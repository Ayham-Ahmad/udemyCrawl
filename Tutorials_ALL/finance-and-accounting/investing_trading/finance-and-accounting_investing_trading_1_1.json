      "description": "In this course, you will learn about real estate investing in an institutional context, which means from the perspective of a private equity fund, pension fund or a developer.\nReal estate investing is both an art and a science. To understand real estate and be a great real estate investor, you need to learn multiple disciplines, such as finance, economics, and politics.\nThis course covers the multi-disciplinary and financial aspects of real estate investing (debt financing, deal structuring, financial modelling, transaction execution, portfolio concepts) and also regeneration and placemaking.\nBecause at the end of the day, real estate is all about creating beautiful places that people like to live and work in. Buildings can transform lives and bring communities together.\nSo being an excellent real estate investor is not just about crunching the numbers but about appreciating aesthetics, history, and heritage. It’s also about understanding communities, what people want and need.\nAndy Warhol said: “Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and working is art, and good business is the best art”.\nThis course gives you a good overview of all these aspects.\n\n\nYou will discover:\nReal estate as an asset in a context of an investment portfolio\nTypes of real estate acquisitions\nPortfolio strategies\nCareer options in institutional real estate investing\nIntroduction to valuation approaches\nWaterfall distribution\nKey concepts and metrics\nRegeneration and placemaking principles\nYou will know what a career as a real estate fund manager at an asset manager like Blackrock or a private equity firm involves, and you will have a comprehensive overview of institutional real estate investing.\nYou’ll also feel inspired and excited about working in real estate or learning more about the sector in more detail.\n\n\nThis course does not cover:\nFlipping and renting houses or where to buy houses\nPersonal investing\nSpecific markets and where to invest\nActual deals/transactions. All deals I worked on are highly confidential, so there is no covering of any real deals. This course is theoretical only.\nFinancial modelling\nThis course covers breadth rather than depth. Each session within the course could easily be expanded into a separate stand- alone course, as real estate investing is a complex and technical area. As an introductory course, this course is intentionally short (2 hours) since we are all short on time these days.\n\n\nIn detail, the course consists of 20 topics, covering:\nWhat is Real Estate?\nWhat is Institutional Investing?\nReal Estate as an asset class\nReal Estate characteristics\n4 types of real estate investment\nTypes of real estate acquisitions\nPortfolio strategies\nDifferent types of funds and characteristics\nKey stakeholders in real estate\nCareer options in real estate\nDifferent real estate sectors\nReal Estate development deal structure\nReal estate development process\nReal Estate transaction lifecycle\nDevelopment financing\nReal Estate valuation approaches\nKey terms and metrics in real estate\nWaterfall distribution cashflow (promote)\nRegeneration and placemaking principles\nWalkthrough of an example of a financial model",

Among the praises I receive, the ones that stand out are 'outstanding' and 'better than a $10,000 course.' Students like Jeff and Tyson appreciate the course for its simplicity and effectiveness, highlighting its avoidance of overwhelming information often found elsewhere.\n\n\nIn the professional trading world, there are two categories: the 'Smart Money,' which includes professional traders, hedge funds, banks, and large financial institutions, and the 'Dumb Money,' comprising retail traders and indicator enthusiasts. The wise choice is to align your strategy with the former, and that's exactly what I'm here to teach you.\n\n\nMarket manipulation by the Smart Money might raise eyebrows, but understanding their entry and exit points allows you to align your trades with them. This strategy enables you to profit just like they do, rather than competing against them as an average retail trader does.\nIn this course, I'll share insights on:\n\n\nReading charts using only price action, a method professionals use without any distracting indicators.\nMy personal live trading account and results – a level of transparency you won't find everywhere.\n\n\nYou'll also learn to identify the beginnings and ends of trends and pinpoint areas on the chart where professionals are entering and exiting the market. With my guidance, you'll grasp market cycles, understanding when a market is trending or not, just by using price action.\n\n\nTo make the learning journey even more exciting, I've included some cool bonuses:\n\n\nMy secret weapon for entering and exiting the market.\nConstant updates with Live Trade examples.\nMy best-selling ebook on Amazon.\n\n\nMy goal with this course is to guide you towards becoming a successful trader. If you diligently apply the teachings from this course, I'm confident you'll be trading price action like a pro in no time.\n\n\nSee you on the inside!\n\n\n-Will",

      "description": "Welcome to the course \"AI Trading: Bitcoin, Stocks & Investing with ChatGPT and AI\".\n\n\nHave you ever dreamed of using the most advanced technologies to improve and take your trading or investing strategies to the next level?\n\n\nDo you want to learn how breakthrough AI tools like ChatGPT, Bing, Google Bard and Claude 2 can make your financial goals not only attainable, but tangible?\nOr do you want to program your own trading bot with AI and link it to your broker for completely automatic trading?\n\n\nThen this course is for you!\n\n\nThis course will give you a deep dive into the fascinating world of AI-powered trading and investment tools.

In this course, we'll also highlight the areas where AI is still reaching its limits and discuss why it's important not to rely solely on these technologies.\n\n\nAlthough AI and machine learning offer an impressive ability to analyze large amounts of data and predict market trends, there are also areas where they struggle. For example, they cannot always accurately predict unpredictable market events, which are often driven by human emotions and psychological factors. Similarly, they can sometimes be confused by \"noise\" or irrelevant data, resulting in less accurate predictions.\n\n\nFurthermore, over-reliance on AI and machine learning can lead to a lack of critical thinking and human judgment. It is important to remember that these tools are designed to support and complement human decision-making, not replace it.\n\n\nLast but not least, it is critical to understand the risks and ethical concerns associated with the use of AI and machine learning. These include ensuring data security and privacy, avoiding bias and discrimination in AI models, and considering the socioeconomic impact of automated trading and investing.\n\n\nIn this course, we will not shy away from discussing these challenges and limitations of AI and machine learning in the context of trading and investing. My goal is to give you a complete and balanced picture of how to effectively and responsibly use AI in your trading and investing strategies.\n\n\nThis course is a comprehensive guide that will take you on your journey through the exciting world of AI-based trading and help you achieve your financial goals.

We will look at how AI is already revolutionizing commerce and investing and what impact this could have on the future of the financial industry.\n\n\nIn summary, this course offers you the opportunity to harness the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence to improve your trading and investment decisions.

You are limited only by your imagination! The course is built around learning Visual Basic for applications (VBA) and we'll be examining a simplified version of the system I built for trading called Ranger1.0. We'll use this system as an example to show you how to build your own automation. Every student will be able to download a copy of Ranger1.0 for their own use. By the end of the course you will understand the code that runs Ranger1.0 and be able to customize it to fit your ideas. You will also be able to use what you've learned to build your own automated system from the ground up, if that's what you choose to do.\nThe focus of this course is on trading stocks. It is possible to trade futures, currencies, options, and bonds through Ranger1.0, but examples on how to trade these are not covered in detail. However, by the end of this course you will have enough knowledge in Visual Basic to be able to create your own custom automation to trade whatever you want however you want!\nThe sky is the limit! With excel you really can build just about anything you can imagine. This course will get you started using Visual Basic, even if you've never written any code before. You will learn how to automate the order life cycle, how to build timers, play sounds, record live data, do backtesting, and even how to build a decision making AI!\nFinally, I will guide you through everything you need to know to set up an account with Interactive Brokers, how to set up the Excel API, and how to trade using a simulated \"Paper\" trading account. An Interactive Brokers account is required to receive live streaming data and to send orders, but even if you do not have an account, I will show you how to get historical data for excel that you can do backtesting on right away!",

I went the extra mile for this course and I recorded entire trading weeks with the system (don't worry I edited the videos, so they will be 20-30 minutes each!).\nThe most important thing is that, by the end of this course, you will be ready to apply the system successfully.\nWhat else in this course?\nYou will learn from my 11+ years of experience.\nYou have unlimited lifetime access at no extra costs.\nYou can always ask for help, my support is well known in Udemy.\n\n\nI really put 100% of myself in this course. I developed the risk model studying for 9 months with a math professor until I was completely satisfied by the results. I paid for expert programmers and mathematicians to prepare top quality material that you can download for free in the course. I tested the system with past charts and also took some time to test it with a real money live trading account that I have created only to verify the results for the current market conditions.\nI hope you will like the course and see you at the top :)",

      "description": "Smart Money – Huge money. Anytime they join in the market , big boys always create the “Footprint” to follow.\n\nFirstly, we need to understand some phase they will do in the market. Please refer my summary for smart money phases as below - you will learn more detail on this course also.\n\nPhase 0. Test liquidity\nThey normally join to catch the bottom or Top when momentum of market already weak after a long trend.\nFor example : In up trend, smart money will buy a little to test whether momentum is really weak to buy.\nAt this phase we cannot confirm 100% and just wait for next action.\n\nPhase 1. Absorbing\nSmart money jump into market strongly after testing successfully. Buyers normally absorb all the sellers in a very short time.  IMBALANCE will be created. That is first confirmation that Smart Money came and we need to think about trading plan soon.\n\nPhase 2. Lack of liquidity\nIncreasing too fast will cause “Lack of liquidity” – Smart money will push market go down with signals that traders call “Over bought”. They manipulate market to go lower strongly to attract more sellers who are the liquidity for them to buy at a cheap price.\n\nThese things maybe complicated because I only have a limited space to share here. But, they will be shared detail with picture on this course.\n\nPhase 3. Come to POI zone\n\nThey (Big boys) almost have enough liquidity from sellers to fill their “empty wallet”. And, Price also came into DISCOUNT ZONE – Strongest BUYING zone that we call as name POI. Here is place we're waitting to Buy and follow 2nd move of smart money.\n\nPhase 4. Go together : Retails and Big boys\n\nBoth Smart money and Retail traders will come and push market go UP strongly than the first time after all the signals defined obviously. Because :\n- POI is target that Big boys are focusing a lot. If POI is broken, trend will be changed and they will lost all money for this game.\n- Retail traders recognized that they were manipulated before. Now, they saw smart money concepts condtion are more clearly.\n\nSo, all of them will join together to push market go  up.\n\n\nBtw, You also understand about market structure after this course to know when a trend start, end, continue running. It helps you to have a better win rate, reward per risk ratio to trade even with Inner Circle Trading or ICT method.\n\nDuring learning and practicing, you can leave any your question on QA part of Udemy. Jayce will reply and help you within 12 hours\n\nIt works not only Forex, Crypto market, It also works well on Stock market. So, If we have knowledge with Smart Money Concepts, It will be the big advantaged to start Trading and Investing career.\n\nI will explain detail from smallest definitions about Smart Money Concepts to help you understand about this strategy before coming to Double Order Block strategy.\n\nSince then, you can use the first Order-Block like the cornerstone to define and explain the next power on second Order-Block and follow smart money with the perfectly support from market structure, market cycle and continuously multiple timeframe theory.\n\nWe'll take you step-by-step through engaging video examples and teach you everything you need to know to succeed as a profitable trader.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be fluently smart money concepts and you'll be so good at trading that you can get a freedom job or trading professionally.\n\nBtw, I also created a Discord channel for students to discuss together. In this channel, we will share the knowledge, tips to learn and analyzation every week on any assets.\n\nI also created a Competition that will help learn facing with yourself to improve your psychology, risk management on high pressure environment like real trading. The pressure comes from your competitors' results, big money capital\nAll of above activities would help you to come profitable and consistency traders in near future.\n\nYou can join discord channel to refer about it anytime.\n\nThis strategy will help you :\nImproving Reward per Risk ratio.\nImproving Win rate.\nLow drawdown in trading to take trading funds challenge.\nStrongly believe to set limit order and take a rest.\nAvoid emotion in trading.\nReading the market picture confidently to entry/exit/manage trade better.\nAble to earn real money from market. (Refer the achivement of graduation student on Discord channel)\n\nAll your questions were leaved in Q&A part will be answer detail within 4 - 12 hours (Depend on time zone) until you understood completely.\n\nWhat you can do after this course :\nUnderstand to analyze & define market structure exactly.\nUnderstand total SMC's map\nUnderstand all the basic definitions about Smart money concepts\nAnalyze the market and entry with smart money exactly with FOLLOW or BREAK the trend.\nGet the optimize Reward per risk ration to start trading funds or your own account.\nUnderstand how to skip & trading with particular market conditions.\nUnderstand how to define Momentum of price to skip or follow trade.\nUnderstand how to define Discount zone and Over zone to trading.\nUnderstand normal mistake to avoid in trading.\nUnderstand successful trading system to optimize your current strategy.\n\nAfter the course, you also can join NCI learning school was designed from level 0 - 5 to enhance your trading ability:\n\n\n- Level 0 : Multiple timeframe theory, connect from zone to zone.\n- Level 1 : Complete Key level strategy, drawing key level exactly.\n- Level 2 : Complete Smart Money Concepts, understanding the real market picture with manipulation\n- Level 3 : How to combine Key level and smart money concepts with market cycle theory and Volume.\n- Level 4 : Using Key level and smart money for day trading, build the road to be success trader, update market structure.\n- Level 5 : For investing trader, Using Ichimoku to multiple assets and using Golden trend indicator to manage 100 assets.\n\nDon't just take my word for it, check out what existing students have to say about my courses:\n\" Amazing course ! Depth explanation. These knowledge helped me a lot - I passed challenge and verification last week. If possible, I hope to see you sharing combine SMC and Key level together \"\n\n\" All of Jaycee's course are very very good. There isn't a lot of other teachers who understand volume, price action, and smart money like him. He is a brilliant trader and I strongly recommend his courses. I would also like to address some of the negative comments I have seen about Jayce’s English. In my opinion his English is fine. But if you have issues understanding anything the closed captions are 100% accurate. I have taken over 40 Udemy courses about trading and almost all have been by non English native speakers. You will miss out on a lot of good information if you don’t try and understand. \"\n\n\" Amazing theory. Your courses were built like a learning school. Very detail and easy to absorb. Do you have any Discord / FB group or anything like that to learn more from you? Thanks \"\n\n\" What a nice course about SMC ! I enrolled both your 2 courses - That is very detail about SMC and Key level Strategy. Full of documents and Exam to absorb the lessons. Love it! \"\n\n\" Nice course with full downloadable contents and Quiz, Practice test with key questions. Useful and easier to absorb new thing. At the first time, I saw this course quite short but, every thing inside of course over my expectation \"\n\nIf you're SERIOUS TRADER who are ready to be DIFFIRENT this year. Let's come with us.\n\nWe will FIGHT TOGETHER for a SUCCESS YEAR",

      "description": "The trading course that will help you master Tape Reading!\nEver wanted to know what the \"secret sauce\" hedge fund traders use? Ever wanted to know what these crazy rich day traders are doing to make money every day? Well, here is the answer:\nThey simply understand how to read the tape. There is no secret sauce, but rather a technique that has been around since the market was founded. It is not a \"secret sauce\" or master powerful trading system, but just the basic understanding of how to read the time and sales.\nSo, what is tape reading and how is it going to make me money?\nTape reading is the art of studying pure and magnified price action real time based on the Level II box. Using the tape you are able to gauge players psychology and imbalances in supply and demand. Reading the tape is a leading indicator, not like charts and indicators where they are based on past data. Tape reading is an important skill to master as an intraday trader because it allows you to see real time where there is buying and selling going on at level. This is also a very important skill because it will improve you efficiency, risk/reward ratio, and it will allow you to catch larger moves all while allowing you to take on the least amount of risk possible.\nTape reading is your edge and will put ahead of many other traders that think technical analysis is the only thing they should know. The advantages of reading the tape are that it brings consistency to your trading, it is a leading indicator, you are able to see buyers/sellers in real time, it minimizes your trading risk and it gets you in more plays that the charts don’t show you. Finally, reading the tape is about analysis the bid, offer, size, volume, and prints. With reading the tape you will be able to determine where the stock is going to move 90% of the time.\nWant to see an example of what I mean by Reading the Tape? Want to see what you will learn how to do on your own? The video below is a little snippet of me explain what is happening on the tape and how I made $2,800 doing so.\nSure, it might seem a bit confusing seeing all those numbers and colors running through your screen but it is not impossible. It is really the most basic, yet important, aspect of trading-after risk management.\nTape reading will help you see what buyers and sellers are doing in real time. It helps you understand what is happening in a chart pattern. It helps you see the chart pattern form in real time. All of this will help you get an understand of the supply and demand dynamics in the stock.... in which will mean more money in your pocket.\nWhat exactly is the Tape Reading 101 Course?\nThe Tape Reading 101 Course is an online educational course which is based on tape reading. It is taught in three different mediums-audio, video, and reading. First, you will read about a section on the the specific topic, then you will watch the presentation on it and after that take a quiz to test your retention of the material. By reinforcing the material three times per section, we will make sure you retain the material. This is done in four sections so you can grasp what Tape Reading is about. There are over 8 hours worth of video content and countless pages of written material for you to read. Best part of it all? You will gain access to the Tape Reading Archive database for continued practice on tape reading after you finish the course.\nBut seriously, what is the benefit of this?\nTo learn the \"secret skill\" that professional traders use on a day to day basis to make millions. Inside you will learn everything from what tape reading is, the level I & II, big bids, bid offers, how to execute your orders, held bids, held offers, and how to spot buy/sell programs. You will also be able to spot high frequency trading algorithms after the course. This alone will teach you the EDGE market professionals use in the markets day in and day out to steal money from the little guy. Join the pool of the sharks, as a shark.\nLook...\nHow can you expect to succeed as a trader if you are only understanding chart patterns and not the underlying mechanics of them? Don't you want to know what institutions are doing? Don't you want to see where the order flow is going and follow it? It is a huge problem for new traders that do not know what it takes to become a Consistently Profitable Trader. They just think that memorizing a few chart patterns is the way to profitability.. but they are WRONG! Until now, there was no solution to this problem. In this online trading course we show you how to read the tape.\nTape Reading is one of the most important aspects of trading because you are able to see what is not on the charts.\nHere Is Some Advice On What Helped Me Out:\n-Focus on the Level I, Level II, and Prints. -Watch your trading video after the close daily and learn from your mistakes. -Learn How To spot buyers and sellers at levels... follow them.\nWhat are some benefits of this course?\nLearn the basic foundation of reading the tape Learn what the Level I and II are Learn what the prints mean Learn how to spot big bids and big offers Learn how to spot hidden buyers and sellers Learn how to spot buy and sell orders Learn the top intraday trading patterns working now Learn how to spot and follow a buy program for 4 pts on the tape Learn why speed is important to the intraday trader Learn our top trading plays Learn how to spot probabilities and trade with them via risk/reward Learn how to lower your risk Learn how to read the tape via the Level I, II, and prints.

He shows you everything you need to know to become a consistently profitable trader. I was lost when it came to reading the tape when I started out. Things moved too fast for me. I didn’t really know what a big buyer or seller looked like. Jose goes in depth about how to do all this and more in his course and more. With a little time I am now able to id the buyers and sellers and find the great risk/reward trades. Things have slowed way down with the concepts I now use and implement. I would recommend tape reading 101 to my own family if they were looking to learn how to trade. Thanks Jose\n-Blake @tiderinsider2\n\nI think a lot of people don’t want to try and learn that stuff because it seems too difficult. They just want to draw lines. I'm serious man, you have some of the best and most relevant content I’ve found. Underrated stuff.\n- Speero @speerothekid\n\nWhatever you spend on this product, you will save 10 times over in time and money, and that may be an understatement of epic proportions. Sounds like marketing, but I don't bullshit. Ask Jose for my email address, I'll expound further. Jose walks you through the universal tools of trading platforms available to the prospective trader. He then takes you through a step-by-step explanation of what they are and how to use them. Using live recorded examples he clearly explains and demonstrates the core dynamics of tape reading. Jose's tape reading library helps you refine those basics you learn with extensive examples recorded live.\n- Mark - Nemo\nPS: If you order now, I'll throw in $400 worth of free bonuses for you.

I have studied Wave theory and learned from some of the best, such as Sir Jeffrey Kennedy, and I have great respect for him. Now, I can safely say that I have great respect and great respect for Mr. Mudassar. He is a man who has worked hard to create this great course. It doesn't matter if you are familiar with Elliott's theory or not, you must take this course! I highly recommend it!\"\nValuable information, Clear explanations, Engaging delivery, Helpful practice activities, Accurate course description, Knowledgeable instructor.\nMohd Saiful Bahry Mat Jusoh - Oct 2021: \"3-4 (years) ago, I was fed up with Elliott Waves because most of the Elliott Waves I found over the internet was wrong and not so deep. Then I stopped using it until I found this course and this course opened my eyes and changed my perspective about Elliott Wave principle. For those who seriously want to know Elliott Wave principle in right and proper way, this course is for you. But make sure you finish this course and take it seriously because you need to hard work and absorb the knowledge and practice this true Elliott Wave principle. Thank you sir Mudassar.\"\nDylan Langley - Jun 2021: \"Great course. Everything was in great detail and accurate. The great thing about this course that was an added bonus that I like is that it has practical application by using recent charts to apply Elliott Waves on. I've been searching for a great course on Udemy that covers Elliott Waves and found this one that beats all the others. This is a very interactive course with charts for the students to label after each section. Also the instructor is very responsive to questions and leave feedback on assignments.\"\nLovish Singla - Oct 2021: \"I think this is the best course I've ever done, you will get shocked by seeing the beauty of E.W.P. and how things work perfectly according to this theory. Honestly, I learned a lot from this course. from now on, he is my guru and mentor. Don't think twice guys!! This is what you are looking for. He has put a lot of efforts in this course. He literally deserves more value for this course. Thank you so much sir for making this course!!!\"\nClement Li - Oct 2021: \"I started learning Elliott Waves 12 years ago by reading books, but with little progress. Only now with this course I made significant improvements in making sensible wave counting. Teacher, thank you!\"\nAhmed Kilany - Sep 2021: \"This instructor was AMAZING. Super easy to follow and understand, thank you.\"\nJulius Lo - Sep 2021: \"Great course. Very sincere teacher. Using simple language and examples to explain complicated topics. Thank you Teacher Mudassar!\"\nSam Cajilog - May 2021: \"This is the best course. I have finally understood how Elliott Waves work. Awesome course. Sir, I appreciate how generous and well you teach EW. I recommend this trading course 100%.\"\nMzamo Mbona - Jul 2021: \"The instructor has deep understanding of the Wave Principle, and he has presented it very well. I think I am now aware of how I can use it in my trading. Thank you. It was worth every minute of it.\"\n\n\nAN EYE OPENER - THE COVID-19:\nIt was afternoon of October 16, 2019. I was sitting in my home-office, having my coffee and analyzing the price charts as my routine work when suddenly, I saw something very shocking approaching this world. I came up with three highly probable scenarios for the near future of major US markets like NASDAQ-100 (the index of top 100 technology companies of the USA) and all three scenarios were screaming a CRASH! I somehow got sad after seeing the possible and highly probable future in advance. I posted my analysis publicly and shut down my PC for rest of the day.\n\n\nI closed my office and went downstairs to watch TV with my kids. Later that day, at dinner table, I told my family about the upcoming crash in US markets which, in turn, will crash other global markets. My wife asked me about the implications of such crash. I said that maybe we would witness the world war-III or something very destructive and similar to WW3 because that’s what big market crashes bring with them.\nDays passed by and the market follows the lines I had drawn on the chart of NASDAQ. Only about 3 months later, we saw news about some new disease originated in China called the Corona virus disease. There was a panic around the world. Thousands of people were dying of Corona every day worldwide. Every business was shutting down and of course, the markets had crashed exactly in the same manner as I had already predicted some 3 months earlier.\n\n\nThe basis for my analysis? Solely the Elliott Wave Principle (EWP)!\nEWP really have true value of providing a Context to price action and a prediction ability up to great extent!\nPlease pay attention!\nDo you feel the Confidence that I had in my analysis about an upcoming Crash?\nWhy would a stock market crash bring world-war or a global pandemic, isn’t it the other way around (i.e. world-war or global pandemic would bring a market crash)? Well, this is the topic for another day!\nThis is where I honestly tell you that not all 100% of my analysis realize like this but 80 to 90% really do and the precision and accuracy is Amazing! For example, just to mention a few, I picked the exact bottom in GOLD at around $1046 per ounce in Nov-2015, picked the bottom in BITCOIN at around $4000 per coin in Mar-2020, picked the bottom in Crude Oil at around $6 per barrel in Apr-2020 etc.\n\n\n\n\nHi, I am Engineer Mudassar (MSc.) and I’m honored to serve as your Elliott Wave mentor!\nWelcome to “Elliott Wave Principle - Trade and Invest with Confidence!” and I'm glad you are interested in my course.\nAs a fact, most of the traders using the Elliott Waves out there are doing it in a complete wrong way and this makes me sad but it also gave me the passion to teach the legitimate, authentic and proper Elliott Wave trading strategy to the world.\nI, myself learned the EWP properly when I wrote my research thesis on the subject of “The Elliott Wave Principle and Investment Decisions” for my MSc. degree back in 2013-2015 in BAU-Istanbul. Since then, I have mastered the EWP as my only analysis/trading methodology. I have learned from the best mentors in the world like Sir Robert Prechter Jr., Sir Jeffrey Kennedy, Sir Wayne Gorman, (Late) Sir Dick Diamond and more, by watching 10,000+ hours of lectures and by reading dozens of books written by them.\nBecause I had quickly realized in the beginning of my trading career that the right and fastest way to learn to trade successfully is to find truly authentic, qualified, expert and experienced mentor. Doing so, was the best decision of my professional life!\n\n\nWHY YOU ARE HERE:\nIf you are not a trader or investor already, let me tell you a few reasons why trading/investing in financial markets can be the BEST business;\nAnyone with any background can LEARN & DO it.\nYou can start trading with as low as $100 investment.\nNo need to rent an office or shop. Can be done from anywhere, anytime.\nNo inventory required because there are no products.\nNo paper work. Instant returns because you convert Trades into Cash.\nMinimal time required and it’s YOU who set the hours.\nNo need to search for customers because it’s heavily Liquid market.\nNo employees required (until a point when you want to grow it to Fund Management Company).\nAnd if you are already a trader then you must have been searching for the best Trading Course or Trading Strategy.\nWell, during the creation of this course, I browsed this same topic as well but sadly, most of what I found is a jargon because I personally think that learning candlestick patterns by paying hundreds of dollars is a waste!\nListen, to be successful in the field of trading, you must learn some solid and genuine method and during my research, I went through many PhD research papers written on EWP because this is not only a trading strategy but a genuine analytical model with a lot of academic value. After testing it for years, I have found out that this methodology is the ONLY legit one and it’s the mother of technical analysis!\nIt’s the best decision you can make for your trading and investing future right now!\n\n\nWITH LEARNING TO TRADE, YOU KNOW WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS?\nLack of education or improper education of instructors!\nTrading and investing is a highly rewarding business. That’s why the number of online traders is growing exponentially. But unfortunately, 95% of these new traders fail in practical trading because either they did not get Proper Education or maybe they wanted to see millions in their bank by the end of first trading year which didn’t happen. So eventually they quit trading and most of them start teaching other novice traders how to trade. You can imagine the consequences!\nThere are thousands of trading courses available but very few have real value to add into your trading career life! New traders trade using others’ ideas and lose money then blame the idea. You better learn to analyze charts by yourself!\n“Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime” - Chinese quote\nI want to teach you for the lifetime the true essence of the EWP and how to trade and invest using this EXCELLENT method!\n\n\nWHO IS THE BEST PERSON TO BE TEACHING THIS COURSE?\nWell, you have two options;\nYou can learn from someone who himself never learned it properly but watched a couple of videos and read a book, failed in practical trading so went on to teaching others. OR\nYou can learn from a Credible Expert with a university degree on the subject of \"Elliott Wave Principle\", who really trades with real money successfully and people respectfully asks for his analysis on regular basis because they trust his knowledge and a decade of practical experience that he has! And that's me.\nTrading and EWP is my Passion! I am a full time trader, means I trade for living. I am also a mentor, trusted and followed by thousands of traders and investors around the world. I have already helped 1000+ traders fall in love with the Elliott Waves and I can do the same for you! I know these lessons will add confidence to your trading and investing. And I'm thrilled to provide this priceless material to you at very Low Price! Know that my colleagues and students have always found my teaching style to be friendly, interactive and impressive and my lessons to be very much valuable!\nAltaf Boghani - Aug 2021: \"This is it folks for investors/traders who are beginning their journeys on learning Elliott wave analysis. Rana is a great teacher, a born teacher. Why do I say that, well you will find out when you take his course that he enjoys teaching this course. It is not a nuisance but his breadth of coverage shows that he truly wants you to learn Elliot wave analysis. I loved it.\"\nI'll do my best to make it worth your Time and Money!\n\n\nWHAT IS ELLIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLE (EWP) AND HOW IT SOLVES YOUR PROBLEM?\nThe EWP is the key to market behavior. It is the hidden engine behind price movements. It’s the authentic and confirmed set of Patterns. It categorizes the price action into two types: the Trend called as “Motive waves” and the Counter-Trend called as the “Corrective waves”. EWP can tell you if price trend is in its initial stage, in the middle or in its final stage. It can also tell you whether a Price Reversal is about to happen or the price is setting stage for huge spike, price gaps etc. It can also tell the size and degree of current or upcoming trend!\nThere Is No More Guessing the Direction of Trend -- Problem Solved!\n“I have never seen a market unfold in other than an Elliott Wave pattern.” - Robert Prechter - US Trading Championship Winner (1984)\n\n\nIt’s the only tool that can predict the market Tops and Bottoms with to-the-tick Precision. The EWP is the best Timing tool for traders and investors! To use the EWP, all you need is a price chart, that’s it!\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, this course will help you develop a personal, specialized trading plan and strategy.\nEWP works on All Timeframes and All Markets which I practically show you in the lectures!\n\n\nHOW THIS COURSE IS THE BEST COURSE FOR YOU?\nWell, in this course, I have practically taught beyond the basic knowledge of EWP because I think learning the basics of EWP alone is not enough!\nThis is a full video course broken up into 11 sections with 45 lectures and an article plus 25 assignments for practice and more. Lectures are in simple plain English, very easy to understand, ranging in length from 10-50 minutes depending on the topic.\nStocks, FOREX, Crypto, Bonds, Futures, Options, Stock Markets, Crude Oil, Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, Alt coin -- whatever you trade or want to learn to trade, this course will make you simply the BEST at analyzing to trade it!\nHere are the details of what I teach you in this course with practical examples on price charts:\nSECTION-1:\nYou will learn the general knowledge about financial markets, trading, trading psychology, the right mindset and the broad concept of EWP.\nSECTIONS-2 TO 9:\nYou will learn the core concepts of EWP with real-time examples on price charts of different markets at different time-frames. Usually three examples for each topic. I have tried my best to give at least one example from each asset class!\nSECTION-10:\nYou will learn how to bridge the gap between theory and practical trading on your own. You'll take the analytical knowledge you've gained from sections 1-9 and learn how to apply it for an effective trading strategy. You'll learn the best Elliott wave patterns to target, how to time your Entry/Exit and how to build a trading plan that minimizes risk and maximizes profits. I practically trade in front of your eyes by risking only 2% of my equity to gain about 44% profits and all is done very safely and conservatively over a period of 15 days.\nExtra SECTION:\nIn this final section, first I teach you how to thoroughly and holistically analyze any price chart from scratch in any market, in order to find the best, safest and highly probable trading/investing setups.\nSo in simple words, we analyze and trade together! This is a huge extra if you pay attention because you will have ME sitting virtually next to YOU throughout your education and trading journey where you have the opportunity to get my chart analysis on regular basis, from almost all markets and all time-frames.

Because SO many people have a horrible misconception about day trading. Masses of people think it's gambling. Huge risks, little rewards that only a math genius or a robot can accomplish.\nThe great news is, that's simply not the case. With day trading, it all comes down to risk mitigation, having a simple strategy and world class discipline. Do you consider yourself a determined person? When you begin to learn, do you just throw yourself in 100% and fully immerse yourself in that world? Of course you do! That's why are you here. That is the type of person you are.\nYou are here to learn and that excites me, because I LOVE teaching and I'm REALLY good at it. I would argue, I am the best mentor, coach and teacher on Udemy. I am very confident that at the end of this easy to understand course, you will know exactly\nWhen to get into a day trade\nWhen to get out of a day trade\nHow much to risk on each trade\nHow to remove variables in day trading\nWhat a day trading plan is\nHow to create a day trading plan\nHow to scan for specific day trades (before they even happen)\nHow to analyze gaps\nWhich moving averages are the most powerful\nWhich timeframes are best to use in day trading\nWhen you finish this one of a kind course, you will be super confident about your day trading approach. You will know exactly why you are getting into a trade and your stress level will be totally gone.\nKnowing when to get in, knowing how much to risk, knowing when to get out, knowing which trade to take and how many trades to take...this is the path of becoming a Real Life Professional Day Trader!!\n\n\nYou rock!!\n\n\nI'm excited to see you in course!\n~ Jerremy Alexander Newsome",

      "description": "This course will provide you with the best 5 Forex strategies I have created during the years. As a professional trader, I use automated and manual trading.\nAre you looking to trade with Forex Robots, but you have no programming skills?\nYou will receive the 5 EAs(Forex Robots) for the Forex strategies FOR FREE!\nNo IT skills are required, you will receive the EAs ready to use, and I will show you how properly to place them in the Meta Trader platform.\nThe Forex Strategies course was re-recorded and I used all of the reviews left by students which were so useful to improve the course!\nI took all the feedback from the thousands of students to improve the course and your learning experience.\n\n\nThe best thing - you will receive lifetime access to this course! I review the Forex Robots for these 5 strategies every month, and you will have access to the current parameters for the Forex strategies according to the latest market conditions.\nYou will learn how to execute the Forex strategies manually. To understand how a Forex Robot works, the trader needs to know what are the entry and exit conditions of the strategy.\nMy secret - I use 5 Forex strategies on 5 different currencies in 3 different time frames. This way, I increase the potential of trading, and I catch the volatility on all the European, American, and Asian markets. Nobody knows where the volatility will come and at what time, but when you have 5 Forex Robots on your side trading 24 hours per day, you will not miss it!\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this Top 5 Forex strategy course:\nhow to set up the screen for each strategy, and what indicators I use\nwhat currency pairs and time frame do I use for each strategy\nwhat specific parameters do I use for the indicators in each strategy\nwhere are the entry points, and how I follow the longer time frames to confirm the trend direction\nthe process of placing the Forex Robots on Meta Trader and trade automatically\nhow to fit the strategies to your trading broker quotes\ntrade with confidence proven Forex strategies\n\n\nRegardless of your level of trading experience or how long you have been practicing trading, this course will provide you with ready and tested strategies to bring your trading to the next level!\nUnlike other Forex courses, where you will learn only \"dry\" theory, this Top 5 Forex strategies course teaches you how to trade with predefined rules for entry and exit on each strategy.\n\n\nWho is the instructor?\nMy name is Petko Aleksandrov, and I am a professional trader with more than 10 years of experience in the financial markets. My purpose is to bring you an amazing course and make you a professional trader by sharing my Top 5 Forex strategies.\nEveryone knows that one strategy will have a losing moment, but when I trade with 5 strategies simultaneously, the other will compensate for the loss.\nAlso, I catch the 2 primary market conditions - the sideways market and the trending. In this course, 3 out of the 5 Forex strategies are designed as trend followers, where I use higher time frame filters to confirm the entry.\nThe other 2 are the Forex strategies working on the sideways market, which is the hardest thing in manual trading. The simple logic behind it is to buy when the price is low and sell when the price is high.\nThis course results from testing 1000s of Forex strategies. I have selected the most stable ones for each broker, easy-to-follow manual, and most profitable.\nAlso, you will see how to optimize the Forex Robots for your trading broker using the professional Softwares EA Studio and FSB Pro (if you decide to practice with those, you may sign up and use a free trial).\nThe only thing you have to do -  choose whether you will trade manually or automatically.\nIf you already have some of my other courses, you know that you will receive full support personally from me.\n\n\nAlso, there is a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you think that these strategies do not match your trading style, you can always use the option.\nI can't wait to see you on the course!\nEnroll now, and I will do my best to make you a better trader.\n\nSee what students leave as reviews to the course:\n\nPaul Classens\nI must say out of pretty much all the courses I have bought over the years some being good and most being bad this 1 is definitely on the top! Petko Aleksandrov is the 1st instructor I have come accross that actually explains the fact that indicators are designed with flawed logic on purpose and since he knows the math behind them his strategies are 100% trustworthy. The results he publishes speak for that, I will definitely be taking more if not all of his courses over time and cannot wait to learn how to properly start creating my own trading robots. The world needs more teachers like Petko Aleksandrov in my opinion. Keep up the amazing work!\n\n\nHomayoun TAHBAZFAR\nA very useful course to get familiar with strategies and robots and how they work. No pure theories but valuable practical points essential to know for new traders. Thanks to Petko.\n\n\n\n\nIvaylo Belev\nMagnificent! This course was exactly what I was looking for! I've been manually trading cryptos for three years and I wanted to diversify with automatic forex trading but I was lacking good strategies. Now thanks to this course I not only have them but I also have the expert advisors which I already deployed successfully.\n\n\nBismark Odoi-Danquah\nReally Awesome course. I started trading on the demo with $100 for testing and made $33 in 3 days. I think my approach is quite aggressive but the EAs work perfectly. I had only one losing trade during the 3 days. I could have made $40 easily.\n\n\n\nConnor BorringtonUpdated\nThese strategies work great! Sure you will get drawdown but give it time and they do excellent :) . Would highly recommend this course for anyone who wants a diverse portfolio of strategies that complement each other perfectly; when one is doing bad the rest make up for it!\n\n\n\nIvars Grisans\nInstructor is very engaging, explains matter in simple terms. Let's hope that EAs provided in course really work :) but that can be proofed only by time.\n\n\n\n\nYehan Chathuranga Pemarathne\nThe software introduced in this course is a really good addition to my knowledge. Also, the mq4 code of the robots is really valuable for me to learn new tricks and patterns of coding EAs. I am glad that I enrolled in this course.\n\n\n\n\nBevan Smith\nGreat introduction to forex trading and the 5 EA's are the perfect way to test the waters.\n\n\nVictor Sandoval Mattar\nGreat course! Highly profitable robots and awesome instructor! Thanks a lot\n\n\n\nBenson Eghreriniovo\nThe course is amazing. Very clear and easy to understand and follow.

      "description": "STRADDLE & STRANGLE OPTION STRATEGIES\nStraddles and Strangles are also Volatility strategies and are very popular strategies. Both these strategies are non-directional, so its possible to profit from a movement in either direction. But the move must come fairly quickly, because we have two Long Options (one on the Call side and one on the Put side), and so our time decay exposure is doubled. Additionally, Vega exposure can be quite large, so this is something to watch for. In general, its best to put on Straddles and Strangles in times of low volatility as measured by the individual Implied Volatility of the stock itself as well as observing the level of the VIX Index. We also look at the \"Valley of Death\" where the trade can fall into trouble.\nStraddles and Strangles fall into two categories of Strategies - 1) Non-directional strategies and 2) Volatility strategies.\nIn non-directional strategies, you don’t care if the Stock goes up or down. Your strategy profits from a move in either direction. The strategy starts out Delta Neutral – or at least you should try to construct it that way. But this does not mean your position will remain Delta neutral forever. In fact, your position will achieve a +ve Delta or a -ve Delta bias, depending on the stock’s movement. But these strategies have one clear advantage over others. You don’t have to be right in forecasting the direction of stock movement, and that fact alone put Straddle & Strangle strategies in our Favorites.\n\n\nWhat you will master\n\n\nWhy are Straddles and Strangles very popular\n\nThe pluses and minuses of these strategies\n\nWhy these strategies can be deceiving for newcomers to these  strategies\n\nWhat is a good environment for these trades\n\nWhat is the difference between a Straddle and Strangle\n\nIs one better than the other in certain situations\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of these trades\n\nWhy is Vega exposure critical\n\nWhat  is the \"Valley of death\" and how can we avoid it\n\nDetailed  analysis of the Straddle setup using Priceline and SPY ETF\nActual  trade execution of the SPY Straddle\n\nTrade  Management of the SPY Straddle\n\nAdjustments  to the SPY Straddle\n\nLearnings  from the Straddle trade\n\nTackling the negatives of the  Straddle",

Is the Stochastic in overbought? Is it the right time to entry? Should my stop loss be higher? My aim for this course is to provide you with a complete system that will leave no doubt about your market action, so you can start being profitable from the very beginning.\nThe system has been tested since 2013 and gained over 185,000 pips in the last 12 years.\nYou don't need any prior knowledge because we will start from essential concepts like Candlestick chart, Brokers and algorithms.\nYou will learn the main Trading System, called ALM-TCS. You will also learn how to adapt the system according to your needs and to your risk tolerance.\nI will present detailed results for each variation of the system, clearly highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, you will learn the critical role of effective Money Management, with an entire section dedicated to key strategies such as the 1% of MAX rule and the Kelly Criterion.\nA common issue with trading algorithms and systems is their neglect of real-world elements like spreads, gaps, and major news events. In this course, we fully integrate these crucial factors into our strategy, ensuring nothing is left to chance and providing you with a comprehensive, reliable trading system.\n\nIn Section 9, you will find all the live trades with real money that I have recorded for the course (and that I will still record, it is a section that will be updated frequently with new live examples).\nSection 10 is a fundamental step of our journey. You will first learn how to recognize the kind of trader that you are and then we will build a Trading Portfolio according to that.\nIn the last section, I will share my last tips and recommendations, so you can be 100% ready to use the system!\nI like to challenge my students in every new course that I create. This time I want to think big: the challenge is to be profitable right from the first month! What if you are an absolute newbie and it is the first time that you approach the Forex market? This challenge is especially for you! I'm sure that the system that you will study in the course will give you a clear approach to the Forex market that allows you to be profitable right from the start.\nWhat else in this course?\n\n\nYou will learn from my 18+ years of experience.\nYou can always ask for help, my support is well known in Udemy.\nI like to say to my students that signing up for this course is like signing up for a gym membership. You have all the equipment, all the machines and a personal trainer ready to help you, but if you stay home, eating chips and watching television, you are not going to see any result, right? So, take your first step. Enroll in the course and let's start this journey together.\nSee you at the top :)",

Having a finely tuned probabilistic mindset coupled with good analysis is an absolute must in financial markets. This course shows a few different ways of looking at Probability and how investors can create strategies to put Probability on their side.\nSECTION II - DEEP DIVE INTO THE OPTION GREEKS\nThis course also takes a deep dive into the four Greeks - Delta, Gamma, Theta and Vega. We introduced these concepts in the previous module, but it is time to take their understanding to a new level. The Greeks are the path to putting your strategies on \"Auto-pilot\". We explain the subtleties of all the Greeks - very cool stuff, put your Math hat on...\nWhat you will master\nWhat is the importance of statistical price modeling in the stock markets\nWhy is Standard Deviation an important metric\nWhat are the pluses and minuses of statistical modeling\nHow can we choose strategies using Probability as a signpost\nTake your understanding of all the four Greeks to a new level\nMaster the subtleties of each of the Greeks\nLook at option modeling from a mathematical standpoint\nSECTION III - OPTIONS ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION\nA good trade entry based upon Volume / Chart / Technical analysis sets you up for success from the get-go. But before you put a trade on, you need to perform Options analysis and simulation to understand how your position will behave under a diverse set of market conditions. Once you perform this Options analysis, you can immediately spot your weak points and you're prepared for them. Analysis and Simulation are as important as finding a good trade entry. In this course, we provide a complete roadmap to simulate every possible market condition BEFORE you put the trade on. This kind of analysis may take 30 minutes, but its well worth the time spent.\nWhat you will master\nHow will your position behave for a + / - 5% move in your stock\nOptions analysis before you put your trade on\nOptions simulation to know where your profit zone is\nWhat is the impact of Time decay on your position\nWhat will Implied Volatility changes do to your position\nSimulating the effects of two variables on your position\nSimulating all three variables\nStress testing your trade",

      "description": "Forex trading course that will give you all you need to start algorithmic trading from Scratch! You will learn our best methods to create a profitable portfolio of Forex strategies, and you will start practicing with not one Forex Robot but with 12 different EAs monthly.\nAre you looking to automate your trading using Forex Robots and spend less time in front of the screen?\nТhis is precisely what you will learn in this Forex trading course. Regardless of your level of trading or how much time you have spent trading, you will receive everything you need to start professional algorithmic trading.\nThis online Forex trading course will allow you to learn whenever you have free time and wherever you are. All you need to start practicing algorithmic trading is a laptop/computer with an internet connection.\n\n\nWho is the instructor?\nMy name is Petko Aleksandrov, and I have been trading professionally for the last 10 years. Over 15 000 students joined my online courses this year, which gives me so much energy to keep sharing my experience and trading methods. With my team in EA Forex Academy, we follow the best methods and look for the newest technologies in algorithmic trading to provide high-quality online trading courses.\nIn this Forex trading course, I will teach you to build your portfolio of strategies and turn them into Expert Advisors for algorithmic trading.  This way, you will not depend only on one Forex strategy or Forex Robot, and you will diversify your risk.\n\n\nYou do not have a profitable Forex strategy?\nI will teach you how to generate many strategies over your broker's historical data and export them as Expert Advisors or the so-called Robots for trading.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this Forex trading course?\nwhy using the Historical data from your broker is so important\nhow to collect and update the Historical data from your broker\ngenerate strategies with predefined rules and criteria\nanalyze the results based on the statistics\nuse different methods to select the best strategies to automate\nyou will know how to avoid over-optimization in the Expert Advisors\ndo the whole process automatically and spend less time on each strategy\nwhat is the Forex VPS, and do you really need one for Forex Robot Trading\nmy experience in algo trading in one Forex trading course\nYou will learn how to select the strategies that stand behind the EAs properly. I will show you my three methods:\nValidation criteria\nEquity line\nStatistical information\nAlgorithmic trading is a must nowadays for all traders. And it is much easier than it was before.\n\n\nWhat is the Portfolio of Forex Strategies?\nI trade many strategies in one trading account. I do not rely on a single Forex Strategy. And this is possible to be done only with Expert Advisors. Manual trading with more than 2-3 strategies is nearly impossible. With Expert Advisors, I can simultaneously trade 100s of Forex strategies, and I will show you the complete process that I follow.\nThe Forex trading course is designed for Forex traders who wish to step into algorithmic trading depth and improve their Forex Trading with Forex Robots.\nMany traders get frustrated after they purchase an Expert Advisor or Forex strategy, which does not work as it was shown. Obviously, the reasons are there. These Expert Advisors were not created over your broker's historical data, and you can not expect them to trade as promised.\n\n\nWhy do these EAs fail?\nThe sellers of Expert Advisors show perfect equity lines(sales illusion)\nThese Forex strategies for algorithmic trading were over-optimized\nThe only purpose is to sell the Expert Advisors(no maintenance)\nAlgorithmic trading is a bit more than trading with a single Expert Advisor\nThat is why we created this Forex trading course to create your Forex strategies and automate them without programming skills.  You can test them and see the results at the moment over the proper historical data. You will also save yourself a lot of time by exporting the Forex strategies with one click of the mouse as Expert Advisor is ready for algorithmic trading and not losing time and resources to developers to code Expert Advisors.\nI know that a single Expert Advisor will fail at one point. That is not important to me. I create portfolios of strategies and trade them simultaneously in one trading account. This way, when one strategy starts to lose, the others will compensate for the loss. Also, I replace this one strategy with another one that I created during this time. This is easy because of the power of EA Studio - professional strategy builders - you may sign up for a free trial version and practice.\nEach Expert Advisor that you create is yours, and you can become a seller. Also, you will get the source code of each Forex Robot, and if you are learning Expert programming, this Forex trading course will be beneficial to you.\nAt the end of the week (or another predefined period), I evaluate the performance of each Expert Advisor in the portfolio. I remove those that fail and replace them with new ones we already have created. We don’t rely on a single Expert Advisor or a single market because our algorithmic trading systems do not limit me.\n\n\nThe best thing with this Forex trading course:\nYou receive lifetime access to this Forex strategy algorithmic trading course, which will allow you to trade with new 12 Expert Advisors every month for the currencies EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, EURGBP, EURGBP, and GBPJPY.\n\n\nWith all my other Forex trading courses for Forex traders, you will receive full support personally from me.\nThe Forex Trading course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you are not happy with it, you can always take advantage of this option and use it - no questions asked.\nEnroll now, and I will teach you how to build your first Portfolio of Expert Advisors professionally.\nSee you on the course!\n\n\nSee what some of the students think about the course:\n\nNeels van Niekerk - Awesome course. Exactly what I wanted. As a beginner trader, I realize the value that automated trading can bring. So far all is clear for me on how to proceed.\nKumar Pillai- Awesome! Learned a lot. Petko explains really well in a gentle friendly manner. Thanks!\n\nLloyd McFarlane - I am getting a much broader understanding of the depth of algorithmic trading.",

      "description": "\"Mistakes are the best teachers, one does not learn from the success\"\n\n\nI am very excited to see you here!\nMy main motive behind publishing this course is to spread the confidence amongst retail traders who struggle to understand why trading business is so complex yet so simple. Perhaps Forex Markets are regarded as one of the most difficult markets to trade, the tendency of doing mistakes is, therefore, much higher than in other investment instruments. More than a mentor, I'm trying to become a trading companion to everyone who decides to invest in this course. What you will learn here will surprise you and at the same time, give you the assurance that markets are nothing but the aftermath of emotions of market participants. I am also confident that through this course, I'll be able to make your trading journey a huge success as the information you will learn is very dear to me and is a result of my years of hard work.\nYou will be able to forecast future market direction on any currency or forex pair before the move begins using the truest and purest form of technical indicators. My choice of relying on these three leading indicators in my investment strategy has worked wonders in the past and once you reach the analysis section of the course, you'll know why. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced trader, I expect you to put in the effort using the methodologies you will learn in this course to turn your trading game into a long-term investment. Every trading decision you will make using this strategy will be validated by the combination of the following three powerful leading market indicators:\nELLIOTT WAVE ANALYSIS + VOLUMES + PRICE ACTION\n\n\nIn the introductory section(Section 1), I introduce you to my course and why this course is different from any other courses you have studied in the past. I also provide a general introduction to Forex and also to my trading approach. I also share my trading journal of a 10k live account I opened while I started writing this course. In the later parts of this course, I will provide updates on my trading account and you will learn how I have been able to grow my trading account by more than 80% within my first 60 trading days.\n\n\n*Sections 2 and 3 explain why the majority of retail traders lose money while trading and its solution by answering the following key questions.\nHow the trading industry is built for retail traders or small traders to fail?\nHow professional traders control the emotions of retail traders through manipulation and dominance?\nHow the differences in the trading mindset of a professional trader and retail trader decide winners and losers in the trading industry?\nHow to beat the market at its own game by understanding underlying market sentiment?\nHow to succeed as a retail trader in currency markets using the only three leading market indicators?\n*Moving on, we dig deep into first of the three leading technical indicators i.e. ELLIOTT WAVE ANALYSIS(EWA) (Sections 4-8)*\nI explain to you the power of Elliott Wave Analysis(EWA) in revealing the prevailing market sentiment within major price moves.\nI introduce the importance of using different Fibonacci retracements and types and their invaluable aid in our EWA.\nYou will learn how wave personalities of different waves explain the psychology of traders in bear and bull market phases.\nI discuss how EWA forecasts or correctly speculates the future market direction on any pair.\nYou will learn how to perform EWA analysis on any trading instrument using my video analysis on EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDJPY, and USDCAD as we explore the trading opportunities on the above pairs in real-time.\nUnlike any other course, I will offer COMPLETELY FREE LIVE TRADES for you to make a trading income while you are learning.\nAll in all, you will be AMAZED to see the future price forecasting strength of Elliott Wave Analysis when used correctly.\n*Finally, I complete the picture by introducing remaining two leading technical indicators i.e. VOLUMES and PRICE  ACTION in the strategy (Sections 9-10)*\nA general introduction to two purest forms of technical analysis retail traders can have in their trading arsenal i.e. Volumes and Price Action.\nOnce you have mastered the EWA, you will learn how price action and volumes act as the backbone of your EWA as a part of this trading strategy.\nI will teach you a perspective on using volumes and key price action patterns like never before.\nThis concludes part 1 of the course and you will finally learn what to expect in part 2 or the final part of this course.\nBy the time you finish studying the whole strategy over two parts of the course, I'm confident that this is all you need to think and trade like a smart trader for the rest of your trading career.\n\n\nI have decided to offer the complete trading strategy in TWO PARTS to guarantee that you understand the dynamics of the Forex industry, technicalities, and methodologies explained in part 1 of the course before you progress to part 2. Part 1 in itself offers a very strong trading strategy based entirely on ELLIOTT WAVE ANALYSIS, but once combined with VOLUMES & PRICE ACTION, you will be able to filter high-risk Vs low-risk trading opportunities to trade profitably throughout your trading career.\n\n\nWith that being said, I wish you a happy trading journey and see you on the inside!",

We know time decay is exponential, but how do the Greeks actually  behave during this time. This course on Trading Options at Expiration takes a deep dive using Apple (AAPL) Options Weekly series. We follow an AAPL Short Straddle trade from Thursday morning  until deep into the following week. The Short Straddle is explained in detail  in this course. The Greeks  are on steroids during the final week of an Option's life.\nOption Greeks behave  abnormally during the final week, especially the At-The-Money Options. It  should be intuitive that these Options are experiencing an enormous amount of  uncertainty insofar as to whether they will end up in-the-money or not. What  may not be clear is how the Greeks behave during this time which ultimately  impacts Option prices.\nMost importantly, the  lectures focus on the kinds of strategies that are ideal during the final two  weeks before expiry. Although most strategies tend to focus on the most dominant  Options characteristic during this time (Time Decay), the course also shows a  couple of very interesting, very high reward strategies with very little risk.\nWhat can you expect\nWhat are Weekly Options and why are they special\n\nWhat characteristics do Options have when they are very close to expiry\n\nWhat kind of trades are suitable during this time\n\nWhat sort of attention do you need to give to these trades\n\nWhat kinds of traders are Weekly Options suitable for\n\nWhat time decay strategies could work during the final week\n\nThe impact of the final weekend on Option prices\n\nWhat challenges and pitfalls can you expect from Weekly Options\n\nWhat role does the Greek Gamma take on during this time\n\nAnd why does Vega whimper out during this time\n\nAnd what about Delta and Theta - it's a total Greek-fest\n\n\nWEEKLY OPTIONS ARE VERY EXCITING TO TRADE BUT MAKE SURE THEY ARE FOR YOU !!!",

      "description": "Learn the incredibly popular Stage Analysis method to gain an edge in your stock trading and investing. This course makes no assumptions of prior experience of the Stage Analysis method or even any prior stock trading and investing knowledge. We begin with the very basics and foundations of Stan Weinstein's classic method, and introduce key concepts in a logical way, through detailed real life examples of stocks charts in the different stages. Taking you from complete beginner through to some expert level Stage Analysis concepts. And so, by the end of the course you will be completely comfortable trading and investing using the Stage Analysis method and will never look at a stock chart in the same way again!\nStan Weinstein began his classic stock trading and investing book “Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets” by talking about one of the many clichés that we hear in the financial media. Buy Low, and Sell High! We hear this over and over again, by numerous talking heads and journalists, on CNBC, Bloomberg, and in the financial pages of the newspapers, as they try to promote the various stocks or market theories that their firms are touting on that day.\nHowever, instead of being a shortcut to riches like Joe Public is lead to believe. It’s actually one of the many clichés that leads to losses year after year for the average retail investor.\nSo instead of “trying to catch a falling knife”, what the Stage Analysis method teaches instead, is that you should embrace the professionals approach, of buying high, and selling higher.\nThis may not come naturally to you in the beginning, as you’ve been exposed to numerous forms of misinformation over the years, so that the market professionals can take your money, while you continue on in blissful ignorance, while only making mediocre returns.\nWell that changes now! As I’m going to teach you the key aspects of Stan Weinstein’s Stage Analysis method, which uses classic, yet timeless technical analysis techniques, to help you identify the major market trends, and stocks with the most potential for future gains, while managing your risk, so that you can outperform the money managers, and consistently grow your account in both bull and bear markets.\nWant to learn more about the method!

      "description": "My courses are a result of trading the markets over the last 13 years.\n\n\nSeven of those years I've traded professionally for three different prop trading companies in London and Chicago.\n\n\nIn the last three years, I've been creating mechanical trading systems as a managing director of a small fintech startup called Blahtech.\n\n\nI collaborate with a team of three elite engineers who come from bulge bracket investment banking background.\n\n\nThis introduction course represents the first 6 lessons of 40 lectures from our comprehensive Professional Development Program on the main website.\n\n\nYou'll learn to recognise 'footnote' Supply/Demand levels around which you will plan the direction of your trades. I also teach you my own concept of Q Points©.\n\n\nQ Points are the missing link to S/D trading and an invaluable tool for weeding out non-relevant areas.\n\n\nQ Points© are my proprietary trading concept - you won't come across them anywhere else.\n\n\nThis particular course will begin the journey to wean you off bad habits and wild-man scalping. It will steer you away from retail lagging tools to teach you how to view Supply/Demand levels that matter.\n\n\nYou'll learn to apply real-time price action reading to these institutional Supply/Demand levels. I also set you on a path to determine whether your trade will have enough 'space' for a statistically correct risk/reward ratio (the amount you risk vs the expected amount of taking profits).\n\n\nThe reason why S/D levels on large timeframes are so efficient is because there is so much trading information over long periods of time.\n\n\nBut also because institutional traders need deep liquidity pools to execute huge institutional orders that go into thousands of lots (we're talking positions in excess of $300-500 million).\n\n\nIn order to save on execution costs (to ensure the order is filled in as little trades as possible), institutional market makers will move the price up or down by using some of the allocated funds to bring the price to the levels where the huge several thousand lots orders can be filled in a cost-effective way. You will learn how to spot these big players on medium and larger timeframes.\n\n\nThis course creates an introduction for an organised trading mind and a systematic, repeatable approach to finding trade locations at levels where institutions trade.\n\n\nThe methodology of market mechanics through Supply/Demand can be applied to most markets, including soft commodities such as gold and crude oil, forex, equity indices, individual stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nRequirements:\nYou must have some previous trading experience and a very good skill of candlesticks reading.\n\n\nWhile this course may be used by beginners, it is best suited for those who have already traded for a while (ideally 1 year+).\n\n\nIdeal students will be looking to advance their skills to a more serious level by adding an analytical approach to their trading performance.\n\n\nYou will require patience and persistence. In some cases, big changes to your own behavioral psychology will be needed on this journey.\n\n\nTrading is neither simple nor easy. While this high income skill has the potential to bring windfalls to certain individuals who are emotionally resilient and analytical enough to keep going, it remains one of the toughest skill to master.\n\n\nThis is mainly due to the sheer amount of information you must remember and cross-check when the opportunity presents itself.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a get-rich-quick, \"simple\" trading system then my courses are not for you.\n\n\nIf that's what you're after, I would highly advise you to stick away from any kind of trading altogether with that kind of mindset.

      "description": "COURSE BUNDLE - OPTION & CREDIT SPREADS STRATEGIES\nDetails of this bundle are provided here, but you may find more information on the individual course pages.\nSECTION I - PHILOSOPHY AND DEFINITION OF SPREADS\nWe introduce option spread strategies in this module. Options spreads sit right in between the 4 basic Option positions and the more Advanced level Option strategies. The Spread is the bridge between the basic Option strategies and the advanced strategies. In fact, most advanced strategies are composed of the spreads we cover in this course, so this stuff is the key. For the busy professional, Spreads offer the right mix of reward and risk. All 4 vertical spreads introduced in this course are extensions of the 4 basic Options. Spreads add an element of cost control and / or risk control to individual Options positions. Master the four Options Spreads, and you would have acquired a skill that can create consistent monthly income. Additionally, you'll be well on your way to mastering the advanced Options strategies.\nWhat you will master\nAdvantages and disadvantages of single Option strategies - Long and Short\nHow Spreads tackle the negatives of individual Options\nWith Spreads, you can now be a seller of Options\nThe meaning of \"defined risk\" Options investing\nSpreads help you control your costs and risk exposure\nWhat are the differences between credit and debit spreads\nControl risk and costs without compromising on Probability\nSECTION - II REAL LIVE TRADES ON THE 4 OPTION SPREAD STRATEGIES\nTHE BULL CALL SPREAD\nThe Bull Call Spread is an extension of the Long Call Option. When you buy a Call Option, you are bullish. The Bull Call spread maintains the bullish element of the Long Call while controlling your costs and has a limited losses profile. Of course, everything is a compromise. But you would probably be willing to make this compromise. We explain why this spread is called a Bull Call spread, and how to address any confusion from these strange names. The risk-reward profile of a Bull Call spread is very favorable. We define why the Bull Call spread is a Debit spread, and study its Profit and Loss diagrams in detail. We put a real trade on IBM and we navigate the trade for a couple of weeks.\nTHE BEAR CALL SPREAD\nThe Bear Call Spread is a credit spread, and we explain why credit spreads are a viable way to assuming an Option seller's profile. The Bear Call spread limits your risk. We study the role of Probability in selecting credit spreads as well as implied volatility considerations and time decay. Time decay is a key component of credit spreads and the Bear Call spread can be an excellent way to generate monthly income. All spreads can be part of the busy professional's playbook, but credit spreads can be especially attractive. We analyze the right criteria for credit spreads, including the selection of the expiry series as well as the individual Options itself. We put a real trade on Amazon (AMZN) and track, monitor and adjust this trade until its exit.\nTHE BEAR PUT SPREAD\nThe Bear Put spread can be a powerful strategy for bear markets. The Bear Put is an extension of the Long Put Option. The Bear Put has some specific features, which make it a very attractive spread, and we dig deep into these characteristics. We put a real trade on Netflix (NFLX). The risk reward characteristics of Bear Put spreads are very attractive as its losses are limited. The Bear Put, just like the Long Put is a Vega positive trade, so this trade can optimize a bearish move as well as any upside from implied volatility changes. The choice of expiry series, time decay effects and the choices of individual Options are also important.\nTHE BULL PUT SPREAD\nThe Bull Put spread is a flat to bullish that profits primarily from time decay, but can also profit quicker from a move to the upside. Its important to pick the right strike prices for the Bull Put spread, as is a thorough analysis of the stock's chart and support levels. In this course, this is what we do - we pick Google (GOOG) as our candidate for the Bull Put, and analyze past price action, support levels and put on a successful Bull Put spread.\nMONTHLY INCOME STRATEGIES PRIMER\n\nIf you have a regular job, then you need strategies that allow you to focus on your job, but yet create a somewhat stable and reliable income stream from your investments. In this PRIMER, we dig deep into credit spreads and understand why being an Option seller (risk defined of course - no naked selling) may not be that bad after all.\nCREDIT SPREAD STRATEGIES - ADVANCED CREDIT SPREADS\nSECTION III - Selection Criteria for Credit spreads\nConsider this course as \"Advanced Credit Spreads\". Both these spreads are dissected to convey an advanced level of knowledge and skill in using these credit spreads. Everything from the ideal credit spread trade setup, trade management, adjustments and exit. You're expected to know what a Bull Put and Bear call spread is.\nIf you have a regular job, then you need strategies that allow you to focus on your job, but yet create a somewhat stable and reliable income stream from your investments. In this course, we dig deep into credit spreads and understand why being an Option seller (risk defined of course - no naked selling) may not be that bad after all. We analyze Probability, Time decay and Volatility considerations and come up with some pretty good stuff.\nThese spreads form the foundation blocks of \"Monthly Income\" strategies. And not surprisingly, all advanced strategies like Iron Condors or Backspreads use some variation of the Bear Call or the Bull Put spreads. Anyone wanting to create a consistent monthly income of 2% to 5% will use these strategies as part of their \"Income\" portion of their portfolio.\nSECTION IV - Live trade entry, Management and Exits\nWhat you will master\nWith Spreads, you can now be a seller of Options\nThe meaning of \"defined risk\" Options investing\nCutting-edge trade entry analysis\nSelection of the right expiry series\nSelection of the appropriate strike prices\nVolatility considerations\nSetting the optimal \"width\" of the Spread\nSet your monthly target that can still let you sleep at night\nOptimize Time decay, Probability and Premium collection variables\nSet \"pain points\", and plan the exact nature of adjustments\nSetup trades that require little monitoring\nWhy you can be wrong on direction and still make a profit\nIdeal strategies for losing positions\nHow do you handle your position when your short strike prices are in danger",

      "description": "Learn How to Day Trade for Profit — Fast, Smart, and with Confidence\nAre you ready to take control of your trading strategy and start making smart moves at market open? Whether you’re new to day trading or looking to sharpen your skills, this course gives you everything you need to start identifying momentum, managing risk, and profiting from breakout setups — without holding stocks overnight.\n\n\nFeatured on Investopedia as Best for Educational Content in Day Trading\nWith over 170,000 students in 192 countries and recognition from trusted names like Investopedia, this is your go-to resource for real, actionable day trading education.\n\n\nWhat will I learn in this course?\nYou’ll learn how to:\nIdentify high-probability breakout and consolidation patterns\nRecognize fast-moving stocks before the crowd\nRead candlestick charts and interpret volume spikes\nEnter and exit trades at the right time\nAvoid common mistakes that could lead to potential losses\n\n\nREAL QUESTIONS. REAL ANSWERS (built for Google AI Overviews)\nWhat will I learn in this day trading course?\nYou’ll learn how to trade stocks that move fast right after the market opens. This includes identifying strong technical setups, reading candlestick patterns, drawing key support and resistance lines, and using price and volume to confirm momentum. You'll also discover how to protect profits and cut losses quickly — all skills essential for day trading with confidence.\nWhy is price action important for day trading?\nPrice action shows you exactly how buyers and sellers are behaving — in real time. Instead of relying on lagging indicators, you can look at candlestick shapes, wicks, and closing positions to tell whether a move is gaining strength or about to reverse. It's the most direct way to read the market's heartbeat and trade accordingly.\nWhy is volume important in day trading?\nVolume tells you the strength behind a price move. A breakout on high volume usually signals real buying interest. On the other hand, rising prices with weak volume can be a trap. Learning how to interpret volume helps you avoid false breakouts and recognize when a move is likely to continue.\nWhat are consolidation and breakout patterns?\nConsolidation is when a stock trades sideways in a narrow range — it’s a sign that buyers and sellers are balancing out. A breakout happens when one side wins, often leading to a sharp move. Patterns like flags, wedges, and pennants help traders spot breakouts before they happen, especially when volume begins to build.\nWhat chart patterns should I know to become a better trader?\nSome of the most useful patterns include early poppers (pre-market movers), midday spikes (second wave rallies), and drop-and-recover setups. You’ll also want to learn how to spot failed breakouts, which can signal a reversal. Recognizing these patterns in real time can mean the difference between a winning trade and a painful loss.\nHow can I find stocks that are likely to gap and run?\nGap-and-run stocks often appear after major news events, earnings releases, or sudden volume spikes. Start your morning by scanning for premarket movers, checking volume, and looking for strong catalysts. The best opportunities usually show momentum before the market opens — giving you a valuable head start over the crowd.\nHow can I profit from premarket movers and gapping stocks?\nLook for stocks with news, unusual premarket volume, and a clean chart setup. If volume remains strong into the open, these stocks can explode upward quickly. Timing is critical — enter as the move confirms with volume and price holding key levels. Early positioning can lead to outsized returns with reduced risk.\nHow can I manage risk as a day trader?\nAlways define your risk before entering a trade. That means setting a stop-loss just below a key support level or failed breakout point. Use a risk/reward ratio of at least 1:2 — risking $100 to make $200. Avoid revenge trading or chasing losses. Discipline is what separates traders who survive from those who blow up accounts.\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nAspiring day traders who want a proven system to trade fast-moving stocks at the open.\nBeginner and intermediate traders looking to master chart reading, price action, and risk management.\nInvestors tired of holding overnight risk and seeking short-term opportunities with quick turnarounds.\nAnyone interested in technical analysis and learning how to read volume, breakouts, and market behavior.\nBusy professionals who want a focused, practical, and results-driven trading strategy they can apply right away.\n\n\nCourse Features\n13 sections • Over 75 lectures • 3h 49m of content\nQuizzes and real chart analysis\nUnlimited lifetime access and free updates\nInstructor support within 24 hours\n30 day money-back-in-full guarantee\n\n\nJoin over 170,000 students from 190+ countries who are already part of the SharperTrades community.\nClick \"Take This Course/Buy Now\" and start your journey to trading success today!\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nIs this course beginner-friendly?\nYes!

There is a sure way to do this, but surprisingly very few people know how.  I'm not talking about using stop-loss orders, because these don't always work.  Stocks can \"gap down\" past your stop-loss order, resulting in your order being filled at a much lower price.  Other times, the stock price can move so fast, your stop-loss order doesn't get filled and you end up suffering more losses than you had initially planned.\nIn this course, I will reveal why you should consider not using stop-loss orders for your stocks, but still reduce your risk and maximize your reward!  Plus, I will teach you how to potentially turn a losing trade into a winner when things go wrong.\nEnroll in the course NOW so you can get started right away!\nYou also get unlimited email access to ask me any questions along the way, in addition to all future course updates.\nIf you're not completely convinced that this is the best way to \"insure\" your stock trades, you are entitled to a no-questions-asked 30 day 100% money-back guarantee.",

Well, that's true.\nIf you use stocks the way they use stocks.\nThe way most of the investing public use stocks is the \"buy and hold\" method of long-term investing. You buy a stock, don't monitor it, and hope it goes up in the next 5 or 10 years. That is NOT what penny stocks are for, and no knowledgeable day trader of penny stocks holds these instruments overnight for even one night.\nPenny stocks are the most volatile instruments in all of finance.

      "description": "Welcome to this course. Here you’ll learn a practical price action trading framework for the Anti-Climax setup.\nWhen a market rises or falls with strong momentum and speed, traders fear they’ll get left behind. The instinctive response is to chase the market, hopping onto the bandwagon at market prices. Eventually, the market runs out of new entrants. This is the beginning of the disappointing end.\nThis is the Anti-climax – a pattern that will help us fade exhaustive price swings.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be able to spot Anti-Climax setups, locate trade entry points, and set stop-loss levels.\nTo enhance the Anti-climax setup, you will also learn how to identify congestion zones that work as reliable support and resistance.\nWe’ll walk you step-by-step through the process. Diagrams and chart pattern examples are used throughout the course to illustrate the key concepts.\nThis course is designed for the existing trader who is looking for a structured approach to a classic trading situation; an overbought or oversold market. Instead of using indicators like the Stochastic and RSI, we use a simple and effective price action pattern.\nThe concepts in this course apply to stock trading, Forex, and futures trading. You can use them with day trading, or swing trading. Price action principles are universal.\nOf course, there’s no guarantee you’ll profit. You need to study the material and see what works for you. You may not implement the information exactly, but you’ll get something from the course you can use in your trading.\nPlease look through the course description, and we hope you’ll join us.",

      "description": "Join over 1,140+ students just like you who’re having massive success with Passive Investing using this exact course (and learning to earn a profit on autopilot right away!)\n\nStudent Reviews:\n'This is by far the best course on investing on Udemy'  - Hamid Mahmood\n'What I have watched, this material is superb. No matter if you are a newbie which can grab this information for better use and more mature investor. The tips on fees and historical statistics pay the course.' - Diana Chan (5/5 Stars)\n'Great comprehensive course for the basics of passive investing, definitely covers quite a bit! Helped me massively.. I have already opened an account and started investing.. Will look to now further my studies in this field. Thanks Jari' - Avinash Verma (5/5 Stars)\n-----------------------------\nHow would you like to have your own passively managed stock portfolio, that takes a day to set up, constantly works for you, grows your money and costs only 10 hours a year to manage?\n\nI know it may sound too good to be true, because the method of investing that most people attempt is to find a needle in a haystack. They try to find that one company that they think will outperform the market and they do so by spending weeks analyzing different companies before making a decision. The painful truth is:\nFor the majority of investors this turns out to be the wrong decision and they end up losing.\nI do things differently..\nI putt the odds of winning in my favor as I approach my finances by this creed:\n\"Invest your time actively and your money passively. It's the best kept secret in the world.\" - Michael LeBoeuf, Ph.D., author of The Millionaire In You\n\nThat's solid advice. And more and more people are heeding this advice because passive index investing has gained MASSIVE popularity over the past half a decade.\nWhy is this?\nIt's very simply because of money and time.\nPassive investing earns more money.\nPassive investing costs almost ZERO time.\nMore and more investors are waking up to the fact that, for years and years now, passively managed funds have outperformed active investors across the board.\nEven the most popular ACTIVE investor in the world, Warren Buffett, encourages investors to switch to a passive way of investing their money.\nHe said: ''most investors would be better off investing their money in a low-cost index fund''.\nAnd that's because he knows that most people aren't him.\nMost people just don't have the time and skill to perfect the art of value investing like Warren Buffett has..\nAnd a passive investing strategy provides a nearly perfect answer. It requires a lot less effort and time than an active strategy and earns much more money in the end. Total win-win.\nWith that being said, you will need to take certain specific steps in order to set up the best possible portfolio for your personal situation. And those steps are perfectly laid out in this course.\nAFTER COMPLETING THE COURSE YOU WILL:\nHave your own automated, highly profitable money-making machine (stock portfolio) that will earn you money 24/7\nHave the ability to earn money while you sleep. Literally.\nRadiate financial confidence\nHave the ability to pass on your knowledge to your children or other people YOU want to see financially well off\nHave the ability to construct Passive Portfolios for those you want to grant some financial security in the future\nand much, much more.\n--------------------------------\nStudent Reviews:\n'I am a newbie to investing. I read some other books and articles but I couldn't understand the essentials as easy as I did with this course. the tips and recommendations are very helpful.' - Tammy Cheung\n'A detailed look at investing that was just the right for me. I learned a lot and will go back to review to keep learning. An excellent course - worth a look.' - Frank DeSwart\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you watch all 3 hours of the course and take bold action as you follow the steps in the course you WILL have your own portfolio and you WILL be outperforming 90% of all investors in the most relaxed and low-effort way possible.\n\"The evidence is clear that the vast majority of individual investors would improve their outcomes if they adopted the passive strategy.\" - Larry Swedroe, author of Think, Act, and Invest Like Warren Buffett\nThe Benefits of Passive Investing :\nHigh Returns : Did you know that the average individual earns only 2.9% per year? That’s ridiculously low. Passive investing earns 3X that amount.\nTime Efficient : You don’t need to put in a lot of time. Spending only a couple of hours per year is enough.\nAutomation : Passive investing = automated investing. You can basically earn money while you sleep (or do something more productive, for that matter)\nLow Costs : The costs of passive investing are much lower compared to other strategies. This will literally save you thousands of dollars in the end.\nAccessibility : You can already start investing with a hundred dollars, you don’t have to put in a lot of time and you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to start. It's and everyman's strategy.\n“Most investors beat themselves by engaging in mistaken stock market strategies rather than accepting the passive buy-and- hold indexing approach (..). The way most investors behave, the stock market becomes a loser’s game.” - Burton Malkiel, author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street\nA small selection of the topics covered:\nThe power of compound interest\nThe essentials of Index funds\nThe essentials of ETF’s\nHow to use large-cap stocks\nEffective Diversification\nHow to use REITs\nHow to use mid-cap stocks\nA bit of personal finance\nEvaluating your risk tolerance levels\nDetermining your investing time horizon\nFull automation (investing automatically)\nHow to use small cap stocks\nEffective broker selection\nCost minimization\nSelf-awareness & characterization\nMore\nMore\nMore\nI'll also give you:\nA list of my best performing index funds\nA list of recommended brokerage firms/investing platforms\nA personal finance template\nLook over my shoulder as I walk you through all of this and more in a step-by-step way so you can follow along and have a passive portfolio working for you in less than a day!\nI'll see you on the inside!\nJari Roomer\nInvestor and Entrepreneur\n-------------------------------------------\nStudent Reviews:\n'Very thorough, exceeded my expectations. Great explanations of the various asset classes, including their risks and rewards.' - Chris Ross\n'A detailed look at investing that was just the right for me. I learned a lot and will go back to review to keep learning. An excellent course - worth a look.' - Frank DeSwart",

Let me tell you the knowledge imparted by Mr. Sandip was thorough and in depth with logical pragmatic reasoning for every strategy also showcasing the pathway for its effective implementation for successful trading. Mr. Sandip is indeed a gifted teacher, who goes the extra mile to ensure that his teachings / strategies are easily understood and perfectly applied even by a novice trader. Earlier when I saw his postings regarding the PAM indicator, I felt that it would be another selling preposition and a mere hype created to lure some baffled traders who are looking for the so called “Holy Grail”. However, after the power packed training sessions, I realized that Mr. Sandip’s major thrust is in figuring out the proper reasons behind every possible trade and methodical analysis of the probable events which eradicates the element of blind speculation which is so commonly prevalent in the market. In my opinion what the PAM does is that it gives an approval mark for taking profitable trades as the tool is based on some hardheaded research blended with a deep conviction through effectual back testing. Undoubtedly Mr. Sandip is one of the few authentic trading mentors which the market has every produced. I also appreciate the help and support I got from Ms. Nirmala in getting enrolled for the PAM indicator /Trainings. Despite certain limitations at my end, she ensured that I got easy access of PAM and that I may not remain deprived from the valuable source of information. Moreover, the training sessions were very well coordinated, and the team is very punctual with their schedule. This is indeed a perfect avenue which can lead people towards financial freedom in today’s complex world. I wish them loads of success in all their future endeavors.\nSachin Dinde : Excellent course Mr. Sandip, thoroughly enjoyed it, I am going through it again to make important points and record setups to practice learn more. Double thumbs up\nDave Butler : Only one word fantastic course, I would highly recommend this course to any trader new or experience. Every lesson is short and to the point, with actionable trading methods. The instructor Sandip is a very helpful person; I would say that he is the best instructor that I have come across. I wish PAM all the best in all that they do. Your student Dave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course is for any one who are tired with losses in Trading in Stock / Forex Market or Someone who is completely new to trading and don't even knows the fundamentals of Trading and wanted to be a successful Intraday or Swing or Positional Trader and looking for a program that will teach him/her everything from scratch and build a confidence of trading.\nAlso if you are a trader and don't know what are the secrets mechanism used by traders using Candle Stick Technical analysis and want to know how the master traders plans their strategy, then this course could be your favorite course in the journey of your trading.\n\n\nTopics Covered:\nA) Introduction to market and trading\nTrader vs Investor\nTrading Types and Styles\nWhat is mean by Technical Analysis\nUnderstanding Entry, Exit and Stop Loss\n4 Golden Trading Rules\nB) Lab Setup For Practicing Paper Trading in Live Market\nCreating Free Tradingview Account and overview of the platform\nHow to use TradingView Advance Tools\nHow to do free paper trading in Real Market in TradingView\nC) Basics of Price Action I\nMarket Trend and its type\nCorrect way to draw the trend line in Live Market\nUnderstanding Long vs Short Sell in Live Market (Which gives the early profit?)\nD) Basics of Price Action II\nSupport and Magical Breakout Rule\nResistance and Magical Breakout Rule\nCorrect way to draw support and Resistance\nHL Rule Of Confirmation for any Breakout Entry\nE) Getting Start with Single CandleStick Pattern Secrets: Live Market Demonstration\nHistory and Introduction To Candle Stick\nMarubozu Candle and types\n5% Relaxation Rule\nMarubozu Continuation and Reversal and Live Demo\nHammer or Bullish Pin Bar and Dragon Fly Candles (Bullish Reversal)\nEntry &Stop Loss Rule For Marubozu, Hammer, Dragon Fly\nInverted Hammer and live trading\nHow to trade on Shooting Star [Live Market Demo] [ why it's my favorite ]\nGrave Stone Doji and Live Trade\nHanging Man Canlesticks and Live Trade\nDoji and Types\nThe Only Condition to trade doji\nAnd Many more.\n\n\nAll patterns and concept which we had taken in the course had been try to deliver directly in the live market so that the candidate will get more comfortable and confident in trading.\nThe techniques which we are going to discussed on candlesticks are also combined with  Other powerful techniques like Demand-Supply, Support-Resistance , Price-Action Setups to get more results.",

In it, I share my daily intraday trading setups, offering insights into the strategies I employ in my trading practice.\n\n\nThe course delves deeply into market structure, covering various aspects that provide a comprehensive understanding. It starts with an in-depth analysis of market structure, progressing through several levels to ensure a solid foundation.\n\n\nAdditionally, the course introduces FBT Zone setups, starting with an overview and key concepts, followed by detailed explorations of different zone setups. Each setup includes discussions on limitations and revisions, ensuring you gain a well-rounded perspective on these strategies.\n\n\nTopics Covered:\nA)Market Structure In Depth\n· Market Structure I\n· Market Structure II\n· Market Structure III\n· Market Structure IV\n· Market Structure V\n\n\nB)FBT Zone Setups\n· Introduction To FBT Zones Setups\n· Concepts Of Zones\n· Turncoat Zones\n· FBT Zone Setup I\n· FBT Zone Setup I Continue.\n· FBT Zone Setup I Revision and Limitations\n· FBT Zone Setup II\n· FBT Zone Setup III\n\n\nIt’s important to note that the setups presented are intended for educational purposes, aiming to help retail traders understand how professional traders plan their trades.

Believe me, whatever I had gathered and used to do paper trading, I deleted it entirely and am going to use these setups and what is taught in Candle stick learning plus few youtube videos that have seen. Thank you so much for all your teachings.\n· Soumya Prakash Parhi: Simple way of explaining\n· Chandy Kunhu C Antony : This is the best course for BankNifty which is shown in real-time.

I have never been so satisfied after completing a course with full confidence. I have completed all 4 major courses of yours sir. 1. Candlesticks complete analysis, 2. Candlesticks master program, 3. Jackpot Setup and 4. FBT setup. Only someone who completes all 4 courses can tell how great your thought and intention of helping the beginners. I would certainly call this as a service that you have been doing to fellow mankind. No one can teach this much of knowledge for such a small monitory exchange. I hope someday I get an opportunity to learn your PAM setups as well. Thank you so much for being such a kind and wonderful mentor. God Bless you and your family!\nSangwanamit82 : Below is my feedback, 1. Very good setup for Bank Nifty mainly on 30 min chart, works very well on it. 2. Market structure is very imp base for trading any index, here author explained it exceptionally well. 3. I always wanted to learn Fibonacci entry and exit zones, here author taken a good time to give the clarity on the concept. 4. Thanks to this author to share his knowledge in a very low price. 5. As I am the beginner, taken many courses but I have never seen any course where author is explaining the concepts with full confidence. 6. In last I will only say, its a very good course for every trader experienced or beginner. Thanks Sandip, kindly create more courses like this.\nD - Ext Jagadeesan : I would glad to say this the entire course is very useful and 5 star is not enough to appreciate the course\nKislaya Kanan : I'm incredibly thankful for having access to this course—it's been a real game-changer for me in my trading journey. Every time I dive into it, I uncover new insights that help me grow. The depth of the course is something I really value. However, I'd love to see even more focus on one aspect: Fibonacci retracements. Could we possibly have an extra video dedicated solely to that? I think it would really add value. Thanks again for putting together such a valuable resource.\nKuldeep: Beautifully Designed. Amazing Explanation. Deep Knowledge about Market.\nAshwin R. Kakde : I have attended more expensive sessions in the past, but none have been as instructive as this one. Your teaching style is truly amazing, and you've explained everything in a very straightforward manner.

Moreover, your endorsement of the course to colleagues and friends is a strong testament to its quality. The act of sharing knowledge and insights is a fantastic way to contribute to the wider trading community. I hope the knowledge gained from the course significantly enhances my profitability as a trader. The last chapter on psychology was an eye opener for me.\nChandra Mohan Semwal : Gem of content very hard to find at this price. Exclusive content for people like me who cannot afford to buy expensive courses. Though at my first go it's a bit hard to digest but I will revise again by watching the full course again.

      "description": "THE ULTIMATE MASTERCLASS\nThis masterclass contains five courses that I have released, over time, in terms of alternative assets:\nFundamentals of Private Equity\nFundamentals of Private Debt\nFundamentals of Hedge Funds\nHow Manipulation Works in Asset Management\nExecutive Presence in Institutional Fundraising and Sales\nThe goal of this course is to give you an overview of these three major Alternative Investment types, as well as the social skills that complement the technical knowledge.\nThis is a course targeted for the \"ultimate\" alternative investments professional, who wants to both master the most-known asset classes and all of their areas, but also wants the additional soft skills in order to succeed.\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nFundamentals of Private Equity\nHow the Private Equity industry positions itself vis-a-vis other such as Venture Capital (which it includes), Hedge Funds and Investment Banking;\nWhat are the types of activities with a PE fund throughout the stages of sourcing, investing in and monitoring opportunities;\nHow PE funds actually work, from fundraising from allocators to deploying capital, as well as how operations are financed, and the provisions negotiated with investors;\nThe two main value drivers in PE investments (namely LBOs or leveraged buy-outs), which are financial engineering and value creation, and which each consists of;\nHow PE-owned companies, namely leveraged buy-out companies behave differently from public ones, in terms of their strategic focus (quarterly shareholder value focus versus \"full potential\"), how the business is restructured and OPEX (operational expenditures) minimised, as well as how talent is incentivized for performance;\nThe usual approaches to valuation (both two multiples-based approaches - trading comparables and transaction comparables, as well as the DCF - or Discounted Cash Flows - methods), as well as when each of these make sense;\nHow to perform a trading comparables analysis, researching a company and its key value drivers, defining the universe of comparable companies, corroborating that information, spreading their key financials, and finally determining their multiples, and a valuation range for the target company;\nHow to perform a transaction comparables analysis, finding transactions on companies similar to the target one, corroborating these with financial/deal information, de-biasing the price for premiums paid and/or synergies, spreading the key transaction information, determining their multiples and a valuation range for the target company;\nHow the DCF, of Discounted Cash Flows method works, by calculating the FCF or Free Cash Flow of the company for a stabilization period, with the goal of calculating its TV or Terminal Value. Then, normalizing that TV based on the capital structure of the company (debt/equity), using the WACC or Weighted Average Cost of Capital, and finally, using a discount factor to discount those cash flows based on the present value of money;\nHow the Venture Capital asset type works, using a \"spray-and-pray\" model for startups focused on exponential growth (J-Curve growth or \"hockey stick\" growth), as well as the relationship between the board member (usually a fund GP) and the startup founding team, which is frequently demoted or replaced with growth;\nHow Growth Capital or Growth Equity works - investing in companies that are at the intersection of late-stage VC and early-stage \"traditional\" Private Equity, consisting of minority stake investments in companies that just need small cash injections - low-risk and low-reward;\nHow Leveraged Buy-Outs work, from determining the attractiveness of an investment (robust cash flow, large asset base, operational \"fat that can be trimmed\"), as well as how operations are run (restructurings and divestitures to achieve \"full potential\" within 4-5 years, with a set of 4-5 key initiatives, and talent incentives for performance, either with actual equity or \"phantom equity\", as well as the monthly focus on OPEX reduction to pay off debt interest);\nHow Special Situations investments work, both Distressed Debt and Turnaround Capital, focusing on helping ailing companies and profiting from their recovery, and why regulatory/legal issues prevent \"mainstream\" expansion of these investments;\nThe institutional fundraising process, from fund marketing, to information providing in data rooms, to due diligence and allocation;\nThe context of fund marketing, including myths such as that keeping funds hidden will not attract regulator attention or will make the fund manager have \"mystique\" and exclusiveness, to actual regulatory roadblocks to fund marketing;\nThe usual fund marketing channels and materials, from simplified versions of fund offering documents, interviews/features with the fund management team and CEOs, periodic updates and others;\nHow to actually sell a fund to an allocator using the PPP model (performance, processes and persuasion). Focusing on performance, on the sophistication of processes (ideally, institutional-quality), but also leveraging my unique persuasion tools to better convince investors;\nWhat type of standard and bespoke provisions investors usually request, from changes in fees (management fees, performance fees, co-investment fees, many others), to complex clauses related to investment restrictions, secondaries sales, transparency requirements, fund financing restrictions, GP commit and devotion, GP removal rights, among others;\nHow to negotiate provisions with allocators, from strategic tactics such as reducing allocation size or breaking up syndicated groups of investors, to \"in-the-room\" tactics such as Implementation Intention or empathy to disarm the other side and make them more receptive;\nThe role of the key players in a fund, from associates, to VPs and principals, to GPs, as well as the tasks that each performs in a fund;\nThe tasks at different stages of a fund's lifetime, from sourcing opportunities (first round of vetting, meeting with intermediaries, initial risk/reward projections, indicative offers) to investing (complete due diligence, deal modeling and financing, deal consideration, negotiations), to post-investment monitoring (preparing exits, supporting companies as a board member) to fund-end activities (fund extensions, fund restructurings, rushed sales including possible sponsor-to-sponsor transactions, and more);\nStage-independent activities in a fund that are always necessary, including reporting (internal and external), or helping with possible LP secondaries sales;\nFundamentals of Private Debt\nWhat are the essential terms and keywords in terms of debt. Maturity, principal, interest. What is direct lending, what is leveraged lending. What is secured debt, what is collateral, what is overcollateralization, what do debt liens mean, what is bilateral and syndicated lending, what is a credit facility, what does debt seniority or debt instruments being \"investment-grade\" mean, what is the yield or interest rate, what is securitized debt (structured finance products), what is debt rediscounting, what are covenants, and what are primary and secondary transactions in funds;\nWhat are the different payment modalities for both the principal and the interest of debt. Principal: Amortised, bullet, sinking fund, call and put provisions. Interest: Cash, PIK (paid-in-kind), step-up, zero-coupon, deferred interest, periodic reset;\nWhat are the different debt characteristics. Public or private, used to finance operations or a transaction, short- or long-term, with instruments above or below investment grade, secured or not, with a fixed or a floating interest rate, being a term loan or a revolving line of credit, being committed or uncommitted, and being provided by banks, private lenders or the bond market;\nSimilarities and differences between Private Equity and Private Debt, including similarities in fund structures and allocator profiles (closed-end funds), but with different return models (exits in PE versus fixed income in PD), as well as the differences between debt and equity underwriting (structuring debt tranches vs. structuring share price and quantity), and the intersection between both (financing LBOs with private debt, for example);\nThe two main types of private debt vehicles: BDCs (Business Development Companies) and private credit funds, as well as the major differences between them (types of investors allowed + investment strategy bias);\nWhat types of debt instruments are provided by banks, including overdraft facilities, term loans, money market facilities, revolving lines of credit, and leases;\nWhat types of DCM (debt capital markets) debt instruments exist, including commercial paper, or bonds and notes, including corporate bonds and high-yield bonds, with different levels of risk and yield;\nThe different types of investment strategies, from middle-market corporate lending, to real estate, infrastructure debt, and many others;\nHow middle-market corporate loans work, usually provided either by senior, secured bank debt or private mezzanine debt, with different levels of risk and demands (maintenance financial covenants);\nHow mezzanine debt works, originally an intermediate step between equity rounds and bank debt, but nowadays reduced to a specific niche, either for bespoke financing needs, or as a replacement for high-yield bonds at times of instability;\nHow Asset-Based Lending (ABL) works, with collateral being specific assets of the borrower, frequently used for working capital needs, using either inventory or Accounts Receivable (A/R) as collateral, and usually repaid by the liquidation of the collateral assets;\nHow real estate debt works, for the development or maintenance of properties of different types (residential or commercial, including all categories of property, from offices to retail, industrial, hospitality and other types), and, specifically for senior, secured real estate debt, its presence as core in many portfolios, as a tested, reliable strategy;\nHow infrastructure debt works, mainly for energy and transportation purposes (power plants, oil pipelines, airports, roads and more), and mostly senior, secured debt where a government is a borrower. Lower risk and lower reward, usually used as a risk dampener;\nHow structured finance products work, including CLO (Collateralized Loan Obligations), CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations) or MBSs (Mortgage-Backed Securities), how the securitization process works, and their role in the 2008 subprime crisis;\nHow distressed debt works, mainly DIP (Debtor-In-Possession) debt, where lenders intervene during a critical liquidity crisis of the borrower, helping them prevent bankruptcy and profiting from their recovery;\nHow venture debt works, as a type of Venture Capital (VC) but with debt instead of equity. Ideal for when the startup doesn't want to give up more equity, or just can't due to circumstances (down rounds), with high barriers to entry in terms of specialized knowledge and contacts;\nHow royalties work in terms of debt investing, licensing the rights to IP (Intellectual Property), namely in sectors such as life sciences/big pharma, entertainment such as movies and music, or consumer brands such as makeup and consumer electronics, and the high barriers to entry in terms of knowledge and contacts;\nHow consumer lending, marketplace lending and P2P lending work, an industry evolving at a quick pace, and how private lenders can obtain exposure to this strategy, usually through rediscount lending through marketplaces or platforms;\nAn overall view of loan agreements, including specific sections such as conditions precedents, representation and warranties, the definitions used, and covenants;\nThe different types of covenants - affirmative, negative and financial - as well as the two main types of financial covenants: incurrence and maintenance, as well as their consequences;\nFundamentals of Hedge Funds\nWhat makes a hedge fund, including being a class of alternative asset, being open-end instead of closed-end, charging a performance fee/incentive fee, and using exclusive techniques such as short selling, leverage or derivatives (like options, futures or ETFs);\nMyths surrounding hedge funds, related to their secrecy, whether they hedge positions or not, their use of leverage, and their obscene returns;\nComparing hedge funds with mutual funds, in terms of structure, presence or absence of a performance fee, liquidity, and others;\nComparing hedge funds and other classes of alternative assets, in terms of structure, being open-end or closed-end funds, as well as expected allocator liquidity;\nAn overview of the key players in a fund, both internal and external;\nThe investment team, composed of traders, PMs, and analysts, and how they perform different tasks including idea generation, generating an investment thesis from an idea, and actually putting capital to work;\nThe fundraising and Investor Relations team, including activities such as fund marketing and selling a fund, negotiating provisions and agreements, and dealing with nervous or angry allocators that may want to redeem their capital;\nThe fund executives - usually CIO (Chief Investment Officer) or COO (Chief Operational Officer), that may be fund partners (usually GPs), or external, and what they focus on;\nWhat prime brokerages (a.k.a. prime brokers or \"primes\") perform, in terms of bridging hedge funds and financial marketings, including performing, clearing and settling trades, but also other services such as extending leverage or performing capital introductions;\nFund administrators and their functions, running operations and calculating performance metrics, among others, and fund custodians, taking custody of the assets - both for added investor protection;\nFund lawyers, which are usually essential to establish the fund's legal entities and negotiate provisions with investors - both in a standardised LPA (Limited Partnership Agreement) but also custom provisions in side letters, as well as fund accountants, which usually perform spend analysis and investment analysis, creating third-party audited performance records, which are essential to investors;\nAn overview of the four main hedge fund strategies - equity, event-driven, macro and relative value/arbitrage;\nEquity plays and how they work through the directional movement of equity prices, including quantitative approaches, long or short plays, and based on fundamental growth or fundamental value, in possible sectors or geographies;\nThe possible net market exposures of equity funds, which can be \"net long\", market neutral or \"net short\";\nEvent-driven plays, relying on either anticipating or causing a major change in a company's lifetime;\nHow activist investing works, by owning a small share of a company and then presenting a plan for change to the board of shareholders;\nHow merger arbitrage works, by owning shares in two companies before a merger;\nHow private issue and Regulation D investments work, by owning private securities of a company that are usually less expensive than the public securities;\nHow distressed debt works, by investing in ailing companies and profiting from their recovery;\nHow macro plays work, by consolidating global tendencies in specific trades, usually in commodities or currencies;\nHow both systematic and discretionary macro plays are performed, including managed futures accounts, CTAs, or other formats;\nHow carry trades work, by performing yield arbitrage on a currency pair in order to obtain daily interest besides profiting from the price convergence;\nHow relative value (or arbitrage) plays work, by exploiting price discrepancies either for one single security, or in a pair of securities (where one is underpriced, and the other one is overpriced);\nOther forms of hedge fund strategies, including multistrategy funds, which combine multiple strategies, which dilute both excess returns and losses, and Funds of Funds (FoFs), which have higher overhead, but can present investors with diversification and access to exclusive, high-performing managers;\nSome measures of return calculations in a fund, including the nominal return, the annualized return (returns standardised for a yearly period), and compounding return, with different compounding rates;\nMeasures of returns adjusted for risk, including alpha, the Sharpe Ratio, the Sortino Ratio and the Treynor Ratio (which use different variations of risk, including standard deviation, downside deviation, or the market beta or undiversified risk);\nSources of risk in hedge funds, including the three main layers (market risk, secondary risk and idiosyncratic risk);\nThe six main types of market risks (equities, credit rates, interest rates, commodities, currencies, real estate);\nSources of risk unique to hedge funds including leverage, liquidity, position concentration, client concentration, counterparties, and more;\nHow leverage works (both borrowing leverage and notional leverage), as well as how to calculate levered risk;\nHow liquidity risk occurs, both by trading illiquid securities, but also by holding large positions (even in liquid instruments);\nSome metrics and indicators for risk in hedge funds, including the famous (infamous?) VaR - Value at Risk, as well as its shortcomings, including lack of estimation outside the confidence level. Other measures of risk including standard deviation, downside deviation, largest loss and largest losing month, months to earn back losses or ratio of winning to losing months;\nHow Manipulation Works in Asset Management\nHow asset managers can manipulate someone's consistency, such as making traders agree to specific investment approaches or allocators agree to the merits of the fund in order to \"lock them\" into future action;\nHow asset managers can leverage emotional manipulation, by getting allocators to feel attached to funds they invest in, or by causing fear or anticipation in their investment team so they perform better;\nHow asset managers can leverage effort manipulation, making allocating or switching investment strategies seem like less effortful, which makes it more easy to do;\nHow asset managers can leverage standard manipulation, twisting comparisons between different investment funds or between traders in their team, using different criteria or making the exceptions they want;\nHow asset managers can leverage pressure manipulation, by pressuring either investors to allocate or members of their investment team to make a change (or take other action), through scarcity or fear, for example;\nHow asset managers can leverage identification manipulation, seeming to have traits in common with their investors to secure allocations, or seeming to have had similar experiences to their traders in order to get them to do something, being more influenceable;\nHow asset managers can leverage fact manipulation, twisting the facts related to their investment fund, or the performance of specific members;\nHow asset managers can leverage context manipulation, selecting what to compare their fund to in order to make it seem the best possible, as well as changing the effect it causes on investors;\nHow asset managers can leverage labeling manipulation, using positive labels to seem more reliable and diligent, or using negative labels to discredit their \"competition\" in terms of investment;\nExecutive Presence for Institutional Fundraising and Sales\nWhat are the nine key pillars of executive presence, and the importance of each;\nHow to cultivate initiative. Why doing more, both in terms of actively presenting information, but also reacting to crises and difficult investment situations makes you more present;\nHow to cultivate your appearance. The image presented, the credentials you and the fund team, as well as associations with reputable investors or other institutions;\nHow to cultivate salience and vision. How to be a fund manager that stands out from others, having unique investment angles, strategies, opportunities, and a strong vision that is reflected in the investment philosophy;\nHow to cultivate transparency. Why sharing both the good and bad components of performance, risks, credentials and more elements is recommended - and required - to close significant allocations;\nHow to cultivate harmony. Why being streamlined in your communication and subcommunication - inside and outside - allows for succint and clear presentations, and why investors consider the quality of the presentation a proxy for the quality of the actual fund;\nHow to cultivate grace under fire. Not reacting in the face of tough demands and tough negotiations, passing on a strong image of stability that allocators appreciate;\nHow to cultivate rigidity. Why illustrating that you are selective about people, processes, investments and even investors makes you more present and memorable;\nHow to cultivate intellectual honesty. Why sharing the truth - whether it's convenient for you or not - communicates an image of a trusted advisor, an objective manager that is crucial for allocators;\nHow to cultivate tension and selectiveness. Why succint, clear communication is crucial for presentations, and why not immediately giving in to demands, but instead politely persisting makes you more respected and not less;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit.

But we've been helping students and professionals master Finance and Accounting across Europe for a while now. Here's what our 1:1 Tuition Clients say about us.\nWe're proud of our students, and inspired by these stories - we decided to share them (unedited) with you...\n\"I have had a great experience with Fervent tutor as I was taught more of the content and less memorizing. I think their timings and their work is professional as the tutor seeks the most efficient and productive way to help the student. I studied accounting with the tutor and it contributed greatly to my knowledge for the exam.\"\n- Abdulaziz, BA (Hons), International Management\n\n\n\"Fervent goes above and beyond the call of duty. First, they help you get the basics right and then assist you until you get a firm grip of your module. Fervent provides an extremely professional and patient environment. Doesn’t matter how many questions you have or silly you think they are, they encourage all of it. I never would have passed my module rather score a merit in it if it wouldn’t have been for Fervent.\"\n- Shambhavi, MSc, Accounting and Finance\n\n\nFervent provides an exceptional service, the whole process from start to finish was very hands on and supportive – during my final year I needed tuition for a governance paper, essentially I was hoping they would do all the work for me but in the long run I got so much more than I bargained for ….they changed my entire thought process and maintained a complete professional reserve. Working with me every step of the way, I was encouraged to think critically in achieving my objective and inspired to dig deep. As a result I produced a 2000 word essay (which I had them proof read as well) worthy of a distinction. Thank you for all the help and most importantly thank you for believing in me.\n- Sean, MSc, Accounting and Finance\n\n\nThroughout the period of doing my Master’s dissertation, I felt agonised from not only researching my specific topic but also writing clearly with no any grammatical errors. Fortunately, I found Fervent which offers efficient and comprehensive services. At first, I just expected my dissertation to be improved in terms of grammar; however, Fervent provided me much more than that. All essential aspects such as formatting, structure, logic, consistency of analysis and critique, strength of arguments are also checked and corrected. One thing that I’ve been very grateful is related to my topic details. In addition to pointing out some big mistakes and recommending more accurate and professional alternative solutions, Fervent gave me many more interesting and valuable ideas which helped to develop my content to have stronger arguments and more critical analysis. My tutor’s suggestions helped me become more analytical in my thought process and in producing a better research paper; my critical thinking skills also saw a considerable improvement. Without Fervent’ support, I don’t believe I could have been awarded an excellent grade for this dissertation. Thank you so much for invaluable help over my hard time.\n- Duang MSc, Financial Analysis and Fund Management\n\n\nUndoubtedly the gains that I have acquired from the studying with Fervent are plentiful and significantly make me different from what I used to be in terms of my expanded knowledge base, improved English skills (e.g. English-writing), as well as being more confident communicating with English speakers and with the improved ability to think differently and critically for dealing with various types of course works in my study in the university more readily.\nMy tutor is specialized not only in the teaching of Accounting and Finance but also very familiar with the relevant knowledge in the subjects such as Marketing and Management. This is why I trust this person at an initial point along with his kind, friendly and very patient characteristics (e.g. I’m always encouraged by my tutor during the session with him, often to hear: if you really want it and then you can do it and will make it with no doubts).\n“Skilled worker ushers in the gate, leads a pious life depending on individual.” This is a Chinese old saying which I can still remember vividly because it was what my tutor had told me in my  with him and made me believe an excellent learning outcome and a constructive learning process requires the hardworking from both of us. The record shows we did it. This is another reason I like Fervent as in the session with my tutor you see his hardworking as for the preparation for each session and in making the sessions distinctive from cliché-ridden teaching-and-listening classes by exploring the best way and the most suitable set of teaching methods to provide the student with the best value for money.\nJiajian BA (Hons), Business and Management",

      "description": "Latest News: Indian Insight Founder & Instructor of this course, Yash Utmani was ranked 8th in Position Trading & 12th in Day Trading in Equities Segment in the last concluded edition of Pro Advisory Championship Competition, India 2016.\n\nNow see what the students are saying about this investing course:\n\"The course exceeded my expectations; it offers a global, complete and professional vision of value investing strategies for the stock market.\nIt is a great job and highly recommended.\"\n\"This course provides an extremely detailed account of value investing strategies and great explanation of all aspects of financial statements as well. I really enjoyed this course as it exceeded my expectations.\"\n\"getting to learn what is truly value investing. always had this notion of forever holding and realized thats not the case for value investing \"\nValue investing is about investing in quality stocks that are trading substantially below their potential. The idea is to identify quality businesses when they provide sufficient margin of safety and investing in them for the long term.\nWithin value investing there are two broad strategies which are used by famous value investors like Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger for wealth creation. My goal is to cover these investing strategies and deliver a comprehensive investing framework that you may use to identify value stocks.  If you are someone who would like to understand the key concepts in value investing and achieve financial freedom then this course is perfect for you.\nYou don’t need to worry if you don’t know anything about accounting or financial statements or investing for that matter. Because in this course I am going to start by teaching you financial statement analysis, so that you get the basic understanding around financial statements. This is very important for your success in value investing. So in the first three sections we cover:\n1. Understanding Financial Statements (including Balance sheet, Income Statement & Cash Flow Statement) for Investing\n2. Common Size Analysis of Financial Statements to enhance understanding of the business for investing\n3. Financial Ratio Analysis (including activity ratios, liquidity ratios, solvency ratios and valuation ratios) to dig deep before investing in any business\nThe next three sections are completely dedicated to value investing & investing strategies where we look at:\n1. Benjamin Graham's value investing strategy\n2. Moat based Value Investing\n3. A complete investing framework to evaluate stocks for investing\nWe will also cover related topics that are as important for your investing. These topics include:\n1. How to figure out if a company will be able to sustain its growth or not?\n2. Concept of Margin of Safety in Value Investing\n3. Additional criterion for the value investing framework to evaluate management of any company\n4. Additional criterion related to accounting red flags for detecting possible accounting frauds before investing.\nAt the end of this course you will have a complete value investing framework to evaluate any business for long term investing. Too many value investing courses cover only how to invest, but do not tell you when to exit. However in investing knowing when to exit is as important as knowing which stock to invest in. Hence this course will also guide you on when to exit your investment in a stock.\nSo if you would like to start your journey in the value investing world or take it further, this course will be a complete package for you.",

      "description": "WHY HEDGE FUNDS?\nHedge funds are one of the most profitable types of alternative assets.\nHowever, they are not easy to comprehend.\nFund structures, investment strategies, provisions and fees, and other elements.\nAnd unfortunately, it's hard to find a course that covers the essentials of hedge funds.\nSo it becomes common for a student to:\nNot be able to discern among the different investment strategies;\nNot know if the provisions negotiated with an investor are helpful to the fund, or not at all;\nNot know which people in a hedge fund perform which tasks;\nNot master the different investment techniques, especially those with subtle differences (such as arbitrage plays);\nSo, how do we address this?\n\n\n\n\nPUTTING THE \"EDGE\" IN HEDGE\nThis course is the ideal course if you want to gain an edge in the hedge fund industry.\nIt covers all the various areas of the industry and practice, including investment strategies, career positions, the broader market, and much, much more.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PERFECT COURSE... FOR WHOM?\nThis course is, naturally, targeted at people who are interested in the functioning of hedge funds.\nMore specifically, it targets:\nAspiring (or current) asset management professionals, including traders that want to start their own fund;\nProfessionals in other areas of high finance that are considering hedge fund positions;\nProfessionals interested in the inner workings and processes of hedge funds;\nProfessionals interested in the performance and risk measures used in hedge funds;\nAnyone looking to know more about hedge funds!\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nWhat makes a hedge fund, including being a class of alternative asset, being open-end instead of closed-end, charging a performance fee/incentive fee, and using exclusive techniques such as short selling, leverage or derivatives (like options, futures or ETFs);\nMyths surrounding hedge funds, related to their secrecy, whether they hedge positions or not, their use of leverage, and their obscene returns;\nComparing hedge funds with mutual funds, in terms of structure, presence or absence of a performance fee, liquidity, and others;\nComparing hedge funds and other classes of alternative assets, in terms of structure, being open-end or closed-end funds, as well as expected allocator liquidity;\nAn overview of the key players in a fund, both internal and external;\nThe investment team, composed of traders, PMs, and analysts, and how they perform different tasks including idea generation, generating an investment thesis from an idea, and actually putting capital to work;\nThe fundraising and Investor Relations team, including activities such as fund marketing and selling a fund, negotiating provisions and agreements, and dealing with nervous or angry allocators that may want to redeem their capital;\nThe fund executives - usually CIO (Chief Investment Officer) or COO (Chief Operational Officer), that may be fund partners (usually GPs), or external, and what they focus on;\nWhat prime brokerages (a.k.a. prime brokers or \"primes\") perform, in terms of bridging hedge funds and financial marketings, including performing, clearing and settling trades, but also other services such as extending leverage or performing capital introductions;\nFund administrators and their functions, running operations and calculating performance metrics, among others, and fund custodians, taking custody of the assets - both for added investor protection;\nFund lawyers, which are usually essential to establish the fund's legal entities and negotiate provisions with investors - both in a standardised LPA (Limited Partnership Agreement) but also custom provisions in side letters, as well as fund accountants, which usually perform spend analysis and investment analysis, creating third-party audited performance records, which are essential to investors;\nAn overview of the four main hedge fund strategies - equity, event-driven, macro and relative value/arbitrage;\nEquity plays and how they work through the directional movement of equity prices, including quantitative approaches, long or short plays, and based on fundamental growth or fundamental value, in possible sectors or geographies;\nThe possible net market exposures of equity funds, which can be \"net long\", market neutral or \"net short\";\nEvent-driven plays, relying on either anticipating or causing a major change in a company's lifetime;\nHow activist investing works, by owning a small share of a company and then presenting a plan for change to the board of shareholders;\nHow merger arbitrage works, by owning shares in two companies before a merger;\nHow private issue and Regulation D investments work, by owning private securities of a company that are usually less expensive than the public securities;\nHow distressed debt works, by investing in ailing companies and profiting from their recovery;\nHow macro plays work, by consolidating global tendencies in specific trades, usually in commodities or currencies;\nHow both systematic and discretionary macro plays are performed, including managed futures accounts, CTAs, or other formats;\nHow carry trades work, by performing yield arbitrage on a currency pair in order to obtain daily interest besides profiting from the price convergence;\nHow relative value (or arbitrage) plays work, by exploiting price discrepancies either for one single security, or in a pair of securities (where one is underpriced, and the other one is overpriced);\nOther forms of hedge fund strategies, including multistrategy funds, which combine multiple strategies, which dilute both excess returns and losses, and Funds of Funds (FoFs), which have higher overhead, but can present investors with diversification and access to exclusive, high-performing managers;\nSome measures of return calculations in a fund, including the nominal return, the annualized return (returns standardised for a yearly period), and compounding return, with different compounding rates;\nMeasures of returns adjusted for risk, including alpha, the Sharpe Ratio, the Sortino Ratio and the Treynor Ratio (which use different variations of risk, including standard deviation, downside deviation, or the market beta or undiversified risk);\nSources of risk in hedge funds, including the three main layers (market risk, secondary risk and idiosyncratic risk);\nThe six main types of market risks (equities, credit rates, interest rates, commodities, currencies, real estate);\nSources of risk unique to hedge funds including leverage, liquidity, position concentration, client concentration, counterparties, and more;\nHow leverage works (both borrowing leverage and notional leverage), as well as how to calculate levered risk;\nHow liquidity risk occurs, both by trading illiquid securities, but also by holding large positions (even in liquid instruments);\nSome metrics and indicators for risk in hedge funds, including the famous (infamous?) VaR - Value at Risk, as well as its shortcomings, including lack of estimation outside the confidence level. Other measures of risk including standard deviation, downside deviation, largest loss and largest losing month, months to earn back losses or ratio of winning to losing months;\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit. I don't want you to waste your money.\nIf you think this course is a fit and can take your hedge fund knowledge to the next level... it would be a pleasure to have you as a student.\nSee on the other side!",

      "description": "Whilst fun, Forex trading is not easy! To be successful today, you must have the ability to test strategies, automate trading and access information.\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\nNote: For this course, we will use the Oanda API service. It is available in most countries worldwide, however please check before purchasing the course.  You can check in video #3 called \"Oanda account setup and API access\". If you are in the EU, it's not available.\n\n\nWhether it's as a hobby or professional, this course will give you the foundation upon which you will be able to:\n\n\nBuild a live trading bot\nCreate a fast, accurate strategy testing system\nRetrieve live headlines, sentiments, technicals and more from the web.\nUse databases to store and correlate data with market moves\nBuild a web application showing the latest prices, sentiments and other market data\nLearn full stack development, using MongoDB, Python and JavaScript (with React)\n\n\nWe will start by learning to use Python to access the Oanda REST API. Next, we'll download a few thousand candles and develop a simple strategy back test, testing multiple parameters and currency pairs at once. We'll use the results from this back test to learn how to automate the export of results into a spreadsheet format with tables and graphs.\n\n\nOnce the simple strategy has been tested, we'll get hold of a lot more data - six years' worth for multiple time frames. We'll rerun our simple strategy, and then move on to implementing candle pattern detection and indicator calculation. We will also look at using multi-processing to speed up the testing even more.\n\n\nNow we have some more knowledge, it's time to create a more comprehensive back testing system - with spread and breaking candles down into finer time frames. For testing we will choose two strategies with over a million views on YouTube and assess whether they really give the claimed 90% win rate...\n\n\nIt's now time to move on to the big moment - the live trading bot. We will develop a robust trading bot that trades multiple pairs with comprehensive logging. We will structure the code such that it is easy to swap in and out strategies.\n\n\nNow it's time to get more advanced and learn how stream prices live - using multi-threading with events and work queues to react to prices and make decisions\n\n\nWe will learn how to use Web Scraping with Python to access live sentiments, technicals, headlines and economic data. Alongside this, we'll create a MongoDB database to store our data.\n\n\nNext up: React! We will use the famous framework to develop ourselves a web application that can access live prices, our sentiment data and much more.\n\n\nFinally, we will deploy our trading bot on a cloud service.\n\n\nThe course includes a quick-start appendix for Python and for HTML/CSS/JavaScript.",

There exists no formal, accredited institution for proper knowledge and procedure. Most participants never make a dime.\nThis is the only industry on earth where those who have no business in the game attempt to compete with the sharpest minds and largest accounts on the planet. WHY?\nThe lure of the market is just too strong. Tales of rags-to-riches, bitcoin millionaires and long-shot dreams of the mansion on the hill turn every wannabe into a player; and every technical analysis washout into a guru.\nThose who cannot do, teach. Those who cannot teach, anonymously market trading courses on the internet. All because the vast majority of participants don’t know what they don’t know.\nA Timeless Solution\nThis course is a perfect solution for beginners and experienced traders alike. It fills the need for a simple, timeless method of structuring price-chart analysis. It further closes the gap between knowledge of technical analysis and real-world skills for making money and controlling risk.\nThis course will demystify the price-chart for experienced investors and traders who never learned proper price-chart structure.\nYou have to know what you are looking at when you see price-chart intervals. Like someone learning to read, this course will guide you through the process of price-mechanics and market dynamics, laying the foundation for effectively reading order flow and market sentiment in the chart so you can second-guess your competitors.\nThis course will make you competent. It will either teach you everything you should have learned years ago OR everything you need to know right now so you don't waste the next five years of your life learning the hard way that the trading education game is rigged.\nPrice Chart Analysis Is A Proven Method For Managing Risk\nFear and greed permeate financial markets. Risk for most traders and investors is seen as something to be feared. I will show you how to use it as a tool. Once you understand how to exploit price-chart structure, risk becomes a powerful ally.\nI have been using the price-chart for over two (2) decades to pull profit from any chart interval imaginable: 1-minutes to Weekly time frames.\nIf You Have The Desire To Turn Price Charts Into Profit, I Can Help You\nLearn the mechanics of price and how you should use them\nUnderstand why your goal should be consistency, NOT profit\nRead order flow and market sentiment in the chart like veteran trader\nQualify price-action using Context\nDetermine the LRE (Low-Risk Entry) on ANY interval\nConsistently take entries with the biggest expected payout\nMaster one of the most financially rewarding skills on earth\nContent And Overview\nThis course has 24 lectures with assignments in each section to help you integrate course concepts and master price-chart mechanics more quickly.\nIncluded are screencasts where your instructor takes you into the chart in real-time to provide instruction on how to read intervals like a veteran screen-trader.\nYou will learn at timeless skill for price-chart analysis. This will enable you to apply ANY strategy of your choosing, develop your own style, and play the game on YOUR terms.\nFeel confident that you will be guided every step of the way by a professional trader who doesn’t just teach, but actually does; a seasoned veteran who has coached private-clients to astounding results for almost a decade.\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to test ANY trading “system” or method, because you will be able to immediately determine if it produces low- or high-risk market entries.",

      "description": "Welcome to Forex Scalping Masterclass Course.\n\n\nWelcome to Forex Scalping Masterclass. This class is all about mastering a forex scalping strategy.\n\n\nBut before that.\n\n\nWhat is scalping in Forex or What is the meaning of Scalping?\nScalping is a type of trading style where traders buy or sell a currency pair and hold it for a short period of time to make a profit. Basically in scalping traders take trades in expectations of small profits in a very small period of time. It is one of the fastest forms of trading and Scalping is one of the most famous styles of trading in forex.\n\n\nWhy is it so?\n\n\nWhy so many people are interested in scalping?\n\n\nBecause Scalping is one of the fastest ways to make huge profits in a short interval of time And It also is because of the benefits that scalping provides as compared to other trading styles.\nLike\n\n\n1. Multiple setups - In scalping forex, you can get multiple setups or multiple trades in a day, unlike other trading styles where you will have to wait for a day or 2 to get 1 single setup.\n\n\nSo basically you get more opportunities to place a trade while trading.\n\n\n2. The low risk involved - In scalping there is low risk involved in each trade. You have to risk a very small percentage of your account on each trade.\n\n\n3. Suitable for Small accounts - Scalping is very suitable for those people who want to start trading with a small account or for those people who want to invest a small amount in forex. You don’t require big accounts to get started with scalping.\n\n\n\n\n4. Active style of trading - scalping is a very active style of trading. When compared with other trading styles like swing trading or day trading where you have to be very patient and you might have to wait for setups for days which might feel very inactive styles of trading. In scalping, you get multiple setups. If you miss one setup the next setup will be right around the corner.\n\n\nForex Scalping if done right it is one of the fastest ways to make huge profits in a short interval of time.\n\n\nBut Remember if it is done right.\n\n\nSo what are the things that need to be done properly in order for scalping to work for us and be profitable?\n\n\nYou should have a Proper Forex Scalping Strategy - A strategy with proper win rate, a risk to rewards, and multiple setups.\nThe Forex Strategy should contain instruction for proper entry and exit points i.e the strategy should have proper and clear instructions for entering a trade and also exiting a trade. This is one of the most common shortcomings I see in scalping strategies.\nProper Conformations - There should be at least 2 confirmations that a strategy should have. I have seen people selling scalping strategies in which they tell people to enter trading with one single conformation which can be risky.\n\n\nSee keep this thing in mind forex trading is a complex process and there are a lot of variables involved in it and If you are placing a trade on 1 single confirmation then it can be very risky.\n\n\nYou must least have 2 confirmations before entering a trade.\n\n\n4. Risk Management - I always say this. No strategy is complete without a risk management plan.\nA strategy should always have a risk management plan designed specifically for that strategy.\n\n\n5. Specifics rules for that Forex strategy - A scalping strategy should have a specific set of rules which cover the guidelines, things to avoid, proper exceptions, and different situations that might occur which trading.\n\n\nEach and every trade is different and there have to be certain rules which should help you take proper decisions and act accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nThis Masterclass covers each and every point properly and clearly.\nThis scalping class covers a very profitable forex scalping strategy.\n\n\nIn this Forex Scalping Strategy Course you will learn\n\n\n1.

      "description": "The fixed income markets are central to the modern economy, and are arguably the most central and influential markets in the entire financial system.  Indeed, interest rates, the most important prices in the entire economy, are set in the bond and money markets. A famous and colorful lament from then President-Elect Bill Clinton in 1993 lead his aide, James Carville, to declare that in his next life he wanted to come back as something really influential: the bond market.\nThis course, which assumes no knowledge of finance, and with minimal math requirements (business school calculus is more than enough) will be useful for financial professionals who wish to go to the next level with their understanding of the fixed income markets, and for quantitative professionals from other fields who are interested in learning something about finance.  If you're looking for one segment of the capital markets to start an exploration of finance, you can't go wrong with the fixed income markets.\nWhat You Will Learn:\nThis course teaches quantitative and rigorous techniques for pricing fixed income securities and for analyzing and managing the risks they are exposed to.  We will develop techniques for the analysis of treasury bonds, treasury bills, strips, and repurchase agreements, as well as for bond portfolios.\nMore than any other asset class, fixed income securities are exposed to risks associated with interest rates.  Moreover, the linkage between fixed income assets and interest rates is very tight.  Thus, by necessity, we will also develop methods for the analysis of interest rates.  We will explore the close linkage between fixed income instruments and interest rates, and we will review the main theories of interest rate term structure.\nThe pricing of fixed income securities is one of the core objectives of the course.  We will go well beyond pricing in the analysis of the risks fixed income securities are exposed to. We will treat the classic measures of interest rate risk: dollar duration, DV01, duration, and convexity, and we will see how to use them for real risk management applications.\nIn the end, everything in this course is driven by applications, and there are applications galore.  We will cover trading applications, like riding the yield curve and rate level trading.  And we will study risk management techniques like immunization, and applications in asset/liability management.\nIncludes Python tools\nPython based tools are now included for computing bond prices and risk measures, and constructing interest rates and yield curves.  All software that is part of this course is released under a permissive MIT license, so students are free to take these tools with them and use them in their future careers, include them in their own projects, whether open source or proprietary, anything you want!\nSo Sign Up Now!\nAccelerate your finance career by taking this course, and advancing into quantitative finance.  With 15 hours of lectures, extensive problem sets, and Python codes implementing the course material, not to mention a 30 day money back guarantee, you can't go wrong!",

      "description": "Student Testimonials:\nThis course offers an unreal value. Very rich content! This beats any financial course I've taken at my university. Looking forward to completing this course and using some of these skills in my career.--Steven\n\n\nCameron is an outstanding teacher. Thank you very much for making the most important and difficult Finance concepts so easy to understand. Looking forward to the further courses.--Gevorg\n\n\nI got (am getting) some intuition about quant finance, not just leaning facts without really understanding the concepts.\nCameron gives nice detailed answers to students questions.--Rich\n\n\nInterested in a lucrative and rewarding position in quantitative finance?  Are you a quantitative professional working in finance or a technical field and want to bridge the gap and become a full on quant?  Then read on.\nThe role of a quantitative analyst in an investment bank, hedge fund, or financial company is an attractive career option for many quantitatively skilled professionals working in finance or other fields like data science, technology or engineering.  If this describes you, what you need to move to the next level is a gateway to the quantitative finance knowledge required for this role that builds on the technical foundations you have already mastered.\n\n\nThis course is designed to be exactly such a gateway into the quant world.  If you succeed in this course you will become a master of quantitative finance and the financial engineering of the most influential class of financial products that exist on markets today: derivatives.\n\n\nAbout the instructor:\nThis course was created by a mathematician and financial quant holding a Ph.D. from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, and who earned his quant chops on Wall Street after an accomplished career as a theoretical materials scientist.\n\n\nThe focus of the course is thus very much on the practical skills someone working in the trenches in the real world of finance needs to have.  But since the course author also has 10 years of college teaching experience, it is taught with an eye to sound course structure and sensitivity to the concerns of students.\n\n\nWhat you will learn:\nMany finance students and professionals find derivatives the most challenging subject in their field.  But if you have a background in quantitative fields like statistics or computer science this course will show you that these most daunting of financial products are completely accessible to you.\n\n\nEven if you are completely new to the world of finance, after completing this course you will have a deep mastery of the fundamental derivative structures traded on markets today: forwards, futures, swaps, and options.  But since this course is presented by a practitioner you will also learn how derivatives are actually used in the real world, as tools for both speculation and risk management.\n\n\nThe world of finance and markets is fast-paced and exciting, but can also be very intimidating.  In the heat of the moment, the markets are volatile and unpredictable, positions go south in unanticipated ways, you have traders yelling at you, you have computer software failing, you're relying on data you can't trust.  Keeping your head above water in this environment can be well nigh impossible.\n\n\nYou need a conceptual framework that allows you to keep above the fray and keep your wits about you.  In this course, my primary purpose is to convey that conceptual framework to my students.  The same conceptual framework that allowed me to survive and thrive in the pits of Wall Street during the dark days of the financial crisis.\n\n\nConcerned that you may not have the required background to succeed in this course?  As long as you meet the formal prerequisites you need not be.  A quantitatively strong business background is more than enough to meet these requirements.  Any decent course in statistics and the basics of calculus is enough.  In truth, high school mathematics is all that is needed for 80-90% of the course material.  The most important requirement is simply to think analytically and logically.\n\n\nHere is a sampling of some of the main topics that we'll cover on your journey into the quant profession:\nInterest rate fundamentals\nPeriodic and continuous compounding\nDiscounted cash flow analysis\nBond analysis\nThe fundamentals of equity, currency, and commodity assets\nPortfolio modelling\nLong and short positions\nThe principle of arbitrage\nThe Law of One Price\nForwards, futures, and swaps\nRisk management principles\nFutures hedging\nStochastic processes\nTime series concepts\nThe real statistics of asset prices: volatility clustering and autocorrelation\nFat-tailed distribution and their importance for financial assets\nBrownian motion\nThe log-normal model of asset prices\nOptions\nPut-call parity\nThe binomial model of option pricing\nThe Black-Scholes theory and formula\nOption greeks: delta, gamma, and vega\nDynamic hedging\nVolatility trading\nImplied volatility\nIncludes Python tools\nPython based tools are now included for computations with bonds, yield curves, and options.  All software that is part of this course is released under a permissive MIT license, so students are free to take these tools with them and use them in their future careers, include them in their own projects, whether open source or proprietary, anything you want!\n\n\nSo Sign Up Now!\nAccelerate your finance career by taking this course, and advancing into quantitative finance.  With 23 hours of lectures and supplemental course materials including 10 problem sets and solutions, the course content is equivalent to a full semester college course, available for a fraction of that price, not to mention a 30 day money back guarantee.  You can't go wrong!",

This puts them at risk later, much like a pilot would experience flying in bad weather without the benefit of instruments.  This class is designed to teach you how to trade options correctly. After learning about Delta, Gamma, Theta & Vega, you will be able to put on great trades. You will be able to easily adjust trades that are not working as expected (option repairs). You will be able to understand whether remaining in the trade is good or bad based on the time decay (theta) experienced daily. What could be better than learning how to avoid losses and maximize profits?\nThe delta of an option will also tell you how likely (statistically) an option is to being in-the-money. In other words, the options market gives you the answers to all of the questions you could possible ask. If a stock is at $50/share. Then you can with the click of a mouse find out how probable it is that the stock would be at 45/share, 50/share or 55/share over the next month! When I first learned what the professional traders know it blew my mind! When taking an option position or setting up an options strategy, there will be risk and reward from the following factors:\nPrice change (delta)\nChanges in volatility (vega)\nTime decay (theta)",

A more correct terminology would be 'Market Mechanics Methodology'.\n\n\nLearning to use Market Profile and TPOs teaches you how to properly understand and interpret intraday institutional order flow.\n\n\nWhen coupled with pure price action patterns and supply/demand on larger timeframes, it is one of the clearest and most robust straightforward ways to confidently read day-to-day market sentiment.\n\n\nI am the first trader to create a fully systematic approach using these concepts together systematically.\n\n\nThe entire approach of my method and style of trading is explained step by step in my comprehensive, detailed Professional Development Program on the main Market Stalkers website (search Market Stalkers on google).\n\n\nThere is a very good reason why Market Profile remains the most commonly used tool of professional prop traders worldwide.\n\n\nThis is a no-nonsense crash course in using Market Profile with a clear and concise approach. I focus on market profile aspects that are relevant for todays markets.\n\n\nNo equations or complicated calculus. No wallpapering you with any and every profile technique under the sun.\n\n\nStraight to the point - improve your understanding of the relationship between TPOs and Value Areas.\n\n\nFind out which day types and setups have the highest odds of working out. Suitable for any liquid products including commodities (crude oil, gold, silver), forex markets, equity indices and individual stocks.\n\n\nLearn once and for all how to use professional analysis tools of volume and price. Raise confidence in your setups. Eliminate fear and doubt.\n\n\nTo move forward with your trading skills, enroll in the course today.\n\n\nSee you on the inside!",

      "description": "In this course, you will learn how to fully automate your trading using MetaTrader 5 trading robots (expert advisors). We will code an expert advisor from scratch that can trade in different financial markets, such as forex, cryptocurrencies, indices, commodities, and stocks.\nThe course is organized into 2 blocks and 12 sections.\n\n\nBLOCK 1: MQL5 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE\nIn section 1, we will review the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform and introduce the MQL5 programming language and its applications.\nIn sections 2 to 5, we will cover the fundamentals of the MQL5 language. In these sections, we will address all the basic features of the language, with plenty of examples and exercises closely related to trading.\nThis way, the course will offer you practical, engaging, and interesting content while being concise to fast-track you to the most exciting part, sections 6 to 12.\n\n\nBLOCK 2: METATRADER 5 EXPERT ADVISOR  CODING\nThis block begins with section 6, where we will introduce you to expert advisors and share a widely known trading system that has been extensively used in the past.\nIn sections 7 to 11, we will apply all the knowledge acquired in previous lessons to code a trading robot that automates a trading system and trades uninterrupted as long as the markets are open.\nWe will equip our expert advisor with a structure that serves as a framework for other projects, including triggers for entry and exit points.\nAdditionally, we will include basic aspects of position management, such as placing stop loss and take profit orders, as well as more advanced management like trailing stop loss and break-even.\nFinally, in section 12, we will validate the system. To do this, we will subject the expert advisor to backtesting against historical data to ensure the code is correct.\nUltimately, we will deploy it in forex, stocks, indices, and commodities markets in a trading account. This will allow us to validate that the robot works both in a trading account and in simulation.\n\n\n\n\nNow is the right time to learn algorithmic trading.\nIn today’s modern markets, the share of algorithmic trading in volume terms stands around 70-80 per cent, and there are several reasons for that:\nAlgorithmic trading allows you to trade as many strategies or markets as your computing power provides, overcoming human limitations that constrain manual traders.\nAutomating your strategies frees up time from repetitive screening of the markets that you can then allocate to research, leisure, or other activities. Furthermore, robots can trade 24/7 which mean they can trade any session, at any time and without rest, which is impossible to do for a single human.\nEmotionless and error-free. Algorithms read patterns and apply pre-established coded rules without experiencing fear or any other emotions, which means that robots do not commit mistakes, programmers do.\nAlgorithmic trading will not only automate your trading, but also it is the first step to trade like a quant, which means that every decision you take will be backed by data and statistics that will be provided by your algorithms and this will increase your chances of success in the markets.\nBacktesting and optimization is much faster and comprehensive through algorithms than through manual means with spreadsheets, which will allows you to know the performance of a strategy in the past and, again, increase your chances of success in the markets.\nAre you passionate about trading?\nDo you want to free-up time from monitoring screens?\nDo you want to increase your chances of winning in the markets?\nIf the answer is \"Yes\", and you are ready to put in the hard work, you are ready to start your algorithmic trading journey today!\nThis course is backed by Udemy’s 30 day money back guarantee.\nIf you're not happy for any reason you will be refunded in full!\nI am confident that you will find this is one of the best courses to learn algorithmic trading and it delivers sharing insights that you won’t find easily elsewhere.\nI am excited to watch you take your first step in your algorithmic trading journey and I hope to see you inside!\nThe expert advisor will be provided to you at the end of the course.\n\n\n- José Martínez",

      "description": "Course updated in June 2025!\nWhat do you use to understand Financial Markets? Are you adding indicators over indicators and you end up more confused than before?\nWhat if I told you that you can analyze the markets with just one indicator?\nWhat if I told you that you can turn one of the most complex indicators into a powerful and easy-to-use weapon to make money trading Financial Markets?\nWelcome to Advanced Forex Trading - Ichimoku Trading Strategy Explained.\nMy ultimate goal for this course is not to teach you another indicator that you can have on your chart. My goal is to provide you with a logical strategy that you can apply to trade the markets with confidence.\nTo achieve this goal, we first need to have a look at the Ichimoku Indicator. We will start with an introduction in order to familiarize with the complete indicator, then I will dedicate 4 entire Sections and 12 entire lectures to each component of the Ichimoku.\nYou will not find a pre-packed set of rules to apply blindly, you will understand any single component of the Ichimoku, you will learn any single formula and the reasons why we trade it in a certain way. This allows you to understand when and how to use the Ichimoku Indicator, being able to differentiate between different market scenarios, finding the best opportunities to trade and make money trading the Forex Market.\nSection 8 is entirely dedicated to Forex Market analysis using the whole indicator, so you can start to familiarize with all the techniques and methods that we have studied in the previous sections.\nAfter that, we will have another important part of the strategy: Risk Management.\nIf you had the chance to enroll in one of my other courses, you know that I like to keep things real. A strategy that helps only to analyze the market, without having a deep focus on Stop Loss and Take Profit, is not a complete strategy for me. So, my promise is to give you a complete strategy with a whole Section about Entry and Exit points, in order to understand how to open and manage your trades.\nAs usual, when I publish a new course, I also open a new Live Forex Trading Account with real money to publish live trades in the course and update the results with the strategy. In addition, in the live trading section, you will also find info about all the Brokers that I use or have used in the past, so you will have my personal feedback for each one in case you want to create a new account to trade the Forex Market.\nAlmost all the examples provided in the course are about Forex Trading, but I am confident that you will find the material very useful for other Financial Markets, like Stock Trading, Cryptocurrency Trading and many others.\nWhat else in this course?\nYou will learn from my 11+ years of experience.\nYou have unlimited lifetime access at no extra costs.\nYou can always ask for help, my support is well known in Udemy.\n\nI like to say to my students that signing up for this course is like signing up for a gym membership. You have all the equipment, all the machines and a personal trainer ready to help you, but if you stay home, eating chips and watching television, you are not going to see any result, right? So, take your first step. Enroll in the course and let's start this journey together.\nSee you at the top :)",

      "description": "Options are derivative instruments that are widely used in the financial markets due to their versatility and range of strategies that can be implemented whether on their own or in combination with other options and/or stock.\nOptions can be used to achieve different goals, some of which can only be implemented with options or options strategies due to their characteristics and special properties. Here are some of the practical uses for Options Strategies:\n• Protection: Limiting the risk of large losses on existing assets (buying a Put, buying a Put Spread, etc)\n• Speculation: Profiting from an underlying's bullish or bearish price action (buying a Call, buying a Put, etc.)\n• Income generation on existing positions: Managing risk on existing positions to generate an income stream based on Options Positions (Covered Call, etc.)\n• Leverage: Controlling a position worth a large notional amount with only a fraction of the required capital (buying a Call, buying a Call Spread, etc.)\n• Diversification: Diversifying a portfolio's components using Options and their inherent low capital requirement (buying calls on Indices/ETFs , buying Puts on Indices/ETFs, etc)\n• Flexibility in their use as Strategic Instruments: Profiting from changes in Implied Volatility, from the passage of time or from the magnitude of a price move regardless of its upward or downward direction (selling a Straddle, selling an Iron Butterfly, etc.)\nIn this course you will learn all you need to know about Options Trading, analysis, evaluation, strategy design, maintenance and monitoring as part of a Portfolio\nIt doesn't matter how extensive your existing knowledge of Options or Financial Markets is.

We will primarily use visual and graphical material to help make complex concepts easier to understand. This is often an initial hurdle on your path towards efficient use and mastery of Options trading and we will make sure that nothing stands on your way to efficiently and profitably trading options.\nAs part of a balanced approach among concepts, theory and practice we will use the paperMoney by thinkorswim Options Trading platform, with information accessed directly from US Financial Markets. Detailed instructions on how to gain access this platform and also how to create a demo account will be provided as part of your course. With this, you will be able to follow all the explanations and transactions on the platform along with us using real market data.\nFinally, as part of an ongoing process to ensure that you get the most out of this course and that you are ready to either start your options trading journey or take your options trading to the next level, you will be asked to take a quiz after each section. You will then be able to know which options concepts and techniques you have mastered and which areas need further attention and reinforcement, for which you will be taken directly to the lecture where this material can be reviewed.\n*********** Course Summary ***********\n1.

Which is this course all about.\n\n\nWhat our existing students said about this course:\n\n\"Brilliant course taught by an experienced professional trader. This course helped me to understand how to trade candle stick the right way in order to be a profitable trader. Also very helpful and answers question almost immediately\"  - Dave\n\"Very good explanation of the most common Japanese candlestick reversal patterns found on the FX market. I especially liked that Syed explains the patterns, and then takes it a step further to explain entry, stop loss and take profit of each pattern. Well done! I'll recommend this course first, and then follow up with Syed's other course on swing trading - both really good courses.\"   - Peter Efland\n\"This is a very engaging course. My perception has changed a bit after i watched the lectures. Now I feel that i need to change my trading method, which i was using before taking this course. I found some very useful information on trading the candle sticks. The speech and delivery is great. Highly recommended\"  - Fred William\n\n\n\n\nThis is a mastery course for both the beginner and advanced - FOREX and Stock market traders, who wants to increase their potentiality by analyzing the price action chart to earn consistent profit from their trades.\nBuild - a strong foundation on 4 of the world’s most traded and strongest trend reversal candlestick patterns, that is being the first choice to get trade signal - to most of the large banks, financial institutions and professional traders in the Forex and stock exchange markets.\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to make successful trade entries with –\nPin Bar candlestick pattern.\nEngulfing candlestick pattern.\nInside bar candlestick pattern.\nPiercing line candlestick pattern.\n\n\nWait!  - You already know what these candlesticks are and how to trade these patterns? Are you sure that you are making consistent profit from these 4 candlestick patterns?\n\nIf so - then perhaps this course is not for you. But if you are not consistently making profit from the Forex and stock market with these 4 world’s most traded and strongest trend reversal candlestick patterns, then perhaps you should change your trading plan. But don’t worry, you are at the right place to learn how to crack down these 4 candlestick patterns to successfully trade the Forex and stocks.\n\n\nYou don’t need to learn and trade 100 candlesticks to earn consistent profit from the market, you need jus 4!\nIf you trade every single time you see a strong trend reversal candlestick pattern, then you are already dead in the long run!\nYou see, when I or you get the first education about forex trading or stock market trading, then it is taught to us that technical analysis and fundamental analysis is the main analysis method of Forex and stock trading. Among which technical analysis is the most Simple and convenient trading method for the general traders like me and you. Because for fundamental analysis, it requires a good knowledge of collecting and analyzing the financial data from various sources, which is quite difficult enough for the individual traders like us.\n\n\nJapanese Candlestick Chart\nSo, for technical analysis, the Japanese Candlestick Chart is the most popular chart among all the price action charts. In Japanese candlestick chart, each and every single bar is called as candle, candlestick or candlestick pattern. Every single candlestick pattern represents trader’s action or trader’s sentiment for a specific timeframe in a price action chart. You will find thousands of different types of candlestick patterns in a price action chart. Where each and every candle represents the market sentiment, either it’s a forex chart or stock chart.\n\n\nYou don't need em all !\nNow, should you learn all of these candles? No. not at all. Only a few handful candlesticks are there on the chart - which frequently tend to form at the supply and demand zones of the forex and stock market. And after their formation, price tend to change its direction and hence swing points formed in a price action chart. These swing points are the area where we should find the strongest trend reversal candlestick patterns to enter for a trade.\nTherefore learning the structure of a candlestick pattern is not what you need most to get success in forex trading or stock trading, rather learning when and where a candlestick pattern forms hold the significance of trading at a candlestick pattern. Reading the overall market sentiment with a trend reversal pattern is more important to make any decision to trade the forex and stocks.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nSo in this course, you will learn 4 of the strongest trend reversal candlestick patterns to make successful trades by the help of most probable and profitable candlestick trading strategies which are the Pin bar trading strategy, Engulfing trading strategy, Inside bar trading strategy, the Piercing line trading strategy and the Dark cloud cover trading strategy (Dark cloud cover is the bearish pattern of piercing line candlestick pattern).\nThis course covers all the necessary details about trading the forex and stock with these 4 strongest trend reversal candlestick patterns. Which includes-\nDetecting the valid formation and structure of these 4 strongest trend reversal candlestick patterns.\nAbility to read the market sentiment with these candlestick pattern.\nMost profitable method to place trade entries at the right position of the market.\nSetting the stop loss for capital safety, if somehow the market goes against your trade. Which is a normal thing in trading forex and stocks.\nTargeting the most probable profit level using the appropriate risk and reward ratio model.\nFiltering the invalid trade entry position, since not every time you can trigger a trade, no matter how strong the candlestick pattern look like based on their structure. You should avoid making trades in invalid positions on the chart of forex and stock.\nAbility to detect if the candlestick pattern is really going to act as a trend reversal pattern or a trend continuation pattern. Sometimes a trend reversal candlestick pattern act as a trend continuation pattern, which is very much necessary to detect as a price action trader to trading forex and stocks.\nAnd some other relevant things to master the world’s most traded and strongest trend reversal candlestick patterns to trade the forex and stock successfully - to turn yourself a consistent trade winner in forex trading and stock trading.\n\n\nTimeframe independency\nThese Candles can be traded in all the time frames. These candlestick patterns will work almost in every time frames, but mostly in higher time frames like 1 hour charts, 4 hour charts, Daily charts, or weekly - monthly charts. Even scalping strategies can be made with these candlestick patterns. No matter which timeframe or strategy you follow to trade the forex and stocks with these candlestick patterns, always try to find out these patterns at the right position of the market.\n\n\nIndicator free clean charts\nNo indicator has been used in this course. It’s a mastery course of pure price action based trading strategy. In this course, no indicators has been used to trading forex and stocks. This course is based on only candlestick based technical analysis. This course made Forex trading and stock trading so easy that if someone follow all of the rules taught in this course, has higher chance of getting consistent profit from the market.\nIf a trader master him/ herself of these 4 candlestick patterns - including the different candlestick structure, traders sentiment on different market conditions, valid and invalid trade entry positions, and the ability to identify the trend reversal pattern to trend continuation pattern of these 4 candlestick patterns, then they will be able to stay in the market for long time and make consistent profit from the FOREX and Stock market as well. They will qualify to read the market sentiment and hence make consistent profit as a professional trader.\n\"Master the Profitable Reversal Candlestick Patterns - Forex & Stock\" is a must take course for the traders - who wants to increase their potentiality of maximizing the number of winning trades, and minimize the number of losing trades in FOREX and Stock market trading - with the world’s most traded and strongest trend reversal candlestick patterns.\n.",

      "description": "Before I start off with the details of the course and how it will enable to achieve your speculative and financial endeavors, below is a list of few of the big moves that I have caught, live in front of thousands of my students over the years:\n2022: LUNA Cryptocurrency Crash: Caught precisely at the turning point. (Watch free preview in Module 10: Case Studies)\n\n\n2016 - 2021: On SPX: In June 2016, while recording lectures for this course I used live charts of SPX and forecasted upside movement from 2100 level, with extended target of 4169, which was achieved in April, 2021. (Watch free preview in Module 9: Predicting the future)\n\n\n2017 - 2020: On GOLD: In Feb. 2017 when GOLD was trading around $1250, I made a public forecast of the upcoming bull trend with targets of 2000 plus, after 3 years in August, 2020 the market achieved the upside target. (Watch free preview in Module 10: Case Studies)\n\n\n2018: On BITCOIN: When BTCUSD was trading around 6200 level in October, my analysis suggested possibility of move down till 3000 level. By December 2018, BTC had given a strong fall and reversed around 3122 level as per analysis.\n\n\n2019: Multiple short-term moves captured on Crude Oil, Gold, Silver, BTC, EURUSD SPX, Nifty, NYSE Stocks, NSE Stocks in the Monthly webinar series called, “Applied Elliott Wave Webinars.”\n\n\n2020: On CRUDE OIL: In the webinar conducted on 22nd March, 2020; I discussed the possibility of possible Negative prices in Crude as per my analysis with a possible target as low as -59$, it was relegated as at that time negative prices were not allowed.\n\n\nHowever, in April, 2020, CME Group announced that they will allow Negative Price Trading. And what later transpired was something in a league of its own, as Crude Oil achieved the Negative Price level of -37.63$. It is worth noting here that I was ofcourse not aware that CME was going to allow Negative Price trading beforehand, and neither was I aware that the market will go so very close to the Hypothetical and previously impossible negative target of -59$.\n\n\nAll combined till 2023: Till date, out of the 241 Analysis published publicly, 206 have played out as per analysis, making the accuracy of my analysis and forecasts stand at 85.48% for 6 consecutive years.\n\n\nIt is worth noting here that in the forecasting industry where even an accuracy of even 60% in a year is considered high, I have achieved and maintained 80% plus track record.\nThat too in a way that is publicly verifiable by anyone, as all webinars are public and the Track record sheet containing links of all the webinars is available in: Section 1 - Lecture 2, accessible to everyone without even enrolling in the course.\n_______________________________________________\n\n\nWhat have I achieved and what you can?\nBefore you go ahead and read more about the course and what's special about it, I would like to bring your attention towards 'Sections 12: Victories of a Day.\"\nIn this section I have discussed a single trading session, where I made 120% PROFITS trading Intraday.\nWhile this is not the highest percentage return I have made in a day, but the overall huge number or trades in this single session (1995) and the twists and turns present a unique learning opportunity and hence I have chosen it.\nThis section cements the fact, that you are learning from an actual trader and also allows me with an opportunity to show off, what I have achieved and what awaits you, should you choose to master the concepts presented here.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nMy extreme emphasis on Credibility and Track Record\nPopular brokers and independent researchers claim the number of successful traders to be anywhere b/w 5% to 3% of the total number of participants.\nIn this extremely difficulty business, it become even more important that I’m upfront about my own credibility.\nI firmly believe that real credibility can only be known from something that is done in public eyes. And can be checked by anyone at any point in time, while in the past I have shared yearly Broker statements of P&L via Private webinars, those are never made public as they contain sensitive personal information.\nHence you see my emphasis and highlight of the 6-year consecutive Track Record sheet.\nIt is the first thing I have talked in the course as well as here in the Course Description.\n_______________________________________________\nYour responsibility as a learner\nIf you learn trading from someone, who does not know how to trade themselves, you will come out to be an even bigger looser.\nHence, it is your responsibility to check the credibility and verify the records before learning from me or from anyone else.\nJust remember, it is your money on the line.\nNow that I have said, what I wanted to, lets discuss what is this course all about and what you are going to learn here.\n_______________________________________________\nWhat is this course about?\nThis course is about the practical application of Elliott Wave Theory, developed by Sir Ralph Nelson Elliott, according to which the prices in the stock market reflect the crowd psychology of humans, which being repetitive forms patterns. These patterns being recognizable on the chart give us predictive power.\nIn this course you will learn all about these patterns from the point of application in Day Trading, Swing Trading and Investment, also you will see how we can use the concept of Fibonacci Ratios and the concept of Channeling along with some other concepts to add more predictive power to our analysis.\n_______________________________________________\nWho are you learning from?\nHello, this is your instructor, Neerav Yadav, founder of 50 Eyes Market Analysis.\nI’m primarily a trader who started trading in Crude Oil Futures. In my progression as a trader, I have traded and tracked all major markets, including but not limited to:\n\n\nIndices: SPX, DAX, NDX, DOW, NIFTY among others.\nCommodities: Gold, Silver, Copper, Natural Gas and Crude Oil.\nForex Pairs: EURUSD, EURCAD, USDJPY, USDCHF and other major pairs.\nCryptocurrencies: BTC, Ethereum, Luna, Ripple among others.\nStocks listed on: NYSE (US Stock Market), NSE (Indian Stock Market) and MOEX (Russian Stock Market).\nApart from this, over the last 7+ years I have also worked personally with a great variety of Institution as well as trader. Including Dubai based Hedge Fund, retail traders who entered markets during Bitcoins massive bull runs, as well as Prop. Traders managing multimillion dollar portfolios.\n_______________________________________________\nWhat is special about this course?\nOther than trading and training other traders over the years, I have also been conducting my own Private Research, on how to easily spot patterns in live market and simplify and analyze complex scenarios.\n\n\nPragmatic Approach: This is a PRACTICAL COURSE (on Elliott Wave Principles), that is I have explained all the concepts on live charts rather than a meaningless slide shows.\n\n\nYour trading style included: I have included various case scenarios throughout the course, some chart discussions depict Intraday Trade analysis, some depict Swing Case scenario while others discuss long term prospects from an Investors point of view.\n\n\nSystematic breakdown: Throughout the course I have discussed the basic thought process in a systematic manner so that viewers can understand the complete application part.\n\n\nIn Section 7: Step by Step Deduction you will find the mention of the concept of Point of Reference, a concept that I first coined and introduced when I was on my quest to make complex Elliott Wave structures simple.\n\n\nIn Section 10, 11 and 12: I have shared some of the techniques that I have developed for spotting trades early on.\n\n\nSpecifically in Section 12: “Victories of a day - 120% profits from a single day’s scalps”, which I consider the most important and most practical part of the course, I have shared my methods to spot strength and weakness as well as the psychological limitations and how to overcome them in live trading environment.\nI would like to make it very clear that, the Private Research I have shared here is only a small fraction of the complete body of work, however it is ample enough to speed up your trading journey by 2 years, if not more.\n_______________________________________________\nFinal words\nWith all that being said, do note that Elliott Wave is no easy subject matter.\nWhile I have done everything possible to simplify the concepts, it is required that you go through the course atleast 3 times or more to be able to make the most out of it.\nRemember that everytime you repeat the course, your knowledge will build up and you will discover new things.\nOfcourse, after learning the contents here, a proper practice routine will be required to sterilize the knowledge.\nFor that you can refer to the second last lecture of Section 12, where I have shared how my routine which allowed me to practice and apply Elliott Wave for 20,000+ hours and how you can achieve the same.",

      "description": "OPTIONS TRADING THREE COURSE BUNDLE - 10+ HOURS\nThis Options Trading Bundle is the ultimate Beginner's course on Options Trading, Options fundamentals and Concepts as well as Live Options trading examples. The first 3 Options Trading Strategies courses are combined to create this bundle. To master the basics of Options, you really need all three courses.\nA brief synopsis of the options trading strategies courses are provided below.\nLEARN CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS, OPTIONS FOUNDATION - TIME DECAY, IMPLIED VOLATILITY, OPTION GREEKS  BUYING CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS - LIVE TRADES\nSECTION I -  Call Options\nMost people learning Options for the first time face too much jargon and complex language. This options trading strategies course use real-world examples (buying a house) to explain how a Call Option (Section 1) works in real life. This example should make it absolutely clear what a Call Option is in step-by-step details.\nSECTION II - Put Options.\nThe Put Option is the ultimate \"protector\" of your portfolio, and in this course you can learn how Put Options work. It is the exact opposite of a Call Option. Put Options increase in value when the value of a stock or index drops in price. We define what a Put Option, and just like we did in the Call Option, we consider a real-world example of a Put Option.\nSECTION III - Stock and Options combo strategies\nIn this section, three creative strategies are outlined for Stock investors to combine Options into their portfolio strategies.\n·  Use Options to buy Stock at prices that are far lower than what the stock is currently trading for\n·  Use Options to sell Stock at prices that are far higher than what it is currently trading for\n·  Use Options to hedge a Stock position that you already own\nSECTION IV - TIME DECAY\nTime decay is a pivotal component of Options strategies. In fact, time decay alone is responsible for the majority of advanced option strategies. In this part of the options trading strategies course, we are going to study the concept in detail. Options are \"wasting\" assets, and they lose value every day. The buyer gets hurt from time decay and the seller benefits from it. And time decay becomes more exponential as we approach expiry of an Option. It is also the great equalizer between the profiles of a buyer and seller of Options. Time decay is the great equalizer in the risk / reward profiles of buyers and sellers of Options. Several intermediate and advanced strategies are based on selling premium (option sellers) and these positions make a profit due to time decay in the value of these options over a period of time.\nSECTION V - IMPLIED VOLATILITY\nImplied Volatility is the \"wildcard\" in Option prices. Ignore it, and you will pay a price. In fact, it's so important we have at least four different varieties - Volatility, Implied Volatility, Historical Volatility, and Future or Expected Volatility. We use the real-world examples to explain the concept of Volatility in simple terms. Then we study how Volatility is quantified in Stocks and Options. And how Volatility finds a back-door to embed itself into Option prices. Implied Volatility considerations are critical when choosing between a buyer and seller profile. We break this complex topic down into simple terms and show you an example of NFLX and CAT options that should make it absolutely clear what this is all about.\nSECTION VI - OPTION GREEKS, DELTA, GAMMA, VEGA, THETA\nIf you're the pilot of an aircraft, the Greeks are your instrument panel. If you don't manage your instrument panel properly, well...you get the picture. Understanding the Greeks are absolutely critical to every Option position. We break this course into easy to understand chapters for all the four Greeks - Delta, the king of all Greeks. Gamma - the silent operator. Theta - every Option seller's dream. And Vega - Watch out for this one.. Most beginners to Options tend to ignore the Greeks. Master the Greeks and you'll shave off months of learning curve. Not to mention, you can then fly your aircraft on \"auto-pilot\" (with help from the Greeks).\nSECTION VII - OPTIONS MARKET STRUCTURE\nThe Options market has a number of terms that we need to be aware of. Starting with terminology differences like \"Long\" and \"Short\", we look at all the details that go into the Options market. We explain the important processes like Exercise and Assignment, as well as things like Expiry series, Bid-Ask spreads, Brokerage and transaction costs and various other details. What is Open Interest and why is it important, and what is the role of a Market Maker. We study the different Order types and which ones are important for the average investor, and which ones make sense in different situations. We also discuss Regulation T Margin as it applies to Options as well as Portfolio margin.\nSECTION VIII - BUY A CALL OPTION (CHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL)\nBuying a Call Option is the most basic of all the Option strategies and is the most efficient strategy to optimize a bullish outlook on a stock. In this options trading strategies course, we take the example of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and show how the trade played out. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and \"moneyness\" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. This is a real trade and over 15 days, and we navigate the trade to its exit point.\nSECTION IX - BUYING A PUT OPTION (FXE EURO ETF)\nBuying a Put Option serves two purposes - exploit a bearish move in the stock or be the ultimate protector of your stock. In this part of the course, we take the example of the Euro ETF (FXE) and show how the trade played out in about 25 days time. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and \"moneyness\" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. We show you how to \"let your winners run\" in a controlled manner.\nSECTION X - STRATEGY AND OPTIMIZATION\nThe Option strategy optimization course brings all the 4 Options strategies together. The 4 strategies are comprised of 2 bullish and 2 bearish strategies, but how and when should we choose a particular strategy over the other. We create a helpful \"4 strategies box\" to distinguish and connect one strategy to the other. Most importantly, what are all the considerations before we choose a strategy. Our choice of strategy depends not only on what the stock is currently doing, but also on various market externalities as well as a few key Option metrics like Implied Volatility. This course also provides a sneak peek into advanced Option topics like the VIX (Fear index\"), trade simulation as well as trade adjustment parameters.\nSECTION XII - SINGLE OPTION ADJUSTMENTS\nThis options trading strategies course studies the need for Option adjustments, and why adjustments are as critical to the success of your position as good entry or analysis. We consider all the four basic strategies - the Long Call, Short Call, Long Put, and the Short Put and look at various adjustments to these positions if they get into trouble. Every investor has a \"pain point\" - this is the point at which they adjust their position. Applying a rigorous approach to this pain point enables investors to control risk while maximizing the opportunity to profit. The course also discusses various details like early adjustments, over-adjusting and adjusting profitable trades as well as the importance of the investor's outlook for the stock when considering adjustments.\nThis bundle consists of  Courses\nCourse I - Introduction to Options - Learn about Call Options and Put Options is a detailed step-by-step explanation of Options, Call Options and Put Options with theory and practical application with Apple (AAPL) Options\nCourse II - Options Foundation - Time Decay, Implied Volatility and Options Greeks will complete your theoretical understanding of Options.\nCourse III is Options strategies for Beginners - Buying Call Options and Put Options where we actually put live trades and manage them to their exit points.\n\n\nTake this ultimate Options Trading Strategies course right now and learn options trading.",

We'll go over different portfolios, from basic portfolios to modern portfolios (based on the portfolios of the biggest investment firms in the world). We'll even build a portfolio together and buy it with real money!\nAnd there is so much more.\nSo register now and see you inside the course!",

      "description": "Day trading or scalping is the highest and hardest level in trading. That a trader will analyze and excute a position on a very small timeframe like 1 minute chart, 5 minute chart. With a high speed of chart, you need to analyze very quickly, exactly to give out a decision. That's a really challenge and requires traders to master trading system, psychology control, risk management in a high level  to trade well\n\nThe market structure rules, key level & smart money concepts zones are simplified to trade effectively on this course.\nScalping = quick and correctly decisions\nIf you have to consider too many times, you will miss the chances or lose that deal\n\nDay trading is a big dream with any traders even newbie or experience on finance market\nIt brings you headache, stressful even you pay attention to learn a lot about trading strategies on the internet or different traders\n\nProblem is :\nYou didn't have the right trading mindset before trading\nYou didn't have the right trading strategy for scalping or day trading\nYou didn't know how to control risk management\nYou didn't know how to practice, just hard working is not the core to be successful in this career\nI achieved TOP 1% traders of trading competition by England funds - CTI  on 2022 by day-trading. Compeittion is harder a lot than trading live in a normal day. Because I had thousands of competitors who are increasing profit every minutes. I have to earn and push my rank as much as I can. You can see my review after competition on my Youtube channel. That's why day traders will have more advantages.\n\nIn the real trading, I even combine day trading (scalping) with swing styles to optimize my trading time. I don't need to wait for a long time to have a position. If I saw a chance with scalping system, I will join a short chance defintly.\n\nWhen you're learning and practicing, you can leave any your question on QA part of Udemy. Jayce will reply and help you within 12 hours\n\nOn this course, I also updated MARKET STRUCTURE RULES and 10 assginments with detailed explanation to help you to analyze market structure, zone more exactly.

Depth explanation. These knowledge helped me a lot - I passed challenge and verification last week. If possible, I hope to see you sharing combine SMC and Key level together \"\n\" All of Jaycee's course are very very good. There isn't a lot of other teachers who understand volume, price action, and smart money like him. He is a brilliant trader and I strongly recommend his courses. I would also like to address some of the negative comments I have seen about Jayce’s English. In my opinion his English is fine. But if you have issues understanding anything the closed captions are 100% accurate. I have taken over 40 Udemy courses about trading and almost all have been by non English native speakers. You will miss out on a lot of good information if you don’t try and understand. \"\n\" Amazing theory. Your courses were built like a learning school. Very detail and easy to absorb. Do you have any Discord / FB group or anything like that to learn more from you? Thanks \"\n\" What a nice course about SMC ! I enrolled both your 2 courses - That is very detail about SMC and Key level Strategy. Full of documents and Exam to absorb the lessons. Love it! \"\n\" 3 hours valuable course - Direct to problem. Not hide any aspects. Quiz and Exam test really useful and full of hard questions. I though I understood all about it before I take the test and realize some problem forgot. Combine with other your course really nice to trade \"\n\" Nice course with full downloadable contents and Quiz, Practice test with key questions. Useful and easier to absorb new thing. At the first time, I saw this course quite short but, every thing inside of course over my expectation \"\n\nIf you're SERIOUS TRADER who are ready to be DIFFIRENT this year. Let's come with us.\n\nWe will FIGHT TOGETHER for a SUCCESS YEAR",

There are a lot of information circling around about all of these, but there is one thing they all have in common - TONS of money.\nAnd that's why you're here, you want a piece. And I will give it to you.\nThis course is designed to transform a complete newbie into an absolute beast who can make an insane amount of money.

This course is a complete guide for every person who is ready to quit the 9 to 5 and start living it up.\nIf I were to read this description few months ago I would think this instructor is full of s**t. I would. But knowing what I know now, do yourself a favour and don't be like me, don't wait like I did and don't miss any more opportunities. Once I finally took action I made 950% profit on my first trade. Jokes aside.\nThis is THE ONE MOMENT people will talk about in 20 years, explaining how they got rich. They will all say \"Oh yea, I just got lucky and got to know about ICOs quite soon before everybody did and I made a lot of money\". This is going to be that story. Such as today is the \"How I got rich\" story told by people who bought bitcoin soon enough when the price was less than a dollar. Sometimes to stop thinking is the best you can do.\nSo stop thinking about it and do something. There is the money back guarantee, if I am not right, you can always get your money back.\nThis course offers:\nExplanation of what an ICO is and how it works on the blockchain\nWhat are the technicalities every good ICO has to have in order to be successful on the market\nWhat is the Presale, Crowdsale, Hard/Soft Cap, Individual limit, Programmable blockchain and more\nHow to recognise the quality of a project based on the structure, the team, the whitepaper, the Slack or Telegram channels\nHow to catch all the presales and get the best deals, how get whitelisted for such presales and how to perform a full registration. Even how to pool with friends.\nWhat never do so you don't lose your assets\nScreen-sharing videos on how to set up your own ether wallet on MyEtherWallet, how to understand all the features the site offers such as Transactions of ETH or Tokens, such as Etherscan page where you can track every transaction ever made, how to set up another wallet that offers extra features such as Metamask, the chrome plugin\nWhat is the Trezor hardware wallet and how to use it?\nUnderstanding the json file, the private key the public address, how to set up GWEI and GAS based on the importance of your transaction\nExplanation of the front page of an Exchange Token Site: What are Bids and Asks, what is an Order book, how to place your own order, how to understand the graph, and the Depth chart, what is Volume\nEspecially how to Deposit and Withdraw on such Exchanges\nWe will also look at all the Hot Exchange sites for Tokens such as Huobi, Binance, Kucoin, Idex and more.\nScreen-sharing of all these Exchange sites for better understanding - create and account with me and even TRADE! Everything here!\nThe Mooning and Dumping tendencies explained - how to try to predict them!\nReading the Candlestick chart and trading with support and resistance!\nTrading Strategies for the best results! 3 awesome strategies that worked for me every time!\nTo not only sugarcoat ICO's I've also prepared warnings you need to know in order to always be prepared!\nAnd much much more! Just check it out yourself!\nNow convinced yet?

      "description": "Welcome to the most comprehensive Algorithmic Trading Course. It´s the first 100% Data-driven Trading Course!\n*** Course fully revised and updated in November 2024 with 100+ new or updated Lectures***\n\n\nDid you know that 75% of retail Traders lose money with Day Trading? (some sources say >95%)\nFor me as a Data Scientist and experienced Finance Professional this is not a surprise. Day Traders typically do not know/follow the five fundamental rules of (Day) Trading. This Course covers them all in detail!\n\n\n1. Know and understand the Day Trading Business\nDon´t start Trading if you are not familiar with terms like Bid-Ask Spread, Pips, Leverage, Margin Requirement, Half-Spread Costs, etc.\nPart 1 of this course is all about Day Trading A-Z with the Brokers Oanda, Interactive Brokers, and FXCM. It deeply explains the mechanics, terms, and rules of Day Trading (covering Forex, Stocks, Indices, Commodities, Baskets, and more).\n\n\n2. Use powerful and unique Trading Strategies\nYou need to have a Trading Strategy. Intuition or gut feeling is not a successful strategy in the long run (at least in 99.9% of all cases). Relying on simple Technical Rules doesn´t work either because everyone uses them.\nYou will learn how to develop more complex and unique Trading Strategies with Python. We will combine simple and also more complex Technical Indicators and we will also create Machine Learning- and Deep Learning- powered Strategies. The course covers all required coding skills (Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow) from scratch in a very practical manner.\n3. Test your Strategies before you invest real money (Backtesting / Forward Testing)\nIs your Trading Strategy profitable? You should rigorously test your strategy before 'going live'.\nThis course is the most comprehensive and rigorous Backtesting / Forward Testing course that you can find.\nYou will learn how to apply Vectorized Backtesting techniques, Iterative Backtesting techniques (event-driven), live Testing with play money, and more. And I will explain the difference between Backtesting and Forward Testing and show you what to use when. The backtesting techniques and frameworks covered in the course can be applied to long-term investment strategies as well!\n\n\n4. Take into account Trading Costs - it´s all about Trading Costs!\n\"Trading with zero commissions? Great!\" ... Well, there is still the Bid-Ask-Spread and even if 2 Pips seem to be very low, it isn´t!\nThe course demonstrates that finding profitable Trading Strategies before Trading Costs is simple. It´s way more challenging to find profitable Strategies after Trading Costs! Learn how to include Trading Costs into your Strategy and into Strategy Backtesting / Forward Testing. And most important: Learn how you can control and reduce Trading Costs.\n5. Automate your Trades\nManual Trading is error-prone, time-consuming, and leaves room for emotional decision-making.\nThis course teaches how to implement and automate your Trading Strategies with Python, powerful Broker APIs, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Create your own Trading Bot and fully automate/schedule your trading sessions in the AWS Cloud!\n\n\nFinally... this is more than just a course on automated Day Trading:\nthe techniques and frameworks covered can be applied to long-term investing as well.\nit´s an in-depth Python Course that goes beyond what you can typically see in other courses. Create Software with Python and run it in real-time on a virtual Server (AWS)!\nwe will feed Machine Learning & Deep Learning Algorithms with real-time data and take ML/DL-based actions in real-time!\nWhat are you waiting for? Join now. As always, there is no risk for you as I provide a 30-Days-Money-Back Guarantee!\nThanks and looking forward to seeing you in the Course!",

      "description": "About this Strategy:\nLike all of the strategies I have developed, this one is super simple and even a novice trader can master it with ease.\nI’ll show you how to divide the market into sections which we will use as decision points. Then you simply make the decision – to buy or sell.\nOf course, you can’t – and won’t be right every time, so what happens then? You lose money?\nNo. Not always.\n\n\nI believe traders can learn to manage their way out of most situations by sticking to a simple plan and using logical decision points in the market. Although losses do happen from time to time with this system – as with any system. If done right, they will be controlled, recoverable and few.\nThis strategy has a very high win rate, which most new and struggling traders will find easier to cope with than some traditional strategies.\n\n\nIn the 12 years or so that I've been trading. I learned that it’s very difficult to be right first time, every time. In fact, it’s impossible.\nBut ask yourself, could you be right second time? Or third? The answer is Yes, you can.\nYou see, that’s much easier – and if you can be right EVENTUALLY, then you can usually get out of most trades with a profit, or at breakeven or at a smaller loss than you would have taken.\nThis strategy is a simple yet powerful approach to trading and trade management.\n\n\nIn addition to the content provided here in the course, I also provide extra material and advice via a Discord group. Students are able to post trades and discuss them with myself and each other. We share results and ideas and encourage traders, it's a great environment in which to learn and develop.\n\n\nI look forward to seeing your results soon.",

      "description": "DAY TRADING OR SWING TRADING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS\nA trading plan applicable to futures, stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, or any financial instrument to gain unlimited confidence using price action. An evergreen course to help you become a more realistic trader.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn:\n\n\nHow to acquire the mindset to achieve higher levels of mastery trading futures or any other financial instrument.\nHow to improve your Risk and Money Management Plan.\nHow to upgrade your trading methodology to read correctly price action for identifying the strongest trend in place.\nHow to apply the right skills and tools to increase the probabilities of making winning trades while reducing risk.\nHow to integrate risk control, money management, and price action to have a successful trading business.\n\n\nI have designed this course with the best intention of helping people who want to get involved in the world of trading, but first of all, I need you to understand and accept a survival rule in this business: \"NO ONE KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MARKET, PEOPLE ONLY HAVE SLIGHT IDEAS\". Markets are driven by trends and psychology in the short-term. The truth is no one knows how far the market will go up or down. No trader has ever had complete clarity about the path markets will take over the short-to-intermediate-term. There are far too many variables at play to know what will happen with anything approaching certainty when it comes to market psychology. This is extremely important that you internalize it so that you can positively advance in the process of making profits trading in the financial markets. I hope you accept and agree with that. Let´s move forward.\nThere are two emotions at play when trading the markets; \"FEAR and GREED\". Fear and greed are emotions that powerfully influence a trader's mind. But especially fear is a feeling that becomes an impenetrable barrier for many people who have been bitten by the markets. All human emotions play a huge role in the final outcome of this business endeavor. Greed and fear are powerful enemies not easy to control when there is real money involved. News, colleague’s comments, TV experts, and even family members can supply additional doses of adrenaline that can make you take wrong trading decisions. After a series of bad trades and some money lost you become ill, and this illness is called “Fear of Losing”, what happens next? you are afraid of pulling the trigger to make a new trade again.\nThere are differences between Day Trading and Swing Trading, which are very important to know and can make the difference between living or dying as a trader. Day trading means competing in a world of nanoseconds with supercomputers located near the exchange houses which for a human being is very difficult. High-frequency trading nowadays generates an amount of noise in intraday data that is complex to handle and only very astute traders can compete at this level. If you don't understand how the integration between risk, day trading and swing trading works this will put the odds against you.\nIf a person who aspires to be a trader is not able to control risk efficiently and does not have an edge that allows him to read the price action in the markets, then that person will be condemned to enter a cycle of good and bad trades where generally losses outweigh gains leading this to doom.\n\n\nI have these questions for you:\n1.-What is motivating you to get on this course?\n2.-What do you want to accomplish with this course?\n3.-Where are you today with your trading and where do you want to be?\n4.-What is your biggest problem right now with your trading?\n5.-What happens if the following information answers all your questions regarding your concerns today?\nNow, if you have been trading and constantly have these thoughts inside your mind like:\nI am losing money trading\nI make many bad trades\nI take profits too soon\nI do not know how to maximize my winning trades.\nI let my losers too much time running\nI am afraid to pull the trigger\nI lose a lot of money in each losing trade\nI do not know where to put my stop loss\nI enter the market and immediately it goes against my position\nThe market hit my stop loss all the time\nI do not understand price action\nI do not know what time frame to use\nI do not know how to detect a valid trend\nI do not have a winner trading strategy\nMy technical indicators do not work\nThen please keep reading because in this course ...\n\n\nYou will find a solution that could help you solve the problems and dilemas of trading at both time frames.\n\n\n\"Stay away from herb behavior and trade like a contrary-minded pro!\"\n\n\nIn this course, I am going to talk about day trading in a short time frame and I am also going to compare it with swing trading in a longer time frame. All this with the intention that you can compare them and understand the key details of trading on these time frames.\nThis course is about how to trade (any time frame). When we talk about trading, (\"no long-term investment\"), we are assuming that we are going to buy or sell a financial instrument which we will have in our possession for a short-term (minutes or hours) or medium-term (days or weeks) and then we will close that position depending on the current market condition which favors us or not.\nThe trading method that is explained in this course can be applied to any financial instrument and to any time frame . In this course, I talk about day trading but my method can be applied to swing trading as well. We are looking for a fractal phenomenon which can be spotted in any time frame. Here I use intraday tick data but for the sake of the general public, I have designed my methodology document using a time frame for swing trading. Once you have acquired experience in swing trading you can adapt this method for day trading if that is what you really like.\nHaving said that, I need you to understand that it is practically impossible to forecast market behavior. No one knows what will happen in the next few minutes, days, or weeks. The first thing we must assume to be successful in trading the financial markets is that we do not know what will happen after we take a position, and what we do is a mere bet based on price action analysis. It is crucial that you understand and accept RISK, it as the greatest truth about trading. I this course I will help you to understand a trading model based on \"PRICE ACTION\" and \"RISK CONTROL\".\n\n\nExperience a positive transformation in 30 days if you apply this model.\n\n\nFor trading the markets you need an edge, you must have a trading method with positive expectancy, this is crucial. This method must be consistent with your own personality and comfort level. The approach you use must make you feel comfortable. In this course, I am giving you the tools to find your edge to succeed.\nHow to avoid emotions to trade successfully by yourself? It is very hard to detach a human being from emotions when trading with real money. What you can do is to control or minimize those emotions. The answer to this dilemma is to learn how to control “RISK”.\nOnce you learn how to manage risk you will enter a state of mind that will control emotions and will let you take trading decisions with the best odds of becoming profitable. After a while, you learn that losing is part of the game and when losses are in control then “fear” of losing disappears from your mind and you will begin to trade successfully.\nThis course is set for students that want to learn how to read price action and control risk to build a sustainable trading business.\nStudents will get step by step instructions for optimizing their skills to take high probability trades reducing risk using any time frame (Day Trading or Swing Trading).\n\n\nWith this course, you will solve any problems you have with your trading method, you will set your mind to listen to the market and to act only after the market tells you what to do.\n\n\nThis course foundation is based on endless hours of studying price charts and money management. Risk reduction is the cornerstone of trading the financial markets, if you focus your trading plan on caring for minimizing risk, then profits will take care of themselves.

You can lose more than your initial deposit and stake. Please ensure your chosen method matches your investment objectives, familiarize yourself with the risks involved, and if necessary seek independent advice.\nU.S. Government Required Disclaimer - Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Trading financial instruments of any kind including options, futures, and securities have large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. You must be aware of the risks and be willing to accept them to invest in the options, futures, and stock markets. Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose.\nNFA and CTFC Required Disclaimers: Trading in the Foreign Exchange or Futures market is a challenging opportunity where above-average returns are available for educated and experienced investors who are willing to take above-average risk. However, before deciding to participate in Foreign Exchange (FX) or Futures trading, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.\nHypothetical Performance Disclosure: Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading. for example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.\nAll information on this site is for educational and research purposes only and is not intended to provide financial advice.

But we've been helping students and professionals master Finance and Accounting across Europe for a while now. Here's what our 1:1 Tuition Clients say about us.\nWe're proud of our students, and inspired by these stories - we decided to share them (unedited) with you...\n\"I have had a great experience with Fervent tutor as I was taught more of the content and less memorizing. I think their timings and their work is professional as the tutor seeks the most efficient and productive way to help the student. I studied accounting with the tutor and it contributed greatly to my knowledge for the exam.\"\n- Abdulaziz, BA (Hons), International Management\n\"Fervent goes above and beyond the call of duty. First, they help you get the basics right and then assist you until you get a firm grip of your module. Fervent provides an extremely professional and patient environment. Doesn’t matter how many questions you have or silly you think they are, they encourage all of it. I never would have passed my module rather score a merit in it if it wouldn’t have been for Fervent.\"\n- Shambhavi, MSc, Accounting and Finance\nFervent provides an exceptional service, the whole process from start to finish was very hands on and supportive – during my final year I needed tuition for a governance paper, essentially I was hoping they would do all the work for me but in the long run I got so much more than I bargained for ….they changed my entire thought process and maintained a complete professional reserve. Working with me every step of the way, I was encouraged to think critically in achieving my objective and inspired to dig deep. As a result I produced a 2000 word essay (which I had them proof read as well) worthy of a distinction. Thank you for all the help and most importantly thank you for believing in me.\n- Sean, MSc, Accounting and Finance\nThroughout the period of doing my Master’s dissertation, I felt agonised from not only researching my specific topic but also writing clearly with no any grammatical errors. Fortunately, I found Fervent which offers efficient and comprehensive services. At first, I just expected my dissertation to be improved in terms of grammar; however, Fervent provided me much more than that. All essential aspects such as formatting, structure, logic, consistency of analysis and critique, strength of arguments are also checked and corrected. One thing that I’ve been very grateful is related to my topic details. In addition to pointing out some big mistakes and recommending more accurate and professional alternative solutions, Fervent gave me many more interesting and valuable ideas which helped to develop my content to have stronger arguments and more critical analysis. My tutor’s suggestions helped me become more analytical in my thought process and in producing a better research paper; my critical thinking skills also saw a considerable improvement. Without Fervent’ support, I don’t believe I could have been awarded an excellent grade for this dissertation. Thank you so much for invaluable help over my hard time.\n- Duang MSc, Financial Analysis and Fund Management\nUndoubtedly the gains that I have acquired from the studying with Fervent are plentiful and significantly make me different from what I used to be in terms of my expanded knowledge base, improved English skills (e.g. English-writing), as well as being more confident communicating with English speakers and with the improved ability to think differently and critically for dealing with various types of course works in my study in the university more readily.\nMy tutor is specialized not only in the teaching of Accounting and Finance but also very familiar with the relevant knowledge in the subjects such as Marketing and Management. This is why I trust this person at an initial point along with his kind, friendly and very patient characteristics (e.g. I’m always encouraged by my tutor during the session with him, often to hear: if you really want it and then you can do it and will make it with no doubts).\n“Skilled worker ushers in the gate, leads a pious life depending on individual.” This is a Chinese old saying which I can still remember vividly because it was what my tutor had told me in my  with him and made me believe an excellent learning outcome and a constructive learning process requires the hardworking from both of us. The record shows we did it. This is another reason I like Fervent as in the session with my tutor you see his hardworking as for the preparation for each session and in making the sessions distinctive from cliché-ridden teaching-and-listening classes by exploring the best way and the most suitable set of teaching methods to provide the student with the best value for money.\nJiajian BA (Hons), Business and Management",

      "description": "Unlock the Secrets of Successful Stock Trading and Investing\n[CC] English | Français | Español | Italiano | Korean (auto) | Simplified Chinese (auto)\n\nFeatured as the #1 Online Swing Trading Course by Benzinga, this course is your go-to guide for mastering the art and science of stock trading and investing. Whether you're just starting or looking to sharpen your skills, this program teaches you to trade with confidence using real-world strategies and professional tools.\n\n\nWhat will I learn in this stock trading course?\nHow to read and interpret stock charts using candlestick patterns\nHow to apply technical analysis for timing entries and exits\nHow to manage risk and protect your capital\nHow to use indicators like OBV and moving averages effectively\nHow to trade with discipline and manage emotions\nHow to recognize and trade market trends and consolidation patterns\nWith over 5 hours of step-by-step content, real chart examples, and quizzes, you'll gain the practical skills needed to succeed in any market condition.\n\n\nREAL QUESTIONS. REAL ANSWERS (built for Google AI Overviews)\nWhat is the difference between candlestick, bar, and line charts?\nCandlestick charts provide the most visual and detailed view of price action by displaying the open, high, low, and close for each time period. Each candle shows market sentiment at a glance—green for bullish movement, red for bearish. Bar charts also show the same four data points, but their layout is less intuitive, making it harder to spot patterns quickly. Line charts connect only the closing prices, which simplifies the trend but omits crucial data like intraday highs and lows. For traders, candlestick charts strike the best balance between information and clarity—especially when timing entries and exits.\nWhen is the best time to enter or exit a trade?\nThe best time to enter a trade is when technical signals align—such as a bullish candlestick pattern forming near a support level, combined with rising volume or momentum indicators turning up. Exits should be just as strategic: set a target price based on prior resistance levels, and a stop-loss just below support to manage risk. One effective method is using the risk/reward ratio—only take trades where the potential reward is at least 2–3 times the risk. This not only improves profitability but also filters out weak setups.\nWhat are overbought and oversold conditions in trading?\nOverbought means a stock has risen too far too fast—often due for a pullback. Oversold means it’s dropped excessively and may be ready to bounce. These conditions are usually identified using indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index) or Stochastics. For example, RSI values above 70 often suggest overbought conditions, while values below 30 indicate oversold. However, context matters—a stock can stay overbought during strong uptrends. The key is to combine these signals with support/resistance zones and candlestick confirmation before acting.\nHow do traders use consolidation patterns like rectangles?\nA rectangle pattern forms when price moves sideways between horizontal support and resistance, indicating market indecision. Traders watch for a breakout above resistance or breakdown below support, often confirmed with volume. A breakout signals a potential new trend, and traders enter with a stop just outside the opposite side of the rectangle. These patterns are especially useful for identifying explosive moves after a period of low volatility.\nWhat is a risk/reward ratio, and why is it crucial in trading?\nThe risk/reward ratio measures how much you're risking vs. how much you aim to gain. For example, risking $50 to potentially make $150 offers a 1:3 ratio. Consistently using a positive ratio helps you stay profitable even with a modest win rate. Say you only win 40% of your trades—if each winner gains 3x more than each loser, you'll still come out ahead. This simple concept is often the difference between successful and unsuccessful traders.\nHow do emotions affect trading decisions?\nEmotions like fear, greed, and impatience can cloud judgment. Fear may stop you from entering good trades, while greed might tempt you to ignore your plan and hold too long. Impulsive decisions usually break risk management rules. That’s why disciplined traders use checklists, trading journals, and predefined rules to remove emotion from their decisions. The best traders act like scientists—testing strategies, sticking to data, and avoiding gut reactions.\nWhat is a Hammer candlestick pattern, and how does it signal a potential reversal?\nA Hammer is a single-candle pattern that often signals the end of a downtrend and the start of a possible reversal. It has a small real body near the top of the candle and a long lower wick—typically at least twice the length of the body. This shows that sellers drove the price down, but buyers stepped in and pushed it back up by the close. For traders, a Hammer at a key support level—especially with increased volume—can be a powerful long entry signal when confirmed by the next candle closing higher.\nHow do support and resistance levels help traders decide when to buy or sell?\nSupport is a price level where buying tends to emerge, halting a downtrend. Resistance is where selling pressure usually stops an uptrend. These levels act like “invisible walls” on a chart. Smart traders use them to time entries and exits: buy near support in an uptrend and sell near resistance in a downtrend. When support or resistance breaks, it often leads to a sharp move as trapped traders scramble to adjust—creating high-probability setups for technical traders.\nWhat is On-Balance Volume (OBV), and how can it improve trade timing?\nOBV is a volume-based indicator that adds or subtracts daily volume based on whether the price closes higher or lower. The idea is simple: if volume is rising while price is flat or declining, it may signal quiet accumulation—smart money buying before a breakout. When both OBV and price move together, it confirms trend strength. But if OBV diverges (e.g., OBV rises while price falls), a reversal may be coming. It's a hidden edge few traders use—but those who do often spot big moves before they happen.\nWhat is a Bullish Engulfing pattern, and why does it matter?\nA Bullish Engulfing is a two-candle reversal pattern that appears after a downtrend. The first candle is bearish (red), and the second is a much larger bullish candle (green) that “engulfs” the entire body of the first one. This pattern shows a sudden shift in momentum—from sellers dominating to buyers taking control. If this happens at a support level, especially with rising volume, it often signals a strong buying opportunity. Some traders also look for it on higher timeframes for added confirmation.\nHow do traders determine a stock’s trend direction?\nTrend direction can be spotted using moving averages, chart patterns, and price action. An uptrend forms when prices make higher highs and higher lows. A downtrend shows lower highs and lower lows. A sideways trend (or consolidation) lacks clear direction, moving between support and resistance. Tools like the 50-day and 200-day moving averages help confirm trends: if price is above both and they’re sloping up, it’s a bullish trend. Spotting trend early helps traders align their strategy with market momentum.\nWhat is the best way to use stop losses and protect capital?\nThe best stop-loss strategy is to place it just beyond a key level—like below a support line or just past the low of a reversal pattern. Avoid setting stops too close (they'll trigger too often) or too far (you risk too much capital). Combine this with proper position sizing using the Risk/Reward Ratio. For instance, if your stop is $1 below entry and your target is $3 above, you're risking $1 to make $3—a 1:3 ratio. This approach protects your account while maximizing gains.\nWhat is the Dark Cloud Cover candlestick pattern, and how does it warn of a reversal?\nThe Dark Cloud Cover is a bearish two-candle pattern that signals a potential trend reversal at the top of an uptrend. It starts with a strong bullish candle, followed by a bearish candle that opens above the previous close but then closes well into the body of the first candle. This sudden shift in sentiment indicates buyers lost control and sellers stepped in aggressively. When this forms at resistance, especially with high volume, it often leads to a downturn.\n\n\nREADY TO GO BEYOND THE BASICS?\nThese insights are just the beginning.

These examples will demonstrate to you the practical applicability of all the concepts to different areas of financial trading.\nAs part of this course you will also learn the various technical analysis patterns associated with elliott wave theory. Some of these technical analysis patterns are complete financial trading systems in themselves that you can use instantly to trade profitably. Students who have some knowledge of classical technical analysis can also combine their knowledge with what they will learn in this course and can improve the accuracy of their trades substantially.\nHow is this course structured?\nThis course is structured into 4 sections:\n1. Introduction to wave theory: Where we introduce you to elliott wave theory\n2. Motive Waves: Where we explain the various patterns that represent trending markets\n3. Corrective Waves: Where we explain the various patterns associated with corrections\n4. Elliott Wave Rules & Guidelines: Where we explain the various rules & guidelines associated with elliott wave theory. These concepts will help you in correctly identify various patterns & set price targets for practical financial trading.\nIt is often said that Technical Analysis is useful only for short term trading. Nothing can be further from the truth. Advanced Technical Analysis concepts like elliott wave theory can be as effective for long term investing as it is for short term financial trading. The applicability of this advanced technical analysis tool across financial markets makes it one must have tool for all serious practitioners of technical analysis.\nIf you have some knowledge of technical analysis, this course will take your knowledge to a new level. If you are new to technical analysis then I believe this is best place to start your journey into technical analysis because you would have an open mind to advanced technical analysis concepts covered in this course that might be a bit hard to believe for more experienced technical analysis users. But don't worry the examples in this course will leave no doubt as to the effectiveness of this advanced technical analysis concept.\nI have personally benefited immensely from learning these advanced technical analysis concepts and I believe not using technical analysis in your investing or financial trading journey will only make it harder for you to succeed. So if you want to learn this advanced technical analysis concept enroll now!",

      "description": "Becoming a great stock investor and earning superior investment returns is much simpler than you probably think. It does not involve simply handing your money over to a professional (this costs you way too much money—without the results). It does not involve complicated formulas and “systems” that work for a year or two before losing you money. Instead, it takes using the same type of approach that the greatest and most successful investors before you have been doing for the last century. This course shows you the process required and the skills needed in order to realize enhanced investment returns for the long-term.\nMaster the Skill of Accurately Valuing Stocks, Enabling You to Earn Annualized Investment Returns in Excess of 12%\nLearn which type of stocks to buy, when to buy them, and when to sell\nConsistently recognize undervalued and overvalued stocks in the public market—helping to ensure you never overpay\nBuild larger account sizes and withdraw more money for retirement income and living\nKeep the 78% of your account value which fees and missed opportunities are taking from you\n\nA Powerful Skill to Possess in an Unpredictable Financial World\n\nToday’s financial world is full of unknowns. How much do you need to retire? Where should you put your money? How secure are your investments? Having the capability to confidently answer those questions for you and your family, along with the peace of mind of financial security, is an extremely valuable asset.\nThis confidence and peace of mind comes from using an investment strategy that has stood the test of time in generating enhanced returns. One that has been practiced, developed, and fine-tuned by investment experts with a combined 40+ years of experience. Mastering the skill of accurately valuing stocks and earning returns above the average allows you to build your investment accounts to values you previously only dreamed of; and it allows you to withdraw a greater amount of income throughout your retirement years.\nContents and Overview\nThis complete course is jam-packed with over 37 lectures of educational content. We’ll begin with an explanation of the ultimate investment strategy, and how we have developed it to generate massive returns for those who properly use it. We’ll then go on to explain why following the traditional financial path, earning the average return, and paying the average fee—could be costing you up to 78% of your investment account value!\nYou will see the true impact of what 12%+ returns can do for not only your investment and retirement accounts, but also for your lifestyle and income during retirement. By the end of this lecture, we hope you will realize that this strategy will greatly benefit you, whether you are still in your working years or currently in your retirement years.\nThe course will continue with a simple explanation of the first principle of successful investing, by focusing on a real-life example of one of the most basic businesses imaginable. We’ll then continue with a quick explanation of the power of compound interest, as well as the different investment choices you have when deciding where and how to allocate your hard-earned money. We’ll wrap up the second section with a thorough education on the #1 determinant of future returns, as well as scenarios which are best for buying and selling stocks.\nIn section three, you’ll discover the second principle to successful investing, and the path we followed to arrive at the ultimate investment strategy you are learning. You’ll then see the importance of combining the two principles, and how only using one and not the other could potentially lead to losing money. This is something you will want to avoid!\nIn the next section, you will learn why investing in stocks is the same as investing in businesses, and how you can use that knowledge to your advantage. We’ll continue with our basic company from section two, and see how going public affects companies, and your potential involvement with them as an investor. In this lecture, you will see which information is required for you to fully and accurately place a value on public stocks.\nThe course will continue with a detailed account of how much stock prices typically move in a given year (probably more than you think). You will then see why these stock prices move, and what influences the high and low prices. After that, you will learn about the best business partner in the world, and how you can fully, legally and ethically work with, and take advantage of him to make a consistent profit. We will also debunk one of the more commonly referred to investment theories, and prove why the ultimate investment strategy is a much better alternative.\nIn section five, you will learn all about the three most important words of investing—and how you could get nearly everything else wrong—and still make money! We’ll go on to define the face value, as well as each of the components you will need to place a face value on any stock you choose. After a detailed walkthrough, you will be armed with the skill to place a value on any stock in the market. You will know whether you are overpaying, or purchasing a stock on sale.\nWe will cap off section five illustrating the difference between a $15 stock and a $30 stock—showing why stock price per share, on its’ own, is insignificant. You will see that it involves other information to differentiate between a $30 stock, and a $15 stock.\nIn the final section, we will explain how to apply the second principle, and you will have the skill to spot only those companies which pass the test under the second principle of successful investing. We will detail what the one final check is, and an important question to ask yourself, before making the purchase of any stock. After this final check, we will detail the four conditions under which you might want to sell any of your stock holdings. After completing this lecture, you will have the capability to highlight which stocks you want to buy, place a value on them, buy them when they are on sale, and know when you might need to sell them.\nBefore saying goodbye, we will present you with our closing thoughts, as well as a step-by-step game plan for getting started on your first purchase.\nComplete with examples, stock charts, full explanations, and different scenarios, this course will enable investors of all skill levels to work alongside your instructors every step of the way, by participating in the class discussion boards and tapping into our knowledge and experience with the markets.",

Just by energy points you can build the future road map.\nIn this course no indicator or oscillator is used. Neither the averages nor the standard deviation is used, not even the candlestick patterns. Concept used in this course is based on Aurora Candles and it's so simple that even a school going student can also understand easily. Most of the contents are explained on real time charts. I believe strongly that trading can’t be learned with theoretic equations. You need to spend too many hours on charts to understand the patterns and behavior of the price movements. More you practice on the charts, start getting the sense of the market price behavior and the day comes when you start forecasting the next move OR at least not trading in a wrong direction.\nThis is not only a course only but my research paper. I welcome those who want to be the part of this research and development in the area of price action.\nAddition to it in bonus section, there are 2 more lectures on:\n1) Briefing of Dow Theory and\n2) Breakout strategy\nare also added now. Just one or 2 months back, when this course was published had near to 2 hrs of video contents, now today as on June 19th has 4 hr 20 min of video contents. I believe in very short span of time, more contents will be added to this course with the help of all my students and team members. I thanks all the students from core of my heart for such a overwhelming response. God bless you all.",

I look forward to more such courses on defined strategies to forecast such as EW , NW , IC , HA , etc. Highly Recommended.\" -Unni Krishnan\n\"A big salute to you Sir! I can never thank you enough. Your course helped me greatly! I have difficulty learning new things and sometimes absorbing new knowledge is hard for me. I watched a lot of video tutorials on YT but this is the first time I have understood fully what trading is all about. The course is simple and easy to understand. This is very important for a newbie like me who has yet to learn about trading. I am very thankful that your course made an impact on my learning and I know I am in the right direction. I have yet to learn more and I am encouraged to continue. Thank you, Sir! Thank you very much and kudos to you Sir!\" - Alexa San Mateo",

I apply and strategize them as suggested in your only 9.99$ course. Each week I check the list of winners/losers and put them in my pre-live account with 10 to 15 strategies and small sizes. So far 3000$ became 3400$ in 5 weeks. I will rollout to real money soon and consecently scaling this out more and more. So far a big thank you for your enlightening and simple strategy in the forex market!!! It was worth it's price so far. Kind regards, Bjorn\nReview from Jose Cortes Llobat\nI have been learning about algo trading since a long time ago but I did not find anything that made everything simple. This course has been very useful to me. I learned a lot about how some software tools can help me to find strategies without spending a lot of hours building the code, backtesting, sorting most profitable, testing on a virtual account, etc. I really like the way that Petko teaches us about the EAs portfolio selection. Really simple. It is something that I looked for since ever. The teacher speaks English with a non-full English accent which allows the people to understand him very well. He's speaking about the topics are very clear as well and you realize that he is an expert on the subjects.\n\nReview from Michael\nAmazing course for auto trading using robots choosing from more than a million strategies and only use selective ones that actually makes money during a certain period, constantly swapping over top money-making ones which is a good strategy by itself. I have started the EAs and will see if the top EAs actually make money in the long run. Thanks Petko.",

You can also ask 10 different people a question about a specific financial topic and you may just get 10 different answers. It can be tough to decipher these opinions and use them to make important decisions when it comes to your financial future. You can get this information from a financial advisor, but financial advisors main goal is to capture “Assets Under Management”. You are those “Assets” to them. Once the course is over, be prepared to be contacted non-stop as they will attempt to bring you into their office and sell you on their services as well as high commission products where their commission may not be in line with your objectives.\n\n\nAs Financial Educators, we do not manage assets. We do not sell products. We do not give conflicting advice. We TEACH. As an educator (and not a salesperson), our goal is to give you the most current information regarding every topic surrounding Retirement Planning. This education is 100% objective and ZERO selling of any product or service exists.\n\n\nWhen it comes to planning and making crucial decisions about retirement, it makes sense to learn from a trusted, reliable source who specializes and teaches the topic everyday WITHOUT the worry of being sold.\n\n\nTHIS CLASS IS FOR:\n\n\nThis class is designed for adults who are planning for their retirement whether retirement is several years away, right around the corner and even if you are recently retired. The content is relevant for those who work or have worked as an employee and those who are self employed.\nWhatever stage you are in, Retirement Planning Bootcamp will help you learn how to build wealth and protect your wealth so you can accomplish your financial goals and live the lifestyle you have always envisioned in retirement!\n\n\nCOURSE AGENDA:\n\n\nSection One - Life After Work\nDefining your ideal retirement\nFinancial resources in retirement\nOpportunities and responsibilities for today’s retirees\nPreparing your retirement plan\n\nSection Two - Retirement Planning Obstacles\nCommon obstacles and how to avoid them\nBudgeting\nGood debt vs. bad debt\nCompounding interest\nTax planning strategies\nTaxable vs tax advantaged investments\n\n\nSection Three - Inflation and Taxes\nThe number one fear in retirement\nEarly retirement and longer life expectancy\nInflation, the silent robber\nRetirement confidence\nDon’t forget to include taxes\nHow to calculate how much you will need in retirement\n\n\nSection Four - Income in Retirement\nIndividual Retirement Accounts\nRoth IRA conversions\nDefined benefit vs defined contribution plans\nInvestment income\nEmployment income\nAnnuity income\nRental income\nHome equity\nInformation age\n\n\nSection Five - Retirement Plan Distributions\nAnnuity vs lump sum\nSingle life vs joint and survivor\nAdvantages and disadvantages\nIRA rollover options\nCashing out can cost you dearly\nComparing distribution options\nIn-service distributions\nRequired Minimum Distributions\n\n\nSection Six - Investment Planning\nRisk tolerance\nTime horizon\nInvestment objectives\nInvestment categories\nStocks\nBonds\nCovered calls\nMutual Funds\nInvestment fees and expenses\nExchange Traded Funds\nAnnuities\n\n\nSection Seven - Risk Management Strategies\nTypes of investment risk\nDiversification\nAsset allocation\nRebalancing\nStop loss\nDollar cost averaging\n\n\nSection Eight - Wills and Estate Planning\nObjectives for Estate Planning\nWills\nHealth Care Proxy\nDurable Power of Attorney\nEstate Taxes\nProbate\nTrust Account types\n\n\nSection Nine - Social Security\nHistory of Social Security\nCurrent state of Social Security\nFull retirement age, reduced benefits, and maximum benefits\nTaxation on retirement benefits\nEarned income and benefit reduction\nSpousal benefits\nFuture of Social Security\n\nSection Ten - Insurance Planning and Asset Protection\nLife insurance needs\nMortgage protection\nIncome replacement\nCollege expense\nFinal expense\nWhole life\nTerm\nDisability\nHealth insurance\nMedicare\nLong term care\n\n\nAN INSIDE LOOK INTO THE CLASS:\n\n\nSection One - Life After Work\n\n\nIf tomorrow is your first day of retirement, and you don’t have to wake up and go to work, what does your ideal day look like? How about your ideal week, or month? Have you even given it much thought as to what your dream retirement looks like? Do you want to travel the world, or spend more time at home enjoying time with family, or taking up a new hobby. How about turning a hobby into an income generating business to supplement your other sources of retirement income? In order to achieve your financial goals in retirement, you need to have a clear vision of what your lifestyle will look like. Traveling the world or spending time with family are both great ways to spend time in retirement. However, they require two different levels of financial resources. In this section, we help you you figure out exactly what it is that you want to do in retirement and from there you will learn how to properly plan to meet those goals.\n\n\nSection Two - Retirement Planning Obstacles\n\n\nMistakes can be costly. They can set you back years. In this section we explore the most common obstacles that people face while preparing for retirement and then we show you how to avoid these costly mistakes. We then cover budgeting. If you are like most people, there never seems to be enough money left over at the end of each month. In this section we give you a brief exercise to explore that will help you track all of you unnecessary spending. Once you can identify where you are spending money needlessly, you can cut-back on those items and put the extra savings into an investment plan for retirement. We also take our first dive into the subject of taxes. We cover the taxable vs tax-advantaged investments as well as several strategies to help you save money on taxes each year.\n\n\nSection Three - Inflation and Taxes\n\n\nAccording to a study by the Benefit Research Institute, 64% of current retirees retired by age 65 or earlier. However, the same study shows that current workers plan to retire after age 65. There is a big discrepancy between when they expect to retire and when they actually do retire. Some of the reasons why people retire earlier than expected are for reasons out of our control, therefore you might not have as long as you had hoped to to plan for retirement. In this section we show you how to plan for various scenarios such as how long your money must last and how to figure out how much money you will need to live on while factoring the impact that inflation and taxes will have on your income.\n\n\nSection Four - Income in Retirement\n\n\nIn this section we discuss the various tax-deferred ways to save for retirement including employer sponsored retirement plans and IRA’s. We also cover various sources of income pre-retirement and during retirement such as pensions, Social Security, investment income, as well as other unique ways to supplement your main sources of income.\n\n\nSection Five - Retirement Plan Distributions\n\nDid you know that the IRS will penalize you up to 50% if you don’t take money out of your qualified retirement plans in time? That is a crazy penalty. We will show you when you have to do this to avoid this penalty as well as other ways to minimize taxes and penalties when making retirement plan withdrawals. Did you know that you could rollover your company sponsored retirement plan while you are still working for that employer?? There are a lot of options that you have when it comes to taking money out of your retirement plans before and during retirement. In this section we go over the pro’s and con’s of each option you have as well as how to avoid a very simple mistake that could cost you tens of thousands of dollars when transferring your money. We also cover the many different options you will have when selecting a monthly annuity payment from your pension. This decision is permanent and cannot be changed. We explain the different annuity payment options and the pro’s and con’s of each.\n\n\nSection Six - Investment Planning\n\n\nBring a pen and notepad for this section because we cover a lot of ground. When it comes to retirement planning, a lot of that planning revolves around your investments. We begin this section by showing you the importance of knowing your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment objectives. Then we move on to explore the many different types of asset classes and investment categories, such as stocks, bonds, cash, covered calls (an excellent source of income), mutual funds, exchange traded funds, separately managed accounts, and annuities. The most eye-opening part of this section is our discussion on mutual fund fees and the other various forms of unnecessary fees, where to find them, how much it will cost you (a few hundred thousand dollars on a modest size portfolio over the course of your retirement), and the more cost efficient alternatives that are available to you.\n\n\n\n\nSection Seven - Risk Management Strategies\n\n\nNow that you are familiar with the many different types of investments that you learned in Section Six, now we want you to learn how to properly manage the investment risk in your portfolio. Every asset class has risk, even cash as you learned in last section’s story about Warren Buffett. You can’t fully eliminate risk, but you can certainly control it. In this section, we will go over the many different types of risk that each asset class is exposed to and how you can minimize that risk. Some of the topics covered are Asset Allocation, Diversification, Rebalancing, and Stop Losses.\n\n\nSection Eight - Wills and Estate Planning\n\n\n42% of Americans do not have a simple Will. As our way of saying “Thank You” for registering for our class, we give all class registrants a very detailed 18 page Last Will and Testament. If you go to an attorney to get this done, you will pay at least $500. Now that you have this Will, USE IT!!! In this section we cover the very important topic of Estate Planning. Contrary to what many believe, estate planning is not just for the wealthy. Everyone needs estate planning. The reason: If you have an estate plan, you will be able to make important decisions regarding your healthcare, your assets, minimizing taxes, providing for your family and loved ones and much more while you are living as well as after you pass away. Without an estate plan, the state courts will make these decisions for you. That is a pretty scary thought. We will go over the benefits of having a Will, the benefits of a more detailed estate plan, as well as other topics such as estate taxes and how to minimize this and probate and strategies to avoid probate. Lastly, we will cover the many types of Trusts and the advantages and purposes of each.\n\n\nSection Nine - Social Security\n\n\nThis is a hot topic. The big question many of us have is “Will Social Security be there when I need it?”. We answer that question in this section. It is no surprise that the Social Security program has been in a financial mess for quite some time, and recent estimations are that the two trust funds that make up Social Security will be depleted by 2034. What does that mean for you and how will that impact your retirement? Find out in Section Nine. We also show you when you can collect your benefits and how your income will be impacted depending on what age you start to collect your benefits. Many people take their benefits early and also work part time or full time. Doing so can have a negative impact. We will show you how much you can make without impacting your retirement benefits. We also talk about taxation on your benefits, spousal benefits, and the future of Social Security.\n\n\nSection Ten - Insurance Planning and Asset Protection\n\n\nWe thought it would be appropriate to end the course with this topic. The final piece to a proper retirement plan is protecting you and your assets. If you do everything right, but skip this step in the planning process, you could still experience a major financial loss that could be avoided. We begin this section by addressing the most common needs for life insurance such as income replacement for your loved ones, college tuition coverage, mortgage protection, and the cost to pay for final expenses. There are a few types of life insurance and we explain the pro’s and con’s of Whole Life and Term Insurance. Next we move on to the topic of Long-Term Care. Approximately 70% of Americans who reach retirement age will need some form of Long Term Care. We explain what this coverage is, how much it can cost as well as the major cost of doing nothing, and the expected length of time long term care will be needed. Finally, we end this section addressing the topic of health insurance and disability.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT AND WHAT YOU WILL GET:\n\n\nCLASS INSTRUCTION:\n\n\nRetirement planning was never taught in our formal years of educations. It is up to you as an adult to take the time and learn this information. You will discover more information on the topic of Retirement Planning in our six-hour course, than most people will receive in an entire lifetime.\n\n\nOur instructors are qualified financial professionals who have earned the formal designation of “Retirement Planning Specialist”.\n\n\n\n\nCLASS OBJECTIVE:\n\n\nUnlike the “free dinner seminars” that you have probably been invited to (every night of the week), we do NOT sell during this class. We do NOT promote a single product like most people do at these dinner seminars. This is a 100% educational program that ties together every single aspect of retirement planning and how you need to integrate each topic to have a proper plan.\n\n\nAttend our class and learn how to:\nCreate a plan to retire early\nTake advantage of new tax laws\nMake sure your retirement plan is properly allocated\nTake advantage of the most cost efficient investments and risk management strategies\nMare sure your estate plan is current",

I have followed his Youtube videos first to familiarize myself with his product, and I was impressed, even before buying this course. Watching every second of the course made me more impressed by his detailed explanation and teaching style. I see lots of creativity in the way he does his trading. Some peephole me feel a bit overwhelmed by the number of strategies he generates and filter, but if it is quite justifiable for serious traders who want to make money. I have personally benefited significantly from this course and plan to apply his methodology. One note for potential buyers: check the review first to ensure that you have the prerequisites to benefit from the course, and once you decide you will not be disappointed. Thank you, Petko,\nMarie F Petit  -> I love the way the course is scaffolded, it enables me to really understand what is being taught. Thank you!\n\nIgbinovia Osayi Martin -> Great expert!!! It's my desire to enroll for all Petko's courses before the end of 2020\nFrantz Aladin -> I like this course a lot. i'm a coder so i can understand the codes and truly understand whats going on. Very good ea's . having good results so far on demo.\nRaymond Oh -> This is Petko's second trading course I purchased and attended. Like the last one, Petko did a wonderful job in sharing his excellent trading strategy with his students. He's also a great teacher. He effortlessly walks through the lectures with easy-to-understand languages and convincing manners. Moreover, he provides the students with his robots (the EAs) for free and updates them monthly. That is a very good value to students because it would save them a lot of work and a lot of time. Petko's trading strategies are excellent because they help traders build skills that make trading more profitable instead of giving them false hopes. In addition, the strategies in this course can also be extended into other trading instruments such as futures and stocks. Even if you are a seasoned trader, you could still benefit from attending this course. So, I highly recommend it. Thank you Petko for a great course!\nJose Cortes Llobat ->Amazing course plenty of good content. It follows the process given by the instructor on other courses but all of them are complementary providing new knowledge about how to work with many EAs. It's pretty nice that the instructor provides the EAs to test with and updates them monthly, so you will never have outdated EAs. It's awesome how those expert advisors are created using new software tools that do not require any programming skill and how the instructor explains the entire process providing the students the whole picture of the process. Thanks Petko. :-D",
