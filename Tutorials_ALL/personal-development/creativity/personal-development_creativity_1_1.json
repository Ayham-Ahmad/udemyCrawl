      "description": "Welcome to the crash course on how to use Mac Operating System (commonly referred to as Mac OS or Macos ).\n\n\nIf you have recently switched from Windows to Mac OS X on an Apple Macbook or iMac, the differences between the two operating systems might seem confusing, frustrating and even a bit overwhelming at first.\n\n\nI can totally resonate with you since I have been in your shoes. When I bought my first Macbook after using Windows for many many years, it took me many hours just to learn how to Copy & Paste text (without the help of Google).\n\n\nLearning other basic functionalities in the new Macbook was a nightmare. It was a steep learning curve and took me months of browsing blogs and Youtube videos before I became comfortable with my Mac.\n\n\nSo I created this course to help BEGINNERS and INTERMEDIATE USERS of the Mac OS to improve their macos user experience. I have packed this course with whatever I have learnt during the last few years on my Apple Macbook.\n\n\nAnd the cool thing is, you can learn all of it in this course, without looking for Mac os Catalina etc. tutorials on Youtube, Apple Support etc.\n\n\nMac computers are wonderful, stable, carefully designed and well built - no doubt about that. And it's safe to assume that almost always, there is an easy and cool way to do things in Mac OS X.\n\n\nBut ...\n\n\nMany people think that with Mac computers and Macbooks, one needs to purchase many extra software packages, which come built in with Windows computers.\n\n\nIf you have the same views, I have a great news for you! Your Mac is full of tools and functionalities which you probably have never had a chance to explore, so you're missing out on a lot of cool stuff. For example, you get many free apps, e.g. iMovie, Keynote, Numbers, Pages etc.\n\n\nIn this hands on course, I have carefully put together many Macos tricks and best practices in the form of short video tutorials. It took me years (well, literally!) to learn them, but with this course, you can learn these Macos tricks super fast with minimal effort.\n\n\nThese wonderful tips and hacks will save your time and energy and will have a big impact on your productivity. This course will take you from a beginner / intermediate to an advanced Mac OS user in no time!\n\n\nAfter taking this course, you would be able to navigate the Mac OS X with swipes and keyboard shortcuts like a breeze, and would be able to minimize Macos Catalina etc. slowdowns like a boss. I will even teach you how to do basic video editing in iMovie.\n\n\nThis course will be regularly updated and I will be adding more macos tips as I explore them!\n\n\nCheers,\nKashif",

      "description": "FINALLY…\nA PROVEN STEP-BY-STEP TRAINING COURSE FOR WRITING, EDITING, PUBLISHING, AND MARKETING YOUR NOVEL.\nIN THIS UNIQUE STEP-BY-STEP ONLINE TRAINING COURSE, I’LL SHOW YOU HOW I’VE BUILT A SUCCESSFUL WRITING AND PUBLISHING BUSINESS WITH SEVENTEEN BOOKS IN PRINT, THOUSANDS OF SALES… EVEN WITH A DAY JOB.\nThe best part? You can forget about the writing myths that say you can’t write a novel with a day job, you need years to complete a page-turning-kick-butt-story, a specialized writing degree, fancy software, or knowledge of the publishing industry .\nYou’re going to learn what it really takes to write a novel, find a core of rabid fans, and even do it with a day job by following my proven system that:\n1. Shows you why mindset is more valuable than writing skills (and what to do when you get stuck).\n2. Gives you a proven step-by-step blueprint for starting, editing, and finishing a page-turning novel in less time (even with a day job).\n3. Instructs you how to format and publish your novel (even if techie stuff gives you ulcers).\n4. Provides a marketing strategy that isn’t sleazy, scammy, and designed for people who hate marketing (like most writer’s).\nIf you’re a writer (or want to be one), you’ll see how simple my step-by-step training is to learn, whether you’ve never finished a novel, have written multiple books, or are somewhere in between.\nI’ll show you how to put my training into practice for writing novels at a prolific pace for years to come. Why? Because I know you have stories to tell, and your stories matter...\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\nFight the negative thoughts that keep you from finishing your novel.\nHave a fool proof structure for writing compelling and kick-butt stories in any genre.\nCraft a writing, editing, publishing, and marketing plan before you write the first word.\nLearn the skills necessary to format and publish your ebooks or print versions of your book on various platforms.\nImplement a marketing strategy for those who hate marketing.\nBuild a thriving publishing business.\nHave the tools to write a novel in less time, and repeat the process for years to come.\nI can’t guarantee the results I’ve seen in my students (or any results for that matter), and don’t listen to anyone who says they can. What I do know is the step-by-step system of the 45 Day Novel works. It will take patience, hard work, and some grit. But if you apply the principles in the course, and keep working the system, it will pay off. You can write, edit, publish, and market your book in less time, even with a day job. I’m living proof, and so are my students.\nWho am I?\nHi, Ryan J. Pelton here. I’m the author of seventeen fiction and nonfiction books, have sold thousands of copies, and host a popular podcast called The Prolific Writer. I’ve helped thousands of people write fast, often, and well… because our stories matter.\nBut you’d be surprised to know for many years I bought into the lies and myths of writing and publishing. Myths presented as gospel-truth in the world of publishing.\nThings like:\nYou’ll only have success in writing if you ditch the day job (because you need eight hours a day to write).\nHow about another doozy- a good novel takes years to write and must be rewritten dozens of times (Ernest Hemingway and Stephen King wrote bestselling novels in less than two weeks).\nOr another whopper- you need a specialized writing degree to be taken seriously as a novelist (John Grisham was a lawyer and Harper Lee was a ticket agent for an airline).\nOkay, one more for fun- unless you have a bestseller, you’ll never make a living as a writer (most working writer’s make a living without having bestsellers).\nLies, lies, and more lies...\nI knew something was off, and there had to be a better way.\nSo in 2012, I went on a search. A search for disarming the myths and lies of publishing that so many writer’s fall prey (like me). I believed you could write great books… books people loved, and read, and told their friends about… even with a day job.\nI knew deep in my bones that writing a novel in a short period of time didn’t make it unworthy of readership. I had a hunch that a specialized writing degree was not a prerequisite for a satisfying and long term writing career.\nMy hunches were right…\nOnce I discovered these writing and publishing myths and lies, were just that. Everything changed.\nWhen I focused on what mattered… writing the next book using the 45 Day Novel philosophy, things began to happen. From 2012 until now, I’ve managed to write and publish ten novels and nine nonfiction titles that have sold thousands of copies, gain solid reviews from actual reader’s… all by using the 45 Day Novel Program.\nHear from one my students:\nAs a struggling new writer…\nRyan has been a great mentor and inspiration to me. He has helped me overcome many of my personal hurdles and roadblocks. He understands the real-life struggles of the writing life, as he is a writer himself. I especially benefitted from learning his 7 Step Story Structure, which helped me get unstuck with my current writing project. Whether you're an aspiring author working on your first book, or you're an author who is stuck on a project, I highly recommend Ryan as your new writing coach.\n-Dr. Thien Doan (Author/Speaker/Coach)\nAre you a beginning, intermediate, or seasoned writer with a story to tell?\nEnroll now and see your novel out in the world for people to enjoy!",

Our goal is to strike a balance between mechanics—accurate measuring, shading, and layering—and cultivating an interpretive mindset that helps you “find the art in art-making.”\n\n\nWe’ll begin with a look at the simple materials you’ll need and how to set up your workspace. From there, we’ll carefully measure our subject to create a realistic framework, then walk step by step through shading, blending, and layering pastels to achieve depth, light, and natural texture. Along the way, we’ll discuss what details to focus on, what to let go of, and how to bring out the spirit of the subject without overcomplicating the process.\n\n\nIn this class, you’ll learn how to:\n• Choose and set up pastel materials for success\n• Measure accurately to achieve realism in still life subjects\n• Apply shading and layering to create value and depth\n• Explore both soft and hard edges for dimension and texture\n• Develop an artistic mindset that allows for creativity and interpretation\n\n\nBy the end of this concise yet thorough class, you’ll have a finished pastel still life drawing and a toolkit of foundational skills you can carry into future projects. More importantly, you’ll gain confidence in both the technical and creative aspects of drawing—learning to embrace precision while also trusting your artistic intuition.",

It will support you in creation of action-based imagery, regardless of whether you have an arts background or any artistic experience.\n\n\nBegin your journey of making art with a message!\n\n\nWhile there are many courses that focus on developing creative techniques, there are few courses that focus on creating art as a form of activism.\n\n\nThis course is for artists and activists of all skill levels and backgrounds who want to learn how to turn their art into a powerful and effective tool for change.\n\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\n\n· How to turn your art into an instrument for change in the world\n· Where to find other artists and activists to collaborate with\n· How to encourage and inspire your audience to engage with your art\n· How to create impactful art by following activity prompts\n· How to use social media techniques to share messages of action and change\n· Self-care techniques to develop resiliency and fortitude as an artist and activist\n· Knowledge of art activism history to use as a foundation for your own journey\n\n\nStrengthen your voice, vision, and vitality for impacting change.\n\n\nRegardless of your skill with visual, media, theatrical, dance, or musical arts, this course is designed to teach you everything you need to know to become an artistic activist.\n\n\nWhether you prefer to write poetry, make murals, paint on rocks, do interpretive dance, or any other form of artistic expression, this course will help you learn how to turn your passion into an impactful way to ignite change.\n\n\nContents and Overview\n\n\nThis course is aimed at teaching artists and activists safe and easy ways to begin their journey as protest artists, civil rights activists, climate change fighters, and becoming a voice for those who cannot fight for themselves using the power of artistic expression.\n\n\nYou’ll start with the basics of the definition of art activism and what it encompasses along with learning about the history of art activism as we examine the artists that came before us.\n\n\nYou’ll learn about the rules and regulations around the world today that prevent the act of creative protesting, and how to stay safe when protesting and creating art for change.\n\n\nYou’ll work through exercises to create different types of art that will develop your style before exploring which angle will best connect your work with the right audience.\n\n\nYou’ll then discover how to find the right audience for your art, how the placement of your art is key, as well as how to find other artists and activists to collaborate with so that you can reach a larger audience and make bigger and even more impactful art.\n\n\nWho is the Instructor?\n\n\nLibby James is a writer, adventurer, activist, and rebel. Her favorite art activist medium is creative writing, creating stories for how she wishes the world would be. She believes that a person can be changed by reading a book and can then go on to make change in the world.\n\n\nLibby creates a space in her work for societal taboos with hopes of making them less threatening – a space where flawed characters are not only forgivable but accepted, and where she can show readers what the world could have been and what it can still be. She encourages other artists to create work that clearly represents their own truths, to take risks, and to push against the creative norm in new ways.\n\n\nI can’t wait to meet you in the course!\n\n\nEnroll now, and I’ll show you how to use your own unique creative expression to change the world.\n\n\n-Libby\n\n\n“Libby’s courses always resonate with me as an independent creator and artist. This Art Activism course is no exception! Libby is a wealth of knowledge and I took away a lot of actionables from this course for the future of my art and writing career!” -Kristina",

The reason why I say \"rediscover\" is because the belief here is that we were all born with innate powers of creativity and imagination. Over time, due to a number of reasons that I will go over during the course, many of us lose our creative touch and confidence.\nAnd in a world were challenges are becoming increasingly complex and ambiguous, our creativity can lead the way to more clarity and poise in our quest for success. The need to be creative has never been more real.\nThis course is focused mostly on idea generation, not idea evaluation, though I do provide a couple of quick ways you can evaluate your ideas, too. Another way to think of it is as a problem solving guide.\nThe course is split up into 6 sections:\nSection 1: Introduction\nAn overview of what you will learn\nSection 2: Building Creative Confidence\nStart on your journey on how to gain confidence in your creative abilities again\nSection 3: The Principles of Creativity\nLearn about the multiple aspects of creativity that are utilized in the three main stages of Idea Generation: 1) Focus, 2) Explore, and 3) Move (these categorizations are my own, based on the works of other experts in the field)\nSection 4: Idea Generation\nMostly adapted from Michael Michalko's book Thinkertoys, this section provides 5 techniques you can immediately use to start looking at problems in new perspectives and coming up loads of new ideas.\nSection 5: Idea Evaluation\nHere, you'll learn a couple of quick techniques to help you sift through and evaluate the ideas that you have generated.\nSection 6: A New Beginning\nSome parting thoughts. Please don't skip this lecture. It contains some important takeaways that I want you to take with you.\nWhat is included in the course:\nLifetime access to 2+ hours of content\nTips and tricks from creativity experts such as David and Tom Kelley, Michael Michalko, Roger von Oech, Edward de Bono, Tina Seelig, Thomas Edison, and more\nTONS of exercises! You can't learn how to ride a bicycle just by reading a manual. The same is with creativity. You're going to get your hands (and brains) busy in this course\nA collection of slides, video lectures from experts, audio clippings, images and some home-made animations. I can shamelessly say this was a labour of love!\nAccess to me. I will promise to respond to you within 48 hours, pending personal emergencies\nAbove all, I hope you have lots of fun and learn tons along the way!",

      "description": "Tired of being told \"Scrivener is the answer to all your writing woes\"?\nWhat if you could do all those same organizational tricks (plus lots more Scrivener can't do) without needing to purchase or learn a whole new word-processing platform?\nGood news! This course -- designed and taught by editor and publisher Demi Stevens of Year of the Book Press -- takes you behind the magic curtain to show you just the tools you need to get the writing done faster and more elegantly.\nUsing fun sample texts, along with drafts from actual manuscripts, this course goes beyond the mechanics of MS Word to show you how to format your Work-In-Progress using a series of 1-click tools like \"Style\" settings for chapter headers/sub-headers and main body text, table of contents, bibliography, citations, footnotes or endnotes, and indexing.\nOr if you've been tempted to try your hand at dictating your manuscript (pun intended) -- but the price tag and learning curve for Dragon Naturally Speaking ($99+) has got your mouse-hand shaking -- discover the new free \"Dictate\" feature, which converts voice to text with astonishing accuracy.\nPerfect for beginners or advanced MS Word users, you can easily target the skills you want most by lesson topic. If you simply need to solve your page numbering woes to create that illusive \"intentionally blank\" page between chapters, no problem! Jump straight to Lessons 12 and 13 for page breaks and headers/footers.\nCan't stand the thought of removing those now-superfluous 2nd spaces between sentences, or extra line breaks between paragraphs... one by painful one? When you're dealing with an 80,000-word manuscript, there's not enough wine in your rack to get you through that. Instead, skip to Lesson 9 for the almost 1-click wonders of the \"Find and Replace\" tool.\nMaybe you've just landed your dream editor, and they've sent back your entire document with \"Tracked Changes\" -- but you don't know how to even begin deciphering their suggestions. Fear not! Lesson 27 will get you oriented, as well as provide ideas for what you should verify with your editor before you dive in... so you don't waste valuable deadline time doing the work twice.\nOr perhaps you've decided to tread the indie path and self-publish your book. Hiring a format and design team could cost $150-1000 per book. Using skills from this course, plus the bonus book-formatting lesson, you'll be ready to create a file suitable to upload to Amazon KDP, Ingram-Spark, or other POD platform, so you can start building your author brand today!\nIn addition to the instructor's work in the publishing field, Demi Stevens is a Microsoft Office Certified Trainer, so you'll benefit from the overlap of MS Word ninja techniques plus butt-in-chair/hands-on-keyboard wisdom from the writing trenches.",

      "description": "Learn how to write a book in a short time and then write many books in a short time by mastering the outsourcing process.\nRecently added: How to acquire rights to books and sell them as your own.\nOne of the best ways to make money online is to sell books on Amazon and many people successfully do that. But what if you don't think that you are a good writer? What if you've never seriously written before? What if you don't know how to write a book and where to start? What if you don't have time to write a book?\nIn this course, I teach you three strategies you can use to create a book:\nOutsourcing strategy for how to create a book without writing a single word.\nI will teach you how to create your book by writing what you can and outsourcing appropriate help that will make your book a high-quality book.\nAdditional ways to acquire book rights like white label licensing (PLR licensing), out of copyright books, and more.\nOnce you write your first book, you can easily use the same ebook creation method to write your second, third, and twentieth book. After that, you will be able to sell your books on Amazon for years to come and generate a passive income by working from home on writing more books or just enjoying your semi-retired life.\nGet the course today, learn how to write a book, and get started on this path of making money from home as an author, and getting you close to a lifestyle you wish you had.\nPLEASE READ: Many well-known business people and celebrities create books without writing a single word. I will teach you their strategies in this course. This course isn't to help you become a great writer. It is about helping you be able to have a legitimate book created in your name, and sold for an income.\nWHY WRITE A BOOK\nThe self-publishing industry is very popular today and book writing is a passion and a dream that can finally be achieved for many through self-publishing. Once you learn how to write a book, create your book, and self-publish it on Amazon and Kindle as a digital product (ebook) or a paperback book, you can earn passive income from selling your book on Amazon, Kindle, your own website and many other online stores where books are sold.\nBOOK OR EBOOK CREATION IN MANY WAYS\nYou don't have to write the book. You can outsource the transcription and the editing of the book. You can even acquire books that are already written by licensing and other methods explained in the course.\nAMAZON KDP LOW CONTENT BOOKS\nA recent addition to the course is the creation and sales of Amazon KDP low content books. Low content books are books like planners, notebooks, diaries, calendars, and many similar books that are categorized by the fact that you don't have to create the content. Amazon KDP low content books are a great and fast way to get into the Amazon KDP business because you don't have to buy, outsource, or write an actual book and there is a lot of demand for Amazon KDP low content books.\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION WHEN YOU FINISH THE COURSE\nWhen you complete 100% of the videos in this book writing course, you will be emailed a certificate of completion by Udemy so you can show it as proof of your self-publishing expertise, and that you have completed a certain number of hours of instruction in how to write a book by outsourcing most of the work.\nMONEY-BACK GUARANTEE\nThe course on how to write a book comes with an unconditional, Udemy-backed, 30-day money-back guarantee. This is not just a guarantee, it's my personal promise to you that I will go out of my way to help you succeed just like I've done for thousands of my other students.\nInvest in your future.

Final Draft is my Ferrari.\"\nRobert Zemeckis (writer/director/producer of \"Back to the Future,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" and \"The Polar Express\") says this:\n“The intuitive ease of Final Draft allows the writer to focus on what’s truly important – story.”\nBen Stiller (actor/writer/producer of \"Zoolander,\" Tropic Thunder,\" and \"Night at the Museum\") says:\n\"Final Draft is the only screenwriting software I have ever used, and it is the only one I ever will use.

      "description": "Whether it be writing, speaking, marketing or mere conversation, language is the vehicle through which we express our thoughts, dreams, creativity, desires, and opinions. But not everyone communicates in a compelling way. Holding people’s attention can be quite a challenge, especially in a time where the average attention span is consistently decreasing due to social media preferences such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Holding people’s attention today is perhaps harder than ever before. Luckily, literary techniques allow you to present your thoughts in a way that is interesting, fun and/or unique. They are used by storytellers, public speakers, advertisers, educators, salespersons, politicians, comedians, as well as people who just enjoy regaling their friends and family, to place a spotlight on their ideas. In this course, we cover ten commonly used literary techniques that can be used by anyone, anywhere, to improve the efficacy of their communication skills. These basic techniques can be used to clarify concepts, engage an audience, or even add some intrigue or novelty to your messages.\n\n\nWe will discuss allusion, hyperbole, irony, simile, metaphor, imagery, personification, idiomatic expressions, mood and tone as devices used in communication. This is step one in becoming a more intriguing communicator, whether it be as a writer, speaker, or both. Knowing these techniques, with the eventual goal of applying them with purpose, will help set you above many of the more lackluster, dull and/or disengaging speakers, writers, and conversationalists you encounter.\n\n\nForget the drab days of boring dialogue, monotonous stories, and lifeless conversation. Start to communicate in color…. In living color… by applying these techniques to your communication style. You may be surprised by the results.\n\n\nIn this class, we will cover the following:\n*Simile, metaphor, hyperbole, personification, irony, allusions, idioms, alliteration, imagery, mood and tone.\n*We will define what these techniques are.\n*We will explain why they are used.\n*We will give tips on how to use them yourself.\n*We will practice identifying them in context.\n\n\nFOR EDUCATORS:  We support any and all schools who aid students in empowering themselves. Lesson plans, worksheets and answer keys are included in this course to assist educators who wish to use/or/sample our course materials.",

      "description": "“Write what you know!\" “Find your voice!” “Show, don't tell!”\nRules and conventions are pervasive in fiction writing, and whether we are aware of it or not, they shape the way we approach and write our stories. This course aims to free you from the tyranny of the rules and offer a solid foundation of techniques, or roads into writing, that expand your understanding of the workings of creativity, language and story, and help you discover and bring forward your own best work.\nBreak the rules that limit your creativity and bring forward what you have always wanted to write\nRe-evaluate conventional rules and approaches and decide if they are right for you and your writing\nDiscover alternative tools and approaches to expand your creative power and language, and ultimately help you discover the form of your story that gives it the space to fully develop\nGet un-stuck, beat writer's block, and generate lots of new writing with the help of the fertile writing explorations that accompany each unit\nChallenge conventional writing rules and discover effective approaches to bring forth your most creative and surprising work\nThis course is the fruit of working with thousands of writing students at all levels. I’ve seen them paralyzed by how they think they’re supposed to write, judging their own work so harshly according to conventional rules that they fail to notice the gold in it. They fail to notice that they are doing something different, even unique, and instead throw away work that with some development could be mindblowing! Exquisite! And true to their deeper goals in writing.\nIn all my teaching, I have found my students to be immensely more creative, and immensely better writers, than they understand themselves to be. What they came to create in writing was way beyond what they had imagined. And I believe, that  if you are willing to put in the work, this course can do the same for you.\nCourse structure\n\nTogether we’ll look at twelve writing rules and conventions that are generally accepted by many, though certainly not all, writers, and continue to be taught as the way. We’ll look at each of these rules in turn.\nAt first, we’ll shake up those conventions, explore a bit of why they have been embraced, and consider what damage they may do to writers, their characters, and their stories.\nThen, we’ll look at a tool or technique for writing beyond this convention in order to deepen your writing and unlock your real creative gifts.\nWe’ll finish each unit with a practical exploration to illuminate for you - or familiarize you with - each creativity tool which you can apply immediately to your own writing.\nDuring this journey, we’ll use plenty of examples from literature around the world, by authors such as Toni Morrison, Michael Ondaatje, Zadie Smith and Pablo Neruda.\nYou’ll be leaving this course with effective approaches to bring forth your most creative and surprising work.\nDetailed overview\nHere is what we will cover in regards to each of the rules:\n1. “Write what you know”\nHow sticking to “writing what you know” can block your creativity and limit your writing by deflating the power of your imagination. How to use the process of association in your writing, a valuable tool which can fuel your imagination and the expressiveness of your language.\n2. “Find your voice”\nWhy “finding your voice” is sound, yet incomplete advice. How working with multiple voices and viewpoints can help you write complex stories.\n3. \"The more details, the better\"\nThe importance of narration and point of view in shaping details. How the concept of microscopic truthfulness can help you use details more effectively.\n4. “Write from a sense of place”\n\nWhy the instruction to “write from a sense of place” does not apply to all writers and all stories. How to expand this instruction in order to open your work to the complexity of an unconventional sense of place.\n5. “Outline”\nWhy discovery can be preferable to, and should precede, planning. How to use a story map as a tool to allow for more discovery and creativity in the journey of writing your story.\n6. “Deepen character through backstory”\nWhy backstory is a crucial yet insufficient aspect of full and complex characterization. How to tap into the concept of “the unlived life” in order to create unforgettable and moving characters.\n7. “A story consists of five parts with rising and falling tension”\nThe origins of the five-part story form and why it is time to move beyond this prototype. How to change the shape of your story by exploring the stories often left unexplored.\n8. “Start by setting the scene”\nThe drawbacks to revealing too much too soon when beginning a story. Alternative ways of crafting a story beginning that allows for mystery and discovery.\n9. “All events lead up to the climax.”\nWhy every story doesn’t have to be built on the rising and falling of tension. How to discover different shapes of story and its tension in your own experiences and those of others.\n10. “A causes B, then B causes C, …”\nThe difference between simple and complex causality. How to use concentric circles as a tool to create multidimensional characters and events.\n11. “Use flashbacks sparingly”\nThe limits of a mostly chronological unfolding of story. How to tap into associational thinking to open up your language to move your story around in time.\n12. “Every story has already been told”\nWhy it is not true that “every story has already been told” and why yours is a story worth telling.\n+ A bonus lecture on \"Show, don't tell\"\nWhy \"show, don't tell\" is not a rule set in stone and why sometimes telling can be preferable to showing.",

      "description": "Whether you are a complete beginner or an aspiring writer with some experience, this course will provide you with the tools, techniques, and inspiration needed to craft engaging narratives that resonate with readers.\nIntroduction to Storytelling\nStorytelling is one of the oldest and most powerful forms of communication. From ancient myths and legends to modern novels and films, stories have always played a crucial role in shaping cultures, beliefs, and human connections. A well-told story can transport readers to another world, evoke deep emotions, and leave a lasting impact. But what makes a story truly compelling? What elements must come together to create a narrative that captivates and inspires?\nThis course is designed to answer these questions and more. We will delve into the core components of storytelling—character, plot, setting, theme, and style—and explore how these elements work together to create stories that are not only entertaining but also meaningful and memorable. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the art and craft of storytelling and the confidence to apply these principles to your own writing.\nCourse Objectives\nThis course is structured to achieve several key objectives:\nDevelop Your Narrative Voice: One of the first steps in becoming a skilled storyteller is discovering and refining your unique narrative voice. This course will guide you through various exercises and techniques to help you find your voice and use it effectively to convey your story’s tone, style, and personality.\nCreate Compelling Characters: Characters are the heart of any story. They drive the plot, interact with the setting, and engage readers emotionally.

We will explore different plot structures, from the traditional three-act structure to more complex, non-linear narratives. You will learn how to outline your story, build tension, and create a satisfying resolution.\nCraft Vivid Settings: Setting is more than just a backdrop for your story; it can also shape the mood, influence characters, and enhance the narrative.

We will explore various elements of style, including diction, sentence structure, and rhythm, to help you develop a writing style that is both unique and effective. You will also learn how to adapt your style to suit different genres and audiences.\nIncorporate Themes and Subtext: A powerful story often contains layers of meaning beyond the surface narrative. You will learn how to weave themes and subtext into your story, adding depth and complexity that will resonate with readers on a deeper level.\nEdit and Revise Your Work: Writing is rewriting. This course will teach you how to approach the revision process with a critical eye, identifying areas for improvement and making changes that enhance the overall quality of your story. You will also learn how to give and receive constructive feedback, an essential skill for any writer.\nBuild Confidence in Your Writing: Writing can be a challenging and sometimes daunting process, but with the right guidance and support, you can overcome self-doubt and develop the confidence to share your stories with the world. This course will provide you with the encouragement and tools you need to believe in your abilities and take your writing to the next level.\nCertification\nUpon successful completion of the course, learners will receive a Certificate of Completion that can be added to their resumes and LinkedIn profiles to showcase their storytelling and writing skills to potential employers.\nCourse Structure and Content\nThe course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a different aspect of storytelling.

Using a straightforward photo reference, we’ll work step by step from blank paper to a finished, cohesive drawing—learning not just what to do but why each step matters.\n\n\nWe’ll begin by walking through the basic tools you’ll need, including a small set of graphite pencils in a range of values, drawing paper, tape, erasers, and a ruler. I’ll show you how to select the right pencils, prepare your workspace, and set up your frame so you’re ready to begin.\n\n\nFrom there, you’ll learn how to:\n• Measure accurately from a reference photo to achieve correct proportions\n• Apply shading and mark-making techniques to create depth and dimension\n• Use light and dark values to build a realistic and unified image\n• Blend edges for softness while maintaining sharpness where needed\n• Work gradually across the whole drawing so it develops evenly and cohesively\n\n\nThis course is meant to be lighthearted but focused—providing a serious introduction to graphite drawing while encouraging an open mind and positive attitude. By the end, you’ll have not only a finished drawing but also a strong foundation of skills to carry into future projects. My hope is that you’ll find the process both enriching and enjoyable, sparking creativity and pride in your work.",

You will also learn performing tricks and techniques that take the \"scariness\" out of performing.  These techniques are also great if you want to be a better speaker, or just a funnier person in everyday life.  Learn from Steve North the Comedy Coach has been voted #1 Comedy Coach at over 12 national comedy festivals, and has appeared on TV and seminars all over the world.  And, most importantly, you will learn that your greatest comedy resource is ... you.  Steve will help you find and convert  your own unique traits, behaviors and attitudes into great comedy material.  There is a feeling of joy when you realize that your flaws and what you think of as your limitations turn out to be your greatest asset when you do comedy.  It's simply a matter of taking these \"shortcomings of behavior\", exaggerating them, and presenting them to an audience through your \"blind spot.\"  And, Voila, Comedy !",

Why can't you be the one to release something that releases the atmosphere of Heaven over peoples lives?\n\nAs a minister who trains and teaches creatives across the globe, I also see so many of us stuck in the same patterns - for example, really gifted people however they have no plan or map or even an idea of how God wants to use you and what gifts he has placed inside of you.\nYou don't have to live like that. God is giving you an invitation to live your best life, and I would be honoured to be a part of that journey.\n\nThis online course is jam packed not just with information but tools -  I want to give you a tool belt. I want to give you an action plan, I want to help release you into all God has for you.\n\nSo what's in the course?\nHow you can create with impact & release God's presence through your worship/art;\nHow to Hear from God for your future dreams;\nDeal with rejection, brokenness & how to receive healing;\nGoal setting & Direction - tools to dream your future with an action plan to get there;\nActivation exercises to help you get to the core of what you were born for;\nYour secret weapon in times of discouragement and fear;\nI've also included a PDF of impacting identity statements you can use to drive out some of those negative thought processes that can plague your success;\nAnd finally there are also a prayer you can print out that will help you overcome the root of rejection and dissapointment, as well as a daily prayer you can pray based on the Lords Prayer in scripture - but I've tailored especially for artists.\nI'm excited about what we can achieve together when we have vision, passion, and healing in our lives.\nI would love you to join me as we explore together how to overcome obstacles so that you can be the God Artist God has destined you to be.

All writers benefit when exposed to classic and groundbreaking texts ... and to careful, unexpected analysis. In this six-part, nearly one-hour course, Beth Kephart, an award-winning memoirist, teacher at the University of Pennsylvania, and author of Handling the Truth: On the Writing of Memoir, celebrates the form. She explores the work of Virginia Woolf, E.B. White, Annie Dillard, James Baldwin, Mary-Louise Parker, Alison Bechdel, Helen Macdonald, Maggie Nelson, and others as she defines what great memoir does and how it gets written. Each video is organized around a theme. Silence and writer's block. The art of the intimate letter. Lessons from the kitchen. Writing of loss. Writing the natural world. Memory and mortality. Each theme yields a series of writer prompts. The entire package is accompanied by a PDF writer's journal that recaps key lessons and prompts.The series is perfect for writers, of course. But it is also just right for avid memoir readers who are seeking to better understand the books they read, as well as instructors at the high school, college, and workshop level.",

Why take that valuable time?\nIt's All Here!\nNow, I know what you're going to say.You're going to object. You're going to say that there can't possibly be an easy way to write a novel. A whole novel? As in 80,000 to 100,000 words?\nWell, I used to think the same way. I believed that there was some mystery to being an author. That it was something I wanted but maybe I could never achieve. I was terrified of the seemingly enormous task of writing a book.\nBut, let me tell you, I wish I'd had this system when I started out. That's why I wrote it. It's the book I would have most wanted to have by my side when I started writing.A program that could have saved me years of hard earned experience!\nListen... I know what it's like to be poor - and it sucks.\nI remember being so poor I once prayed for divine help - that's how desperate (and pathetic) I was!\n\nYears ago, I was living in the virtual gutter. Dirt poor. Always struggling to pay the bills. Crazy, because I was working nine to five jobs - with various partners and children - living the \"normal” life like everyone else - and yet I had the least amount of money!\nI hated normal life because I felt empty and dissatisfied.\nI knew I had so much to offer but each day that passed seemed like a missed opportunity. I began to think I would go to my grave having given nothing to the world.\nEvery day, I grew more depressed until the turn of the last millennium – when I knew I just had to get myself together and simply change my life!\nSure, I’d written stories before, but THIS TIME, I decided, it would be different.\nI would go all out to make it work!\nOnly when I listened to my heart and intuition and gave it my all to start on my dream - to write for a living - did everything fall into place. Within less than a year I was earning more than double as a writer than I'd ever earned in an office job.\nThe catch?\nI had to write.\nIn that first year of freelance writing I wrote three e-books, seven short stories, two online writing courses and finally finished a massive novel.\nAll that changed my life, put me on the road to where I am now. Happy, fulfilled.\nThe Truth of It\n25 years ago I was a struggling artist, scraping together money from wherever I could find it. I wrote and wrote, eventually getting published. It was hard. It was harder because I had no blueprint, no concise advice to follow.I'm a professional writer now - and have been for over a decade! I've written numerous books, screenplays, stage-plays, articles, columns and short stories. I've been published all over the English speaking world. It's been good for me.\nBut the truth is I would never have taken this career without my love of writing. I love writers, if you can understand that, because they inspired me to do what I do.For this reason, I've always felt somehow indebted. That's why I want to give back to writers something useful.\nMy Commitment to You\nI've been a writer all my life.\nI'm passionate about writing. Ask any of my students and they'll tell you. My great aim is to help writers no matter where they're at - to succeed. I'm dedicated wholeheartedly to this one objective.\nI've also been a voracious reader since I was very young. Even now, I read 3-4 books every week - without fail. In the last year or so, I've read all the Internet has to offer on the subject of writing and self-help in this area.It is because of this that I can honestly say that this course is the best, the most complete, and the most radical new way of looking at this age-old subject that you will ever come across!\nThe Facts\nI'm going to let you in on a secret now. Good writing can be taught.\nYou don't need to be a genius, or hugely talented or even clever. Good writing can be taught.\nHave you ever been amazed by an author's success? Especially when their writing is average? There's a reason for it.The truth is anyone, with the right guidance, can create compelling fiction. Anyone can write a brilliant novel. Yep. Even you.\nDon't Believe Me?\nAsk yourself this. What makes a good book nowadays? A good read? A good story? Or well written prose and intelligent sounding words?\nThe fact is, modern publishers don't want great literary writing. They want stories because it's stories that sell!That's why agents and publishers continually reject a great writer and take a brilliant novel every time!Best news? Something that even publishers don't know?There are ways of creating those stories. Ways that I can show you.Here's another recent unsolicited testimonial:\nDoes this Sound Like You?\nOver the years, I've worked with thousands of writers, on all kinds of projects. The same excuses keep coming up.I don't have the time to writeI can't get my head around this story - it's too hard\nI don't know where to start\nI'm not good enough\nI can't get this character right\nThis plot doesn't work as well I thought it would\nYou've probably used a few of these yourself in the past.The fact is all the above excuses are the result of wrong thinking. That's where my Easy Writing System can help you most. It goes right to heart of writers' problems and deconstructs them from the inside out.There are solutions to the problems writers face and I've found them, used them with terrific success and now, distilled them down into one incredible system!You've just got to get hold of it!\nBut, as I said, I know what it's like to be poor.\nI grew up in a working-class home on a council housing estate in a dormitory town in the UK. My dad was a lorry driver and my mum a seamstress. My sister and I went to crappy public schools with thousands of other working-class kids. Nobody thought we had anything going for us and my parents constantly told me not to expect too much from life.\nIt sounds bad but I honestly used to loathe my home life and what I'd been taught to look forward to. Even at a young age, as a consequence, I vowed to do something different.\nTo BE different...\nI promised myself I'd be an artist. A musician, a writer, whatever, it didn’t matter. It was only important that I be a creator – someone who was in control of their life and tried to make a difference, make a contribution to the world.\nI didn’t want to be a poor nobody – the kind of person my parents steered me to be.\nI wanted to be an author.\nBut not only that. I wanted to be a rich and famous author, too. And live in a big country house, be a lord of the manor, and have thousands of eager fans waiting for my next magnum opus…\nOkay, I got that but – at the time – twenty years ago – I often wondered how was I ever going to make that happen.\nHOW?\nI needed a road map – a complete instruction manual.\nOf course, in those days, there weren’t things around like that. In the old days, there was nothing like this course…\nSo, for years, I floundered until I finally understood that the secret to success is that you have to create new things and sell them to people - and so, if you're a writer, you have to create stories – novels ideally - and then sell them, and…\n...that's how you get successful!\nEven NOW.\nI could go on - but really, the best way for you to appreciate this course is to take it.\nI promise, you'll have the time of your life.\nJoin me - and I'll personally help you as much as I can to get YOUR novel written and OUT THERE.\nClick the purchase link below before the special price expires!\nTRANSFORM YOUR LIFE - ONCE and for all!\nWrite and Sell Your Own Novel - Starting Now!",

The carefully-crafted lessons provide an in-depth look at the various aspects needed to write a story for young readers. This course is aimed at anyone who wants to know more about writing for children and to be inspired to begin or continue their own writing journey. The course covers 12 different topics, all related to writing for children, including writing techniques, examples, 7 writing exercises and practical information on how to publish your book and working with an artist. In addition, I will be sharing some of my own experiences as a self-published author. Let's get started writing engaging stories.\n\nAnne-Lene Bleken (b. 1966) is a former high school teacher and an author of children’s books, novels, and short stories. She teaches courses in Writing for Children and is the owner of two publishing companies, where she publishes stories in English, Danish and Norwegian. She comes from Lillehammer in Norway, with strong roots in the Western part of the country where her mother's family comes from.

I will have you set goals, focus your intentions, and build up your confidence to share your work with the world.\nThis course is interactive. I’ll have you pause from viewing to do writing exercises to clarify the type of writer you wish to be and what your dream career looks like. This isn’t just a quick-view course. Success means something different to everyone - I want to help you find a path that feels meaningful to you.\n\n\nWhy haven’t you moved forward with your publishing career?\nAre you worrying too much about what other people will say about your work?\nDon’t know where to start?\nThink you aren’t a real writer?\nCan’t get past the gatekeepers?\nCan’t finish your book?\nWorry that you will fail?\nWe must push past all our fears and setbacks and keep moving forward. This course will help you overcome the hurdles that have prevented you from the writing career you desire.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn all about:\n· The traditional and indie publishing worlds\n· Building a career as an author\n· Overcoming fear and doubt\n· Deciding if a traditional writing education is right for you\n· How to revise and edit your manuscript\n· How to build a creative community around you\n· How and where to get your work published\n· Life as a rebel writer\n· And so much more.\n\n\nIf you were looking for a traditional publishing 101 class you’ve come to the wrong place. I want to push you to think outside the box when it comes to a writing career. I want you to always be questioning what success means to you.\n\n\n“He is careful of what he reads, for that is what he will write. He is careful of what he learns, for that is what he will know.”\n― Annie Dillard\n\n\nWhat students are saying about the course:\n“Amazing course!! I'm learning a ton.” -Jackie M\n“I love this course - super helpful and insightful! Thank you so much for all of this valuable information.” – Michelle H.\n“Having already completed the Rebel Memoir course, I knew that this one would have the same down-to-earth approach by Libby. As though being sat in a cafe with her chatting. What Libby delivers in this course, which I found very useful, was not only the amount of information and detail she gives about things like social media, publishing and so forth. But I also discovered how to approach certain institutions, such as Libraries, bookshops, which I had jotted down as areas needed to contact when self-publishing. I also learnt about online pitch events that I never even knew existed and now know how they work. Although some of Libby's examples, say for instance names of big stores, are ones in America, for that is where she lives, despite this and my living in the UK, the actual content of the advice is relevant so can be put to use here too. When Libby says she is there for you and to please get in touch with her on social media, her words are not false. I reached out after completing the Rebel Memoir course and I feel doing so has meant I have a great, genuine, contact within the writing community.” – Penny W.\n\n\nAre you ready to invest in yourself and your writing career?",

      "description": "In this course, we cover the roots of religious beliefs all around the world, Shamanism. We cover various religious methods from many different backgrounds and as a student, by the end of this course, you will have a firm grasp on how religious ideas emerged, where they came from, but most importantly you will have a firm concept of how you can experience shamanic states for yourself. This course is designed to teach students how to have their OWN religious experience. Specifically, we talk about sensory deprivation, meditation, psychedelics, and psychotropics, as well as a variety of other religious methods designed to help a shaman or initiate enter the spirit world. Our primary resource, or textbook if you will, is Michael Harner's The Way of the Shaman.\nThis classic on shamanism pioneered the modern shamanic renaissance. It is the foremost resource and reference on shamanism. Now, with a new introduction and a guide to current resources, anthropologist Michael Harner provides the definitive handbook on practical shamanism – what it is, where it came from, how you can participate.\n\"Wonderful, fascinating… Harner really knows what he's talking about.\"\nCARLOS CASTANEDA\n\"An intimate and practical guide to the art of shamanic healing and the technology of the sacred. Michael Harner is not just an anthropologist who has studied shamanism; he is an authentic white shaman.\"\nSTANILAV GROF, author of 'The Adventure Of Self Discovery'\n\"Harner has impeccable credentials, both as an academic and as a practising shaman. Without doubt (since the recent death of Mircea Eliade) the world's leading authority on shamanism.\"\nNEVILL DRURY, author of 'The Elements of Shamanism'\nMichael Harner, Ph.D., has practised shamanism and shamanic healing for more than a quarter of a century. He is the founder and director of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies in Norwalk, Connecticut",

The focus is on building essential drawing skills while also cultivating an artistic mindset—balancing technical mechanics with personal interpretation.\n\n\nWe’ll start with the basic materials and setup, then move into accurate measuring and careful drawing to create a realistic framework for your landscape. From there, I’ll guide you through shading, value-building and different kinds of blending to create varying degrees of softness. Through technique, we will explore bringing depth, light, and atmosphere into your drawing. Along the way, we’ll talk about what to focus on, what to let go of, and how to let the spirit of the subject guide your hand.\n\n\nIn this class, you will learn how to:\n• Choose and set up simple charcoal materials\n• Measure accurately from a photo reference for a balanced composition\n• Use value, shading, and blending to create depth and realism\n• Apply texture to suggest natural elements\n• Approach drawing with openness and interpretation, not just technique\n\n\nBy the end, you’ll have a finished charcoal landscape and a set of practical tools that you can apply to future drawings. More importantly, you’ll have begun to explore the mindset that transforms technical drawing skills into a more personal, expressive art practice.",

      "description": "What’s the one feature of humans that makes us stand alone in the animal kingdom? It’s our ability to imagine possibilities…and to imagine requires creativity.\nCreativity is the most fundamentally human of qualities and a unique trait of our species.\nIt’s the most important asset we have to negotiate through this rapidly changing world. From the way we manage our work life and conduct business, to how we learn a new skill, model behaviours for our children and shape the way we age to express our unique selves, the creative brain has no limits.\nThe neuroscience points to the growing understanding into what’s going on in the brain’s of highly creative thinkers and practitioners, as well as the power of brain plasticity. The brain turns out to be far more adaptable and, with the right sort of triggers, can be rewired. Creativity is whole brain activity and the more we understand this, the better we can enhance our own and others’ creative abilities.\nThis program seeks to reveal the science that’s building our understanding of why some of us are more creative. What happens at the intersection of science and creativity is no longer a mystery or based on myth.\nOf even more relevance, creativity is a skill that can be learnt and practiced, with studies showing that creativity is close to eighty percent learned and acquired.\nThis program is curated from the latest research from the world’s most renowned experts and thinkers in the fields of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social science and psychology.\nThe good news is that anyone can learn to be more creative, incorporate creative thinking into the everyday life choices and learn to resolve the challenges of doubt, failure and mediocrity that may limit their potential. The secret is there are no tricks or magic formulas but there are strategies, tools and a mindset that, if you stick with, can set you apart to create a distinct creative advantage.",

      "description": "This is my hope for you. That as you journey through these next 5 weeks, you will have a sense of how GOD has gifted you with a creativity that is uniquely yours. Maybe you ALREADY have a sense of where you thrive creatively. This may be an opportunity to incorporate this section of your life into your spiritual practice. This may be a time to try a new creative medium. Whatever place you find yourself, remember during this point in time you will journey through this course as YOU NEED TO.\nYou will hear from me and from 5 other Christian creatives about their discovery of their creative voices and the stops and starts they have experienced in the process.\nYou will have a chance to journal about your creativity life and your spiritual life through linger questions offered at the end of each section.\nYou will also receive 6 30 minute video tutorials that are geared toward the topics for each week. You can choose to create these projects or work on any project you are interested in, allowing this course to inspire you to complete it. These videos give you step by step instructions to create using easy to find materials.\nI have also included inspiring videos to enhance this experience included with each day's questions.\nA little more about me:\nMy name is Robin Norgren and I am creative. Guess what? You are creative too though you may have some hesitation calling yourself creative. Maybe someone else in your family or your group of friends is considered the 'creative' one. This course will help you not only expand your idea of how to define someone as creative but also convince that YOU are creative.\nMaybe you already acknowledge that you are creative but you are unsure how to integrate creativity as a spiritual practice. This course will help you to do that. I take my story as a self proclaimed 'noncreative' and let you in on how God fully CONVINCED me that not only did I have a creative voice but that it could be utilized as a tool of healing and comfort not only of my past but in times of need in my present and future. AND also a source of encouragement and strength for those around me.\nWhy is this subject an important one?\nI believe that we each have a set of challenges and struggles in our lives that there it no getting away from. Maybe you were fortunate in that you did not experience childhood trauma. If however, you did go through such pain, maybe you tried the conventional route of counseling and found some healing but maybe there are DEEP down parts of the scars that you simply can't get to with talk therapy. This is where creativity can come in like a healing balm and reach you, change you, perhaps HEAL you in ways you never imagined.\nPerhaps you are experiencing pain right now or anxiety or extreme stress that you cannot articulate but you know you need to work through. I have found that creativity may just be the healing balm you are looking for. Not only will it help you to gain tranquility within, but it might possibly clear the path for you to gain clarity on your situation.\nWho is this course for?\nYou should take this course if you are looking specifically to explore your Creativity as a Christian spiritual practice. Are you ready to walk with God through these beautiful creative outlets?\nYou should take this course if you understand your creative life as a spiritual one and want to experience creativity projects where the instructor speaks freely and her walk with God and her relationship with Jesus Christ as she creates.\nYou should take this course if you are looking for a bible study or devotional that infuses creativity into the study.\nYou should take this course if you are just learning or need a refresher on how to listen to your creative voice and would like a Creativity Facilitator to walk alongside you.\nAt the end of this course, you will deepen your relationship with God and gain a love of the creative process as a spiritual discipline.",

      "description": "Welcome to this online course from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, brought to you in partnership with David and Charles. You are about to embark on a journey into botanical illustration – a very enjoyable art form that requires attention to detail, focussing your attention on the astounding variation found in nature. Pen and ink is often the medium chosen for documenting new species of flowering plants – everything is drawn to scale to show the characteristics of the plant. In this course, we’ll use a stargazer lily as it’s a large flower with robust structures that are visible to the naked eye. These captivating flowers are loved and admired for their wonderfully large and colourful blooms with prominent spots and a distinctly heady fragrance. You will be led step-by-step through the process of drawing the lily, starting with basic botany and careful observation of the flower. We’ll use precise measurements to guide our drawing to create an accurate representation.\nAs an online course, this learning experience allows you to follow at your own pace – enjoy the process and you will enjoy the results! You can watch each section as many times as you need, and you can pause at any point to focus on your work before moving on.",

I also co-wrote the screenplay for the feature film “Saving Dinah.” I’m represented by Writers House, one of the largest literary agencies in the world.\nSo I speak to you as writer to writer, teaching the techniques you need to craft a book that can compete in the marketplace. I know what agents and publishers are looking for, what they want — and don’t want.\nPraise for my novels:\n“Riveting Tudor drama” — USA Today\n“A classic historical novel – sweeping, gritty and realistic.” — Historical Novel Society\n“A haunting thriller…Kyle keeps the cinematic action scenes and nail-biting suspense rolling throughout.” — Publishers Weekly\n“Wonderfully intelligent, highly readable, and thoroughly entertaining.” — New York Times best-selling author Heather Graham\n“Kyle is a master at her craft.” — RT Book Reviews\n\n\nPraise for my book for writers, Page-Turner: Your Path To Writing A Novel That Publishers Want And Readers Buy:\n“Kyle breaks down both the art and the craft of writing in a way that is entertaining and easy to understand.” — #1 New York Times bestselling author Kelley Armstrong\n“Brings alive almost every tough issue a writer of fiction must confront…friendly and fun to read.\"— Albert Zuckerman, Writers House literary agency\n“Page-Turner is the quintessential book for writing that breakout novel\" — Goodreads\n\n\nI’m an acclaimed writing coach and a frequent presenter at international writers’ conferences.

The videos offer a wealth of examples for story development. Your course was the boost I needed. Thank you.” — Linda Sievers\n\n\nThere are no rules in writing. Well, except this one: “Thou shalt not bore.”\nBut although there are no hard rules, there are principles that have shaped the art of storytelling for centuries. I apply these time-tested criteria about plot, character, and style (which led to the international success of my own novels) so you can strategically apply them to your writing.\nWriting a novel is a fulfilling adventure. If you have a story to tell, I’ll help you tell it and share it with the world.\nEnroll today — and start on the path to writing a page-turner!",

Is it about personality? Is it about unique creativity? Is it self expression? Is it manipulation?\nDo authors choose their style, or does it develop naturally?\nIn this course I will dispel the mystery, and you will learn how to choose and apply style.\nBuild your writing style on solid creative and technical foundations\n... through three critical relationships\nyour relationship with language\nyour relationship with words\nyour style choices\nThrough both lectures and exercises, I'll show you how style is about informed choice; and you'll learn what you need to begin developing your style, and making choices that will both serve your story and please your readers, and make your work instantly recognizable.\n\nCourse Content\nOver an hour of lectures, with exercises that are a lot more than just repetitive practice. Each lecture is a lesson in style development, and each exercise will change the way you think about creative writing, and develop the cognitive tools you use to turn your story ideas into actual narration.\nEach lecture comes with a handout to download, with either factual information, useful links, or additional commentary on some of the ideas and techniques, as well as the exercise instructions written in full.",

This course will help you make sure that the novel you're writing is in fact YA; how to prepare query letters to literary agents; a few things to never do; and great resources to help you on your way once you've finished the class.\n\n\nLike its namesake, this genre is always in a state of flux, maturing and regressing on almost a daily basis. This course is fundamental for those writers who either think they should write YA because it's \"hot,\" or those writers who want to write YA because they feel compelled to do so. Both camps will learn by the end of this course whether or not Young Adult fiction really is their niche.\n\n\nYA is really about your Voice, and how authentic your words sound on the page. Another element of this course is helping you to understand what that authenticity sounds like. One thing is certain about YA over adult genres: If the reader thinks you are preaching or talking down to them, they'll throw that book away as hard and fast as possible. You can sometimes fool an adult; teens are almost impossible. So don't try! Learn how to write compelling fiction for that age range before trying to publish yourself or send your novel out to agents or editors.",

But if you are very serious, and stakes are high at all times, you'll be afraid to try new things, and you won't grow.\nIn this course, you'll learn about balancing when and how to be playful and creative in the things that are most important for you so you can find novel and creative solutions that are levels above what's been done before.\nEXERCISES TO PRACTICE YOUR CREATIVE SKILLS\nIt's not enough to just learn about creativity. You have to test your skills at it. There will be a number of exercises to help you try  to find creative solutions in low-stakes scenarios.\nLEARN ABOUT HOW A LEVEL OF CREATIVITY CHANGES WITH EXPERIENCE\nIf you're new at any given skill, you'll have a high number of creative solutions. They may not be great, but that will be creative. As you gain experience in a field, you no longer need to be creative since you have proven methods for doing things. But if you can keep your creativity deliberately up as experience grows, you'll find better and more useful creative solutions to problems.\nPHASES OF CREATIVITY\nWhen we engage in a creative process, there are actually at least two stages to that process. The first phase of creativity is to think as broadly as possible and gather as many ideas or options as possible.\nThe second phase of creativity and go through all the creative ideas you've gathered, and edit them to make sense.\nThe analogy for this would be the relationship between a creative writer and an editor. But in most cases of engaging in creativity, you must be both, the creative person and the editor. The combination of both of these will ensure that your creative works achieve high quality and resonate with people who may consume your creative works.\nCREATIVITY CAN BE APPLIED ANYWHERE IN YOUR LIFE\nMost people think that creativity is something you need during the creative process of making art or music. But I would encourage you to add creativity to just about every part of your life from problem-solving to professional work to personal life. Think outside the box all the time. It's a fun challenge you can take on every moment of your life, and the best part if that the results will often positively surprise you.\nMAKE CREATIVITY A PART OF YOUR IDENTITY - YOU ARE A CREATIVE PERSON\nMake everything you do creative, and live your live creatively. It's more fun, and a creatively-lived life is more fascinating moment-to-moment. Take pride in your creativity, and have it enrich every facet of your life.\nHOW HAVING A CREATIVE LIFE WILL CHANGE YOU\nInstead of doing the same old thing that everyone else does simply because it's the thing to do, you will think for yourself, and do the more enjoyable things that inspire and interest you. Separate yourself from the boring lifestyles of people around you.\nInstead of being a consumer of other people's entertainment, content, or products, turn yourself into a person who uses creativity to create content or product that other people consumer or buy.\nWhen you always come up with new ways of doing things or new solutions, you will become the thought leader people pay attention to, and follow.\nInvest in your future!

Therefore in order to master these elements we have divided the classes in small parts so that the students can learn each of these individual elements first, master them and then move on to the other levels. While line is the backbone of miniature painting.\nEyes, hands, legs :- Being an intricate art of line and detailing no part of the painting can be left out.

Even though the anatomy resembles realism there is a different technique involved to make them as traditional hands. Learn that through these very easily designed classes.\nEyes :- Eyes form the beauty of the face and play a very important role in the painting. Each school has a different eye kind. Learn them through this class.\nFace/Side face :- Just like hand, legs and eyes face also forms an integral part of the miniature painting. While it looks similar to realistic painting the techniques to create a miniature face are unique.\nThis course will give insights into how to draw a face in the Indian Traditional Painting. It will also throw light on the subtle differences between the faces, noses, turbans, hair from the different schools and male-female.",

Schools, to some extent, under emphasize that. If you can't communicate and talk to other people and get across your ideas, you're giving up your potential.\"\n\n\nWith this course, you will learn creative presentation & speaking skills in a short time. Find out what really matters & what you can leave out. Challenge your mind the right way & take your audience on a journey they'll never forget!\n\n\nThis course is not the typical learning style. I use an unconventional teaching style that is anything but boring (most lectures on speaking can be boring) But strap on your seatbelts to keep up with this fast-paced & practical course.\n\n\nWe are going to let you practice by example & methodology. You'll understand not just how to structure your speeches & presentation but also how to breathe life into every word so that they all count. You're going to learn simple methods that skyrocket your performance & speed up your learning curve!\n\n\nI'll see you inside for a journey that you'll never forget!",

Releasing your story as a novel is a great way to get it out there and see if you can find an audience. This could help Hollywood take notice. Novelizing your script is also a way to share your story with the world and not wait anymore. Especially in the age when self-publishing is available to all of us. I got tired of waiting for \"Hollywood\" to decide my stories were worth telling and started getting into the novelizations process after my film, The Ultimate Gift, was produced. I've done six of these now. One novelization on my own, and five with my writing partner, Rene Gutteridge, who has been a published novelist over thirty times. She's also a produced screenwriter. This class will walk you through what has to change from screenwriting to novel writing. Rene Gutteridge joins me for quite a few of the video lectures so you have an expert in screenwriting and an expert in novel writing teaching this class. Each section has PDF downloads. Together these include all segments of our published book Novelizations: How to Adapt Scripts Into Novels. You'll see real live samples from many of our published works so you can get a complete understanding for how a screenplay translates into the very different writing form of a novel.\nPLEASE NOTE: Udemy estimates this class has 4.5 hours of lecture content. This includes both video lectures and written PDF documents. The run time on video content is approx. 100 minutes.",

I want you to feel comfortable using this cursive style in everyday situations. So we’ll start by going over the component strokes and the rules, and then it’s up to you how many you want to break as we go on practicing individual letters, and writing words and phrases.\nSince you will be learning a new way of writing, it doesn’t matter what your handwriting looks like now. So feel free to get back into a beginners mindset, which means this might be frustrating at first, but if you keep at it, you’ll see progress in no time.\nYou'll also find three extra lessons where I'll demo warm-up drills and exercises, and we'll also take a quick look at the Palmer method for handwriting, and the differences between Spencerian handwriting, Spencerian Calligraphy, and Spencerian Letting.\nReady?

      "description": "\"Color is a power which directly influences the soul.\" — Wassily Kandinsky\nIsn’t that such a compelling thought? Just imagine walking into a room bathed in warm amber light—you instinctively feel cozy, maybe even nostalgic. But then, think of standing under harsh fluorescent blue lights in a hospital. Cold. Sterile. Maybe even a little uneasy, right? That’s not just your imagination playing tricks on you. That’s color psychology at work.\nLet’s explore this fascinating world where color meets cognition, where hues shape how we think, feel, and act, often without us even realizing it. The idea that color influences mood isn’t new—ancient Egyptians used colored light for healing rituals. Fast forward to modern times, and researchers have backed those ancient intuitions with data-driven findings that make color psychology a cornerstone in everything from marketing to mental health interventions.\nWe begin our journey with the basics of color theory. You’ve probably heard of the color wheel—primary, secondary, complementary colors—but did you know that the human eye can distinguish about 10 million different colors? What’s more fascinating is how each of these colors can trigger unique emotional and psychological responses. For example, studies show that blue consistently ranks as the world's most popular color. Why? Because it conveys trust, calm, and stability—no wonder it's used in the branding of banks, tech companies, and health institutions.\nSpeaking of branding, let’s talk business. Have you ever noticed how McDonald’s uses red and yellow? It's not random. Red stimulates appetite and urgency, while yellow evokes happiness and attention. Combine the two and boom—fast food magic. In fact, color increases brand recognition by up to 80%, according to a study by the University of Loyola, Maryland. And here's a kicker—research published in Management Decision found that customers make up their mind within 90 seconds of an interaction with a product, and up to 90% of that judgment is based on color alone.\nNow, let’s zoom into the world of marketing psychology. You know that feeling when you see a sleek, all-black product and immediately associate it with luxury or exclusivity? That's no accident. Luxury brands like Chanel and Rolls Royce use black because it’s linked to sophistication, power, and elegance. On the flip side, green is increasingly being used in branding by eco-conscious companies because it signals health, nature, and sustainability.\nBut the power of color doesn’t stop at consumer behavior. It extends deep into our creative consciousness. Think about Van Gogh’s \"Starry Night\"—those swirling blues and yellows. Or Picasso’s \"Blue Period\", where he painted almost exclusively in shades of blue to reflect depression and isolation. Artists have long known that color is emotion made visible. And designers? They’re the modern-day magicians of mood. Interior designers, for instance, often use cool tones in bedrooms to promote relaxation, while restaurants prefer warmer tones to encourage appetite and conversation.\nLet’s not forget the role of culture. Color meanings can shift dramatically across cultural lines. In Western societies, white is associated with purity and weddings, but in many Eastern cultures, it symbolizes mourning. A study published in Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology found that color preferences and emotional responses vary widely based on cultural conditioning, which means a red logo might excite someone in China but feel aggressive to someone in Scandinavia. So, if you're designing a product or campaign for a global audience, color becomes more than a choice—it’s a strategy.\nYou may wonder, what about color in health and learning environments? Excellent question. Ever noticed how hospitals are often painted in soft greens and blues? It’s not just aesthetic—it’s therapeutic. These colors reduce anxiety, lower heart rate, and promote healing. In educational spaces, color can influence focus and memory retention. According to a study in Color Research & Application, students in blue classrooms performed better on tests requiring creative thinking, while red environments boosted performance in detail-oriented tasks.\nNow let’s look at how color affects behavior in real-life case studies. In one study conducted by the University of British Columbia, researchers found that participants exposed to red were better at tasks that required attention to detail, while blue led to more creative and exploratory thinking. Another study from the University of Rochester discovered that exposure to the color red prior to taking a test reduced performance, suggesting that even brief exposure to certain colors can affect cognitive functioning.\nOf course, not everything is universal. Individual experiences, cultural context, and even age and gender play a role in how we perceive color. Children tend to prefer bright primary colors, while older adults may gravitate toward subtle, muted tones. Gender also influences preferences—studies show that while men prefer bold colors like blue and green, women are more drawn to softer hues like lavender and turquoise.\nWhat’s on the horizon for color psychology? Well, tech companies are investing heavily in color-responsive interfaces—think smart lighting systems that adapt to your mood or AI-powered design tools that suggest color palettes based on emotional goals. Even wearable tech is being developed to monitor emotional responses to color in real time. The future is not just colorful—it’s emotionally intelligent.\nSo, as we journey through this course together, my goal is not just to teach you what colors mean, but to show you how to use them intentionally—to evoke the right feelings, to tell a story, to design with purpose, and ultimately, to make your projects more powerful and emotionally resonant.\nBecause whether you're crafting a brand, designing a space, or simply choosing the right outfit for a big day, color is speaking—the question is: are you listening?\nLet’s unlock that language, together.",

      "description": "Join me, Dr Nevine Nasser, on a transformational journey exploring the meaning of life using the language of sacred geometry. We will explore the philosophy of sacred geometry that describes reality/the universe as unfolding from a transcendent  origin, in the same way as a pattern unfolds from a centre. We will see how nested geometric shapes and ratios underlie the fractal order of the natural world and the cosmos.\nWe will also learn some history and share illustrated examples from the natural world and from sacred architecture that demonstrate the pinnacle of this art form.\nWe will learn to draw simple geometric shapes using compass and straight edge, as well as more complex sixfold patterns, such as \"the seed of life\" and \"the flower of creation\". We will also explore eightfold patterns such as \"the breath of the Compassionate\" as well as \"cosmograms\". Each section of the course contains practical worksheets that will unlock your creativity and allow you to spend as long as you like drawing shapes and patterns.\nThrough these practical exercises, you will experience how sacred geometry can be used as a tool not only for contemplating the nature of reality, but also for self-reflection. Sacred geometry can help us to refine our characters and to align ourselves to the order of nature and the cosmos, finding meaning, purpose, equilibrium and flow in our lives.\nThe knowledge presented in this course is a distillation of over 15 years of research and practice up to doctoral level, delivered by a professional architect specialised in sacred architecture. It is presented in a simple and concise way to help you learn the fundamentals of sacred geometry whilst experiencing its transformative effect. This course goes beyond gaining new information, it aims to transmit profound knowledge that becomes fully integrated through practice. The methods taught are based on traditional techniques passed down through the ages through unbroken chains of traditional arts practice all over the world, finding its source in the ancient Pythagorean tradition.\nThe course is arranged in 7 sections, with video lectures, practical worksheets and additional supplementary material.\nPlease do reach out if you have any questions, I would love to hear from you!",

Where there is universal truth, there is also great beauty and from this a feeling of sacredness naturally arises. In this class you will learn everything you need to draw and experience the sacredness of geometry.\nYou can draw in this class using a pencil, paper, compass, straightedge or using a free iOS app. In this course, I use Euclidea: Sketches, a 100% free iOS app, for the practical reason that it is far clearer to observe what I'm doing viewing my recorded iPad Pro screen than filming my drawing board.\nTo follow along with this course, you are welcome to use this app (or use another computer-aided drafting program), or draw by hand using the time-tested instruments of pencil, paper, compass and straightedge.\nThe following books are mentioned in the course; they're not required reading, but these are great books. If you end up loving geometry, you'll might want to eventually read some or all of these:\nDrawing Geometry by Jon Allen ISBN 9780863156083\nRuler & Compass by Andrew Sutton ISBN 9780802717764\nSacred Geometry by Robert Lawlor ISBN 9780500810309\nCity of Revelation by John Michell ISBN 9780345236074\nEuclid's Elements (first published circa 300 BCE, ISBN 9781375462631)",

Our workshops are based on the principles of Creative Problem Solving (CPS). CPS is the oldest, and best researched, of the deliberate creative problem solving processes. This course introduces you to the fundamental principles of creative behaviour, and teaches you the same methods we use when we are working with everyone from NASA, to the Government of New Zealand.\nThe course is designed around a few simple ideas:\nEveryone has the skill to think creatively\nYou can enhance this skill through practice\nWhen you are developing a new skill, you need to start with the right level of difficulty. Enough so that it challenges you, but not so much that you become deflated.\nYou will need to practice the skill for a few weeks before you really notice the difference. So, please don't try to rush through the course.\nNow for the most important point. You have to make time to learn. No matter how enthusiastic you are about this topic, life will get in the way. This is the main problem with online learning. It is incredibly easy to put to one side, and forget about. Don't let this happen to you. Book learning meetings with yourself, and make it a priority. None of the videos are very long, and the exercises are designed to fit in with your daily life.Course details.\nThe course is taught through a combination of 19 short videos (maximum 10 minutes), and guided practice. It comes with a workbook that you can fill in along with the lesson videos. Each video introduces you to a new element of the creative thinking process, and we will encourage you to apply the lesson to your normal daily routine. The videos build on each other, so over the course of a few weeks you will have learned a lot, and practiced even more!",

My ambition is to provide you with all the principles and techniques you need to create compelling stories. This class is primarily geared towards cinematic storytelling, but the principles and techniques presented here can just as easily be applied to writing plays or literature. My hope is that you, after completing this series, will see that creating compelling stories is not achieved by luck or magic — but, instead, by tangible and specific principles and methods, all of which you will learn in this class. The board game Othello boasts the slogan “one minute to learn, a lifetime to master”. I would never propose that the principles of storytelling only take a minute to learn — but you will find that the principles of storytelling are simple, clear and concise. Learning to employ them masterfully, however — that does take a lifetime.\nI have divided the entire course into three parts: 1) the aspects common to all characters, 2) the aspects specific to each character, and 3) the modus operandi of creating a compelling story from scratch. In this first part of the series, we take a helicopter view on the art of storytelling — we are looking at the playing field, and its contestants, from above.\nWelcome to the second part — aspects specific to each and every character!\n\n\nAll our classes include:\nLesson material\nQuestions and tip\nChapter exams\nHelpful links\nRich video clips",

      "description": "Acting skills will enrich your life in many ways, from making you more poised and effective in social and work situations, to helping you be more mentally flexible and adaptable to the changing environment around you. Plus, it is just plain fun!\nJoin me, Robert David Duncan, as I share with you the many lessons I have learned on my own journey to becoming an actor in mid-life. You don't have to be outgoing, loud, attention-seeking or any of the other common perceptions people may have about performers. The best actors are often quiet, thoughtful and in many cases quite reserved when they are not performing. The main thing is that you be yourself, have an openness to try new things and be willing to work steadily at building your acting tools.\nI start from a belief that all actors should have a baseline set of skills, including learning how to work with text, voice and physicality, as well as more intermediate skills like listening, reacting and improvising. As we move further along, we learn about more advanced tools such as imagination, emotions and empathy. As our skills build, we then consider what it is like to inhabit a character and how to make that character come alive in scenes in the company of other actors. Finally, we look at what it means to be the kind of actor everybody wants to work with, and how we can keep growing both as actors and people.\nThis is definitely not a course in becoming famous, or a set of shortcuts that get around the hard work of becoming a capable actor. Rather, it is all about that hard, unseen work that all good actors have had to put into learning their craft. One thing I can assure you is, if you do the work in this course, including keeping a learning journal and doing the practice exercises, you will develop a formidable bedrock of talent that nobody can take away from you. This will equip you with the kind of ability that lets you walk into a drama book store or library anywhere in the world, pick up a play or script and start work!\nPlease feel free to check me out on IMDb so you can get a sense of who I am and what I do. I have been fortunate to have studied at a very well-known drama school and have also worked with several great coaches, teachers and directors. They were most generous with me, and I would like to pay that forward by sharing with you what I have learned through years of training, experience, study and reading, and resolving what I've learned down to the very essentials for you. Please join us on this wonderful learning journey!",

Or they use the scene as an opportunity to advance the plot, reveal character, or simply make an impact through set-pieces. While there’s some validity to that, most amateur scenes tend to fall flat and disengage the reader, who ultimately tosses the script in the recycling bin. Writing great scenes requires talent, skill, know-how and practice. While the first two can’t be taught, you can learn what makes a great scene, recognize when a scene doesn’t work and why, and apply practical techniques as you craft dramatic scenes and receive feedback from the instructor.\nIf you want to elevate your scripts and stories – AND your screenwriting or filmmaking career -- to the highest possible level, this class is a must.\nThey DON'T teach you this in Film School!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat people are saying about our courses:\n\"By far, the best director and cinematography course on the Internet.\" - Nate Carroll\n\"I really enjoyed taking this class.

Adds depth to your understanding and intuitive insights which you surely had if you happened to play with video shooting and editing without doing any learning beforehand. It's enriching. The movie samples are great as the clarify the points. Love it! - Yosi Tsitsu\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn this online writing course you will learn:\nHow to craft and structure the basic dramatic scene\nEffective techniques to make your scene more compelling\nThe three types of scenes in a screenplay\nThe key elements of the pre-writing phase of a good scene\nThe most common scene problems and how to avoid them\nThe crucial distinction between passive and active conflict\nHow to use the Emotional Palette to create tension and anticipation\nAll about pacing, scene variety, and scene transitions\nHow to craft scene subtext\nWhether you are filmmaking as a pro, making movies on the weekends with a DSLR camera or deep into the craft of screenwriting this is for you.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is Karl Iglesias?\n\nKarl Iglesias is a screenwriter and sought-after script doctor and consultant, specializing in the reader's emotional response to the written page. He is the best-selling author of Writing For Emotional Impact and The 101 Habits of Highly Successful Screenwriters.

But why do some gaming videos rack up millions of views while others languish and struggle to get even a hundred views? It's all about creating great content that YouTube and the millions of viewers love. One of the things YouTube is obsessed with is watch-time. They track which videos their viewers watch and for how long.\nSo understanding how to create more engaging, interesting videos is key. You'll learn everything about that in this important module.\nYou will learn the best video editing software and how to start using it the right way.\nPlus, I'll share with you some key resources where you can find free audio you can use in your videos and even free video clips you can use for b-roll.\nWe go into some tips to make your channel \"sticky\" meaning how to keep retention.

Join me as I guide you down a path to discover your intuition, paint with intent and gain better access to a 'going with the flow' mentality.\nA recent experience delving back into art after many years feeling lost made me realize...\nPainting brought me peace and happiness, a sense of growth and inner healing. The level of healing was so tremendous, I started to feel the need to share. So much trauma had melted away, if only others knew... maybe they could achieve a similar healing outcome?!?\nI share my methods in hopes that others can benefit and heal as well from this wonderful healing art technique. Imagine a new revamped version of yourself... the one you've always dreamed of.\nThe goal of this course is to teach you how to paint your feelings and emotions on canvas. By doing so, they can be released into the painting allowing for the individual to find peace within the emotion. It’s like taking the bad, putting onto something and then having it transmute into wonderful healing goodness.\nWhat this course IS?\n-A guided Intuitive approach to healing through intent by painting our emotions, feelings, thoughts or situations on canvas.\n-An opportunity to remove energy blocks, release fear, heal past trauma or gain courage among many other possibilities.\n-A way to tap into your Intuition, reunite with your inner child or discover new aspects of yourself.\n-A method to remove the need for perfection.\nWhat this IS NOT?\n-A course on learning how to paint or learn specific painting techniques.

      "description": "Zentangle® is a meditative and therapeutic art form which revolves around certain structured patterns to create beautiful artwork. These patterns called as “Tangles” in Zentangle® terminology are very easy to learn by anybody with or without prior artistic background. They are made up of very elemental strokes which anyone can grasp very easily. The tangles have been designed in a fashion that they require your utmost attention, focus and awareness almost like meditating. Also, the Zentangle® method acts as an excellent therapy for kids and adults alike due to its ability to instill mindfulness.\n\n\nSo, till now we tangled on white tiles with black ink to create beautiful Zentangle® artwork. Tanglers are free to stick to black and white format with shades of grey even at advanced levels. However, having said that Zentangle® HQ provides a  wide variety of stationary such as the grey, black and tan (Renaissance) tiles in different shapes and sizes. This course is about moving from tangling in black and white to more neutral /toned surfaces and the best way to do that is to start with Grey and Tan tiles. Grey and Tan tiles provide excellent shading and highlighting opportunities with wider usage of both graphite and white charcoal pencils. It also opens up the gates to explore and experiment many techniques such as layering tiles, giving the embossed effect and also using colored pens and pencils beautifully. It also allows more extensive use of the White GellyRoll pens and a whole lot of other stationary.\nThe objective of this course is to provide that gradual transition from white tile tangling to greys and tan and subsequently black surfaces. This will not only enrich your tool kit but also take your Zentangle® practice to the next level.\nContents of the course:\n1. Introduction\n2, Tools and Supplies\n3. Shading and Highlighting - White Vs Toned paper\n4.Embellishments - White Vs Toned paper\n5.Backgrounds and Layering - White Vs Toned paper\n6. Use of Color Stationary on Toned paper\n7.Zenbossing - Originally by Anica Gabrovec CZT\n8.Conclusion\nSo lets get started. Enjoy tangling!!",

When you apply the techniques to your writing, they will soon become habits, which will cut your editing time and costs if you are going to publish your book.\nThese techniques work with fictional and non-fictional writing. The techniques can also help college and high school students write stronger papers.\nEach lecture includes a short video explanation, a technique to apply to your writing, and additional exercises to reinforce the technique. There are also various handouts for quick reference to be used with future writing projects. These techniques will make the reader experience more enjoyable, and when readers enjoy your writing, you will sell more books.\nAs you go through the course, you will be using your own manuscript or written piece. Writing prompts are provided for those who have no prior writing samples.\nThe time required to go through the course will vary with each student since you are using your own written pieces that differ in length. Starting out, you will only be applying the techniques to a couple chapters. Once you have mastered the techniques, you will go back and apply what you have learned to your whole book or written piece.\nBy doing some initial editing yourself, you can save hundreds of dollars when hiring an editor. Then you can use the extra money on marketing. Let's get started!",

You lose momentum. You lose interest. You stop and move on to the next shiny thing which is untainted by your sense of frustration and failure.\nBut here is the secret.\nWhen you are planning to write a new romance story, all you need to focus on are the characters, and how they are going to change during the course of the romance as a result of the relationship.\nThat’s right.

That is what will make your story both unique and compelling.\nAdvanced story craft techniques are very handy at the editing and revision stage when you shape your story for the reader – but not here. This first draft is for you!\nInstead, we use the power of character arc and emotional conflict to create a simple but effective emotional story map for your romance novel.\nAs you write your romance, your characters will come to life on the page and reveal their true personalities through what they say and do, but you will never find out unless you can get those characters onto the page and interacting with one another – fast!\nFind out how you can outline your romance fiction faster than you thought possible, even if you know nothing about story structure.\nThis is the exact process I have used to create my award-winning romance novels.\nHere is what I will be covering:\nEmotional Story Maps: How to develop the opening chapters of your novel in less than an hour using romance story maps.\nPerfect for Intuitive Writers: Use this 6-Step Story Development Process to make sure that you never get lost again – but with the freedom to take detours and respond fully to where your characters take you.

It's a beautiful skill to hone and can be enormously effective in any type of writing, including business writing.\n\n\nYour senses create a unique image, an image that shows how you see, hear, feel, taste and smell this world. In this course I will help you to write from the five senses so you can transport your readers into the character’s experience and thus bring your stories vividly to life.\n\n\nWhy is it so effecitive?\nWhen you read sensory words different areas of your brain light up than when reading non-sensory words. Your brain processes sensory words as if you taste a coffee, as if you see an outburst of colour, as if you feel the fur of our cat. This is why sensory words are more powerful and memorable than ordinary words because they make your reader see, hear, smell, taste, or feel your words.\n\n\nIf this doesn't taste like more...\n\n\nAre you ready to take your first step into the magical land of sensory imagery language? Let's see, hear, touch, smell and taste the world, let's explore and write inspiring stories. Let's spice up your writing and invite your readers to experience your words as if they’re living in your story.\n\n\nIt is a hands on course in which you'll be putting the theory and ideas straight into practice by fun and curious exercises.

Working 10 hours a day but aren’t really “feeling it”.\nYou remember when things were fun and engaging but now you are hating every minute and feel you are missing out and should do something different?\n\n\nIt doesn’t always mean you need to change what you are doing but rather HOW you are doing it.\nEven Picasso, Da Vinci and Eistein got bored of their work.\n\n\nTHIS IS WHERE GAMIFICATION COMES INTO PLAY.\n\n\nIt taps into our core psychological triggers and helps us make progress and achieve our goals.\n\n\nGamification is the reason why you can play 16 hours straight and still look forward to doing it again tomorrow. That’s why you keep telling yourself: ANOTHER ONE. One more quest, one more hour, one more....\n\n\nIt’s the reason kids get hooked so fast. It's the reason Fortnite reached 200 million players.\nAll those game mechanics from badges to leaderboards to quests have the role to keep you playing...for hours and hours....\n\n\nSo why not use those exact elements to achieve your own personal or professional goals?\n\n\nLook, I have over 5,000 hours of playing Dota 2 (I can send you my Steam Profile URL if you don’t believe me), not even going into detail with all the other games I’ve played along the years.\n\n\nSo you could say I’ve been a victim just as much as I’ve been a student of game design and game mechanics.\nI’ve experienced first hand all the psychological triggers I’m going to share in the course that’s why I can attest what worked for me and for the 10,000,000 unique monthly players Dota 2 has.\nOn top of that in my freelance work I’ve consulted with several Fortune 500 organizations to integrate gamification into their workflow with great results.\n\n\nSo, who would you rather listen to?\n\n\nSomeone who tells you the theory or someone who experienced 20,000+ hours of game mechanics and applied them to the world of business with success?\n\n\nBut getting back on track....\nAt the end of the day it’s not even about games. It’s psychology. It’s what makes you pull the trigger.\n\n\nAnd this course goes over everything from how choice works, to cognitive biases and even advanced topics like the Skinner box which for you who don’t know what that's about, it loosely says something like this:\n\n\nIf you get a reward for your action just sometimes you are more likely to repeat that action than if you got the reward every time.\n\n\nIt's why loot boxes exist in games with great financial rewards for game developers.\n\n\nMoving from psychology to practicality the course explains in detail all the core game mechanics of gamification. Things like badges, leaderboards, quests, goal setting and much more…\n\n\nSo by the end of the course you will not only know about game mechanics, you will have the ability to take action and get the results you are chasing easier with game mechanics.\n\n\nAnd that’s the key word here…EASIER.\n\n\nBecause at the end of the day you already know what you want deep down inside.\n\n\nAll that you’re lacking is that extra drive, that push, that extra motivation to push you FROM PONDERING TO DOING.\n\n\nAnd that’s my promise with this course, to help you find the right gamification elements you can apply to your life or business and MOVE FORWARD AND WIN.\n\n\nAnd I’ve also made it simple for you:\n\n\nThis course is NOT:\n10 hours filled with boring presentations\nstuck up approach where I give a one size fits all method\ntheory with no practical application\n\n\nThis course is just the exact mix of theory, examples and to-dos to get you to take action and reach your goals.\n\n\nSo either you want to:\n\n\nget that promotion\nimprove your productivity\nallocate more time to that hobby\nmake work fun again\nnot be bored out of your mind at work\ngrow your business while having fun\nhave customers be more loyal\nboost repeat purchases\nmake progress on that impossible project\nmake the relationship with your loved ones more fun\nlive a more fulfilling and purposeful life\n\n\nThis course WILL HELP YOU DO THAT.\n\n\nI’m looking forward to hearing you share your results from adding gamification to your life.",

Whatever your motivation, this course is an ideal opportunity to get some of the fundamental principles of creative writing - each lecture is complete, there’s plenty of practice and I’ll always feedback if you post a discussion.\nThere are many benefits to being a creative writer. A precise message is an excellent asset, particularly when there is so many internet, work and family distractions for the reader. Although it could be argued that communication has evolved and that using 'creative writing’ is no longer required in our fast moving 24 x 7, instant access lifestyles.\nBut I’d argue the complete opposite. Reading a well written creative writing piece can be an excellent escape and allow your mind to wander to a whole new world. From ‘The Hobbit’ to ‘Black Beauty,’ creative writers have opened doors and allowed us to be involved in soaring adventures.\nContents and overview\nThis course contains over 18 lectures and one hour of content.\nHowever, much more than that, it’s a community of like minded individuals. As we develop and encourage each other you’ll get invaluable, and specific, feedback from your fellow students.\nBy the end of this course you’ll have valuable skills that will help you quickly focus on the main components of creative writing. You’ll hear what others think of your work and I’ll always try to respond - perhaps a comment, maybe a new lecture.\nWhat are the requirements?\nAn open mind, willingness to learn, plenty of practice!\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\nOver 18 lectures and an hour of content\n… but that’s evolving\nYou’ll enjoy a boost in creativity\nYou’ll know where to start\nYou’ll think about writing in a new way\nYou’ll be an important part of a like minded community\nWho are the target audience?\nBloggers, article writers, school students, aspiring authors and hobbyists!",

In this course, I guide the student through the entire process of recreating a copy of The Girl With a Pearl Earring using historical techniques as well as scientific studies published by scientists. In this course, students will start by learning how to create a Linen canvas support and the proper use of historical pigments used by Vermeer. Artists from Vermeer's time used a complex build-up of layers known today as indirect painting. This system of layers usually began with a monochromatic stage and the subsequent application of semi-opaque or transparent layers of colors to create a rich sense of atmosphere and depth in the finished painting.\nStudents can expect to learn the following skills in this course.\n\n\nHow to prepare a suitable ground for your painting.\nHow to transfer an underdrawing to the canvas.\nMonochromatic painting using two or three colors.\nSubtle modeling of form and flesh tints.\nThe use of warm and cool color transitions to create the illusion of form.\nHow to glaze using underpainting and transparent colors.\nThe proper use of fat over lean practice in oil painting.",

Keywords for the subject include science, biotechnology, embryology, cloning, animals, agriculture, medicine, innovation.\nThe course consists of 8 sections and 13 lectures. The language is simple and easy to understand for laymen (once they understand my bad pronunciation due to my deafness...). First lectures prepare the audience to the main subject by stepwise introduction re. the author, the course itself, embryology, theory and traditional practice of cloning. The main subject, handmade cloning will be discussed in two long chapters with ample video illustration. Understanding of events on the video are facilitated by the previous explanation - and may also mean a kind of exam for the students. In the final lectures, the controversial situation of cloning is described. Hopefully students will understand the situation and support our efforts, or at least won't regard cloners as evil creatures any more.\nAnybody who is interested in this subject (with controversial reputation, I admit) is encouraged to enroll. This is not a demanding scientific education, just an invitation to an excursion to see our world as it is. Sometimes funny, sometimes frustrating, but at least - authentic.",

My ambition is to provide you with all the principles and techniques you need to create compelling stories. This class is primarily geared towards cinematic storytelling, but the principles and techniques presented here can just as easily be applied to writing plays or literature. My hope is that you, after completing this series, will see that creating compelling stories is not achieved by luck or magic — but, instead, by tangible and specific principles and methods, all of which you will learn in this class. The board game Othello boasts the slogan “one minute to learn, a lifetime to master”. I would never propose that the principles of storytelling only take a minute to learn — but you will find that the principles of storytelling are simple, clear and concise. Learning to employ them masterfully, however — that does take a lifetime.\nI have divided the entire course into three parts: 1) the aspects common to all characters, 2) the aspects specific to each character, and 3) the modus operandi of creating a compelling story from scratch. In this first part of the series, we take a helicopter view on the art of storytelling — we are looking at the playing field, and its contestants, from above.\nWelcome to the third part — the modus operandi of creating a compelling story from scratch!\n\n\nAll our classes include:\nLesson material\nQuestions and tip\nChapter exams\nHelpful links\nRich video clips",

Have you ever felt confused about which journaling method to try out because they all seem like too much work? You are interested in journaling, but you are not into into all of those creative or scrapbook journaling styles? Would you like to find practical ways to come up with writing ideas and learn how to journal with them? Are you interested in making the best out of life, everyday experiences, and having a personal record of all of this?\nTHIS CLASS IS FOR YOU.\n\n\nMy name is Robert and I want to teach you a journaling method based on reflection and expression. A system I’ve developed for myself.  This is a way to journal which is all about being present in the moment, enjoying the process, and growing as a person. But wait… I won’t only be giving you a simple formula for you to apply. I will be telling you how to find and develop a journaling method that works FOR YOU.\n\n\nThere’s a huge amount of journaling methods out there, but the fact is that there’s no one else like you. If you want to make the most out of this amazing practice you have to figure how to make it yours. My goal is to help you get there.\n\n\nI use Day One for digital journaling and I will tell you why this is my favorite journaling application. You'll be able to download some shortcut's I've created to have some flexibility when using this app, but over the class will also explain what features you should look for in case you opt for a different app. What you will learn in this class is not specific to any app, platform, or medium.\n\n\nI have drawn a lot of inspiration from proven methods of productivity and knowledge management such as Getting Things Done (by David Allen) and Building a Second Brain (by Tiago Forte). Unlike these methods, however, what I will teach you has less to do with results and more to do with mindfulness and being present. This is particularly useful for anyone interested in personal growth or creatives looking for inspiration.\n\nWhether you are just getting started in journaling or if you already have some experience with it, I am sure that you will find incredible value and a lot of insights in this class.",

      "description": "Hi everyone,\nTanjore paintings are panel paintings mainly done on the wooden planks and hence also referred as palgai (wooden plank) padam (painting). The plank used was originally wood of jackfruit tree but nowadays its plywood over which the canvas is pasted with Arabic gum. Then French chalk or powdered limestone and a binding medium are used for coating the canvas evenly and then left for drying. The canvas was then ready for painting. The artists then did the detailed sketch of painting using stencils. A paste of powdered limestone and a binding medium called sukkan or makku were used for creating the Gesso work. Semi precious gemstones and gold leaves of varied hues were embedded in particular areas such as pillars, arches, thrones, dresses etc. Finally the sketch was filled with colours. In the old days artists used natural colours like that of vegetables and mineral dyes. Today they use synthetic colours. Vibrant colours such as bright red and dark brown colours were used to mark outlines. Background of the paintings was mostly created with red colour though blue and green colours were preferred as well. Scholars say that red background in Tanjore painting is a distinct mark. Lord Vishnu apt enough is coloured blue and Lord Nataraja chalk white. Yellow colour is used for the Goddesses. Blue colour is used for the sky but black was employed in occasions.\nThese paintings were not only confined to the wooden panel but this amazing art could also be seen on the walls, glass, paper, mica and exotic materials such as ivory. Small ivory portraits were typically worn as cameo pendants called rajaharam and were quite admired.\nHowever, according to some experts, it is surmised that Thanjavur paintings originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676–1855).\nThe first step out of the several steps involved in the making of a Tanjore Painting is the drawing of the preliminary sketch of the images on the surface of the canvas. The canvas for the painting is made up of a wooden base over which a cloth is pasted firmly. Then the second step involves the mixing of zinc oxide or the chalk powder with a water-soluble adhesive, which is then applied on the base. Next, the drawing is filled and ornamented with pearls, cut glass, and other semi-precious stones.\nIn some cases, the use of laces or threads are made for decorating the painting. Furthermore, wafer-thin sheets of gold are pasted on some parts of the painting, while the other parts are painted in vibrant color combinations.\nWe will easily try to make this indian folk art.\nThanks,\nNabojit Kar",

We look at how we can translate taste in an artistic and abstract language. How would you translate a particular flavour in colour or form?\nThis course will help improve your perception and understanding of colour, form and composition. Your ability to 'think' abstract and 'see' your painting through your senses will be a great asset in the development of your future paintings.\nThis course has a fun and intuitive element to it. You can work on the practical exercises at home or anywhere you feel comfortable and creative.\nAnd like Part 1 also in Discover Abstract Painting Part 2 you will get access to the online classroom which is incredibly valuable.

      "description": "There’s lots of pressure put on parents these days with regards to their parenting role and this can make parenting difficult, but parenting can be fun, can be creative, you can build bridges between you and your children using creative methods like Neurographica and meditation.\nParenting is about connecting with our children, building bridges between you and our children, guide them and ensure that you help them wire a healthy brain that they will use for the rest of their lives. Parenting is the most important tool for wiring the brain in early years. The way a child’s brain is wired depends on the contact between the child and the adults, especially parents.\nNeurographica is an amazing tool for self-awareness, self-development, changing mindset. Using Neurographica in parenting, helps you to understand yourself and transform parenting in a positive and happy experience.\nThis course is structured into 3 big units:\n1. Introduction to Neurographica\n2. The science behind Neurographica and Parenting\n3. Workshop consisting in 2 meditation sessions and 2 drawings\nIn the first unit I will give you some general information about Neurographica, and I will connect it with Mindfulness and Meditation, as well as power of creative act and art.\nIn the second unit I will give you some information about the amazing computer we have in our skull: the brain and the gamer who sits in the controlling chair: the mind. The connection between the brain and the mind is beyond incredible. I've always been fascinated to read and learn about this. I believe that we have a whole galaxy within us, even more, a whole Universe. I will talk about neurons, connections, changes, reconnections, mindset and at last but definitely not the least, the power of thoughts. In the second unit, I will also talk about Neurographica and I will explain how it works and why, what makes it so powerful and why I believe everybody should at least practice, if not study it.\nIn the last unit, I will guide you through two drawings that will help you in your parenting role, help you define who you are and what is your place in this world, this universe.\nI am married and I have 3 children: my son who is 16, a step-son who is 10 and a step-daughter who is 12. My step-son has special needs and a diagnosis of autism. It is my professional experience and knowledge about neurodiversity and parenting, that help him overcome difficulties that he encounters at school and in his social life. The amazing results I have achieved with him, despite lack of support from education, health and social services encouraged me to create this course and provide support for children and parents that go through the same challenges or just want to improve their parental experience.\nI am a qualified social worker with over 20-year experience in working with children and families. I am a Neurographica specialist, and I love art. I have a certificate in Art Therapy coaching, NLP, Mindfulness and Yoga for children, Diploma in Film-making, Challenging behaviour, Special Educational Needs and I am a qualified teacher. I owned an Afterschool club for children between 3 and 18 years old, which was rated 5* by parents.\nI am a spiritual person and I believe in God, good will and kindness. I practice yoga and meditation daily.",

      "description": "Many people believe that we are mono-function. They believe that we can not do two things at the same time, that is, that our brain is not capable of performing more than one task. And that's a lie. Our Brain is as capable of doing many tasks at the same time as our computer. What we lack is training and this is what you will learn in this Project \"Mental Palace\".\nWe have two cerebral hemispheres. The Logical Side, which for right-handed people is the left side of the brain, and the Creative Side, which, following the same reasoning, is the right side of the brain. Because of cultural issues, and this has been going on since antiquity, we have always prioritized our logical side and as a consequence we have repressed our creative side. It is not so that people are increasingly stressed, detailed, calculating. Precisely because they are overloading the logical side, while the creative, intuitive, relaxed side is falling into oblivion.\nThere has to be a balance. There needs to be a synchrony and attunement between the two cerebral hemispheres so that one can enjoy what is most accurate in their brain, which is their ability to solve any problems. We are beings infinitely capable of achieving any goals. We are not our brains, we have a brain and starting from this premise, we can develop it according to our need.\nIn this Project, which I affectionately baptized as the \"Mental Palace\", you will Balance the two Hemispheres, the Logical and the Creative, as well as further increase your Brain, Mental and Personal Capacity. As soon as you sign up, you will have the basic information, which is present in all my Projects of this nature, so that you understand everything about Isocronic and Solfeggios, and then you will have information about our simple but powerful Brain and Exercises, that you will be doing during the period that you are listening to the frequencies.\n\n\nHere are some of the benefits you may gain from the \"Mental Palace\" Project:\nDevelop Your Creative Side and Improve Your Logical Side;\nDiscover some skills you did not know;\nLearn new things easily;\nYou may be more intuitive, as this is a function of your Creative Hemisphere;\nSolve problems more peacefully;\nSpiritual Connection, since it is also a characteristic of the Creative Hemisphere;\nInner peace;\nInterpersonal comunication;\nMusical Skills and Arts;\nAnd countless other benefits;\n\n\nAlthough I can not guarantee the effectiveness of the \"Mental Palace\" project, I am convinced that it is powerful. In addition to the exercises, the Isochronic will stimulate and activate Creative and Logical areas in the Brain simultaneously. Each cerebral hemisphere will be stimulated, with the isochrones, differently to potentiate the function of each. Each Solfeggio Frequency will break any and all mental barriers that may prevent the Brain from reaching its goal. These Solfeggios frequencies act in the inner healing, as well as in the mental, spiritual and physical balance, thus causing you to return to your true Nature.\nOur True Nature is Mental Balance, Intelligence, Cognitive Capacity, Tuning of the Hemispheres, and all that, you can get with this Project. Believe me, you can achieve any goal you want. You are definitely capable. When you do not, it is because you believe otherwise. Change your way of thinking about yourself, and you will change anything around you. None of us are deprived of capacity.\n\n\n\"The Mind that opens itself to a new Idea never comes back to its original size.\" (Albert Einstein)\n\n\nOpen your mind. Reconnect again with your Inner Power. Do great things in your life. YOU ARE CAPABLE. The Miracle is just beginning!\n\n\nSee you soon!\n\n\nA Little About Evandro Angotti:\nBefore you talk about me, I want to make it clear that my only real intention is to help people. Today I was able to wake up and be happy to know that I am with this wonderful Project in 18 countries. I could not go that far if it were not for you. So, please stay here registered my gratitude for your life. I wish the Universe would grant you everything you want for your life. May you achieve all your goals. You are free to contact me ASAP.\nI have more than 10 years of experience in Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Isocronic Waves, Binaural and Solfeggios, Quantum Physics (Law of Attraction) and Personal and Spiritual Development. I have helped and continue to help thousands of people, now around the world. I feel fulfilled. I believe my purpose in life is coming to fruition as I see, people like you, achieving their goals. For me, it would be worthless, if this does not happen, it's worth nothing if you do not reach your goal.\nAnd finally, pay close attention: I am able to help you reprogram whatever you want into your life. But it all depends on you.\n\n\nNote: As already mentioned, despite having some important information, this project is not about a course, but about frequencies that you will use for 27 days to do a Mental Reprogramming.\nNote²: Each Project made available here in the Udemy Platform has its purpose. Each of them takes a certain amount of time for its complexity in development. In addition, I try to improve every day to deliver all of them with the best possible quality. If you are interested in developing in other areas, look for other projects, which I thought of you to do. Gratitude!!",

      "description": "In this BASIC carpentry and joinery course, you will learn the basics of the trade, because you want to know more about wood, because you are interested in everything related to this beautiful trade, because you have only once started working in your workshop and you do not know how to continue but you want to know more or because you want to be a professional in the future.\n* IN ALL MY CONSTRUCTION COURSES, I INCLUDE A TECHNICAL DRAWING OF THE FURNITURE AND AN EXPLANATION OF THE WOOD YOU NEED TO WORK WITH AND HOW TO ORDER THE WOOD AND FITTINGS. In PDF format that you can download for your workshop. SOMETHING VERY VALUABLE ...\nMy objective is clear, to teach you the steps to follow to develop your project and to assimilate the theory and practice of the trade.\nYou will see what the basic tools are and how to buy them, you will see how to start working the wood with them, how to sharpen them, their use and handling.\nI will also help you to professionally set up your workshop if you such desire.\nI am attaching in pdf format, a list with the basic tools to start working with and a second very complete list in case you want to set up your workshop as a professional.\nThen we will study the machines that exist in the market in case you later decide to better set up your workshop.\nWe will also see the wood you must buy.\nI am going to give you 3 fundamental exercises for carpentry-cabinetmaking.\n- How to sharpen the different tools such as chisels, carving gouges, carpenter's plane, cabinetmaker's blade. Manual sharpening and mechanical sharpening.\n- the carpenter's-cabinetmaker plane: there are many kinds of planes, but one can be used for almost everything. You will see the use and handling and how to get the wood squared with it.\n- A basic exercise to learn how to trace with a tracing gauge and work with saws, chisels and final sanding. This way you will see all the steps to follow when doing woodwork. I add a technical drawing in pdf that you can download, from the exercise so you will learn to read a carpenter-cabinetmaker’s plan.\nI also add a bibliography with some inteesting books about the trade that you can buy or consult in libraries or online, so you can accompany the classes and better understand the trade.\nI advise you to spend at least 3 hours a week to gradually learn how to work with the different tools and start enjoying them and the wood. It is a very pleasant profession, but it requires dedication.\nHere I present this first course so that you can learn the first steps to follow. Of course there is material for years if you want, it depends a lot on the time you can spend on it. For this reason, I will be presenting several different works and in different courses so you can learn what you like at your own pace. For example: how to make a box with dovetails, how to make a frame with bridle joint, how to make your carpenter's bench or how to do marquetry. Different courses that I will offer you from now on.\nIt is one of the most beautiful trades, but also the longest to learn. For this reason, after this introduction to the woodworking profession, I recommend you continue with the other carpentry, joinery and restoration courses that I have so you will fully enter the subject. Go for it!\nI hope you enjoy wood as I have been doing for over 35 years. Best wishes.\nJean Baptiste Van den Heede, cabinetmaker.",

I am sharing with you ONLY things that worked for me while I was writing my books (by 2025, it is 7 books already!), and things that other writers shared while writing theirs. Practice is more for me than theory, so let's get down to business, shall we?\nOne thing that I've found helpful in my writer's life is awareness, mindfulness, meditation. Here in this little course I am sharing a lot of practices that will enhance not only your life as a writer making your writing as good as it gets, but also tools to create a life that you want to live and breathe.\nI hope you not only watch the videos, read the supplementary materials but also practice everything and see for yourself how it all works. Your experience is the most important one! Just KNOWING things is not enough.\nAnd yes, you'll have to write. Nobody will do it for you. Don't wait until AI takes your place.

      "description": "You may be knowledgeable but without the power of imagination, you cannot discover new lands or create new possibilities. If you don't create new possibilities, you become STUCK, BORING, AND LIMITED.\nYou may be skillful, but you will never create anything GREAT without the capacity to work unhindered by embracing solitude.\nYou may be sharp but if you are not open to experiences, you cannot grow and mature by accumulating new and variety of experiences. What that means is that you remain AMATEUR throughout your life.\nyou can be a genius but without the sufficient creative energy to manifest your creative undertaking into reality, you will always remain UNACCOMPLISHED.\nYou may be intelligent but if you do not have the flare of curiosity, you cannot be an explorer. If you do not explore, you cannot know or learn new things. If you do not learn new things, you will soon become OUTDATED!\nYou may be brainy but if you don't access intuition, you cannot have breakthrough insights. Of course, without breakthrough ideas, you will produce ORDINARY AND MEDIOCRE WORK.\nYou may be exceptionally talented but without the necessary sensitivity, you will never be able to reach the HEARTS, touch the SOULS, or blow other people's MINDS.\nyou may be resourceful but without the ability to stay calm and composed during times of uncertainty, you will GET LOST for sure and end up producing RANDOM WORK.\nyou may know everything but without the courage and braveness to face challenges and take risks, you will never be SUCCESSFUL in your creative endeavors.\n\n\nAs you can see for yourself, contrary to our belief that creativity is all about being talented, intelligent, skilled, knowledgeable, or resourceful, rather it is more about having certain qualities or personality traits.\n\n\nCreativity is a natural outcome of having certain personality traits.\n\n\nNOW if you want to understand these qualities and build them into your creative personality so that creativity becomes a natural expression for you ...\n\n\nThen this is the RIGHT COURSE FOR YOU.\n\n\nThese are the most important personality traits of creative people-\n\n\nBEING CURIOUS\nIMAGINATIVE\nWORKING IN SOLITUDE\nOPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE\nHIGHLY ENERGETIC\nINTUITIVE\nBEING SENSITIVE\nTOLERANT OF UNCERTAINTY\nRISK TAKING\n\n\nThis is the one and the only course on Udemy about creative personality!\n\n\nWhat will I learn after taking this course?\n\n\nWhat Is Curiosity?\nMy Childhood Stories Of Curiosity\nLearn To Ask Curious Questions\nWhat Is Imagination?\nLearn To Imagine New Possibilities\nStudy Examples Of Imaginative People Like Albert Einstein\nUnderstand The Need for Solitude\nLearn To Embrace Solitude\nExamples Of People Who Worked In Solitude\nWhat Is Openness To Experience?\nDarwin's Story Of Keen Sense Observation\nWhat Are The Different Aspects Of Openness to experiences?\nPersonal Experience Of \"Aesthetic Chills\"\nHow To Make Use OF Serendipity?\nHow To Maximize Creative Energy?\nHow To Conserve Mental Energy?\nHow To Tap Emotional Energy?\nLook At Four Types Of Intuition\nBriefly Understand The Creative Process\nDevelop creative thinking ability.\nWhat Is Sensitivity?\nUnderstand Why Creative People Tend To Be Very Sensitive?\nWhat Is Tolerance Of Ambiguity?\nSee The Difference Between Less Tolerant vs High Tolerant\nUnderstand Various Kinds Of Risk Involved In Various Fields Of Creativity\nExamples Of Famous People Who Failed Before Success\n\n\nYou can scroll through the lecture video titles or watch the preview videos to get a more detailed perspective on the course.\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n\nThe course consists of nine main sections dedicated to nine personality traits starting with curiosity and ending with risk-taking. In each section, you will learn not only about the central personality trait but also many other connected ideas in the form of examples, analogies, stories, and useful information, all aiming at the central idea, meanwhile giving you as many reference points as possible and making your understanding as broad as possible. Mastery of these personality traits means laying a firm foundation for all your present and future creative endeavors.\n\n\nI have tried my best to strike the right balance between theory and practice. It is quite informative. At the same time, it is quite implementable as well. The course will walk you through the most important territories of creativity by giving signs and directions if not by hand in hand. Covering a wide range of concepts, it aims to increase your overall knowledge about creativity and bring about a feeling of knowing and familiarity with different aspects of a creative personality.\n\n\nThe unique thing about this course is that it is a smooth combination of both formal and informal approaches. In the sense that, academic topics like openness to experience, tolerance of ambiguity, and sensitivity are presented in an informal and straightforward way without getting bogged down in the details of the theory.\n\n\nAll videos are short videos and you will be able to finish the course very quickly.\nCourse updated regularly with new content to stay relevant & up-to-date.\n\n\nThis is my very first course on Udemy. It was shot and edited entirely by myself (learnt editing from youtube).\nSince this is my first time talking in front of a camera, I might appear self-conscious and my accent might change a bit at times(If you are OK with it just don't worry about it). My apologies for that. You should know that I am working continuously on myself and I hope to get better at delivery with time and practice\n\n\nOK ...Alright then....it's time now to build your creative personality...\n\n\nNow is the time to TAKE ACTION and bring lasting changes to your creative personality and develop your creative thinking ability...\n\n\nThis is the time to work on your creative personality and gain a larger perspective on creativity as a whole ...\n\n\nIf you don't love the course or enjoy the course or if it doesn't meet your expectation or if it doesn't make a positive impact on your creative self...\n\n\nYou have got nothing to lose!\n\n\nBecause Udemy will give you a refund with their 30-day money back guarantee!\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for?\n\n\nGO AHEAD AND ENROLL TO THE COURSE TODAY BY CLICKING ON 'BUY NOW'\n\n\nSEE YOU ON THE INSIDE!",

You can do all this in just 50,000 words. Globally, this challenge is called NaNoWriMo - the National Novel Writing Month. You can do it in November when people across the world are doing it. Or... you can do it any other time. It's your story. You decide. You decide if you really want to test out if there's a writer inside you, waiting to be revealed. Why not start right now?\nThis course gets you ready to test-drive the identity of a writer. You will get all set up to get your story down in a specific framework. Yes. You have ONLY 30 days to get the first draft done. Or look at it like this: you have 30 magical days to get it done. It's totally possible.\n\n\nThis course is for you, if:\n\n\nyou want to build a strong writing habit\nyou want to have specific tools and writing routines in place\nyou want to improve your writing skills (50K words of practice really does that!)\nyou want to get the story written that has been haunting you\nyou like 30-day challenges and structures\nyou are thinking of becoming a writer\nyou want to know how to build up a story in a simple way\nyou want to get very clear about your writing WHY\nI will help you with all this and much more!\nPersonally, I have done the challenge multiple times and ended up with several first drafts of stories. But it's not just about the draft and getting the story down. Writing can also be therapy for you as well as a healing journey. If something has been haunting you for a long time, maybe try writing it down, try writing it out. See how it feels when you no longer hold on to it.\nI've always been fascinated by the personality and identity of a writer. I am interested in peeking at what's going on behind the scenes. That's why I'm now more focused on building structures for other people's writing journeys. Building supportive structures just like this course here.\nI've been writing almost all my life since I was 8 years old. Stories came to me naturally. I saw stories everywhere. I was also the child who kept writing her own Christmas plays and acting them out (with my sister). Throughout high school, I wrote stories, essays, and poems and submitted them to competitions whenever I could. I won some of them. Later, I fulfilled my dream of studying abroad and did my MA in the United Kingdom, at Bath Spa University. I went to study creative writing because this is not taught in Estonia where I come from. Years went by. I used my creativity in translation, copywriting, technical texts, blog posts, articles, and recipes... but my main passion, which I'm slowly finding out for myself, is writing about writing. Teaching people. Showing them how it could be done. Guiding you.\nLet me be your guide. Let me help you with your first draft of something that could become very big. You never know if you never try.\nReady? Let's WRITE!",

Professional manuscripts are also often required to be in APA format, depending on the governing body accepting the submission.\nThis course will teach you how to format a template, which can then be used continuously, conforming to APA formatting standards. The formatting associated with APA can be tedious and meticulous; however, it is my job to help make the process easy and rewarding.\nStudents who have taken this course in the past and remained consistent through completion of the course, were thankful they spent the extra time setting up APA formatting correctly the first time. They then had a template they could use in the future.\nWhether you are a seasoned professional looking for a refresh on APA formatting or a freshman in college writing your first APA manuscript, I am here to help and serve. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to working with you in this skillset acquisition.",

Curiosity\nHere you will learn about the power of observation of your surroundings and how it contributes to inspiration and information of new ideas and projects. How the concept of “breaking things apart and putting them back together again” can help you understand more than your built environment.\n2. Creativity\nHere you will learn how architects keep the balance between creativity and organization and how it fuels new creative projects. I'm also going to talk about how keeping my ideas organized helped inspire one of my projects 4 years later.\n3. Empathy\nThe key ingredient of great design has to be empathy and the ability of the designer to understand how the user perceives the space or the product he/ she is trying to design. The more you can anticipate the user's needs, the more they will love your design. In this lesson, I will talk about the design of a bus and how great empathy made the bus accessible for all.\n4. Make a model\nSometimes we stand before very complex challenges and more theoretical information does not help us move forward with making a decision. In those cases, we need to try our problem in a smaller, less risky way. Here you will learn how the idea of making models has informed me about how to tackle other problems in my life.\n5. Saving time\nSometimes we deal with repeatable problems, the sum of which can take us a lot of time. Here you will learn how Templates and Standard Operating Procedures can help you become more productive without sacrificing the quality of your work.\n6. Less is more\nAn expression that came from architect Mies van der Rohe, has been associated with many things: Minimalism, decluttering, quality over quantity, but the one way that has been most useful to me has been its link to effectiveness. In this lesson, you will learn about a tool that I have used time and time again to sort out my most important task and not get sucked into doing busy work.\nI hope that by the end of this class, you will see the productivity and creativity problems you may deal with in a new light and you will be able to come up with more original and effective solutions.",

      "description": "Oral storytelling is a lost art that is beginning to revive across the world. Once it was a rich and integral tradition, passed on through families and communities. Stories carried important cultural knowledge and wisdom to be shared down through the generations.\nIn the space of less than a century, this art has largely disappeared from our communities and families.\nTell Me a Story will introduce you to the art and craft of developing this ancient skill, using proven story-learning techniques to help you remember the structure and detail of traditional tales.\nThe course includes opportunities to reflect on what stops you from telling stories now and to clarify your vision of the kind of storyteller you’d like to become.\nYou will be encouraged to explore the deeper meaning (for you) of the stories you select to learn – building a relationship with your story, making it your own and reflecting on its ‘story medicine’ gifts.\nIn a world now mapped by digital hyper-connectivity, so many of us are disconnected from the natural and human communities that surround us. Renewing the art of storytelling may offer a remedy for reconnection. As we sit by the family fireside, or in forests and by streams, listening to stories told from memory, with gesture and expressive voice, we feel our hearts and minds awaken to ancient ways of relating to each other, to nature and to the sacred.\nWe begin to remap ourselves and our world into wholeness.\nA well-told story is spellbinding: we walk away with fresh insights, challenged by questions or mysteries—our emotions and spirits stirred into new possibilities of becoming.\nToko-pa Turner writes in her book ‘Belonging’: “There is a world behind this world. The old cultures used to be in constant conversation with it through the sacred practices of storytelling, dreaming, ceremony, and song. They invited the Otherworld to visit them, to transmit its wisdom to them, so that they might be guided by an ancient momentum. But as we succumbed to the spell of rationalism, the living bridge between the worlds fell into disrepair. As fewer made the journey ‘back and forth across the doorsill where the two worlds touch,’ we forgot how to find the Otherworld.”\nReclaiming your inner storyteller builds a bridge between you and the Otherworld to enable many magical journeys back and forth for years to come.\nWho is this course for?\nYou are a parent who would like to spend more creative and meaningful time with your children\nYou would like more social confidence – new ways of sharing old wisdom with friends\nYou would like to reconnect with the magic of your mythic journey and draw inspiration from the old tales\nYou are keen to reconnect to your ancestral heritage and lands\nYou long to reconnect to Mother Earth by learning nature tales and telling stories outdoors\nYou feel you lack the skills or presence to tell a story well\nYou think your memory is not good enough to remember a story\nYou want to deliver wisdom and insights in a more spacious way that is not didactic or moralising.\nDuring this course, you will…\nRecognise your innate storytelling ability and experience\nDiscover many online resources and books for traditional stories\nPractice tried and true story learning and telling skills.\nGain insight into your life’s journey through traditional tales\nGlimpse the power of story medicine\nBuild a relationship with your story to make it your own while retaining its key elements.\nPractice your story in different ways and contexts\nBe introduced to the worldwide storytelling renaissance.\nAt the end of this course, you will\nFeel more confident in your unique storytelling style\nTrust yourself to improvise your story, rather than trying to remember it word-for-word\nNever be short of ideas or resources for story-finding\nHave begun your own oral story collection\nUnderstand the importance of building a personal relationship with the stories you tell\nSee parallels and symbols in traditional tales that offer solace, encouragement, and inspiration for your life’s journey\nEnjoy being creative and experimenting with how you practice and tell your story.\nSee many ways you could contribute to the worldwide storytelling renaissance.\nThe course is taught by Nicola-Jane le Breton, a creative writing teacher and arts facilitator who runs a storytelling development project and monthly workshops in her home community in Western Australia, together with theatre director Silvia Lehmann.\n\nEnrol now to learn a uniquely insightful and powerful approach to storytelling.",

      ],
      "description": "FLY stands for Free the Life within You, after many workshops I delivered worldwide I offer a complete tutorial online on how to demonstrate and practice this inspiring method of self-expression. we use oil, tar, and acrylic colors flowing on canvas creating unexpected combinations and forms. our tools are sticks and spatulas we can work on canvas, wood, or paper. the outcome is always surprising. it is important to notice that there are no experience or pre-requirements for this course.\nthere are FLY workshops dedicated to designers, architects, therapists, educators, artists, and even to managers or HR recruiters\nThe FLY method is about three main elements:\nFLOW\nLAYERS\nMERGING\nThough it seems like a painting class it is not. From the many FLY workshops, I led around the globe I learned that there are wider applications to this very simple technique, and this has to do with those three above-mentioned ingredients I will elaborate about.\n\n\nFlow – has to do with life, health, freedom, purity, new ideas.\nThink about a river that its natural wisdom leads him to the sea. A human being that doesn't flow is stuck, to be stuck in the human body means an unhealthy situation, in Chinese medicine treatments an essential part is dedicated to renewing and balancing the energetic flow in the human body. In FLY we pour colors on canvases and let them flow we use chopsticks to direct the colors and to form the imagined shapes in our minds. The canvas is but the mirror to our soul, this free self-expression leads to an intuitive creative process without any prejudgment, borders, or right and wrong conceptions.\nFlow has to do with connecting the dots, I'll call that sharing. A human being with flowing energy is open, radiant, vital, and willing to share so the movement on the canvas resonates with one of the most important assets in human life, the ability and necessity to move and it is not only a physical movement from point A to point B but the flow of new emotions and ideas that can happen while sitting still.\n\n\nLayers – archeology and human beings work the same, what is precious is hidden, excavations are about moving a lot of dirt and dust to understand what the archeology site is all about. Sometimes pearls of nature are located on battlefields like Megiddo or Austerlitz, what is revealed can be deceiving what can be found can be surprising. The deeper you go into a historic site the more eras you discover. there are sites like Jericho or Jaffa in which more than 10 layers were revealed.\nA human being is much more complicated than any archeological site, the human is the creator of the sites so they are responsible for every layer found in any excavation, in each human, there are much more layers than any historic site, sometimes it is a layer each month or year sometimes layers are about emotions, intuition, mental disturbing habits or beauty that is a camouflage of agony. Psychology is about making order in human beings' layered system. It is very hard to erase a layer because memories are engraved in the brain and stressing extreme memories can turn into trauma, so life is ongoing building new layers on top of existing ones, if you can t erase them join them or merge them or try to make the best of the variety of memories and emotion.\nIn the FLY workshop, we build layer upon layer each made up of contradicting ingredients as tar, acrylic, and oil colors all ingredients after dried can be coated with lacquer or could be the basis of a new layer on top. Unlike an archeology site, we start with the deepest layer and mark our way to the first and ultimate layers.\nThe number of layers depends on the artist's inner feeling and expression, in my paintings I use 7 layers on average.\n\n\nMerging – we are all different, but yet made out of the same ingredients. If all our building blocks were similar life couldn't exist, it is the variety that is the life expression and the mélange between materials and essences that make Planet Earth and all living beings upon it flourish.\nVariety is the mixture of opposite ingredients like air and water, fire and iron, black and white. Merging is an essential part of our lives on the physical level it can be man and woman in the spiritual realm, the spirit with the universe's ray of creation. Every learning has to do with merging, every new idea, and result, sharing is merging information between human beings as working together for a common goal is merging individual efforts into a collective purpose.\nIn the FLY workshop, the merging aspect is done by applying different and sometimes opposing materials such as oil and watercolors, tar with gesso, and turpentine. When applying those opposing colors, it makes like local explosions on the canvas that can be seen as fractals, with each and every layer those strange forms merge with one another to produce the FLY new self-expression work.\n\n\nThose 3 elements, flow, merge and layers are the core elements of every FLY workshop and individual FLY creation. We don t have to try hard or to implement a lot of effort, it just happens naturally on the canvas.\nI am here for any question or assistance, you can write to me with the Udemy platform or by mail at ted@ted.co.il\n\n\nHave magic in your life\nTed Barr",

I make all of the tricks and principles very easy to understand having taught each one to over 500 individuals on a 1:1 basis during my live magic masterclasses.\nThere are tricks with cards, coins and other everyday items, the majority of which need no specialist materials. I have also included an introduction to using a special magic gimmick which is easily and cheaply available. As I say, this isn't a necessity for most of the tricks but I've included this additional tuition to get you further along the road to becoming a great magician.\nYou'll be able to watch and read through the majority of the material in a couple of hours but this course is intended as a resource for you to keep coming back to and working on to develop as a magician. You'll be performing tricks like \"Sister Cards\" in a matter of minutes. With tricks like the \"Coin Vanish\" you'll understand the moves straight away and be performing them soon after but only practice will make you a master.\nYou'll see each trick how it's intended to be performed followed by an explanation video showing you the method and techniques with a roaming camera for you to get right into the action. Some of the tricks require separate \"utility moves\" you can use for a few different tricks in this course as well as thousands in the future. These \"Utility Moves\" also have their own detailed instruction videos.\nAmazing Magic Tricks & Impressive Card Tricks.\nTaught By A Full Time Professional Magician.\nTested On Over 500 live students.\nSpecial Insight Into Invaluable Magic Gimmicks.\nUtility Moves Give You The Tools To Create Your Own Tricks.\nI look forward to starting you on your magical journey,\nMatt",

      "description": "Have you ever wondered how you could expand your creativity? How you could step beyond the forces that obstruct inspiration? How to hack your flow?\nIt has been suggested that it takes 10 000 hours to reach mastery in a craft. This course will serve as a catalyst for you on your journey, whether you are a creative person on their journey into their art or an entrepreneur starting up a business, a catalyst that accelerates your own mastery over your craft, business and life. It is a course based on the highly rated book: The Creativity Manual and the 5 steps outlined in the book, Self-discovery, Clarity, Confidence, Momentum & Reward. The practical tools are all beautifully interwoven with tales of travel from the author, Johan Nayar MSc. who is an Evolutionary Psychologist, a World Traveller and Creative Explorer. The course offers deep insights from NLP Master Practitioner & Trainer, Tristan Henri, and it is the interaction between these two characters that brings the course to life. The stages are as follows:\n1. Self-discovery\nThe first section is Self-discovery. Much like a singer must find her voice, any creative or entrepreneur must find a style from which they can operate best. We'll cover the following things in each section:\nhow creativity evolved in nature\nan introduction to Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP) and its principles.\nNLP eye patterns - where do people look when they are lying\nperceptual positions- how to gain perspectives on a situation (NLP)\nour filters on the world- deletion, distortion and generalisation (NLP)\nan introduction to the Myers Briggs personality test\n2. Clarity\nNow that you know yourself on a deeper level we move onto Clarity, which is a way to gain focus on a goal. A person who is striving towards something is much more likely to achieve it than someone moving away. What we'll cover:\nhow niching works in nature and its application in business & art\nwhy focus is so important in any endeavour\nan Ayahuasca story\neffective goal setting using SMART goals\npersonal empowerment by taking responsibility for choice\n3. Confidence\nNow that you have gained the focus of where you want to go, it's time to put it all into action. Confidence will accelerate this process, we will cover:\nstatus in modern society\nNLP anchoring - how to access confidence on tap\nthe success cycle - how to be more successful\nno failure only feedback- how to reframe negativity over 'failure'\nacting 'as if'\n4. Momentum\nWith confidence comes a level of flow which is the state where the real magic happens. In this section we investigate ways to increase momentum, it includes:\nan exploration of planning vs spontaneity\nhow to hack your flow, be in the zone or get in the groove\nmaximizing productivity using the Covey matrix\npersonal editing (NLP) change your unproductive memories\ncontinuation of perceptual positions\n5. Reward\nIn this section you combine all of the above processes into a single, unified force and notice how results begin to manifest all around you. We will cover\nthe evolution of reward systems\na summary of all the previous sections\nguest interview with filmmaker Theo Davies\nfurther learning\nThis course offers a hands on approach to enhancing creativity and building confidence. You will be leaving the course with so many useful techniques and a clear direction over your goals. You will be not only able to flourish in your own endeavours but be an inspirational influence to others.

Get ready to learn how to turn your dreams into reality.\nI have been in show business for over 20 years.  As an award winning actor, I have performed on Broadway, played recurring roles on \"Young and the Restless\",  FX's hit show \"You're The Worst\". I also guest starred on Amazon Studios \"The Boys\", ABC's \"Switched at Birth\", CBS's \"Criminal Minds\", Nickelodeon and many other principle leading roles in feature films and television.\nI specifically designed this course to isolate all of my WINNING techniques into a program I wish I had as a young actor.  It would have saved me years, not to mention dollars of unnecessary classes and workshops that regurgitated the same jargon over and over.  One of my biggest pet peeves is teachers who spent hours talking FLUFF and NOT getting to the valuable information.  We get right to it!\nOver the span of my 20-year career, I have worked with incredible mentors and powerhouses in the industry.   As a result, I have developed an acting technique that books jobs!\nJoin me on this journey to learn how to conquer your fears and manifest your dreams into reality.\nI hope to see you soon.",

All the creative and innovative ideas come from imagination, and thus the key to boosting your creativity is liberating your imagination to be able to imagine something that does not exist in the present reality. You will learn how to remove the limits you have in your imagination to boost it. Then, to realize your idea, you almost always have to work with limited resources such as time, money, and people.

      "description": "Hello Writer!\nWelcome to the course where I show you how to write an in-depth, enjoyable fantasy novel that will keep your readers interested. Don't make the same mistakes that so many novice authors make and create a fantasy novel that can challenge those of successful authors!\nMy name is Matthew Dewey and I am a writer. It is hard to say when my passion for writing began, but if I can recall it all started back in primary school. A small, pale child with not much to say, but plenty to write, or in most cases scribble, across a page. From there writing became a hobby, moving on to become a part-time job writing articles on various subjects from technology to programming. Suddenly, the spark was ignited and I wrote my first novel. From there I was hooked onto something that was akin to a calling.\nEnough monologue, it is time to tell you what this course is worth to you. First, That being said, this course was created with the express intention to teach the fundamentals of writing a fantasy novel. In my rising through the writing world I found that information was handed freely, but not with enough dedication and forethought. The advice lacking and the examples poor. I decided to push through and after several years developed my own toolkit that is simple and multipurpose. The first and most important lesson I learned was how not to write a fantasy novel. From there I experimented and found the positives.\nIn addition to the research, I also write from experience, having written several fantasy novels and articles on the subject as well.\nI will show you how to:\nCreate better fantasy worlds\nEstablish plot structure\nImprove protagonists and antagonists\nAdd emotion to your novel\nImprove side characters with subplots\nCreate Story and Character development\nDecide on creating a series or not\nAND many tips and advice to add to your writing arsenal!\nWelcome to the Writing a Fantasy Novel for Beginners Course! I will show what you need to know to develop an interesting Fantasy novel and take it from boring to exciting!\n\"Writing is a powerful form of art, but it is the reader's imagination that is the canvas, not the page.\"",

It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it's got. The professional [the writer] must be alert for this counterattack. Be wary at the end. Don't open that bag of wind.\"\n-Steven Pressfield, The War of Art.\nPerhaps you’ve had a creative idea floating around for some time, but you’re not sure how you’ll bring it to life. Maybe you’ve visualised the end goal for a novel, film, play, web-series, poetry performance, etc., but you’re not sure how to get from A (the idea in your head) to B (the reality). Starting a creative project when all you have is a half-baked concept, a pen and blank page can be overwhelming, especially when it needs to work around your day job, the house chores and a well-thought-out Netflix itinerary!\nIt’s time to embrace your love for writing, establish the ideas you’ve had for a blog, a poem, an essay, a novel, a script, etc., set manageable and fun goals, put those plans into action and inspire others as well as yourself in ways you never imagined, but were always capable of!",

If part of your story doesn't support the life of the whole, out it goes!\nThe Ecology of Novels includes:\nVideos\nReading materials\nInspirational exercises\nCase studies\nCharts, spreadsheets, graphs\nLinks to extra resources (for swats only)\nMuch as a new painter would stroll the Louvre studying the great master painters, as a writer you should be examining the best storytellers. So in this course we’ll be ambling through the literary Louvre, paying our respects to creative greats like JRR Tolkien, George Lucas, Harper Lee, William Shakespeare and many more.\nPlenty of courses teach the basics of story writing.\nFew teach writers how to write brilliant – and connected – prose.

Have you started writing but got stuck and don’t know how to finish?\nDo you have ideas but find it hard to develop them into a complete story that makes sense? Or do you experience writer's block, get stuck, and lose motivation?\nIf you have experienced any of these problems or if you simply want a clear and specific way to develop your idea into a story, you’re in the right place.   This course will present an approach to writing stories that I have developed over a number of years and refined with my students in face-to-face classes.\nThis approach is a step-by-step strategy for crafting short stories that promises that you are going to write an original short story if you're willing to follow the basic principles I will present.\nIt’s different from other systems and other techniques of fiction writing. It’s more structured, and it works really well for beginning writers because it gives them a lot of practical help with the nuts and bolts of building a short story.\nWe’ll start by discussing some general principles and reading two short stories: one by Guy de Maupassant, and the other by Anton Chekhov.\nThen, we’ll get to the sections with specific tips, specific procedures, and step-by-step directions on how to go from start to finish of the whole writing process.\nThis approach is not magic, its' not a formula, and it doesn’t include all possible ways to write a story.\nJust one way. And one approach.\nI realize that there are other approaches, but my goal is not to provide the survey of all possible ways of writing a story. It is to take beginning writers along the most confident path to the completion of their first story.\nThis course is designed to meet the needs of all beginning fiction writers. I have used this approach in my classroom courses for a number of years, and my students find it effective, efficient, and enjoyable.\nI hope you will, too!",

I also provide lessons and workshops, on public speaking, acting and performance based educational projects.\nI wanted to create a course to share some of the techniques, mindset principles and exercises that have been taught to me during my years of working in the industry, that I believe can be of great help and benefit to aspiring actors or seasoned pro's that would like a refresher to their already honed skills, using a variety of techniques and exercises.\nThank you and see you on the course!",

      "description": "Dreaming about writing a screenplay?\nHave you ever watched a movie and thought, \"I could do better than that!\"\nMaybe you’ve got a vision, some inspiration, and a handful of great ideas, but you just don't know how to get started?\nOr maybe, you have a copy of Final Draft but found it too complicated and intimidating. Yet you know it could help you turn your great ideas into a great screenplay, but you just need a little help so you'll feel comfortable.\nOr, maybe you’ve already written a novel and want to convert it into a screenplay to see your story up on the big screen?\nEither way, you’re here because you want to make something BRILLIANT and LIFE CHANGING.\nThen congratulations!! I wrote \"How to Write a Great Script with Final Draft\" just for you.\nFinal Draft is THE screenwriting word processor used in Hollywood today. All the pros use Final Draft. Shouldn't you?\nCheck out what James Cameron (writer/director/producer of \"Titanic,\" \"Avatar,\" Terminator\") had to say about Final Draft:\n\"You can't win a race without a champion car. Final Draft is my Ferrari.\"\nRobert Zemeckis (writer/director/producer of \"Back to the Future,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" and \"The Polar Express\") says this:\n“The intuitive ease of Final Draft allows the writer to focus on what’s truly important – story.”\nBen Stiller (actor/writer/producer of \"Zoolander,\" Tropic Thunder,\" and \"Night at the Museum\") says:\n\"Final Draft is the only screenwriting software I have ever used, and it is the only one I ever will use. I owe ALL my success to Final Draft. Period. End of story.\"\nWhat does all this mean for you?\nYou can write a screenplay!\nYou can start a new career!\nYou can achieve your dream!\nSo why should you take MY course?\nI’m Wallace Wang, author of dozens of books including \"Microsoft Office For Dummies,\" \"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Computing,\" and \"Steal This Computer Book.\" I've spent a lifetime demystifying computers and software to make them easy to understand for the average person.\nLike you, I started out as a nobody in Hollywood. For more than a decade, I've been reading books, watching movies, and studying screenplays along with joining various writing groups to improve my writing and story telling skills. Eventually my scripts started placing in the quarter finals of various screenwriting competitions until I finally won first place in Scriptapalooza's 2023 Screenwriting Competition.\nI know what it's like to make mistakes as a beginner, but more importantly, I also know how to avoid those mistakes and fix those problems writing and telling stories. So this course contains much of the hard-earned knowledge I learned through trial and error. By taking this course, you can learn to avoid common mistakes beginners make and go straight towards writing the best possible screenplay you can.\nIn addition, I've also written \"The 15-Minute Movie Method,\" \"Writing Scenes for Screenplays,\" and \"Story Starter.\" All of these books distill the knowledge I've accumulated from studying movies from classics such as \"Casablanca\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life\" to modern day blockbusters such as \"WALL-E,\" \"Pulp Fiction,\" and \"Die Hard.\" Just look at some of these quotes about my screenwriting books:\n* Amazing book! Broke stuff down in such a clear way with lots and lots of examples. Worth having in your reference library as a writer.  J. Carrie\n* I absolutely love this book. He drills the concepts in with a repetitive style that at first I thought would be annoying but instead it has been the best way to come away with a working knowledge of the material. He uses lots of examples from movies I've actually seen. Literally transformed the way I'm writing now. S. Johnson\nBut enough about me! What about YOU?\nMy guess is you’re looking for a change in your life. Start a new career? Chase a long cherished dream? Change the world with your ideas?… Am I right?\nYes, this course is absolutely for YOU. Whatever stage you’re at.\n\nBeginner? No problem. We start with the basics. Already a writer? Good. This is the perfect refresh of your skills.\nYou’ll not only learn how to use Final Draft, but you'll also understand why you want to use certain features as well. In addition, you'll learn how to turn a great idea into a structured story, and then use Final Draft to help you organize your ideas and write them down as a polished, perfectly formatted screenplay.\n\nBy using popular movie examples along with short videos that focus on one feature at a time, you'll learn at your own pace whenever it's convenient for you. Best of all, it won't even feel like work because you'll get to watch all your favorite movies to help reinforce each lesson. How awesome is that?\nImagine how you’ll feel after seeing your ideas turn into a fully structured story. Then you'll know exactly which features of Final Draft to turn your story into a great screenplay!\n“OK, I’m sold  – what do I need to get started?”\n\nYour brain, this course and a Windows or Macintosh computer\nA copy of Final Draft 13 or later\nA desire to learn and a belief in yourself\nDon’t forget, there's always a 30-day money back guarantee if you’re not completely happy.\n\nWho is the target audience?\n\nAnyone wanting to write a screenplay\nPeople who already own a copy of Final Draft and want to take advantage of all its features\nAnyone who wants to tell a great story\nYou really have nothing to lose!\nIn short, this course will teach you how to take a raw idea for a story and convert it into a full-length screenplay step-by-step. The secret to success will require work and constant practice, but with the guidance of this course, your dream of writing a screenplay can be much faster, easier, and more enjoyable.\nYou can fumble around on your own and waste time, or you can follow the guidance of someone who has been where you're at and can help show you how to write a screenplay with far less frustration.\nSo what are you waiting for? You can achieve any dream, but you absolutely must take that first step. Click that Buy Now button… and let’s begin your adventure today!",

The course is designed to accommodate beginners and provide a comprehensive introduction to candle making. The aim is to lower the barrier for beginners and make the course accessible to anyone interested in learning the art of candle making.  However, to fully participate in the hands-on activities and practice the techniques demonstrated in the course, learners will benefit from having the following tools and equipment:  Wax Melting Pot or Double Boiler: A dedicated wax melting pot or a double boiler setup is recommended for safely melting the candle wax.  Thermometer: A thermometer is necessary to monitor the temperature of the melted wax and ensure it is within the appropriate range for adding fragrances and pouring into molds.  Candle Wicks: Various sizes and types of candle wicks will be needed depending on the type and size of candles learners plan to create.  Candle Molds or Containers: Depending on the desired candle shape and style, learners will need molds or containers to pour the melted wax into.  Fragrances and Colorants: Candle fragrance oils and colorants are essential for adding scents and colors to the candles.  Heat-resistant Containers or Candle Jars: If learners intend to make container candles, they will need suitable heat-resistant containers or candle jars.  Miscellaneous Supplies: Other supplies such as stirring utensils, a heat source (e.g., a heat gun or hairdryer for smoothing candle surfaces), and adhesive for attaching wicks may be required.  While having the specific tools and equipment mentioned above will enhance the learning experience, learners are encouraged to adapt and improvise with what they have available. The course will provide guidance on alternative options and substitutions where possible, ensuring that learners can start their candle making journey with minimal barriers.

My objective is clear, to teach you the steps to follow to develop your project and to assimilate the theory and practice of the trade. You will see what are the techniques and basic products and how to prepare them, you will see how to start restoring the wood. I will also help you to professionally set up your workshop if such is your desire. I am going to give you several fundamental exercises of the conservative furniture restorer. I also add a bibliography on some books that you can buy or consult in libraries or online and that are interesting about the trade, so you can accompany the classes and better understand the trade. I advise you to spend at least 3 hours a week to learn little by little how to work with the products and techniques and start enjoying the restoration work. Here I present this first course so that you know the first steps to follow. Of course there is matter for years if you want, it depends a lot on the time you can spend on it. Therefore, I will be presenting several different works and in different courses so you can learn what you like at your own pace. for example: how to restore chairs, how to restore painted furniture, how to varnish the doll with shellac, how to recycle and skate furniture, how to restore and paint old wooden windows, etc. It is also good to remember that a furniture restorer has to know how to sharpen his tools, know how to work wood, for that reason, you can see my different courses in CARPENTRY, JOINERY and MARQUETRY that are of great help to the restorer. Some of the courses I currently have: -BASIC CARPENTRY AND JOINERY - MANUFACTURE YOUR CARPENTER'S BENCH, with technical drawing and downloadable wooden parts included. I hope you enjoy wood as I have been doing it for more than 35 years. A greeting. Jean Baptiste Van den Heede, cabinetmaker.",

His delivery is great. The ideas he delivers are fascinating.\" Rod Duncan, author of The Bullet Catcher's Daughter.\n\nWe live in a Golden Age of story. From blockbuster cinema and bestselling novels like Harry Potter & Hunger Games, to HBO television shows like Game of Thrones and American Gods, great storytelling is loved by billions of people worldwide. Writers who can tell great stories make huge fortunes.\nGreat storytelling can be learned.\nThe writers and creators of Star Wars, Breaking Bad or Mass Effect aren't just making things up. Today's most loved stories draw on thousands of years of storytelling techniques, from Aristotle's Catharsis, to the Monomyth of Joseph Campbell, and the Dramatica model used by many of today's highest paid screenwriters.\nBased on over a decade of research, and bringing together ideas from today's most successful storytellers and story theorists, The Rhetoric of Story is an essential course for all creative writers, screenwriters and novelists.\nThe seven foundations of powerful storytelling.\nStories are powerful. Just a few words on a page, or some flickering images on a screen, and for a handful of moments, minutes, or hours we can believe we are another person, living another life, in another world. How do stories have such a powerful, immersive effect?\nJust seven core techniques provide the foundation for every great story every told. Together these seven foundations form a \"rhetoric of story\", that can be used to tell a powerful, immersive story in any medium, from a 5 page short story, to a 10 hour television series.\nA scientific insight into story.\nStories are more than just entertainment. As psychology and neuroscience reveal the inner workings of the mind, we're learning how great stories appeal to the deepest drives of the human psyche. The Rhetoric of Story draws on the psychological insights of Freud and Jung, and leading scientific research, to reveal the 7 foundations of powerful storytelling.\nUnleashing the power of story for all.\nThe poet and novelist Maya Angelou said, \"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\" The Rhetoric of Story provides a simple, flexible toolkit to tell any story. Apply the seven foundations to your writing and produce powerful stories that audiences fall in love with.\nCollege grade teaching at internet prices.\nThe Rhetoric of Story is based on courses taught at under-graduate and post-graduate college level, to students paying thousands of dollars in fees. it makes that knowledge accessible for all, at incredible value.\nThe 7 foundations of great storytelling, in one easy to follow course.\nIdeas you will learn in The Rhetoric of Story:\nWhy no story can be great without a profound INTERNAL change.\nA psychological insight into self, the engine of story.\nThe key to creating truly human characters: the web of relationship.\nConflict, why it must be present, and the 3 levels it must cross.\nThe \"fractal\" pattern of events; stories within stories.\nWhy it's OK to steal story structure...in fact it should be compulsory.\nHow to harness the secret super power of story: Emotion.\nWho is this course for?\nAnyone who wants to write a book, short story or screenplay and wants to learn the 7 foundations of telling a compelling story.\nWriters who have many stories under their belt, but struggle to find an audience for their work.\nCreative professionals - journalists, copywriters, bloggers, marketers and more who want to utilise powerful storytelling.\nExperts, influencers and business executives who want to harness the power of story in their careers.",

To share information, to share a story, to create art, to motivate/inspire action, to educate outside the system, to confess.\nWhy haven’t you written your story?\nAre you scared you’ll come off as narcissistic for wanting to write about yourself?\nDon’t know where to start?\nThink you aren’t a real writer?\nDo you worry your story is boring?\nWorry someone you know will read it and stop speaking to you?\nWorry it’s not as good as other books?\nWorry you are oversharing?\nWorry about what other people will think about you?\n\n\nWorry can sometimes hold us hostage from being able to create. This course is designed for you to be able to say, f--k you, worry and then get words on the page.\nWriting a memoir is emotional work. It is hard work. But it can be rewarding in so many ways. Are you ready to learn how writing your story can change your life?\n\n\nIn this course you will learn all about:\n· Discovering the right story to tell\n· Developing a plot and connecting themes\n· How memoir writing is different from fiction writing\n· Overcoming fear and doubt\n· How to revise and edit your manuscript\n· How to get your memoir published\n· Life as a rebel writer\n\n\nThe universe wants you to write your story, unfortunately, most of the time it isn’t going to automatically align everything so you can take a year off life to drink tea on your porch and write a page a day. Not unless you put in the work and set yourself up to be in a position to do that. You have to prove to the universe you want to be a writer by writing. By showing up.\nIf you were looking for a traditional memoir 101 class you’ve come to the wrong place. I want to push you to think outside the box when it comes to memoir writing. I want you to write what scares you. I want you to always be questioning what you are writing, to learn when to remove chunks of writing from the memoir, and have the strength to keep in the hard truths.\n\n\n“Writers know that when we write, we feel the world move; it is flexible, crammed with possibilities.” – David Grossman\n\n\nWhat students are saying about the course:\n“This course has me vibrating with empowerment, motivation, and confidence.” -Brandy C.\n“I enjoyed this course, it was great value for money. The videos were well paced and not too long. There was plenty of time for reflection and being able to stop and start, to take notes, to do the exercises before moving on to the next section was an enjoyable way to get writing. Thank you, I have plenty of ideas to move forward with and lots of themes to write about in the future.” – Chris G.\n“I have just started. It has helped me to think through motivations and goals really well, and inspired me to start writing. This is huge!” -Carrie B.\n“Great match - awesome information, inspiring.” – Stephan\n“It helped me open my mind to seeing a few aspects in ways I hadn't thought of.” -Nicole J.\n\n\nAre you ready to invest in yourself and your story?",

      "description": "21st-century advances in cognition reveal each mind is a collection of processes that more or less communicate with each other.\nIn short, our mind is a community. Sometimes, it’s a committee. Sometimes, it’s a jury. Other times, it’s a Quaker meeting. On any given day, it’s a contentious town hall forum. Once in a while, it’s a barroom brawl. Each of us engages these systems in a distinctive way.\nWhat's more, if we’re successful enough to push our limits, we all achieve situational learning disabilities. If you haven’t, you’re almost certainly under-challenged. Top-performing individuals learn to embrace, manage, and tune these distinctions. As a result, they put their unique signatures on their accomplishments.\nA lot of people are stuck in mid-20th-century constructs. This results in tools designed to type people rather than to identify distinctiveness, and mindsets that say people who spell conventionally, don’t fidget, or don’t um er are somehow smarter and more in control.\nKnowing the science behind all this can help you, not only to understand and manage your own distinctiveness better, it makes it possible to recognize and leverage the distinctions of others, as you navigate through the waters of life, education, and work.\n\n\nKairos Cognition takes complex research on thinking and learning and makes it personable and easy to understand, with practical applications to embrace and tune your cognitive distinctiveness.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nA complex and interesting world needs you at your complex and interesting best.",

      "description": "This course explores horror as a genre as well as what elements of writing are essential to telling a good story. As a creative writer myself, this genre presented in both literature and film has captured my interest for many years. I have noticed that when writing horror, it’s sometimes easy to forget many of the essentials of good storytelling; it is tempting to simply lay all of one’s focus on the antagonist and what they do to the main characters. Although those are important and memorable features of this genre, there are so many key elements that are often glossed over.\nIt is important to scare readers, but it is much more impactful if you can change them. Do not settle for stories that are just somewhat creepy. Dig deeper! Explore what terrifies you and what truths those horrors represent. Show readers something about themselves or the world that will shake them. If you can make them come to a realization they had not come to before and if you can chill them to the deepest layer of their subconscious, then you will have created horror.\nAlthough this course consists of a large number of writing basics, it covers elements of writing that even the best can get wrong at times. This may seem simple, but understanding and mastering the fundamentals of good storytelling are essential to writing in most every genre. By the end of this course you should have at least one outline for a full horror story, a list of characters with in-depth descriptions of who they are and what they look like, a list of ideas for plot devices to improve your story, and an understanding of how to regularly recreate the aforementioned documents for any future projects.\nThank you for visiting this course and please take the time to look through it further,\nSincerely,\nKalynn Fleischman",

Your words are the wings that lift a great story off the page. Other courses may walk you through how to write your story… but why walk when you’ve got wings?\n\n\nThis course is different from others because I am different; my peers in the field often refer to me as the anti-editor. While elites were sipping Chablis at Oxford, I popped open a beer with my orangutans in the jungles of Borneo, or paid a smuggler to get me across the Straits of Singapore at two in the morning, after the gunboats passed, or swam with the Gray Whales and sharks, or…\nHemingway said in order to write about life, you have to live life.\nI can tell a good story because I’ve lived a good story, and I will help you to do the same.

This course opens with an introduction to the query letter and where it fits within the scope of the entire publishing process. From there, we’ll move into some important things you should do before you query. I’ll show you all the common mistakes writers make in their query letters and why so few query letters lead to requests for sample pages or full manuscripts. I’ll walk you through how to write a standout four-part query letter, and we’ll spend a lot of time breaking down the pitch, which is the most important part. Finally, I’ll give you some strategies for setting up a query system. I’ll let you know what to expect, how (and when) to respond, and what to do when multiple offers start rolling in.

      "description": "In this course children and adults alike learn the basic principles of drawing and how to draw.\nDrawing is a form of self-expression that allows children to communicate their thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. From a young age, children have a natural inclination towards drawing as they try to make sense of the world around them. However, with the increasing emphasis on academic subjects such as science, math, and language, art is often considered a leisure activity rather than an essential part of a child's education. In this essay, I will discuss why children should learn to draw and the benefits that it offers.\nFirstly, drawing enhances a child's creativity and imagination. Drawing encourages a child to experiment with different colors, shapes, and forms, allowing them to create their unique artwork. It also helps them to visualize images in their head and put them down on paper, fostering their problem-solving skills. As children develop their drawing skills, they gain the confidence to express their unique ideas, which helps in building a healthy sense of self-esteem and promoting their emotional wellbeing.\nMoreover, drawing helps children to develop their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and cognitive skills. Drawing requires good control of small muscle groups, which helps in improving dexterity and hand strength. As children learn to manipulate pencils, pens or paintbrushes, they develop hand-eye coordination, which is essential in many day-to-day activities such as writing, typing, and playing sports. Furthermore, drawing relies on visualization, observation, and attention to detail, which help in developing a child's cognitive thinking and problem-solving abilities.\nIn addition to its cognitive benefits, drawing has several social benefits. It helps in building social skills as children learn to interact with their peers, share their artwork, and collaborate on group projects. Drawing also serves as a medium for communication, enabling children to express themselves and their feelings better. This is particularly important for children who face difficulties in verbal communication, such as those with autism or developmental delays.\nAlthough drawing has various academic, social, and emotional benefits, it is usually not given the importance it deserves in a child's education system. Schools tend to prioritize other subjects such as science and math, which are highly valued. However, it is essential to recognize that art is not a leisure activity but an integral part of every child's education. Schools should incorporate drawing lessons into their curriculum, providing children with the opportunity to learn this vital skill. Drawing is an essential skill that every child and adult alike should learn. It promotes creativity, imagination, fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, cognitive thinking, and social skills. It is an excellent form of self-expression for children and helps in building their self-esteem and emotional wellbeing. Therefore, it is crucial that schools recognize the importance of art in a child's education and incorporate drawing lessons into their curriculum.",
      "target_audience": [
        "To encourage your child to adopt a growth mindset, which involves viewing challenges as opportunities for learning and growth, rather than as obstacles to success. This can help them develop resilience and persistence in the face of setbacks or obstacles.",
        "To support and encourage your child to pursue their interests and passions, and provide opportunities for them to engage in activities that align with their talents and abilities.",
        "Builds confidence and self-esteem: Art can help children develop confidence and self-esteem by allowing them to see the results of their efforts on paper or in other mediums. By feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment, children can develop a positive sense of self-worth and confidence in their own abilities.",
        "Enhances cognitive development: Art can support cognitive development by encouraging children to think creatively, problem-solve, and make connections between different concepts and ideas. This can be particularly beneficial for children who may struggle with traditional academic subjects or who may have different learning styles."

You find the courage to tell the group, ‘I’ve got a really good idea for a story!’ Perhaps it’s a web series, an autobiography, a blog, a script, or an essay. Then some know-it-all interjects with a million questions— ‘what happens…who’s the protagonist…what’s the point of their journey…who is the target audience…can I read  your first draft?’ And your response is ‘errrr,’ because you either don’t know how to answer any of these questions or because you’re 'working on it’…two years later, you’re 'still working on it!’\nThis nano course documents the creative coaching consultation I had with Jonell Rowe — a professional writer, award-winning film director, and founder of Lionstooth Productions. Like Jonell, this nano course will get you thinking about the plausibility of your story idea through story structure so that you can develop a seamless narrative that resonates with your audience.\nWhether you’re going for a milieu-based, idea-centric, character-led, or event-driven story; Whether you’re developing something traditional or absurdly abstract; whether you’re writing a stage play, screenplay, manuscript, some audio or web content—an awareness of story structure is a must.\nLet’s nip the uncertainty, procrastination, writers' block, and writers' angst in the bud so you can write the story your legacy deserves!\nTogether, we'll explore five fundamental elements of storytelling:\nCharacter\nPlot\nSetting\nTheme\nWriting style\nUsing the resources in the fillable workbook provided, coupled with support from the lectures, you will:\nEstablish the character profiles and character dynamics in your story,\ndevelop a story structure overview, create a three-act, four-act or five-act framework for your narrative,\nwrite a themes and sub-themes summary\nand articulate your writing style and artistic intentions.\nThen with further support from wider reading materials, inspirational videos and other content, you'll have a boss blueprint for any narrative, which will enable you to stay on track with your artistic vision.",

      "description": "Welcome to Daily Creativity! I’m Bebe Keith and I love to play. Here are sixty (YES, 60!!) fun daily activities that will get your creative juices flowing! Each activity takes only five minutes to do (plus a little more to watch the video and gather supplies, but still not long!), but I encourage you to spend more time if you are inspired.\n\n\nThe creative exercises will help you see things differently, improve your drawing and observational skills and serve as a creative warm-up for your day. You will gain confidence, try new things, make mistakes, explore, develop your voice and search for your style.\n\n\nSome activities are more instructional, but most are creative thinking and exploring activities that you and I both do. Feel free to spend as long as you like on the activities. This is for you. Do what feels right.\n\n\nThis course is good for all ages and abilities. Invite the whole family to join you! I encourage you to do one activity a day for sixty days. This is roughly the average time it takes to develop a new habit. To encourage this, I recommend doing the exercise at the same time every day if possible.\n\n\nFive minutes isn’t much time, but you will find that it’s a great jumping off point to take it further if you desire. You could spend much more than that on every activity and I hope you will have days that allow the extra time to work further.\n\n\nI’ve provided a resource list that you will download. Please print it out and put it somewhere visible. It tells what the activity is for each day and what supplies you will need. There is a video telling more about the basic supplies you can use.\n\n\nWhen you finish this course, you can go through it again with different subjects, making it an ongoing resource for creativity. If you struggle to think of subjects, just google “art prompt lists” and then you’ll be all set to take the course again – with the prompts providing a twist!\n\n\nThanks so much. Now let’s start having some fun!\n\n\nBebe",

In more modern Jungian psychology, the symbol stands for an effort to reunify the self.\nThis \"Time Without End\" workshop is a supportive tool for meditation by allowing clear and vivid visuals while occupying the motor skills.\nRozine takes artists step-by-step, creating beautiful mandala symbolism. She talks about shape and color psychology, using positive affirmations that reflect the meaning of the shapes used in the drawing.\nClass is taught using 8\" x 10\" canvas board, a pencil, Elmer's Colored Paint Pens (medium nib), Black Sharpie Paint Pens (fine & medium nib). Art can be painted with acrylics, watercolors, or oils. Any medium will do — art is your chance to express yourself.\nRozine offers suggestions on how to balance repetitive shapes and patterns. You'll also learn about how to select the best colors.",

To ensure complete transparency, we want to clarify the following before you enrol:\nWhat This Course Offers:\nA 100-hour program designed to teach art therapy-inspired techniques for personal growth, emotional expression, and creativity.\n700 art therapy exercises to help you explore emotions, improve self-awareness, and enhance your creativity.\nA chance to earn the Oxford Diploma of Achievement, awarded by a tutorial college in Oxford, as recognition of your effort and dedication to completing the course.\nVarious interpretations of artwork and then discussion\nDiscussion on the mistakes that Art Therapists may make\nMonthly  Art Therapy workbooks\nArt Therapy and eco-anxiety\nOften the artwork displayed in the Q/A is then incorporated into updated lectures - students are then fully involved in the course!\nHUMAN INPUT : THERE ARE OVER SIX THOUSAND POSTS WHERE HUMANS DISCUSS ART THERAPY AND THE MANY CASE STUDIES.\nWhat This Course Does NOT Offer:\nThis course does not make you a licensed art therapist or provide professional certification. There is NO COURSE ON UDEMY that does this.\nIt is not affiliated with the University of Oxford. The Diploma is awarded by a tutorial college in Oxford and reflects your personal achievement.\nThis course does not substitute professional art therapy or clinical training. It is designed for personal development and creative exploration.\nAbout the Instructor:\nThe instructor is not a licensed art therapist but has studied art therapy deeply and created this course based on extensive research and practical experience. He is, however, an experienced teacher having taught thousands of hours in real life and been featured on television and in newspapers and the BBC website.\nAccreditation:\nThe Diploma is accredited internally by the tutorial college (Oxford School of Learning) or the Udemy platform, (Completion Certificate) but this is not a professional accreditation in art therapy.\nWho Is This Course For?\nThis course is ideal for:\nIndividuals seeking personal growth through creative practices.\nParents, educators, and caregivers who want to explore art therapy techniques for children and adults.\nAnyone interested in learning art therapy-inspired exercises for emotional expression and self-discovery.\nStudents of any discipline who welcome a course that they can become fully involved in rather than passively watch lectures and wish that someone posted in the Q/A !\nWhat is the Oxford Diploma of Achievement?\nThe Oxford Diploma of Achievement is a recognition of your dedication to this extensive course. It is not associated with the University of Oxford. To earn this diploma, you will need to complete the majority of the 700 exercises included in the course. This diploma is a personal achievement award and does not qualify you to practice as a professional art therapist.\nRefund Policy\nWe want you to feel confident in your decision to enrol. If this course doesn’t meet your expectations, Udemy offers a 30-day refund policy—no questions asked.\nWhat I would ask is that you watch the Preview videos which includes the Introduction where I go through all the segments of the course.\nHere are SOME of the topics:\nSections/Topics\nColour Psychology and Colour Therapy to improve children's mental health (include Case Studies that are editable)\nArt Therapy and AI\nArt Therapy - daily exercises\nArt Therapy - the academic background\nArt Therapy - in the interpretation of artwork\nArt Therapy and your own journey to self-healing\nArt Therapy and Distress Tolerance\nArt Therapy and Play Therapy\nArt Therapy and Counselling\nArt Therapy and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy\nArt Therapy and Creativity\nSeven day course in Positivity\nArt Therapy and the treatment of  Depression in children\nSerial Killer art\nArt therapy and Loneliness\nArt therapy and telehealth\nArt Therapy and the Solar System\nArt Therapy and Stress\nArt Therapy for the Homeless\nArt Therapy and Nature\nArt Therapy and Gestalt Therapy\nArt Therapy and Meditation\nArt Therapy and Optimism\nWalking Art Therapy\nArt Therapy and Eco-anxiety\nNumerous Art Therapy Case Studies\nArt Therapy and YOU!\nThere are many more topics plus 15 manuals and over 700 Art Therapy Exercises.\nBut more important is the theme of the course and it is one of going on a journey, a journey of self healing and self exploration. On the way you'll learn a lot about how you can help others - but you will learn even more about yourself.\nYou will also - of course - learn a lot about Art Therapy. This learning will be by DOING. Involving yourself in discussions. Sharing artwork. Sharing analysis. Reflecting. Applying.\nJust as an example, in the section on CHILDREN there are lectures and Case Studies on:\nAbuse and Neglect Traumas\nAnxiety\nAttachment Issues\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\nAutism Spectrum Disorders\nBehavioural Disorders\nChronic Illness\nCommunication Disorders\nDepression\nEating Disorders\nEmotional Dysregulation\nFamily and Relationship Conflicts\nGrief and Loss\nIdentity and Self-esteem\nLearning Disabilities\nPhobias\nPhysical Disabilities\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nSocial Withdrawal\nSubstance Abuse and Addictions\n\n\nThe Q/A section\nThis is integral to this course. Over SIX THOUSAND posts and discussions. Thousands of pieces of artwork, responses to case studies, manuals and Educational Announcements.\nThe Q/A section is where students come and post homework, ask and answer questions, comment on artwork and interpretations, explore ideas, reference further studies, relevant film clips and websites and books. It is where the 'global classroom' comes together.\nYou can often assess how active a course is, how involved the students are, by the activity levels in the Q/A. Look at any course you are now on. Is the Instructor very involved? Are students involved enough to share their work, to respond to the tasks given, to have a go at workbooks, to deal with daily/weekly/monthly exercises, to discuss Case Studies?\nDoing so takes time - time from students and also the Instructor.\nThere are 6,000 posts in the Q/A for this course.\nSix thousand.\nThat is how involved students are on this course. Students want to share, want to comment on artwork, want feedback and want guidance on their journey of self-healing.\nSo really it all comes down to one question:\nDo you want a long, detailed course where there is a high level of Instructor interaction, lectures are added to (there are 780+ already) there are numerous manuals and the Q/A is very very active?\nIf 'yes' - then enrol on that (long) journey of self-healing, to share ideas and progress, to encourage and be encouraged, to learn numerous techniques, to be kept up to date via Educational Announcements and to go slowly as you evolve - then this really IS the course for you.\nIf however, you just want a short course that you just sit back and watch without any involvement, any work, any interaction with Instructor or thousands of other students - then this course most definitely is NOT for you.\nAnd you are not for this course.\nI do hope you decide this course IS for you and you enrol. Please remember to watch the Preview videos.\nThank you .",

      "description": "It's one thing to have a great idea for a story - and it's quite another to put that into brilliant and engaging text that hooks your readers and makes publishers pay attention. For beginner or even intermediate writers, the amount of knowledge needed to write to a publishable standard can seem overwhelming.\nThis course deletes the overwhelm by providing a complete walk-through of the core techniques of both writing and structuring stories as you build your own story from scratch.\nBuild a Story Step-By-Step as You Learn the Techniques of Masterful Fiction Writing\nCreate believable characters\nWrite realistic dialogue and description\nChoose the right point of view and tense\nMaster the principle of \"show don't tell\"\nConstruct scenes and plot structures as you build your own story\nRadically improve any existing story or manuscript you've been working on\nEverything You Need to Write Stories That Publishers Want to Read\nThrough this course you will learn the essentials of story creation so you can feel confident building stories from scratch. You will also learn the core writing techniques that all fiction and creative non-fiction authors need if they want to get the attention of publishers and readers. This course provides the complete skillset needed to write publishable fiction and creative non-fiction.\nHow can I say that with confidence? Simply because every topic covered has emerged from the challenges I've seen writers face in my work as an editor and author coach. As I saw the same few issues coming up again and again I began referring writers to books and courses that covered these topics. And as the list of referrals grew longer I wished I had just one source that would teach writers everything. But there wasn’t, so I created it myself.\nCONTENTS AND OVERVIEW\nThis is your all-in-one, basic to intermediate course for learning the techniques of story planning and writing.\n1. We start with the basics of story development so you fully understand how stories are built up from the simplest ideas. Once you know the patterns and shapes of stories you'll start seeing them everywhere. Publishers can see immediately if your work isn't well structured, so this information is critical for your story's success.\n2. While discussing story development you'll be doing practical exercises to either start a new story or go deeper on a short story, novel or memoir you are already working on. This is your class project.\n3. Then we get into the actual writing technique and cover the core disciplines:\nCharacter building\nDialogue\nTense and point of view\nShowing vs telling\nDescription\n4. And finally, we go back to story structure and cover scene building and basic plot construction. Once that's done you'll be able to put the finishing touches to your class project.\n*** Plus - new in 2023 - guided meditations to access deeper levels of creativity and spark story ideas ***\nWho this course is for\nWhile this course is aimed at novice writers of short stories and novels it’s also the perfect fundamental skills course for authors working on crossover forms such as memoir and creative nonfiction. All the skills used in structuring and writing fiction are directly applicable to true-life stories, histories, personal essays and any other form that uses the techniques of fiction to tell a story based on real life. Many of the topics contain specific guidelines for adapting the material to memoir and creative nonfiction.\nCourse delivery\nThis course includes 41 lectures and exercises (3:54 hours of video learning) plus a comprehensive Course Notes PDF. Each topic ends with an exercise to help you build your own story or improve an existing work.\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to create new stories from scratch, write powerful, engaging prose using the core skills of fiction writing, and confidently continue writing the short story, novel or memoir you began working on in the exercises.",

      "description": "Join over 100,000 students learning from our courses!\nMost seminars and books attempt to teach the frustrated screenwriter what to do and what not to do; this course will outline how to do it - how to develop habits that will lead to more joy in the writing process and better scripts.\nThe only way to guarantee a script request is to interest and excite the listener with your pitch. Presenting techniques from the most successful pitchers in the biz, author Karl Iglesias shows students how to ignite the executive’s interest. Topics include:\nAn insider’s view of the do’s and don’ts of pitching to producers.\nThe essential elements of a great pitch.\nHow to distill your story into a pitchable and enticing logline.\nHow to develop your verbal confidence by practicing your pitch until it shines.\nYou also learn how to deepen the reader's response. A must for any writer who’s mastered the basics but has yet to break the barrier. Focusing on the key ingredient of all successful scripts — the reader’s emotional response — UCLA screenwriting instructor Karl Iglesias shows students fresh ways to evoke emotion on every page of their scripts.\nWhy emotion is the key to successful screenwriting.\nWhat readers look for talented writers.\n“Good” and “bad” screenplay examples.\nWhy A-list screenwriters keep getting hired.\nBONUS: Included in this course is the Screenwriting Secrets: Learn from Hollywood Screenwriters\n\nIn Screenwriting Secrets: Learn from Hollywood Screenwriters, bestselling author Karl Iglesias will guide students to identify and develop the key screenwriting habits of A-list screenwriters, like Ron Bass, Akiva Goldsman, Gerald DiPego, Eric Roth, Nicholas Kazan, Ed Solomon, Scott Rosenberg, and more. He'll offer an insider's view at how these pros discipline themselves, create original material, conquer the blank page, eliminate writer's block, network, pitch, and persevere in Hollywood.\nModeling what works is the philosophy at the heart of this course. The secret to success in any field is to find what successful people do and think about and do the same. The difference between successful screenwriters and amateurs is that successful screenwriters do all the things that amateurs want to do but can't do, or don't know how to do.\nIf you want to elevate your scripts and stories – AND your screenwriting or filmmaking career -- to the highest possible level, this class is a must.\nThey DON'T teach you this in Film School!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat people are saying about our courses:\n\"By far, the best director and cinematography course on the Internet.\" - Nate Carroll\n\"I really enjoyed taking this class. It wasn't just that the subject was interesting to me, but the teacher also made the class intriguing. I would gladly recommend this class to anyone who would be interested in.\" - Leah Ames\nVery helpful. Adds depth to your understanding and intuitive insights which you surely had if you happened to play with video shooting and editing without doing any learning beforehand. It's enriching. The movie samples are great as the clarify the points. Love it! - Yosi Tsitsu\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis course is an effective way to have all these successful screenwriters to be your personal mentors. Study their habits, learn from them, and maybe their wisdom will rub off on you and arm you with enough knowledge and self-confidence to accomplish your goals.\nBy taking this course, you'll discover what it really takes to be a successful screenwriter in Hollywood, and either see similarities in your attitudes and ways of thinking or be inspired to adopt new ones. Whether you are filmmaking like a pro, making movies on the weekends with a DSLR camera or deep into the craft of screenwriting this is for you.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is Karl Iglesias?\n\nKarl Iglesias is a screenwriter and sought-after script doctor and consultant, specializing in the reader's emotional response to the written page. He is the best-selling author of Writing For Emotional Impact and The 101 Habits of Highly Successful Screenwriters. He teaches at UCLA Extension’s Writers' Program, where he’s won the Outstanding Instructor Award for 2010, the Screenwriting Expo and online at Writers University. He also writes a regular column on the craft for Creative Screenwriting magazine.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nImportant information before you enroll:\nIn case you find the course useless, don't forget you are covered by a 30-day money-back guarantee, full refund, no questions asked!\nI will give you my full support regarding any issues or suggestions related to the course.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you've got the dream.\nIf you've got the drive.\nIf you've got the passion - but you're missing the knowledge and experience...this course will help you write and sell your feature film screenplay.\nEnroll NOW!

      "description": "Screenwriting - How To Write A Screenplay Outline : How To Outline A Screenplay\nIt's common for a new screenwriter to attempt to write a movie script without a firm idea of the overall script structure. This is a mistake, born of enthusiasm and a blind belief that the script can be developed as we write. The fact is that a screenplay must have a definite structure - a Script Outline Template is essential, if it is to have any chance at all of being made into a movie.\nAristotle's original concept of a 3 Act Story is still valid, but modern screenplay writers have further developed the basic idea into a precise craft. Building on the idea of beats, or scene sequences, a modern script consists of a series of events and turning points which need to be in the right proportions and relationship if the movie script is to be of interest to the money-men in Hollywood.\nAgainst conventional wisdom, the movie script pitch letter normally created at the end of the process when the screenplay is ready for submission should be written before even starting to plan a script. How to use this is just one of the gems you will find inside the course.\nInside the course 'How To Write A Screenplay' you will learn:\nHow to build a reusabla Screenplay Outline Template for maximum audience appeal\nHow to write and use your movie script pitch letter as a powerful creative tool\nHow to transfer your scene ideas to a visual planning board\nHow to create and use a 'beat' planning tool using FREE online presentation software\nAt the end of the course you will have in your hands a strategy enabling you to effortlessly create viable movie screenplays in the correct format adored by Hollywood, giving you the best chance of success.\nSign up now!\n#howtowritescreenplay #writemoviescript #screenwriting #screenplayoutlinetemplate #howtooutlineascreenplay",

      "description": "There are three elements without which there is no Story:\n1) Characters,\n2) Setting,\n3) Conflict.\nOf the three, Conflict is the easiest to master. Yet confusion and contradictory information abounds making it difficult to understand the role of Conflict in Story.\nThis course will show you how to look at Conflict in a way that is easy to understand. \"High Concept\" is a publishing and film industry term that means a concept that is easy to grasp, that deals with a breakout idea and archetypical stakes.\nIn short, the term “High Concept” means “simple concept.” The moment you hear the central idea of each type of conflict, it will immediately ring the bell of recognition and you can put it into practice right away.\nI have given this course at various international writer’s conferences, including ThrillerFest—a premier thriller enthusiasts’ Conference in New York organized by the International Thriller Writers—as well as universities as part of my 24-hour course on the Anatomy of Story.\nWRITING HIGH CONCEPT CONFLICT includes a Workbook and other Resources to guide you along the way—like a Master Story Conflict Cheat Sheet that you can use for each of your WIPs—and help you analyze other stories—books and films—to see how others have done it, or failed to do. Lessons include a Summary at the end and Actions for Today that you can refer to conveniently as many times as you wish with your unlimited time subscription.\nWRITING HIGH CONCEPT CONFLICT also includes a section dedicated to Conflict Resolution, which is critical for ending stories in a satisfying way, plus a Bonus Lesson to give you an extra edge.\nIf you take about 15 to 20 minutes a day—which includes your practice sessions recommended after each Lesson—you will be able to finish this course in two weeks.\nI have striven to give you the essence of what I’ve learned over decades and wished I’d known when I started writing.

If you've done any of my other courses, you'll know that there's going to be some difficult concepts and some hard work for you to do.\nAnd - of course, no one can promise you success in an award or a competition, any more than anyone can promise you success in writing. But there's a lot you can do to greatly improve your chances.\nAnd most of all, if you write the kind of short stories that I'm teaching you to write, you can use them to get attention - from new readers, from agents, from commissioning editors, from periodicals. Great short stories are both an education in themselves, and a powerful marketing tool.\nSo I hope you'll put in the hard work, and I hope you'll let me know how you get on.",

(Find it on Amazon or any major bookseller.)\nA computer/tablet\nAn idea (or many ideas) that you think would make a great story!\nThis course includes:\nOver 3 hours of on-demand video lectures, written and hosted by award-winning writer/director, Jennifer Zhang\n10 story structuring worksheets and guides\nFull lifetime access\nAccess on mobile and TV\nCertificate of Completion\nCourse detail:\nA good, solid story is a good, solid story no matter the subject matter, page count, or runtime.\nAnd the thing all of us know, and that author and screenwriter Blake Snyder himself admitted --- is that the Save the Cat! methodology is not magic... though it may feel like it when you discover that you've taken an idea and transformed it into a full story that's ready to be written out as a gripping screenplay.\nThe reason Save the Cat! has been such a driving force behind so many films throughout Hollywood – from acclaimed indies to major blockbusters… is that Blake Snyder simply cracked the code on the basic elements of a good, compelling story that resonates with a wide audience, and then he made this code widely accessible and easily employed by any writer. And that’s the magic of Save the Cat! in a nutshell. And learning it in detail is what you will be embarking on over the next 4 weeks.\nThis course is very comprehensive. It pulls lessons from all 3 of the books Blake wrote, as well as the blogs, worksheets and other teaching materials he developed… so you’re going to gain a solid understanding of the Save the Cat! principles and be able to apply them right away to your own work. And even if you’re familiar on a basic level with the material, this course will build on your understanding in a valuable, substantive, and thought-provoking way.\nThroughout this course, you’re going to learn what makes a good, attention-grabbing movie pitch, and then you’ll be writing your own title and loglines for your ideas. And then the bulk of the course will be focused on learning how to properly develop the 15 beats or plot points that will map out your story as detailed in Save the Cat!. You’re going to take your best idea and put together YOUR beat sheet for the whole story. After that, you’ll be refining this beat sheet until it’s perfect…. and that perfect beat sheet will form the roadmap, the blueprint, and the backbone for your entire script.\nA few final notes: this course is designed for screenplays, so all the references will be from movies – all kinds: blockbusters, award-winning films, independent films, animated movies, live actions movies… However, if your plan is to use these lessons to write a story for another medium, all the structuring tips are just as applicable to novels, short films, TV pilots, etc.\nThank you for your interest in this course. We hope you're excited to get started!",

        "Our intention is to take you on a journey into the world of acting, along the way giving you some idea of the skills you’ll need in order to enter the industry as well as an insight into the industry itself. We aim to show you how to start, how to progress and how to make what you do work for you. However, you won’t be taking this journey alone. Keeping you company will be two actors, Lyndsay and Brad. They’ll be learning just like you. Sometimes, especially in the later stages of this journey, they won’t even realize that they are learning. That’s the thing about acting. Life and what it does to you as you go along, as you navigate through your experiences and emotions, is often the best training ground that you as an actor can have. For the actor, nothing in life is ever wasted. In this course we will look at monologues and scene work and the supplementary material includes improvisation exercises for you to practice. But it differs from other similar courses in that we will not simply be covering the purely technical aspects of acting. Through Lyndsay and Brad you will be given an insight into what the life of an actor entails, - the hopes and fears that every actor experiences in their struggle to succeed. It is about the technique of acting but it is also about what it means to be an actor in a more general sense. This is why we look at such issues as confidence and the audition process. Our intention is to provide you with a glimpse, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, always relevant, of the life of the actor as a whole. Our greatest wish is that you find it entertaining, interesting but, more importantly, useful in your endeavour to make this industry your career."

      "description": "Creative Writing For Beginners is intended to provide new writers with a set of tools that can be used immediately to improve the prose they write to tell their story. Knowing how to write prose effectively with basic rules that are easy to implement fast is essential for great fiction!\nSPECIAL NOTE: This course is designed to make your prose more effective, if you're writing a novel, for example. Please do not enroll if you just need to improve your basic English. It isn't the purpose of this course.\nThe aim of every author should be to write clear prose that flows, providing an enjoyable experience for the reader who wants to keep turning those pages!\nNew (and experienced) writers are often so close to their writing, that they are sometimes blind to small errors, either in construction or word usage, that rankle with their readers and block the flow of the story. In the case of repeat errors, the reader may even abandon the book altogether. Detection and correction of simple errors in written prose is the core of any creative writing lessons.\nIn the course Writing For Beginners, you will learn how to apply simple rules right now that will immediately improve your fiction. This course is a tool for budding writers wanting to create proactive page turners, stunning prose and captivating stories.\nCreative Writing For Beginners - subjects included in this course:\nAdjectives & Adverbs - how to use them and when not to use them all.\nThe Active and Passive Voices - what are they and how should they be used?\nSpecial Punctuation - the use of semi-colons, ellipses and other marks to spice up your sentences.\nWriting Numbers - the conventions which guide how to write numbers and dates.\nUnnecessary Words - overused words are included as well. How to find them, avoid or replace them.\nAbsolutes - these are also called overgeneralizations and blanket-statements.\nClichés - how to identify and replace phrases too commonly used in prose.\nInterjections - what they are, and when to use them correctly.\nVague Writing and Initial Coordinating Conjunctions - remedies for two lesser known problem areas.\nVariety - an essential element in good prose. How to achieve it?\nThe final lecture concludes the series and shows how to edit your prose, applying the rules that will dramatically improve your fiction. Check out my profile for future Writing Courses For Beginners - Coming soon 'Creating Characters For Fiction Writing.'\nRecent Reviews:\nAs a new writer, this is exactly what I'm looking for. The tips James gives are invaluable, from searching out and destroying the words that make prose look amateurish, to some very useful editing tips. At this price, it's a steal and thoroughly recommended. Thanks!  (Jack Spencer)\n*************\nFirst of all, I wasn't sure if it wasn't perhaps too basic - I consider myself to be pretty literate, but I learned new things that help a lot. Right from the first lesson about Adjectives it was useful. The tips given at the end are worth the cost of the course alone. Thoroughly recommended. You might think you know the basics of writing fiction, but you don't! If you want to improve your prose quickly, this course is well worth while. (Patrick Mennan)\n*************\nI like the way James spends time on each topic. English is not my language (French) and I need some good tips for writing good prose. Seems good, and contains some solid tips. (Benoit Fourrier)\n\n\nRelated search terms:\n#WritingForBeginners  #creativewriting #howtowriteprose",

      "description": "Do you have a lot of creative projects on the go, but you never actually get to any of them? Have you been procrastinating on your projects by looking for quick fixes on the side? Are you trying to make yourself feel better by chasing the instant gratification of sex, rather than doing the work? Are you trying to move from being 'Sex Obsessed' to a 'Creative Genius'?\nThis course is definitely for you, if you answered yes to any of the questions above.\nI have been running live versions of this workshop for months and I realized that there is a real need for it. So many people email me weekly asking whether this workshop would be available online. I decided enough is enough. I stopped procrastinating and created this course for your viewing and working pleasure.\nIn this course, we will explore the connection between creativity and sexuality and how we can use one to drive the other. I have included techniques that you can use in the comfort of your homes to move your creative projects forward using the power of your sexuality.\nI hope you will be enticed to take this course and use all of its benefits.\nTestimonial from Wayne Duckworth: I attended Shikha’s workshop Creativity and Sexuality with both excitement and trepidation at what was to come but within minutes felt reassured and comfortable as she set out a framework for the 3 hour deep dive into unexplored territory. After explaining the content she set firm boundaries that felt both nurturing and precise but with plenty of space for free exploration and just the right amount of challenge. Her approach is dynamic and heart centred to the creative and energy work, which is both individual, and partnered with plenty of time for sharing back with the whole group. She was able to hold the space for the group as we began to explore ourselves stimulated by the well chosen exercises inviting us to open up and share our stories, vulnerabilities and hope for a deeper connection to our creative selves. I definitely learned about my own desire to hide in my sexuality and with the tools and wisdom she provides feel I can transmute my sometimes distracting sexual focus into a more creatively productive channel. Awesome!\nTestimonial from Chloe Donnelly: I have attended several of Shikha's workshops now, I was hooked after the first session! I am in love with how fluid and synergetic the sessions are. They bring up powerful emotions within a setting of ultimate confidence and respect among new friends. She is certainly not a pushover, can read you well and does all within her power to help you grow. The sessions on sexuality were particularly empowering for me, as I am constantly re-evaluating my sexuality and it seems fairly ambiguous, but I realised after talking with others that I have a great knowledge within sexuality because of this lack of stillness. These sessions are honestly not to be missed, rarely have I found anything so worthwhile and thought provoking!\n\nTestimonial from Zita Moran: Before I encountered Shikha’s course I had never made the connection between my creativity and sexuality. Truth be told, I was actually rather repressed in this area. But there’s something about Shikha that makes you feel safe to open up and experiment. The result was spectacular—it's been revelation after revelation for me. Now I have powerful tools to use whenever I feel my inspiration is drying up. Thank you Shikha for introducing me to a new creative paradigm! You are a godsend—I'll never look back",

But music is part of life and everyone is connected to it in some way. Discovering your own personal connection to the world of sound and music can open new avenues of experience and self-awareness.\nFinding Your Inner Musician eschews the demands of conventional music teaching to open up a direct path between you and the world of sound using simple, accessible instruments and tools and takes you on a journey through this world in search of your Inner Musician. You may find it in the most unexpected places!\nIn particular, the course leverages the possibilities of the iPad and its ecosystem of music apps, many of which are uniquely visual, intuitive and fun. It puts everything you need right in your hands and allows you to do whatever you want, whenever you want. It brings down the obstacles to music making many people that come with the conventional approach, such as the need to know theory, to play an instrument or buy expensive software that takes a long time to master.\nIt also shows you how to connect with the simplest elements of music that surround us at all times and building your sound practice from the inside out.",

      "description": "In this course you will learn from seven masters, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, Italo Calvino, Haruki Murakami, Kazuo Ishiguro and Charles Bukowski. Learning from great novelists is like being an apprentice to one these masters of creative writing and storytelling. This course not only has distilled their craft and storytelling techniques, but also their way of thinking. To become a great writer is to emulate and learn from the greats.\nDostoevsky is the father of Russian literature. He was not only a great novelist, but also a philosopher and psychologist. Kafka is perhaps the most well-known 20th century writer whose name alone has given us a literary style called Kafkesque. So Dostoevsky and Kafka bring the dark side of human experience. On the other hand we have Proust and Calvino two of the greatest writers of the 20th century whose writings represent a more artistic side of creative writing. Proust holds the record for writing the longest novel in history and also one of the most profound. Calvino was a master of storytelling who combined folktales with modern science. Then we have two contemporary authors. Haruki Murakami is perhaps the most unique writer of current time and has a cult following among his readers. Ishiguro won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2018 and is often called the master of craft and methodical writing. Bukowski is one of the most important writers of the 20th century America with a unique voice.\nSo this course brings 7 of the most successful, yet unique novelists of the past three centuries who are very different from one another. You get to learn from their styles and ways of thinking and seeing the world. Creativity is seeing things differently. And these 6 masters certainly do and feel things differently.\nYou don't need to have read any of their books. I will summarise all their major works and then bring unique lessons we can learn from each one. The lessons are a mix of practical tips, way of thinking, and psychological as well as philosophical insights. So not only you learn practical tips on writing and storytelling but also learn what philosophical and psychological ideas underpin those tips.",

Do some of their dialogues sound more like conversations they had with someone than something that they came up with? Doesn’t having a muse sound a lot like someone being a medium?\nWonder no more. All of the details behind how to develop a writing style, what a muse is, how to find one, and two different methods for doing so are included in this SixtySkills course.\nThe two main techniques involved here are dream yoga and mental wandering. Sometimes referred to as an out of body experience (OBE), or astral travel, mental wandering is a skill that anyone can learn how to perform over time. Dream yoga is an excellent way to make use of what is otherwise downtime in your day as well. Both techniques work individually and can provide great synergy as well.\nThis course covers some common misunderstandings, technique errors and lifestyle choices that can greatly enhance your odds of success. Specifically, it also addresses why you would want to learn how to do this and points out some common pitfalls frequently seen along the way.\nWhile learning how to separate your consciousness from your body is a classical technique in meditative practice, it is also of great practical value as well as you are about to find here. And this course gets into reasons why you would want to learn to do this and some that might make you want to reconsider.\nSo, join SixtySkills today and learn how to engage in the fine art of How to Be an (Esoteric) Fiction Writer.",

      "description": "As a fantasy writer, you want to take your readers to exotic places like they’ve never seen before, a world of wonder that they want to get lost in.\nHere at the Worldbuilding Workshop for Fantasy Writing, that’s my aim. By the end of this course, you will have created a believable and compelling world that your readers will want to get lost in again and again.\nThe World Building Workshop for Fantasy Writing is taught by me, Jason Link, the author of the Legender series, an epic adventure that Publishers Weekly calls a grand fairytale.\nFor the last 25 years I have been practicing the art of worldbuilding in fantasy literature, and in this course, I share with you the insights I've gained on that journey. Years and years of research compiled in one place.\nThe massive task of worldbuilding has been broken down into manageable chunks and follows a logical flow.\nIn this course, you will\nmap out your world with natural features (mountains, rivers, forests, etc.) and people-made features (countries, cities, and roads)\nplan out your world's timeline to get the big picture of your world's story\ncreate fantastic creatures that survive in your world's habitats\ndevelop peoples and races and establish their societies and cultures\nform a healthy relationship between your world and your story\nlearn crucial concepts used all throughout the worldbuilding process\nlearn how to establish rules for your world so your world is more believable\nlearn how to create a world of depth so your world is more compelling\nlearn how to create meaningful names for the various people, places, and things in your world\nBy the end of this course, you will have a believable and compelling world that will enchant your readers.\nPraise for Jason's course \"World Building for Beginners\":\n\"This was a great course! I wrote so many notes down. Each video in each section had so many helpful tips, examples and resources. Well made! This was very motivating. You are very supportive! Thank you!\"\n\"This course has gone over in a brief time what I spent the last year learning. Great stuff!\"\n\"A good introduction to understanding, developing, and leveraging the relationship of your invented world to the story you write. There are interesting and insightful references in the course that help you develop your new world and story.\"\nPraise for the worldbuilding done by Jason Link:\n\"I am not one to lightly compare a fantasy author to Tolkien, for so few have succeeded in creating such vast worlds and peoples as Tolkien did, and even fewer have produced Tolkien's world-spanning mythology. Jason Link has created a vast and beautiful world, peopling it with fantastic creatures and races, while deeply respecting the spiritual underpinnings of the world he has created.\"\n\"Perhaps the best part of reading was that feeling you get when you are immersed into a different world, which is exactly what Link has built. There are cultures, geographies, languages, and creatures that come together to make a fun yet deeply sophisticated world. In this way, The Legender reminded me of the greats like Tolkien.\"\n\"The author did a wonderful job of painting a captivating picture of the world of The Legender for us. Although it is a world totally different from our own, I felt connected to it and completely intrigued by the characters, scenery, creatures and story.\"\n\"The fantasy world that the author draws you into is described in such beautiful detail that it is both believable and compelling. The characters are well-developed and intriguing, and the story definitely picks up the pace as you move along. I will admit that the new creatures are very different from what is seen in other fantasy novels, but the author does a wonderful job of describing these creatures in such a way that your imagination easily fills in the picture.\"\n\"Jason Link has a gift for not only creating a captivating new world, filled with creatures and cultural practices a reader has never thought of, but also maintaining a consistent and believable voice throughout the twists and turns of the story.\"\n\"A created world such as this has room for tomes and tomes of adventures and histories for its readers.\"\n\n\nDo you wish readers to have a similar reaction to the world of your story?\nIf so, join me in this course so I can show you how to create a believable and compelling world that will enchant your readers--a world your readers will want to get lost in again and again.\nCheck out the free previews to get a sample of what you'll learn and then enroll to get started worldbuilding today!",

      "description": "Comedy is a serious business, with a lot of laughs. Stand-up comedy has become a giant industry and a major source of talent for television, movies, streaming services, theaters, night clubs, colleges and universities, corporate events, trade shows, conventions, military shows, benefits, special events, and many other venues where laughter is in demand. As a comedian, you will find the competition for jobs can be fierce, but because the entertainment industry is continually looking for new talent, there is always the opportunity to be “discovered.”\n\n\nSuccessful comedians are made, not born; there’s more to what you see than just talent and luck. It takes preparation, practical experience, and knowledge of what the business expects of you. To share an important piece of insider advice about the comedy industry:\n\n\n\"They may call it amateur night - but no one is looking to hire an amateur.\"\n\n\nThis course is divided into five chapters that serve as your step-by-step guide into the world of stand-up comedy. We start by laying the groundwork for you as a creative artist (writer and performer) and continue your journey toward becoming a working comedian.\n\n\nChapters:\nSetting the Stage\nWriting Comedy\nWriting Your Comedy Set\nPreparing To Perform\nOn Stage and Beyond\n* Bonus Lecture - Looking Ahead and Talking About… Different (performance) Markets\n\n\nEach chapter contains:\nFive video lectures (over two and a half hours followed by bonus lecture).\nArticles pertaining to each lecture topic.\nAssignments designed to take you to your next step toward being working comic.\n\n\nIt is important to note the insider advice in this course comes from experiences within the comedy / entertainment industry. In addition to Dave’s credits, each of the twenty-five lectures includes a real-life example related to the topic. In other words, there is a lot of name-dropping by sharing lessons and experiences from well-known (and some legendary) comedians about what methods worked for them, and sometimes - what didn’t. And since this is comedy (don’t forget) it is meant to be informative and entertaining at the same time. A good description would be infotainment.\n\n\nPersonal creativity, sense of humor, desire to make others laugh, and your ability to laugh and have fun are the key ingredients in this course. Your success as a working comic is the goal. Whether you’ve been looking for a way to break into comedy or to take your career to the next level, there are no more excuses. Let’s take that important next step together.\n\n\nDave Schwensen is a nationally recognized comedy coach, talent coordinator and consultant for television, talent coordinator for The Improv Comedy Clubs in New York and Hollywood, talent booking agent for colleges and universities, corporate events and festivals, university instructor in presentation skills and communications, keynote speaker and trainer, award-winning humor columnist, radio and podcast host, and last but not least, an entertainer. He has been featured on PBS Television and Radio, Chicago Tribune, Ohio Magazine, The Hollywood Reporter, U.S. News & World Report, Backstage (industry) Newspaper and many others. He has been a featured guest and comedy expert on numerous national, international and regional television and radio broadcasts.\n\n\nDave has more than three decades experience facilitating comedy workshops for major comedy clubs and festivals throughout the US. He is the author of three books about the comedy industry featuring experienced advice from more than forty working comics and industry professionals. Past members of his comedy workshops and coaching have credits including television, comedy clubs, corporate events, colleges and universities, and cruise ships.\n\n\nBooks by Dave Schwensen:\nHow To Be A Working Comic: An Insider’s Guide To A Career In Stand-Up Comedy\nComedy FAQs And Answers: How The Stand-Up Biz Really Works\nHow To Be A Working Corporate Comedian: A Step-By-Step Guide Into Launching & Building Your Career\n\n\nReviews:\n“Schwensen certainly knows the ins and outs of making it in comedy. He has put his knowledge to work in How To Be A Working Comic, a book that shows aspiring comics everything from how to hire an agent to how to handle road gigs.” - Chicago Tribune\n\n\n“A MUST for all in the comedy industry.” - The Comic Bible\n\n\n“Full of proactive ideas and hands-on experience… a valuable resource no matter what career level you may have achieved.” - Back Stage, The Performing Arts Weekly\n\n\n“To say Dave Schwensen knows the comedy business would be an understatement.” - Ohio Magazine\n\n\n“The nice thing about Dave is he doesn’t tell you, ‘If you want to be funny, do this.’ He looks at what you’re trying to do and then he helps you fine-tune it.” - The Chronicle Telegram\n\n\n“Sign up for Dave Schwensen’s workshops in comedy - he knows more about comedy than most comics I’ve worked with over the years.” - Bobby Collins, Comedian\n\n\n“This man knows what he is talking about! If you want to be a comedian, public speaker, increase or find out what your sense of humor is, or if you’re a comedian who just needs a refresher course, this is the guy, this is the class! (And yes, he is classy guy!).” - Jeff Wayne, Comedian",

      "description": "My name is Omry Ishai, and I am a magician and mentalist with over two decades of experience. Almost every time I finish a mentalism performance, I get a lot of questions like, \"How did you learn to be a mentalist? Where can I study mentalism? Is there a mentalism course or a school for mentalists?\"\nIn the past, learning mentalism was quite challenging. There were no specific courses, and becoming a mentalist often required a background in magic tricks to access the necessary knowledge (In reality, there's a close connection between magic and mentalism. In fact, mentalism is a sub-genre of magic, a point I emphasize in the course).\nToday, things have changed. Thanks to platforms like Udemy, it's much easier to explore various content and interests, including courses on magic tricks and mentalism. That's why I decided to create a comprehensive Mentalism Course to provide a taste of the fascinating world of mentalism for anyone interested.\nIn this course, you'll find clear and practical explanations of how to perform mind-boggling mentalism tricks. I'll teach you how to read thoughts, predict the future, influence people's choices, move objects with the power of your mind, bend spoons, and even perform card mentalism tricks. No prior knowledge or special gimmicks are required; you can perform everything using everyday items you likely have at home. All demonstrations are easy to follow, and you'll be able to perform them right after the course.\nThis Mentalism Course is designed for anyone who wants to learn the art of mentalism, whether you're a child, an adult, a senior, or a cat (although it might be a bit challenging for cats from a motor skills perspective...).\nWhat sets this course apart is the lively, fun atmosphere. The primary goal is not just to teach mentalism but to provide you with a new skill. With this skill, you can create unforgettable moments for people around you. Imagine the incredible feeling of someone saying, \"You read my mind!\" or knowing precisely what choice they'll make. These are rare moments in our everyday lives.\nSo, I invite you to join my Mentalism Course, and who knows, it might change your life just as it changed mine.\nBest of luck!",

Thank you.\n\n\n===== Extra reading below about Neurogrphica(TM) =====\nWhat is Neurogrphica(TM)?\nNeurographica(TM) is a process created by the Russian psychologist Dr. Pavel Piskarev in 2014. It is very popular in the Russian and German speaking countries.\nIt is an art form that does not require any kind of drawing skill; basically if one can pick up a marker/pencil to draw lines in a controlled manner, one can make Neurographic Art (or Neuroart).\nThe process of making Neuroart can have therapeutic effects, but it is not recommended as a replacement for seeing a therapist (at the time of this writing).\nIt is like Art Therapy with rules; except it is not recommended as a substitution for seeing a therapist (at the time of this writing).\nIt has techniques that a Neurographica(TM) practitioner uses to help their client/s achieve their goal/s.\nIt can be used as a form of self care to give yourself a few hours to exercise some self love as you engage with the process.\nAt a higher mastery level (ie. Specialist level and higher), practitioners can modify the technique/s to assimilate/inculcate some Metaphysical and/or spiritual underpinnings, hence creating a new algorithm. New algorithms can also be created by combining established psychological theories.\n\n\nThe Magic is in the “Doing”, not in the final product.\n\n\nWhat can Neurographica(TM) do ?\nIt can change one’s ingrained thinking patterns, and therefore affect behavioural pattern/s.\nOnce the drawing technique is mastered (easily), no supervision is required to use the method again.\nReduction of stress level/s.\nPurge any personal negative emotions, and negative energy that is in your body.\nPotential to engage dormant brain neurons to increase “computational capacity”, and thus help with arriving at a solution to a difficult problem/issue.\nHelp any user to create new neurons and neural pathways in the brain, thus engaging the process of Neuroplasticity of the brain.\nThe process is capable of training your concentration, and putting anyone into a meditative state while engaged.\nArt in any form enhances brain functions.\nGives the user a way of manifesting their own reality on paper.\nHelps the user to anchor their hopes, thoughts, and wishes, during the drawing process; to help manifest them into this reality through the process of Resonance and Law of Attraction.\nCreate beautiful works of abstract art, without any formal training in Art.\nCan boost your personal self esteem/confidence.\nFor personal and professional growth.\nWorks with the user at the subconscious level through drawing.\nUsed very effectively in Coaching and Counselling practices.\n\n\nHow does it work?\nResearch has revealed that our brain stores memories/information as patterns of neuron activation. (1) (2) (4)\nWhen you draw familiar metaphors/symbols on paper and then associate them with newly formed meaning/s, the brain mirrors the activity by activating the neurons involved in recognizing the metaphors/symbols. (3) (4) (5) (6) And hence, create and anchor the new meaning manifested into a new pattern of neuronal activation.\nIt is widely accepted that learning fine motor activity rewires the brain.\nAnd it is also a well known fact that when you do more of something, it becomes a habit and becomes easier. This can be explained as the process of Automaticity kicking in, requiring your brain to use fewer resources in doing the same task. (7) (8) (9)\nYou put all the above information together and you have the recipe to “make positive changes through strategic drawing.”\n\n\nNOTE : As with any technique, you have to put in the time to see the results. You reap what you sow. There are no shortcuts to achieving the results that you want.\n\n\nA quote from the English translated version of a Russian research paper on Neurographica(TM)\n\"The main conclusion of the literature review and the practical results of its use is that neurographics has the ability to activate the maximum number of points of influence on stress reduction and helps to change the subjective perception of the situation, form new ideas that enable a person to take qualitatively new actions. \"\nAnanyeva E.P. - Neurographics as an art-therapeutic method for accompanying cancer patients in a stressful situation of chemotherapy // Psychology and Psychotechnics. - 2018. - No. 3. - P. 101 - 112.

Follow me step by step through the process of drawing one portrait, and together we will explore the creative, expressive qualities of charcoal: from the rough, basic block-in phase through to the final finished art work.\nYou'll also learn how this way of drawing is the key to unlocking your own unique drawing voice, and your own drawing language.\nThrough careful observation, you'll learn how to naturally and intuitively find the landmarks of the face, and be able to draw them easily, without complex construction or detailed measuring. Eventually this method allows you to draw freely and responsively.\nAn expressive portrait can be a striking and powerful artwork. It allows you to weave your own impressions of a person into a drawing that fully represents the subject.\nIf you've ever wanted to learn to draw faces or portraits, in a way that is natural, easy and leaves room for your own creative expression, then this course is for you!\nPlus, it's fun! :) It's great to get messy with charcoal and draw with the FREEDOM of not having to make a photo-quality image.

Enroll now and start your path to becoming a masterful, passionate writer!\nLearn that writing is a Divine Impulse!\nWriting with passion is crucial because it infuses your work with authenticity and energy, making it more engaging and impactful. When you write with passion, your enthusiasm and commitment shine through, capturing the reader's attention and evoking emotions. This connection can inspire, motivate, and resonate deeply with your audience, creating a lasting impression. Passionate writing also fuels your creativity and perseverance, helping you overcome challenges and produce your best work. Ultimately, writing with passion transforms your words into a powerful force that can influence and inspire others.\nAbout Me: Writing has been a love of mine, my entire life. Well beyond love, almost an addiction, but one that saves me instead of hurting me. I have been through the spectrum of emotions with writing, have been traditionally published, and Indie published, have been agented and not agented, I have learned so much on the strategy of writing, but more than that, what it means to be a writer, what we go through and how we feel on our journey to becoming a writer and how that effects our life. The choices and perceptions we have along the way can have real consequence to our writing, but also our level of stress on that journey (the old adage of writers being alcoholics applies here). I have over 40 years of experience writing, since I have written as soon as I could write, and not like everyone else, but a drive, I call a Divine Drive to write. I want to share everything I have learned with you in the intimate workshops that I will share one at a time, as I feel inspired, to share with you something I think will really impact your life of writing.\n\n\nWhat you'll learn\nA Documentary Look at the Lifestyle of a Writer and Author\nUnderstanding the Profound Reason You Need To Write\nUnderstanding Your Writing Routines & Rituals or Forming Them\nExploring The Bones & Flesh Writing Technique\nWrite, Grind, Acquire Methodology\nThe Process of Writing a Book\nFinding Your True Motivation (It Isn't What You Think It Is)\nHow Do Writers Create Material Out of Thin Air? (Fiction and Non-Fiction)\nDefine If You Are A Writer Or Not\nCreating an Inspirational Space to Write\nPhilosophical Questions and Answers About Writing\nWriting: A Pathway to God?\nUnderstanding How Writers Are Different\nUnderstand Why Writers Must Write\nWriting As a Career or Giving Up Writing (Could You Really?)\nSelf-Analysis On Your Own Writing Ritual & Making It Purposeful\nA Professional Writing Workshop Diploma is available to you with the Academy logo and seal, available in both digital and hard copy (details apply). You may request a POBA certificate from Charly, our Certificate Chancellor. Details will be in the course on how to do that.\nGo on Amazon to read the assortment of reviews I have on my books. Look up my name in the search bar, Sufani Weisman-Garza. You will find an assortment of reviews on my books from long reviews from professional reviewers, Beth and Leanne to everyday readers, from fiction to non-fiction. Why, it's important that you see that when we write from our heart and share our divine impulse to write, that it touches others whether with sheer joy, or profound learning and impact. Our job it to just do it well. So, think about yourself as if you were the writer, reading theses reviews, and ask yourself how it would feel to write something and read what others felt about your work. They aren't just words on a page, they are responses to your divine impulse to write. It's deeper than that. Your words are also connecting you to others in a meaningful way.\n\n\nIf you are also interested in these topics, you will be interested in this course: Content writing, writing, creative writing, technical writing, business writing, academic writing, novel writing, complete creative writing, all genres, writing with flair, writing revenue, write well, get published, get published and earn an income, digital journalism, how to become a bestselling author on amazon kindle, writing skills, authorship, becoming an author, how to become a bestselling author.\nEnjoy, and I'll see you in class!\nLove Sufi",

      "description": "Advanced Science Fiction & Fantasy\nWriting the 21st century myth\n\n\nA journey into the mythic storytelling of scifi & fantasy with writer and storyteller Damien Walter on a hunt for the 21st century myth.\nFor as long as there have been humans, there have been stories. Stories to help us understand our mysterious universe and give meaning to our lives. Stories to give us comfort in darkness and inspire us to reach for the light.\nScience fiction & fantasy are the most popular stories of the 21st century. On the cinema screen, in our Netflix streams and in video games, billions of us watch, read and play the amazing stories of scifi and fantasy.\nDamien Walter, writer on sci-fi and geek culture for The Guardian, BBC, WIRED and graduate of the Clarion writers workshop, leads a journey into scifi and fantasy storytelling.\n\n\nFive Star Reviews\n\n\n“I loved the course. Damien has simplified the complexity of stories for me.” Kim Davis, The Rhetoric of Story\n\n\n“This was excellent. Rather than teaching the mechanics of writing, this is about how to tell a compelling story.” Mark Lemke, The Rhetoric of Story\n\n\n“This course was absolutely amazing. I started this course as my job was slowing down for the covid-19 pandemic and ultimately finished it at home after being laid off.” Cory Ellis, The Rhetoric of Story\n\n\n“I found this course informative, exciting and inspiring. As a 75 year old, new to writing this has motivated a new journey of which i am looking forward to with enthusiasm.” Brian Cummings, The Rhetoric of Story\n\n\n“Wonderful style of teaching and great use of \"practicing what you preach\". Each lecture itself feels like listening to a story.” Maral Asdjian, The Rhetoric of Story\n\n\n“Damien clarified for me exactly what I was missing - the essence of the story.” Grzegorz Kopeć, The Rhetoric of Story\n\n\n“With relevant examples, Damien has literally broken down complex ideas into easy, digestible content.” Shivani Deshmukh, The Rhetoric of Story\n\n\n“Damien is a very engaging teacher and he makes the complexity of this subject accessible and thrilling. I have no background in literary studies. And English isn't my native language. Even so, I followed all the lessons without significant hassle.”\n\n\n“simply full of insightful tips and advices - there's not a dull or pointless moment in the whole class.” Juuso Sallinen, The Rhetoric of Story\n\n\n\n\nScience fiction is our modern mythology\nAs science transformed how we saw the universe, life and human existence, our old myths died. We began a search for new myths to give meaning to the modern world, myths we call science fiction.\nFrom Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 and a thousand stories beyond, great storytellers have crafted new myths for the age of science.\nBut as we grow into the 21st century, even the modern myths of science fiction are getting old. The need for the myths for our fast changing world is greater than ever.\n\n\n\n\nWho will write the 21st century myth?\nWhen Damien Walter asked Twitter what was the greatest myth of the 21st century, he got a surprising answer, from the storyteller Neil Gaiman himself.\nStar Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Avengers - all the smash hit sci-fi & fantasy franchises of today are myths of the last century, their values are those of the past 20th, not the future 21st century.\nWhen a truly 21st century myth is written, we will know it.\nWho will write the 21st century myth? Will it be Neil Gaiman? Will it be any of the great new writers of today?\nOr will it, perhaps, be you?\n\n\n\n\nDamien Walter wrote the long running Weird Things column for The Guardian, and has interviewed legendary SF authors including Harlan Elison and Neil Stephenson. He studied with World Fantasy award winner Graham Joyce, and is a graduate of the Clarion writer’s workshop lead by Neil Gaiman and Kelly Link. His writing courses have over twenty-five thousand students online.\n\n\nAs featured in:\n\n\nThe Guardian, BBC, Wired, The Independent, Buzzfeed, Aeon\n\n\n\n\nThe advanced course for fans and creators of science fiction and fantasy\nJoin a growing community of passionate fans and creators on a journey to write new myths for the 21st century.\nTalks - open talks looking at classic works of science fiction & fantasy and the myths they gave to the world.\nWorkshops - deep dive discussions and writing craft sessions to open up the mythic imagination.\nInterviews - with leading creators and industry professionals.\nFeedback - the chance to get your stories read and to develop further with critical feedback.\nCertification - create your 21st century myth and receive course certification.\n\n\n\n\nJoin the course in Advanced Science Fiction & Fantasy today on Udemy",

Well beyond love, almost an addiction, but one that saves me instead of hurting me. I have been through the spectrum of emotions with writing, have been traditionally published, and Indie published, have been agented and not agented, I have learned so much on the strategy of writing, but more than that, what it means to be a writer, what we go through and how we feel on our journey to becoming a writer and how that effects our life. The choices and perceptions we have along the way can have real consequence to our writing, but also our level of stress on that journey (the old adage of writers being alcoholics applies here). I have over 40 years of experience writing, since I have written as soon as I could write, and not like everyone else, but a drive, I call a Divine Drive to write. I want to share everything I have learned with you in the intimate workshops that I will share one at a time, as I feel inspired, to share with you something I think will really impact your life of writing.\nA Professional Writing Workshop Diploma Is Available to you with the Academy logo and seal, available in both digital and hard copy (details apply). You may request a POBA certificate from Charly, our Certificate Chancellor. Details will be in the course on how to do that.\nGo on Amazon to read the assortment of reviews I have on my books. Look up my name in the search bar, Sufani Weisman-Garza. You will find an assortment of reviews on my books from long reviews from professional reviewers, Beth and Leanne to everyday readers, from fiction to non-fiction. Why, it's important that you see that when we write from our heart and share our divine impulse to write, that it touches others whether with sheer joy, or profound learning and impact. Our job it to just do it well. So, think about yourself as if you were the writer, reading theses reviews, and ask yourself how it would feel to write something and read what others felt about your work. They aren't just words on a page, they are responses to your divine impulse to write. It's deeper than that. Your words are also connecting you to others in a meaningful way.\n\n\nIf you are also interested in these topics, you will be interested in this course: Content writing, writing, creative writing, technical writing, business writing, academic writing, novel writing, complete creative writing, all genres, writing with flair, writing revenue, write well, get published, get published and earn an income, digital journalism, how to become a bestselling author on amazon kindle, writing skills, authorship, becoming an author, how to become a bestselling author.\nEnjoy, and I'll see you in class!\nLove Sufi",

Your job as a screenwriter is to create that WOW! feeling on as many pages as possible. But writing authentic, sparkling, well-crafted dialogue that individualizes characters and entertains the reader is the ultimate challenge for screenwriters, who otherwise may have solid script elements, and yet are bound to fail because of flawed dialogue.\nIn Writing Dialogue for Emotional Impact, bestselling author Karl Iglesias will showcase dozens of dialogue techniques and lots of examples from highly successful screenwriters that turn bland, on-the-nose dialogue into striking speech that snaps, crackles and pops off the page.\nHow-to books and seminars discuss dialogue superficially and are more often prescriptive than enlightening. They focus on what dialogue must do but neglect to discuss specific techniques on how to do it. Expanding on the essential elements of all successful scripts - the reader's emotional experience - this course will analyze great dialogue and offer helpful dialogue rewriting exercises.\nIf you're looking to raise your dialogue to professional standards, Writing Dialogue for Emotional Impact is the course for you.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat people are saying about our courses:\nVery helpful. Adds depth to your understanding and intuitive insights which you surely had if you happened to play with video shooting and editing without doing any learning beforehand. It's enriching. The movie samples are great as the clarify the points. Love it! - Yosi Tsitsu\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMost seminars and books attempt to teach the frustrated screenwriter what to do and what not to do; this course will outline how to do it - how to develop habits that will lead to more joy in the writing process and better scripts.\nAward-winning UCLA screenwriting instructor Karl Iglesias takes an in-depth look at the most challenging area for screenwriters: how to avoid “on-the-nose” dialogue and create dramatic interactions that have subtext—the true meaning and emotions behind the spoken words.\nAlong with great examples from successful screenplays, these courses includes:\nTen proven techniques for creating subtext in your dialogue.\nThree reasons why subtext is such a big deal.\nThe dramatic moments when “on-the-nose” dialogue is actually acceptable.\nDid you know that 95% of novice writers fail at the concept? The concept is the core of the script. And most insiders agree that in Hollywood, the “idea is king.” You can create a great hero, write edgy dialogue, weave in a deep theme. But if you choose the wrong concept, or fail to develop it properly, you’re guaranteed an uphill battle at the marketing stage.\nWhat makes a great idea, regardless of genre or whether it is a high or low concept.\nThe three emotional requirements of a great idea that create interest, excitement, and fascination.\nTechniques to energize any concept, including soft-sells.\nA screenplay should be as exciting to read as the movie will be to view, and this requires writing designed to involve the reader. Expanding on the key element of all successful scripts, the reader’s emotional experience, author Karl Iglesias discusses the basics of emotionally evocative writing.\nCommand attention on the page.\nEnergize descriptions.\nSeamlessly weave exposition into description.\nTrim the fat.\nChoose the right words for emotional impact\nIncluded in this course is the 10 Habits of Successful Hollywood Screenwriters\n\nIn Mastering the Habits of Highly Successful Screenwriters, bestselling author Karl Iglesias will guide students to identify and develop the key screenwriting habits of A-list screenwriters, like Ron Bass, Akiva Goldsman, Gerald DiPego, Eric Roth, Nicholas Kazan, Ed Solomon, Scott Rosenberg, and more. He'll offer an insider's view at how these pros discipline themselves, create original material, conquer the blank page, eliminate writer's block, network, pitch, and persevere in Hollywood.\nModeling what works is the philosophy at the heart of this course. The secret to success in any field is to find what successful people do and think about and do the same. The difference between successful screenwriters and amateurs is that successful screenwriters do all the things that amateurs want to do but can't do, or don't know how to do.\nIf you want to elevate your scripts and stories – AND your screenwriting or filmmaking career -- to the highest possible level, this class is a must.\nThey DON'T teach you this in Film School!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat people are saying about our courses:\nVery helpful.

Study their habits, learn from them, and maybe their wisdom will rub off on you and arm you with enough knowledge and self-confidence to accomplish your goals.\nBy taking this course, you'll discover what it really takes to be a successful screenwriter in Hollywood, and either see similarities in your attitudes and ways of thinking or be inspired to adopt new ones.

But after editing a few hundred books and writing a dozen of my own, I've created clear and simple resources for outlining commercial fiction that is better than anything else available. I hope you think so too.\n\nWhether you're a pantser or a plotter; whether your first rough draft is finished or you haven't even started; this guide to plotting and story architecture will drastically improve your novel's pacing, create more intrigue, and keep readers engaging. Ultimately, you'll end up with a much more satisfying book - which means better reviews, and more sales.\n\nFEEDBACK ON MY PLOTTING RESOURCES:\n\"I've been listening to this non-stop. Dude has done his research on story structure.\"\n\"Finally implementing your structure into the beats of my story. I really think you're on to something here. You can literally immediately visualize hundreds of movies you know (that worked) based on when certain beats happen.\"\n\"I have been looking for a plot structure like this for a long time! It helped me to complete a system that I'm so happy with. Thanks so much!\"\n\"This has been so helpful! You don't understand what this means to me. If anyone ever asks me how I managed to write three full POV stories at once in the same book, I'll credit Derek Murphy.\"\n\"Man this right here helped me a ton yo. It cut out most of all the nonsense that the other outlines be giving.\"\n\"When I put my story ideas into other outlines they seem to leave me still feeling lost, and confused with what should happen in certain chapters. But this one? I was able to connect the dots from beginning to the complete end. I had to study it for a week straight before I finally was able to really understand how to use this story structure completely.\"\n\"Thank you so much for creating this story outline. Me being able to really complete a story blueprint makes me feel so happy right now.\"",

(Lars Peterson)\n*************\nI was looking for a good grounding in novel writing, and this gives a really good outline of the process. I've learned new things (Perry Carver)\n*************\nI like the way James spends time on each topic. English is not my language (French) and I need some good tips for writing good prose. 'How To Write A Novel' looks good, and contains some solid tips. (Benoit Fourrier)\n\n\nHow To Write A Novel The Structured Way\n\nWhew! There's a lot to take in, but it really does flow logically once you see how all the elements of a modern novel fit together and help to improve your novel writing skills. Even beginners can succeed at novel writing if you are well organized and the manuscript is planned well.\nThe course 'How To Write A Novel' will guide you through the essential steps to a successful novel, even if you have no experience. You need to bring your idea and the willingness to want to learn how to write your first novel, that's the main thing.\nHow To Write A Novel (without having a break-down)\nThe title of this course is self-explanatory, in that it is designed to help you write the story you have always wanted to write, through explaining the various elements of novel writing through the course of its lectures. I would like to applaud you for taking your first step towards novel writing; writing your first novel is not easy, and acknowledging that you even want to do something about the story that you have in your head is a huge event.\nI understand that this can’t be easy, mainly when the idea of novel writing seems to stand out scarily and appears to present pictures of people sitting in dingy rooms, furiously typing away on their rusty typewriters with no sense of time or anything else – just writing (or trying to write) their first novel book.\nThis stereotypical image associated with writing can often put people off learning how to write a novel in a structured manner, because they begin to fear the amount of work related to it. However, this course is designed in a manner that allows you to be able to consume small parts of the novel writing process without it becoming an overwhelming experience for you - you will learn how to write a novel painlessly!\nQuite often, aspiring writers tend to think they lack the expertise required and don't know how to write a novel-length story successfully – but that’s where you’re wrong. Armed with enough dedication and information, there is no reason you shouldn’t be able to do this!\nThrough the course of this course, various lectures outline and attempt to answer any questions you might have had about the various aspects of novel writing. It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner – we begin right with the basics, and go all the way to novel completion, with the additions of suggestions regarding editing and publishing as well.\nThe lectures focus on a wide range of topics, from dialogue use, to world building and structuring your narrative – giving you everything you need to get started on that novel you always wanted to write.\nBe open to learning on this journey towards becoming a more efficient and thoughtful writer – and you will be surprised by what you discover about yourself (and your novel writing skills) by the end of this journey.\nSign Up Now!\n#NovelWritingEssentials #howtowriteanovel #writefirstnovel #writeyournovel #creativewriting #novelwriting #howtowritenovels",

Don't make the same mistakes that so many novice authors make and create main characters that can challenge those of successful authors!\nMy name is Matthew Dewey and I am a writer. It is hard to say when my passion for writing began, but if I can recall it all started back in primary school. A small, pale child with not much to say, but plenty to write, or in most cases scribble, across a page. From there writing became a hobby, moving on to become a part-time job writing articles on various subjects from technology to programming. Suddenly, the spark was ignited and I wrote my first novel. From there I was hooked onto something that was akin to a calling.\nEnough monologue, it is time to tell you what this course is worth to you. First, it is free to all beginner writers as a way to introduce them to me. You can find this course on my YouTube channel or on my website, thepennedsleuth. That being said, this course was created with the express intention to start a series of courses. In my rising through the writing world I found that information was handed freely, but not with enough dedication and forethought. The advice lacking and the examples poor. I decided to push through and after several years developed my own toolkit that is simple and multipurpose. The first and most important lesson I learned was how not to make a main character. From there I experimented and found the positives.\nI will show you how to write:\nPersonality\nBackstory\nDescriptions\nNames\nand PURPOSE\n\n\nWelcome to the How to Make A Better Main Character Course! I will show you everything you need to know to keep your main character interesting and worthy of the role of protagonist!",

Then using Therapeutic Art as the tool to deal with these possibly distressing or confusing emotions, both calming the distress and using visuals as a way to see these emotions in front of you. You'll even find yourself having fun in the process!\nThis is an introductory course to help you discover your true desires and passions, and how to move into having these in your life, and you will see what it is you need to do to change your yourself, your life and your world. What do you want to happen in your life next year or in the next 5 years? Where do you want to be – in your mind, body on your life path? And how can you make this happen? I will help you to help yourself throughout this course!\nSetting good intentions for ourselves and others has far greater effect than most of us truly know. The effects can be miraculous if our intentions are truly believed to be reality. Just as Dr Randolph Byrd showed in a study in a San Francisco Hospital, with two control groups of heart patients: one group were prayed for by some volunteers, the other was not. The prayed-for group reported to be 5 times less likely to need antibiotics and 3 times less likely to develop fluid in the lungs, whilst also none of the prayed-for group needed artificial ventilation whilst 12 members of the non-prayed for group did. This clearly shows just how powerful our thoughts, prayers and intentions can be - even so much as making someones health better! When a loved one is ill and you feel helpless thinking, \"I wish there was something I could do\" There is! In this course we will look at what we want, our aspirations, and make these intentions to bring them about in our lives and those around us.\n\n\nNo prior experience of doing any form of art is required!\n\n\nThis is a 4 week course designed for you to take the time and space each week for a creative exercise whilst you contemplate the questions I give you about your Self and your life. You can do the exercises in any timeframe you desire, however I advise having time to reflect between each exercise, ideally sticking to it being 4 weeks.\nUse your preferred materials for any of the exercises, even if I am using paint you can use pencil, pen, crayons, pastels, collage or anything else you can think of! The priority is for you to do the exercise itself, no matter the material being used, and see what comes up for you.",

In fact, it's absolutely essential for your success in the modern world. Mastering your creative thinking will help you to reach new heights in your career, your business, your art, finances and in your relationships with others.\nResponding to the challenges of the twenty-first century – with its complex environmental, social and economic pressures – requires people to be creative, innovative, enterprising and adaptable, with the motivation, confidence and skills to use creative thinking purposefully.\nThis includes combining parts to form something original, sifting and refining ideas to discover possibilities, constructing theories and objects, and acting on intuition. The products of creative endeavour can involve complex representations and images, investigations and performances, digital and computer-generated output, or occur as virtual reality.\nImagine for a moment how this could change your life. If you don't like where some aspect of humanity is going, imagine if you could do something amazing about it.\nMost of us are not natural creative thinkers. Telling oneself and the team ‘to be creative’ does not usually yield results. Some special techniques are required to help us use our brains in a different way - to change our usual thinking process. The issue with creative thinking is that almost by definition any idea that has not already been examined is going to sound crazy. But a good solution will probably sound crazy – at first. Unfortunately, that’s why we often won’t put it forward.\n\n\nWhy take this Course?\nFrom the linear to the intuitive, this course details ingenious creative-thinking techniques for approaching problems in unconventional ways. This course will equip you with a ‘tool-box’, introducing you to a selection of behaviours and techniques that will augment your innate creativity.\nThrough fun and thought-provoking exercises, illustrated strategies, and inspiring real-world examples you’ll learn how to create original ideas that will improve your personal life and your business life.\n\n\nWhat you'll learn in this course:\n·         Understand what creative thinking techniques are\n·         Develop your own, new, creativity techniques\n·         Make your ideas take shape in the real world\n·         Use high-impact, creativity techniques\n·         Tap into your most original thinking, regularly and on demand\n·         Make new connections in your mind that result in amazing ideas\n·         Brainstorm, analyze and evaluate innovative ideas and solutions\n·         Unlock creative solutions and skills of which you were previously unaware\n·         Learn how to apply the methods and tools to generate ideas for improving areas of your own performance\n\n\n\n\nWhat is in this Course?\nStep by step instructions on all the stages for creative thinking mindset\nAn engaging style of teaching",

In this educational and FUN four hour-ish workshop, I'll teach you the basics of movie screenplays, how to properly structure and format them, how to begin to write your own stories, and an honest insiders take on the movie business from a working screenwriter and producer with almost twenty years of experience.\nYou'll walk away not only with the tools to begin to write movies, but you'll leave with the beginnings of your own story. This is a great introduction for those interested in a possible career in film but also for those who love movies and want a one-of-kind experience.\nI have written six feature films that have been produced, including most recently, The Commando, featuring Michael Jai White and Mickey Rourke. I also produced four feature films; a one-hour comedy special on Starz, Comedy InvAsian, a television series featuring the nation’s top Asian American comedians; and Brash Girls Club, a limited comedy series, which premiered on Tubi TV. The only thing I love more than writing is teaching it. I am currently a screenwriting instructor at UCLA Extensions, the New York Film Academy in Burbank, and most recently Chapman University.",

You’ll be guided step-by-step through the entire process by BOB MILLS, an experienced professional who has written jokes, sketches, speeches, song lyrics, and comedy routines for Dean Martin, Dinah Shore, Steve Allen, Bob Hope and a host of guests on their TV specials -- a seasoned practitioner of the comedic arts whose myriad assignments included writing serious magazine articles that appeared in national publications like the Saturday Evening Post and The Ladies Home Journal. He is the author of THE LAUGH MAKERS: A Behind-the-Scenes Tribute to Bob Hope’s Incredible Gag Writers which recalls his two decades travelling the globe with Bob Hope as a staff writer.\nHe is a firm believer that virtually anyone with a sense of humor (that includes almost everybody) can learn the craft of creating comedy by mastering the elements necessary to inject funny lines in monologues, speeches, reports, articles, scripts, and song lyrics, as well as comic dialogue -- anywhere that laughter and wit are welcome.\nAn instructor who was born to teach, BOB MILLS explains comedic structure in clear, concise language -- providing the student with the “nuts and bolts” of comedy writing that the old timers refer to as “laying pipe.”\nThrough entertaining, easy-to-understand lectures, extensive analysis, hands-on practice, and by studying the hours clips included as additional resources exclusively available to the Udemy student of actual on-air performances of monologues, sketches, and routines performed by professionals, students will become familiar with a time honored craft whose genesis can be traced back to Vaudeville and English tab shows.\nIn fact, by completing this course, the student will have learned so much about script writing, he or she will possess the skills needed to create laugh lines at will, and for any purpose, be it for a spec script for TV or just “punching up” a business presentation.\nFrom blank page to scripted performance, the student becomes privy to comedy writing secrets passed down through generations of professionals dating back to Vaudeville!\nCourse Summary\nTopics covered in this course (along with 4+ hours of video examples) include:\nThe History of Humor in America\nEnglish roots (tabloid shows, burlesque)\nVaudeville (W.C. Fields, Fred Allen)\nRadio (Jack Benny, Fred Allen)\nFilm (Abbott & Costello, Martin & Lewis)\nTelevision (variety shows, sitcoms, unscripted reality)\nThe Anatomy of a Joke\nVerbal magic (“hiding the technique”)\nThe setup\nMisdirection (creating an expectation)\nThe reveal (punch line)\nNecessity of Instant Recognition\nClarity in presentation\nAttitude in delivery\nMethods of Misdirection\nUncommon Association\nUnexpected List Entry\nIllogical Connection\nAnthropomorphizing\nMisplaced Terminology\nFlippant Iconoclasm\nAlliteration\nUnexpected word usage\nNew Meaning for Familiar Phrase\nLiteral Interpretation\nMisuse of Medical Terminology\nAlternate Word Meaning\nIllogical Conclusion\nMisused Logic\nUnlikely Comparison\nObscure Word Use\nFantasy Exaggeration\nTypes of Jokes\nTopical (based on news items)\nSlice-of-life (everyday conflicts)\nStory-based (“Two guys walk into a bar…”)\nBiographical (embellished from real life)\nObservational (Ellen DeGeneres)\nConsistent Point of View\nAngry (Jerry Seinfeld, Louis Black)\nThe Victim (Richard Lewis, Rodney Dangerfield)\nFalse Braggadocio (Don Knotts)\nImprov (Jonathan Winters, Robin Williams)\nMonologue Structure (order of jokes)\nRhythm and Pace (varying length)\nBuilding the Payoff Line\nJoke Formulas\nArranging the Topics\nOpenings\nClosings\nCreating Comic Dialogue\nReal Life conversation (Award show presenters)\nCharacter Interview (Carl Riener & Mel Brooks)\nUsing an Already Familiar Character\nDeveloping a Character\nAvoiding “Leading Lines”\nThe “Dumb Act” (Burns & Allen)\nImportance of the “Straight Man”\nThe Comedy Sketch\nHistory of the sketch\nLength\nSubject matter\nFilm & TV Parody\nBrevity\nJoke-Driven Sketch\nThe “Set Up”\nDeveloping the Premise\n*The Conflict\n*The Dilemma\n*The Resolution (“Black Out’)\nCONCLUSION\nAlong with learning to write monologues, sketches and comic interviews, the student has learned the principles necessary to improve any writing assignment from business reports, speeches, presentations, articles, company shows, and product demonstrations.
