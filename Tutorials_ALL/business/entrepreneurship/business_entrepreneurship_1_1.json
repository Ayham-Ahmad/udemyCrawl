Watch our PREVIEW VIDEOS\nOver 140,000 happy students enrolled in our courses!\nOver 28,000 TOP reviews!\nMotivation, according to the Cambridge dictionary, is the enthusiasm, need or reason for doing something. I would personally prefer to call it the burning desire to achieve a specific and well defined goal.\nIt is the eagerness and passion that governs and manages your behavior and defines the path along which you will move. Motivation is something that triggers you into action and allows you to follow through when obstacles appear.\nIt is the endurance to keep moving ahead in spite of difficult times and difficult circumstances. It is the drive to stick to your plan even when all odds are against you.\nMotivation is the vigor and perseverance that pushes you to FULFILL YOUR DREAMS. Our brain is in a permanent state of need for pleasure. If you are able to filter the thoughts that you send to your brain, you are on your way to controlling how the brain reacts in different situations.\nOnce the brain detects possibilities to acquire pleasure, it will jump into action to satisfy its needs. At the same time, however, the brain has the natural tendency to avoid painful and unpleasant situations.\nLearn to feed your mind continuously with empowering thoughts. Fuel your mind with thoughts that are related to happiness, contentment and pleasure and the brain will strive towards its achievement.\nUse your Power of Motivation to:\nBecome fearless\nEmanate Confidence\nClimb the career ladder\nDefine your goals\nBecome more energetic\nFuel your brain with positivity\nBecome hungry for success\nIncrease your self-confidence\nBoost your self-esteem\nConquer obstacles\nOvercome procrastination\nTake control of your thoughts",

Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Andrew Mason, Kevin Systrom all started their businesses not with immediate success, but with immediate failure, ridicule, and frustration.\nThat’s not the story you heard, right?\nYou probably heard that they all channeled their unlimited brilliance into crafting the perfect idea. An idea so great, so perfect that it was just a matter of time before their idea took the world by storm.\nThat’s what most people think. And most people are 100% wrong.\nFacebook started as a way to compare attractiveness between classmates.\nPinterest started as an app that let you get notified when your favorite designer goods went on sale.\nGroupon started as a website for raising funds for charity.\nInstagram started as Burbn, the 400th app to let you “check in” at your favorite businesses.\nAnd yes, Twitter started as a website to list and find podcasts.\nNone of these ideas were brilliant. They weren’t clever. They certainly weren’t insightful. And they certainly weren't \"ahead of their time\"\nBut they WERE created by people who supposedly are.\nBusiness ideas are not an art. They're not things that are limited only to those with experience & creative insight.\nAnyone can come up with, develop, and improve business ideas. Business ideas that can be life changing - and I guarantee a whole lot better than the first idea of most major companies.\nStop being intimidated by the process of coming up with business ideas. Learn it, master it, and conquer it.\nLearn the science behind creating great business ideas.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy you should enroll:\nOver 1,000 students have signed up within the first 12 hours of the course going live!\nCourse includes over 6 hours of high quality content, including activities, worksheets, quizzes, exclusive discounts, and access to an exclusive class only web idea generating web application\nYou'll learn skills that are invaluable in any situation, like being able to assess an ideas marketability, how to spot market inefficiencies, and how to successfully employ brand new, disruptive business models\nYou'll have direct access to the instructor, who has vet over 1,000 ideas as a venture capitalists, and hundreds more as a founder and director of a digital agency\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the instructor:\nTop rated Udemy Instructor with over 30,000 five star reviews.\nTeaches 11 different courses on Entrepreneurship, with over 500,000 students enrolled.\nAll courses by the instructor have are rated an average of 4.97 out of 5 stars.\n+ Worked as a VC and was in charge of deal flow in Silicon Valley.

In other words, you can become a freelance translator.",

You want abundance, you want creative freedom, you want a great lifestyle. But... maybe you compromise, or shrink your opinions, or you follow some rules that seem unbreakable. And over time, or over night, your idea of success gets away from your soul.\nThis VIDEO COURSE is an exercise in DEFINING SUCCESS ON YOUR OWN TERMS.\nYou’ll examine your fears and your desires. You’ll get closer to what “achievement” really means to you — right now. And you’ll get effective tools to help you take more decisive action. Soulful approaches + practical implementation = life and work transformed.\nDig it:\nAnswer The 11 Burning Questions -- from the dream zone to money practicalities, that are essential to creative direction.\nDeclare your superpowers -- hone in on your true strengths instead of trying to be well-rounded (because being well-round is highly overrated.)\nBecome a sovereign of time management -- learn the difference between “Power Time” and “Tyrant Time”.\nCreate a Stop Doing List. (What you stop doing is just as critical to your success as what you start doing.)\nLearn how to set goals with soul, based on identifying your Core Desired Feelings.\nMake generosity part of your business plan… because generous people always have more to give.\nWith her characteristic warmth and straight-up style, Danielle is asking you spirit-anchored questions about how you plan to expand your creative power. This is a wholistic approach to ambition that connects your prosperity to your soul, and your passion to being of real service in the world.\nContents & Overview\nThis course is where divine wisdom meets practical tools. You get 13 video “sessions” of lectures, contemplations, and a full scope Q&A series that Danielle hasn’t offered anywhere else. Every section is full of creativity prompts and printable PDF worksheets on specific topics. -- all designed to help get real, get clear and own your definition of true success.\nThe first sessions are groundwork for the Fire starter philosophy: operating from your zone of true strengths, using ease as a metric and committing to authenticity and service.\nThen you move into casting a vision for work and life that’s grounded and expansive (yes, it has to be both!) You’ll examine fears, reconsider the value of failure and practice the art of connected conversation. You’ll learn the crucial skill of setting boundaries and knowing when to say “Hell, yes!” and “No, thank you.”\nThe homestretch is about choosing “power time” over “tyrant time” management, and getting clear in money expectations. And with a final that is all about heart, you’ll get inspired to build your true tribe and make generosity part of your prosperity strategy.",

      "description": "-- Nat's Review: \"This is the best course on entrepreneurship that I've seen.\"\n8 Steps to Becoming a Successful Business Owner\nThere’s a lot of fluff and theory about startups, entrepreneurship, and business modeling. You won’t find any of that stuff here. That 8-step journey that we’ve built for you has been crafted through our founding team’s real startup journey and with research from institutions like MIT, Y Combinator, and Stanford. This experience is about lowering your risk, accelerating your journey forward, and inviting you to join a thriving community of like-minded people.\nSee Real World Examples as You Launch Your Business\nYour launch will be supported by real world examples of the business launch tools in this course in action. You’ll have access to multiple target market interview recordings, downloadable support resources, and an inside look at data tracking Eazl’s growth from a concept to a six-figure business in its first year. You’ll also get to choose from three specialization tracks:\nServices and Live Experiences\nPhysical Products\nWeb Applications and Digital Technologies\nUnmatched Video Learning Experience Quality\nAnyone who has the willpower to do what it takes to become the boss will love this course. Leveraging our experience as the leading provider of entrepreneurial business education to a community of over 50,000 learners worldwide, we’ve created an unparalleled video-based learning experience for you. This experience is about real stuff involved in entrepreneurship, the power of visual learning, and the thrill of building something awesome. Starting with the first phase of the course, you’ll learn how to select a launch market, collect the research you need to create an offering that people will pay for, and move down the human-centric design path. Then you’ll move to phase two where you’ll design a minimum viable product (MVP)--a very early version of your concept--that you can use to validate your idea before taking it to the public. In phase three you’ll build your first operational version of the business, craft the first iteration of your brand and business story, get your first paying customers, and set yourself up to receive growth capital using a practical method that doesn’t require you to deal with venture capitalists or lawyers. Come rock it with us!\nThis course features music by Audionautix, Kevin MacLoed, and Chris Zabriskie\nTeam Eazl would like to thank the following people who underwrote the development of this learning experience:\nPlatinum Circle Funders: Dundee and Ian Butcher, Bieke and Brian Burwell, and Michele Chaboudy\nGold Circle Funder: Landry Jones\nSilver Circle Funders: Christos Angelidakis, Eric Jacobson, Ricardo Pan Neves, David Valentine, Joselyn Quintero, and Mike Steely\nContent Upgrade Journal\n• Version 1.1 (November 2021): In this upgrade, we've added new content related to finding business ideas that work well online, how to perform market research using the Internet and other tech-enabled researching methods, more prototyping tools, and more content on how to get your business' first customers. Enjoy the update!\n• Version 1.2 (January 2022): In this upgrade, we've added professionally-developed English-language subtitles. This will be a great addition for our ESL learners!\n• Version 2 (November 2023): In this upgrade, we've added AI prompts for entrepreneurs. You can use these prompts to generate a business plan and develop your early customer profile -- they'll help you reach your goals faster!",

Or perhaps, you know something about it, but don’t understand how it works, where its value comes from, and how is it developing currently.\nIt is the technology powering crypto-assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and many others. And it has become the hottest field in the tech sector now.\nBlockchain has the potential to change the world and few people realize all its far-reaching applications beyond Bitcoin.\nIts disruptive potential has been compared to that of the Internet. That’s why people call it “the Internet of money” or “the Internet of value”.\nNow, compare this course to having a roadmap to the Internet in the early 1990s. A comprehensive guide that enables you to fully understand the new space and empowers you to make correct fully-informed decisions. You will be able to see new business opportunities before others do. You will be able to distinguish good ideas and projects from bad ones. You will learn how blockchain works and how it can be applied in various sectors. Moreover, you will get a new perspective on decentralized economic systems, which are expected to play a huge role in the future. This is the “sharing economy” 2.0 – powered by crypto-economics and blockchain.\nThis is what “Blockchain for Business: The New Industrial Revolution” will teach you!\nOur mission is to provide the most comprehensive educational material on the subject, which delivers the best value for money to our audience.\nAfter the unprecedented growth of the crypto-asset market, fuelled by speculation and emotions, it is high time to increase awareness and understanding of blockchain technology among the general public.\nWe believe that understanding should come first, before anyone starts making any decisions with real-world implications. That’s why our team created this course and tried to design it in the most clear, accessible and fun way. This is by no means a highly technical course and our focus here is not programming. We are not going to show you how to write code. But we are going to explain everything else, which is relevant and important to know about blockchain.\nOur materials are designed to explain the fundamentals of blockchain technology, crypto-economics and their applications in business and everyday life to people without a technical background.\nWe hope you are as passionate about constantly upgrading your knowledge base, as we are. Because knowledge is power!\nSo, let’s begin! Take this course today and become part of the new industrial revolution that is already shaping the future!\nP.S. We believe this is an excellent educational product. But if you are not completely happy with the value you have received at the end, don’t worry - we offer a full 30-day unconditional refund.

      "description": "(UPDATED JUNE 2022)\nJOIN OVER 27,000 DELIGHTED STUDENTS AND START YOUR AFFILIATE MARKETING JOURNEY TODAY!\nThis has been the most eye-opening affiliate marketing course for beginners I have come across thus far. (Felix Mawunyo Vondee)\n\"Affiliate marketing has made businesses millions and ordinary people millionaires.\"\nIf you've ever wanted to make money online, I'm sure you came across the term affiliate marketing. Maybe you even purchased eBooks and video trainings, joined affiliate networks such as Clickbank and JVZoo and thought the sales would start rolling in. Because when people think about affiliate marketing, they think about the 'fantasy' they've been told - the Easy Button. You start to get the idea that you can quit your day job, push the Easy Button, and live happily ever after after. But then, when you follow that, they seem to make money... but you don't. Sounds familiar?\nWe've all been there. But today, it's going to change.\nIs affiliate marketing is as easy as you’ve heard? it's not a 'push-a-button-and-be-rich' business, but it's not rocket science either. You just need a strong foundation and to keep building up your business from there. And that's exactly what this course is for.\nYou see, you wouldn’t build a house without a strong foundation. And neither should you build an affiliate business without first snapping some very important pieces into place.  Skip these beginning steps, and your affiliate business will be about as a strong as a house of cards.\nYou will learn...\nHow to approach affiliate marketing differently and truly understand your business.\nHow to avoid common mistakes that are ruining your business.\nHow top affiliates - also known as super affiliates think, and what it takes to become a super affiliate.\nHow to drive traffic to your offers.\nHow to approach social media marketing the right way, and what are the pros and cons of every major social media network!\nAnd much more...\nBUT LISTEN.\nWhile this course is comprehensive and will teach you proven methods to make passive income, this is not a \"get rich quick\" course. I'm not going to say things like \"buy this today and make money tomorrow\" or \"people have made money an hour after purchasing this!\". You CANNOT get rich overnight (unless you win the lottery). Moreover, I'd recommend staying away from anything and anyone that can guarantee overnight wealth. Consider this a slow-and-steady path to making money online. And of course... if you don't implement these methods and stick with them, nothing is going to change!\nBut if you're serious about becoming an affiliate marketer, this is for you. Ready to get started?",

      "description": "WARNING: This course is not for everyone. If you are looking for a bunch of spammy proposal templates to copy and paste, then this course isn't for you. If you have a history of action-faking, time-wasting, procrastinating, and generally not following through in life, then this isn't for you. If you don't intend to use the techniques in this course to help other people, then this isn't for you. This course is only for those who are ready to take action, apply the material, help clients and get serious results. This course is for winners only. Are you a winner? Keep reading.\nDo you struggle to get Upwork clients to respond? Does it feel impossible to land interviews? Do you know 100% for sure you're qualified for the job...yet still you get ignored? If so this course might help.\nFreelancing is hard work. Especially when it comes to attracting high-paying Upwork clients. Just when you find a good one, you're up against 20 to 30 proposals. So how do you get ahead, and how do you get stand out?\nDo you:\nSend proposals every day but clients just won't give you a chance?\n\nHave relevant experience, even a degree, but nobody cares?\n\nFeel sick of getting passed over for other, less-qualified freelancers?\nThese exact problems lead many freelancers to give up or quit. They send templates to be faster - to try to get their proposal in first, and they still don't get a response. They talk about their experience but it's crickets.\nThe real problem? It's not the effort you're putting in. It's your process. Because clients are looking for something VERY specific from you. It's not a template. It's not your experience. It's DEFINITELY not your degree. Instead, clients want to know that you are someone who can really help them. They want to know that you can get the job done, and done right!\nOkay, so I need to prove I'm the best, but how do I do that? Simple, you have to change your process. You have to approach proposals differently from everyone else. You have to show you care about the client, and prove you're someone competent and trustworthy.\nIn short, you have to:\nProve you can get the job done quickly, well and without a lot of instruction\n\n\nShow clients you are a credible authority without talking about your experience or degrees\n\n\nHelp clients see that you are competent, so they feel comfortable hiring you\nInside, you will discover how to:\nStop making the same instant-reject mistakes as every other freelancer\n\nCraft proposals that ONLY give clients exactly what they need from you\n\nImprove your process to boost proposal responses fast!\nIn this course I'll show you a simple, repeatable process that continues to work to this day! Once you learn this method, and properly apply it, your results will change.\nInstead of burning connects faster than a blowtorch burns gasoline you'll send way less proposals and get way more responses. You'll stop spamming clients and come across authentic and useful.  Plus, you'll show clients you really care, and make yourself stand out even when there are already 50 proposals and 10 interviews lined up.\nThis is the EXACT system my students who broke six-figures use. It's the EXACT system I used to go from $0.00 to $100.00 an hour in my first month freelancing. It's also the system I used to build a second Upwork account to full-time income levels in less than a month from scratch with NO DEGREE, NO PORTFOLIO, AND NO EXPERIENCE LISTED. Thousands of my students use this system to get results every single day. And when you learn to properly apply it you will get results too.\nONE QUICK NOTE To really stand out, you MUST go beyond templates. You must ACTUALLY CARE about helping clients get the results they want. You need to want to go the extra mile to show them that difference. That means customizing each and every proposal. It means trying harder and taking your time on each one. As a result, you will spend LESS time applying overall.\nThat's what I'm going to teach you here. How to prove your worth in words. How to grab attention like a gun to the forehead. How to give clients a clear, direct path to view you as the best person for the job.\nLet other freelancers blab about their skills and experience. When you take this course, you can beat every one of them, even when a ton already applied. Because inside this course I will show you a better way. A proven system that teaches you:\nHow to send fewer proposals than ever and get way more responses in less time\n\nA simple technique I use to attract high-pay clients even when 20-30 people already applied\n\nProfound psychological techniques to get noticed and stand out like a beacon in the night\n\nUseful NLP tactics that help you bypass client objections and compel them to respond\n\n\nHow to prove you care about your clients and that you can help them better than anyone else!\nThere ARE templates in this course, but this ISN'T a template course!!!!!!! Do NOT expect to win gigs by copying templates!!!!!!!! Instead, I'll show you what works for me, and how you can apply it to your own proposals to get better results. If that makes sense for you, scroll up and enroll now!\nFriendly,\nLex DeVille",

      "description": "If you have a startup but things aren’t going so well, chances are you have a mindset problem.\nAccording to Business Insider, over 50% of businesses fail by the 5th year they are in business and over 70% fail by the 10th year.\nThe reasons for failures can be grouped into two.\nFirst, what I call external reasons, cash flow problems, competition, no market need for the product, etc.\nAnd the second group is what I call internal reasons – these are the mindsets, believes, and understandings of the entrepreneurs running the startup.\nThis program focuses on the second group of reasons as they are more important and harder to master.\nIt’s not by chance, Tony Robbins said: “Success is 80% psychology and 20% mechanics.”\n…because come to think of it, if you are not in the right mindset, it doesn’t matter how good of a strategy you have, because your execution will be poor.\nPsychology can work for you or against you.\nThe main purpose of this program is to provide you with the right mindsets and help you install the psychology of the winner within you!\nHow am I going to do that? You are asking….\nWell, I’ve spent the last several months studying and researching the most successful entrepreneurs on the planet.\nOut of hundreds of entrepreneurs, I picked 17 brilliant people to present and analyze their opinion on the most important mindsets an entrepreneur should possess.\nIn addition to that, I share personal stories from my businesses and more importantly what are the mindsets that have been working for me throughout my entrepreneurial journey.\nWHO IS THIS PROGRAM FOR?\nI designed this program for current and would-be entrepreneurs who want to build profitable businesses that will last by adapting the proven-to-be-successful mindsets and philosophies.\nThis program is about a mental shift.\nIt’s about the psychology of the stellar entrepreneur.\nWe’ll be discussing topics such as\nFear\nPassion\nMoney\nValue\nTime\nAction\nLearning\nOpportunities\nOn the other hand, we won’t be discussing topics such as venture capital, pitching, angel investors, and so on.\nAgain, the focus will be on the psychology, not the strategy.\nWHO IS THE INSTRUCTOR?\nMy name is Vladimir Raykov and I’m a direct response marketer.\nAnd basically what I do is I help people sell their products.\nI teach around 50000 students from 172 countries to improve their marketing and business processes but the number of students is growing fast.     In my life as an entrepreneur, I’ve managed to build a successful information product business but on the other hand, I have a few unsuccessful startups.\nAnd we’ll have a chance to talk about that throughout the program as I analyze myself and the mistakes I made. This I believe will be quite valuable to you as it will prevent you from doing the same mistakes that cost me tens of thousands of dollars. Yes, this is what happened when I ignored a critically important principle you will learn about in this program.\nI’ve been studying management of innovation and business development in one of the best business schools in Europe – Copenhagen Business School.\nI’m also the author of How To Build Your Successful Online Teaching Business (Online Entrepreneurship Book 1)\nAnd if you believe as an entrepreneur, you need to constantly look for ways to elevate your skills, mindsets, and philosophies to the next level, then I invite you to join this program.\nSOLID GUARANTEE\nGo take this course and if for some reason you don’t like it, you have 30 days, unconditional money-back guarantee. No questions asked, No hassle. No hard feelings.\nClick the “Buy Now” button right now!\nI’m waiting for you inside the course! We’ve got a lot to cover.\nThere is no risk whatsoever.\nSo, let’s get started!",

You will learn how to take your career to the next level. You will learn how to reinvent yourself in ways that you never thought was possible! Chris Haroun has had the opportunity in his career to meet with the top CEOs, entrepreneurs and investors in the world, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Marc Benioff and the CEOs of most large technology companies. This book is an amalgamation of business advice that Chris has compiled from his many meetings with successful business people over the past two decades as well as observations of why brilliant entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg have become incredibly successful. Business schools do a good job of providing students with theoretical and practical frameworks that can be applicable to real world problems but often miss teaching students some of the most crucial business lessons like how to network, how to find customers or how to get a job!\n\nChris Haroun is an award winning business school professor, venture capitalist and author. He is currently a venture capitalist at a prominent San Francisco Bay Area venture capital firm and has previous work experience at Goldman Sachs, hedge fund giant Citadel, Accenture and several firms that he has founded. He has raised and has managed over $1 billion in his career.\n\nChris teaches many courses online at Udemy. He has an MBA in Finance from Columbia University and a Bachelor of Commerce Degree with a major in Management Information Systems and International Business from McGill University. Chris is also a frequent guest lecturer at several Bay Area business schools including Berkeley and Stanford. He is a McGill University Dobson Fellow. He has written numerous articles/been interviewed in Forbes, VentureBeat, Entrepreneur Magazine, Wired Magazine, AlleyWatch and Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK: Hong Kong's oldest and sole public service broadcaster). He serves on the boards of several Bay Area technology companies and charities.

A home business that really works - and no selling!\n\nThe ultimate, easy to run, no selling, monthly repeat income Home Business!\nUdemy Instructor Alun Hill writes: I've known Chris Towland, who prepared this course, for many years.\n\nI've seen him develop this entire home business from nothing\nI've seen him overcome every obstacle\nI've seen him refine the business to the point where he already makes $3,000 every month, month after month\n... and with just for a few hours work monthly.\nNo-one would call Chris a salesman - and that's the real beauty, in my mind, of this course.\nIt's no good knowing how to make really good money working from home if you also need to be any sort of salesman.\nAnd absolutely no sales skills are required to make a success of your life - if you follow in Chris's footsteps in the way he shows.\nThere's no need to ever visit anyone, no need to \"cold-call\" etc - you just follow the included simple templates, please.\nI spent some considerable time convincing Chris to add this course to Udemy as it takes many, many hours of intense work to create a home business course of this high quality and detail.\nHowever, the end result is wonderfully easy for you to follow and Chris is delighted to not only offer the course here, but is also available to answer any questions you may have, at no extra cost, of course!\n\n\n\n\nFAQ's:\nQuestion: Chris, can I do this home business in (insert country!)\nAnswer: Yes, you can make this money, and more, wherever in the world you live. I live in the UK but I have clients all over the world - and you can too!\n\n\nQuestion: Chris, how soon can I start making money, from this home business?\nAnswer: Realistically, it will take a couple of hours to set up the first time (following the detailed course lectures and any free help you need), but you're then able to start charging your professional fees immediately (with no other knowledge or experience, you just study the simple but comprehensive course!) - and clients pay you month after month - and even recommend their business friends to pay you too!\n\n\nQuestion: Chris, what do I need to get going today, please?\nAnswer: A computer and any speed of internet. And about $30 to $40 to start (then just a couple of dollars a month, regardless of the number of clients!)\n\n\nQuestion: Chris, will this home business become \"saturated\"? What about when thousands of people start doing this?\n\nAnswer: I'm not in the slightest bit worried about you competing, as almost every local business IN THE WORLD will love it - and you or I will never cover .000001% of them!\n\n\nQuestion: Chris - this sounds like the perfect home business for me! Tell me more!\nAnswer: I am currently earning well over $3000 every month from the business that I show you in this course.\nThis is also with less than 20 clients so it leaves me plenty of spare time to spend with friends and family. It also leaves me plenty of time available to take on more clients if I decide I want to increase my income at any point - but at the moment, I love my life / work balance and so am happy with the clients I have.\nThe great thing is - that the income is recurring.\nMy clients happily pay monthly - so the only time I need to go to find new clients is if I DO decide to grow the business further.\nThe businesses that are my clients start by paying me $60 monthly for the service I provide for them, but as the results come quickly, this figure rises to $150 per month or even more.\nI also offer additional services to my clients that means some of them pay me from $300 up to $600 per month, every single month.\nIn this course I show you everything that I do in this home business so that you can do it too.\nYou'll see how I get new clients, how I get great results for them quickly, and even the additional services that I offer them.\nYou'll watch over my shoulder and see me set everything up so that you can duplicate it and get your own profitable business up and running quickly!\n\n\n\nAnd the full 30 day no-questions-asked Udemy instant guarantee is your assurance of the quality and potential of this home business course.\nEvery hour you delay, therefore, in registering for this course is actually COSTING you money!\nDelight your family!\nImpress your friends!\nGet started today by clicking \"Buy Now\" and get full, lifetime access with all future updates and all current and future course materials included!",

      "description": "Freelancing can be one of the most rewarding career paths for a web designer—but it can also be one of the most frustrating. On one hand, it offers freedom, flexibility, and the potential to earn far more than a traditional job. You get to work with a variety of clients, set your own schedule, and take control of your destiny.\nBut that’s only one side of the story.\nThe truth is, freelancing can also feel like a constant uphill battle:\nFinding clients,\nNegotiating rates,\nChasing payments\nDealing with rejection\nThese can drain your energy, kill your confidence, and leave you questioning your skills. Burnout is real, and without the right systems in place, it’s easy to fall into the trap of working more and earning less.\nThat’s exactly why I created this course.\nI’m Chris Barin, an Adobe Certified Instructor and a successful freelance web designer. I’ve made over $50,000 on the popular platform 99designs, and my freelancing journey has been featured on their official blog.\nI’ve been on both sides of the table—as a freelancer and as a business owner who hires freelancers—so I know what it takes to succeed in this competitive space.\nThis isn’t just another theory-heavy course filled with fluff. I focus on the real-world strategies that helped me stand out, win clients, and build a sustainable freelancing business. I’ll share all the insights I’ve gained over years of trial, error, and success—so you can skip the guesswork and get straight to results.\n\n\nYou’ll learn:\nHow to find the right kind of clients—and avoid the ones who’ll drain your time and energy\nHow to set up your portfolio to attract serious business opportunities\nHow to talk to clients and handle negotiations with confidence\nHow to present your pricing so clients understand the value behind your work\nWhy soft skills matter more than flashy designs when it comes to winning projects\nReal-life examples and case studies that show why freelancers fail—and how to avoid their mistakes\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a crystal-clear understanding of what it takes to thrive as a freelance web designer. You’ll know how to work smarter, not harder. You’ll have actionable tools to get better clients, better rates, and better outcomes.\nWhether you're just starting out or you've been freelancing for a while and feel stuck, this course will give you the clarity and confidence to move forward. It’s time to stop struggling and start building a freelancing career that works for you—not against you.\nLet’s dive in and make your freelance journey one worth taking.",

Unfortunately, most people take this opportunity for granted, and they expect to magically get rich quick without working hard for it.\nWhile you can easily join any MLM company with no prior knowledge or skills, you need to quickly catch up with self-education in order to succeed.The top earners in today’s network marketing world are also the top learners. Yet, there are no network marketing degrees offered by business schools, and it’s not easy to find a good source to educate yourself as a new network marketer.\nIn an effort to fill the education gap, a team of international network marketing experts got together in the US, and established IDSEI: the first International Direct Selling Institute . IDSEI has developed the first professional certification program called: Certified Network Marketer (CNM), with the passion to empower network marketers and direct sellers, by giving them the knowledge and self-confidence they need to succeed. IDSEI’s program has educated and certified over 20,000 people to date, using online platforms.\nThe CNM course offers a wealth of knowledge condensed into 4 hours of video and divided into 12 lectures. Taking you through the ins and outs of the profession, this course unveils the secrets to becoming a successful network marketer. It is recommended that you watch all the videos in the order of appearance to maximize the learning outcomes.\nBy the end of this course you will be prepared to kick start or boost your direct selling business. You can also sit through the official Certified Network Marketer certification exam and receive your official digital certificate from IDSEI, by emailing your Udemy Certificate of Completion to info@idsei.com, upon passing the exam.\n***THIS COURSE IS AVAILABLE WITH FRENCH, RUSSIAN & ARABIC SUBTITLES***  (contact info@idsei.com to avail this option)\nSpecial Offer for Teams: We highly recommend you and your team to join the program, get the formal education, and all get certified. This will help your team to:\nspeak the same language and support each other better\nsave hours in ad hoc training sessions, and\nbecome professionally recognized.\nThat's why we offer team discounts to successful teams.

You don’t need to be an expert,\n2. You don’t need to have done this before to create great content and get floods of visitors,\n3. You don’t need to be a university graduate, or college, or even high school…\n4. And, you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars to make this a reality, (This really is KEY FOR THIS TRAINING)\n\n\nWHY TAKE THIS BLOGGING COURSE AND NOT ANOTHER ONE?\n\n\nWell, this blogging training is based on a blog strategy that works, and that I use in my own businesses. Also, the more you do with this, the stronger your blog will become.\n\n\nYou see,\n\n\nThis blogging training focuses on great research, SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Content Creation.\nVs.\nWhat many people teach, just simply following your passion and people will come... THAT DOESN'T WORK!\n\n\nFor a start... if you just simply create content, you don't even know whether anyone is looking for that type of content, and 9 times out of 10, THEY AREN'T!\n\n\nNon Targeted Blog Content = No Visitors\n\n\nPlus…\nDid you know?\n\n\nWhen people are searching on Google they are most likely looking for a solution to a problem that they have...\n\n\nWhen your Blog appears they are actually actively looking for the solution you are offering,\n\n\nYour blog just means so much more to them...\n\n\nWhen we know how to find out these problems, we make much better FOCUSED blog content.\n\n\nBetter Focus = MORE VISITORS = RETURN VISITORS = A GROWING BLOG!\n\n\nIf you have fallen for the gurus before, don’t worry, many of my students have been in the same predicament before they came to me.\n\n\nSo, for a change, you will learn the real fundamentals of how Google works, for YOU and YOUR BLOG!\n\n\nThe skills and strategies haven’t changed since marketing began.\n\n\nThese are the things that actually WILL work for you, no matter the niche you want to be in, and in a much quicker time.\n\n\nDo you want to get real results for a change?\n\n\nYou will be able to easily follow along with the over-the-shoulder step-by-step approach to help this become a reality for you…\n\n\nSimply do what I do, and let me guide you to succeeding online.\n\n\n==============================================\nHow This Blog Marketing Training works\n\n\nThe training is split into 7 Modules:\n\n\nPart 1 – Finding Your Passion - Correct Blogging Procedure\n\n\nThis is all about you and your niche, and your passion, but also...\n· Finding out what niches people make money in,\n· How it will work for you,\n· How to get to the core of what you want to create,\n· How to find the perfect blog name... sometimes this can be the hardest point, but it is a breeze with this method.\n\n\nI’ll show you how to pick the perfect blog niche, with a simple 5-minute exercise, ready to be plucked up by you and used to create your first blog, and your first monthly revenue.\n\n\nPart 2 – Setting Up Your First Profitable Website\nWe get straight into your blog creation now...\n\n\nYou will follow along step by step as I bring you through the whole blogging website setup, from:\n\n\nPurchasing your first domain,\nGetting your hosting set up,\nYour website created,\nYour required settings all finished,\nYour plugins added,\nWhen done correctly following this specific optimization formula, you will get an unfair advantage, and create:\n\n\nExtremely strong audience targeted high converting blog,\nThat is easily findable by your customer or buyer,\nThat the search engines love,\nAnd that is an automatic machine that brings in more and more visitors and sales the longer it is active.\nYou will get addicted to creating these blog websites, and the more you create the better and easier they will become. I can get them set up now, in about 1 hour from start to finish (not all the content obviously).\n\n\nAnd when you follow along, build yours out and learn the process, you will be able to do it too, but you need to learn it first.\n\n\nPart 3 - Finding Your Audience - Getting This Right Is Key To Success\nFollowing on from the blog website creation section, imagine you could unwrap the secrets to make your website or blog instantly resonate with not only Google but also your target audience.\n\n\nA little-known formula that makes the search engines think that your website is the best in your chosen niche...\nAnd your target audience flood to your site, even if you are brand new.\n\n\nYou will be finding what is part of the NOOR Strategy.\nA keyword list of terms that you will be crafting your content around that Google and the other search engines have...\n\n\nNo Other Option but to Rank you high in the search engines, even if you are completely new...\nThis is where your blogging power-up starts to happen!\n\nWithout this,\nYou won't be creating great content for people who actually want to read it, and if you don't have this...\n\n\nWell, you have a Dead Blog.\n\n\nPart 4 - Creating Blog Content Easily - That Rocks!\n\n\nContent is King as they say...\n\n\nBut, while it might be king, and it is that important, it is a learned skill...\n\n\nIt is not something that you automatically get good at!\n\n\nBUT...\n\n\nWhat if you could Short Cut that skill acquirement?\n\n\nWhat if I was able to show you how to...\n\n\n1.

YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY!\n\n\nPart 5 - Making Money With Your Blog - The Fun Stuff\nWhen it comes to selling online, you need to understand what you can sell...\n\n\nBut most importantly, what your visitors actually want...\n\n\nThis section is all about making money with your blog, and we will cover:\n\n\n1. All about affiliate marketing\n2. What affiliate marketing actually is,\n3. How it will work for you,\n4. What you will be POTENTIALLY promoting,\n5.

You are onto the first Module of The Advanced Blogging Section\n\n\nWith everything that you have learned so far, you can have a fully functioning and long-term sustainable blogging business created...\n\n\nBut, imagine being able to take everything you have done and then inject it with turbo fuel.\n\n\nWell, that is what email marketing does.\n\n\nIt turns your blogging site into a money-printing machine due to the power of what is called permission marketing.

      "description": "Have you ever thought about building your own website? Or maybe you already have one and want to make it work a little harder for you. Did you know you can actually make money from your website through affiliate marketing? It’s easier than you might think, and anyone can do it with the right guidance.\nI’ve been building affiliate websites for over a decade now, and I’ve learned a lot along the way. These sites have provided me with a consistent income, and the best part? If you build them correctly, they can generate passive income month after month, year after year. But here’s the catch – if you don’t set them up right from the beginning, you could end up wasting your time and effort.\nIn recent years, Google has tightened its rules around affiliate websites, making it harder for those looking for quick cash to succeed. That’s why I created this course – to share the exact strategies I use to build successful affiliate websites in today’s digital landscape. I’ll take you from the very beginning and guide you step by step, showing you exactly how to:\nGetting Started\nDecide on a niche: I’ll help you pick a profitable topic that you’re passionate about.\nFind affiliate products: Learn how to choose the right products to promote within your niche.\nChoose a catchy, brandable domain name: I’ll walk you through picking a name that sticks.\nDomain and hosting setup: Buy your domain through a registrar and set it up with a reliable host.\nInstall WordPress: The foundation of your website – simple, flexible, and powerful.\nCreate essential accounts: Set up a Gmail address, create a “Gravatar,” and link it to your site.\nSetting Up Your Site\nInstall a WordPress theme: Choose a professional, easy-to-navigate theme that suits your brand.\nEssential plugins: Discover the must-have plugins to make your site perform at its best.\nSet up Google Analytics and Search Console: Track your progress and understand your audience.\nCreate important pages: Add essential pages like Contact, Terms, and Privacy.\nSEO optimization: Set up the Yoast SEO plugin to make your site search engine-friendly.\nContent and Structure\nMindmapping your content: Plan and outline all the main topics you’ll cover.\nAutomate internal linking: Learn why it’s crucial and how to do it efficiently.\nCreate quality content: Write posts that the search engines reward and your readers love.\nAffiliate product pages: Discover why having a dedicated product page works better than scattering links everywhere.\nCreate promotions: Keep your offers visible without overwhelming your content.\nSocial sharing and engagement: Add buttons to make it easy for visitors to share your content.\nRelated posts: Automatically display related content to keep visitors on your site longer.\nEnhancing and Maintaining Your Site\nSetting up a blog: Learn how to structure shorter, informative posts.\nContent inspiration: Use tools like Feedly and YouTube to keep the ideas flowing.\nSocial media integration: Set up Facebook and Twitter accounts and automatically syndicate new posts.\nCategorizing posts: Organize your content in a way that makes sense for both readers and search engines.\nBuilding a Long-Term Asset\nThis course is more than just a step-by-step guide; it’s a system that I personally use to build affiliate websites that not only survive but thrive in today’s competitive environment. Many have given up on affiliate sites because they haven’t adapted to Google’s evolving standards, but I’m here to show you how to get it right.\nAffiliate websites are still one of the best ways to create a steady stream of passive income – if you know how to do it correctly. I’ll share my proven methods so you can avoid common pitfalls and start building a site that makes you proud (and makes you money).\nIf you’re ready to create a high-quality affiliate website that works for you, this course will give you everything you need to get started and succeed. Let’s build something great together!",

Show your users and your team exactly what you want and get taken seriously.\nWhether you're a solopreneur or part of a larger organization you need to be able to effectively turn ideas into real, tangible working demos. This course is focused on giving you, the digital professional, the ability to rapidly assemble and deploy working web and mobile prototypes in just a few hours. The best part about this course is that we're going to do it without code. No programming, no technical books to study, no distractions from what you do best.\nEntrepreneurs\nLaunch your MVP for free and start getting real user feedback today.\nCut through the fundraising noise and show investors something they can understand, a real product.\nStop guessing which feature is essential to your vision. Prototype it and test it this morning and have your answers this afternoon.\nCut your contracting costs by 50% and save yourself the headaches of misunderstandings and poorly compiled project specs.\nProduct Managers\nStop bugging your developer team to make incremental changes that they don't understand. Show them exactly what you need done and keep them out of the “is it worth it\" debate.\nTest new features and get user feedback before you make major changes.\nGet organizational approval for initiatives by letting then use the exact thing you're proposing.\nDesigners\nBring some life to your PSDs and make them interactive.\nBridge the gap between design and development by removing any chance for miscommunication or misunderstanding.\nGet more accurate feedback from users and reviewers by deploying your designs in their browser and phones.\nGrowth hackers\nCut your experiment iteration time in half and stop overloading your developer resources.\nWeb and marketing agencies\nGet more projects approved and increase your billable hours by pitching your clients with prototypes.\nNever waste time and money building something incorrectly. Prototype it and find out exactly whether you're on the right path.\nWin over prospective clients by rapidly building their proposal and demo-ing it back to them. A huge advantage in the client acquisition game.\nThere's no course like this online. I'm going to walk you through how you can take an idea, conceptualize the requirements, and roll out a polished and professional prototype, without touching any code.\nIf you're trying to be successful online, do yourself a favor and learn this incredibly valuable skill.",

We'll only teach you things we know to be successful and that you can implement yourself!\nGet ready to take action!\nThroughout the entire course, you'll be participating in a 60-day challenge, which will help get your online business up and running in the next two months.\nWho are the instructors?\nOver 3 million people have purchased digital products from Phil Ebiner and Diego Davila over the past decade. We've mastered many of the steps to growing a successful online business and are so excited to share what we've learned with you. We both started our online businesses on our own, bootstrapping our brands, and know you can do the same.\nMore about this course and why we created it:\nDigital marketing, social media marketing, online business, digital product, passive income, content marketing, social media advertising, email marketing. All of these terms are important for running a successful online business. But where does one start?\nThat's the question we asked ourselves recently, realizing how fortunate we are to have businesses that at this point could run mostly on their own through automation bringing in passive income and providing a wonderful life for our families and us. How lucky were we?!? And how we could help more people achieve this success.\nWhen having an online business could be necessary (or at the very least beneficial) for many people and existing businesses, getting started is the hardest part. What if there was a course that taught everything in one place? Wouldn't that be beneficial for thousands (or perhaps millions) of people?!\nYES!\nSo we got to work. We brainstormed all of our favorite digital products - from online courses and ebooks to podcasts and webinars, from coaching programs and webinars to audiobooks and printables. We developed a course that dives right in with helping students like you understand what a successful digital products online business looks like with proper (yet easy-to-implement) digital marketing funnels.\nThen the course takes a step back, helping students develop the right online business idea, complete with validating your digital product to make sure it will be—a success.\nIt then contains crash courses into each digital product where you'll learn why it might be the right digital product for your online business; the tools we recommend to create that product; best practices and tips for creating that digital product; and case studies into our very own digital products.\nThis course isn't just about creating your passive income online business and hoping people find it. We teach you digital marketing, which includes free organic marketing and paid advertisements. You'll learn how to set up proper email marketing campaigns, drive traffic to your digital products with social media marketing and content marketing. This includes sections on using Facebook Pages, Facebook Groups, Instagram, and YouTube. You'll also learn about paid advertising, using Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, and Youtube Ads to drive even more traffic to your online business.\nIn short, we wanted to create a course that covered it all. And we hope you agree that we succeeded in that goal. At the end of the day, we are only successful if you are as well. And your success will only come by taking action, even small ones. Let's get you on your way to having your own online business!\nStart your online business today.\nThere's absolutely no reason to hesitate. If you've ever wanted to start an online business.  THIS is the course for you.\nClick that enroll button, and we'll see you inside!\nCheers,\nPhil + Diego",

But over time, I figured out how to get the Fiverr algorithm to promote me (which I show you in this course), how to up-sell, and how to retain clients long-term.\nBut to figure all that out, it took me over 3,000 Fiverr orders and over 1,000 5-star reviews!\nIn the beginning, I sold my services for just $5 to gain experience and to build up my brand on Fiverr. For a long time, I humbly worked for wages that were below minimum wage, and gained a lot of experience.\nLater, I charged $200 for the same services that I only charged $5 when I started. I did it the hard way, and I paid my dues.\nI mastered turning five-dollar sales into clients who spend thousands of dollars, and that is exactly what I teach you in this course. Don't look at Fiverr as discounted freelancing. Look at Fiverr as an amazing lead generation platform where the leads pay you instead of you paying to get leads!\nFast forward to today, I got overwhelmed with having to keep updating my online courses, and in the short-term I paused my Fiverr gigs because I didn't have enough time to help clients and keep updating the courses (I have over 230 courses at the moment). But I plan to be back on Fiverr soon.\n\n\nI UNDERSTAND HOW IT FEELS TO BE IN YOUR POSITION\n\n\nAs you can see, at one time I also had to start from zero on Fiverr. I understand how stressful, frustrating, and confusing it can be to start and see no results.\nSo I put everything I know about how to get ahead on Fiverr into this course so you can succeed sooner. I am here to help you. So enroll now, and let's begin your Fiverr success journey.\n\n\nWHY FIVERR FREELANCING IS BETTER THAN UPWORK\n\n\nAre you tired of wasting time on platforms like UpWork, where:\n\n\nPotential clients bombard you with questions, taking up valuable time\nYou have to apply for numerous jobs, often without any response\nThis unpaid time investment can be frustrating and unproductive\nOn Fiverr, clients come to you after searching for services\nThey order your services directly, without lengthy interviews or applications\nStop wasting time and start earning money for your skills immediately\n\n\nBONUSES INCLUDED\n\n\nLots of extra freebies, downloadable worksheets, and exercises to make the course more interactive and valuable\nPersonal invitation to my Facebook community after you complete the course\nMy list of 50 business-success skills when you complete the course\n\n\nWORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT\n\n\nI know how important it is to have support when you're trying to grow your freelancing business\nI answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours.

That's our work. It's what we do: we build organizations and projects that create value. No value, no project. Understanding the levers of value creation gives you a significant unfair advantage.\nThis is a master class for leaders, marketers, managers and freelancers. It includes a 35-page workbook and a series of direct, useful conversations that are guaranteed to change the way you approach your work.\nWhat we’re seeking here isn’t a fancy elevator pitch or a carefully compressed mission statement. Instead, the challenge is to describe (without regard in any way for how you benefit, or for how your organization profits), precisely what’s in it for the user, the customer, the people you seek to serve.\nSeth Godin is one of the most popular bloggers in the world, the guy American Way Magazine called, “America’s Greatest Marketer.” He’s written 18 bestselling books, started successful companies, but mostly, he’s a teacher.\nIn his first ever Master Class, Godin doesn’t waste time with entertainment. Instead, he’s put together a focused, useful course and a significant workbook, all designed to help you produce more value in less time.\nWatch the videos, do the workbook, engage with your fellow students and then repeat the process. After a few cycles, you will begin to see things you’ve never realized were important.\nGo make a difference. This course will help make that possible.",

      "description": "Do you want to change the world like Apple? This course will explain how to use a technique called evangelism to change the hearts, minds, and actions of your customers, colleagues, and employees. Evangelism is an innovative approach to sales, marketing, and management. It means mobilizing your customers and staff into becoming as passionate about a cause as you are.\nI first learned the technique of evangelism at Apple where my job was to convince developers to believe in Macintosh before it was “real.” I also used evangelism to convince developers and customers to believe in Apple during some of its challenging times. And the rest is history.\nSubsequently I’ve used evangelism to introduce many new products. I’m currently the chief evangelist of Canva, the online graphics design service that empowers people to create great graphics. We’ve signed up over 10 million customers in 179 countries in less than four years. That’s the power of evangelism!\nThis course distills my 30+ years of experience as an evangelist into a straightforward handbook for putting evangelism into action.\nIn this course, you will learn how to:\nDefine your cause, whether it is a business or a public interest concern\nCreate a mantra, goals, and tactics to further your cause\nEffectively pitch and demo your product\nUse the stages of evangelism to accelerate your success\nLeverage social media to evangelize more widely\nFind, train, and recruit new evangelists\nThis course also includes:\n14 activities so you can immediately put your skills into practice\nMy answers to frequently asked questions including: “What if my management doesn’t ‘get’ evangelism?”, “How do I differentiate my pitch?”, and “How do I evangelize a mundane product?”\nMy tips and tricks for bringing your own cause, product, or service from idea to reality.\nBy the end of this course, you will ultimately learn how to establish your product or service as “good news”—far beyond simple “speeds and feeds.”\nThis course is for people who want to make a difference. If you want to transcend traditional sales and marketing in order to create believers, this course is for you. If you want to challenge the status quo, the mediocre, and the mundane, take action to become a world-class evangelist.",

Keeping them happy and coming back is what fuels your business. Without them nothing else matters. From an online purchase to a lunch outing with friends, everyone has a story of how they weren't treated the way they felt they should be at a business. When we patronize a business we have preconceived notions of how we should be treated. If they are not met, we feel dissatisfied and often give negative reviews of our experience leaving family and friends much less likely to see experience the business themselves. If our expectations are exceeded and we leave the experience very satisfied, the chance of spreading the word and sending others to the business increase dramatically.\nThis course shares the stories and secrets of other successful entrepreneurs taking you through the importance of customer service and how to create systems to implement phenomenal customer service within your own business.",

As a business owner of 25 years, I wish I had come across Professor Haroun's knowledge and inspiring attitude many years ago. The course material is comprehensive, easy to understand and Professor Haroun's sense of humour and his inclusion of applicable videoclips in his downloadable course material adds spice to the whole experience.
