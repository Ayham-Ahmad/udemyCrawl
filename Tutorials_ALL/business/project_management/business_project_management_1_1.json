Well run projects help control costs, manage risk and improve project outcomes. Projects that are not well run create chaos, dissatisfaction and increase costs. At the core of any successful project is a diverse team of very talented individuals who are passionate about planning, executing and monitoring their projects.

I assume you know nothing about this topic and start with the foundation and build from there. Some of these concepts could be challenging, so I sprinkle in as many examples as I can, both non healthcare and healthcare, to assure full understanding of the topic. This is why I have appended \"Plain and Simple\" to all my courses.\nWHY ARE YOU QUALIFIED TO TEACH THIS COURSE?\nI spent 35 years in the designing and launching of medical imaging products and services.

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nIn every firm, you have key processes that you have to take care of to stay in business, thrive, and scale your business. You should optimize those processes to outperform your competition, get more customers, and generate higher profits. In this course, I will teach you how to optimize processes in practice and how to estimate in Excel the potential impact of the improvements. I will show you how you can do it either in your own firm or during consulting projects for your customers.\nIn this course, I will show you different methods that you can use to improve processes. You will learn the following things:\nHow to optimize processes in practice?\nWhat methods can you use to optimize processes\nWhat you can try to optimize\nHow to estimate in Excel the potential impact of the improvements\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turnarounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. We have helped numerous firms improve performance, escape bankruptcy, and conquer new markets as well as customers, by using techniques and frameworks shown in this course. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange Citigroup, Cisco, IBM, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To a lot of lectures, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures, so as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modification, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nProcess optimization is the bread and butter both for Management Consultants as well as Managers. However, firms usually do not teach the skills and the approach that you need to optimize fast processes. Most firms do not even define KPIs for important processes and do not try to find out the drivers of those processes. Therefore, we wanted in the shortest possible time, to give you the essential tools that will help you optimize processes in practice.\nThis course will help you become an expert in process improvement. This skill will prove very useful not only in consulting but also later when you become a manager or director or you move on to build your own business. By giving you exposure to real-life cases and analyses I want to improve your skills in process optimization. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do, during process optimization projects. You will also get insight into how to create a new process from scratch. We want to provide you with frameworks that will open your eyes to ways in which you can make the firm do things cheaper, faster, and deliver high-quality products and services.\nTo sum it up, the course will help you become an expert in process optimization on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, PwC, Deloitte, EY, and other top consulting firms. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants, Business Analysts as well as Managers, and owners/founders of businesses.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you optimize the process. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nHow to optimize processes in practice?\nWhat methods you can use to optimize?\nWhat you can try to optimize\nHow to estimate in Excel the potential impact of the improvements\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided into 4 sections. Currently, you will find the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nOptimization of in-store processes – a case study. In the second section, we will have a look at a case study in which we will optimize processes in a store. The aim will be to lower the costs of processes so we can have a more profitable business. We will discuss in this section also the main techniques that are useful during process optimization projects. Later, we will use the same techniques to improve other than costs, KPIs\nOptimization for other KPIs. In this section, I will show what other KPIs we can optimize during process optimization. Again, we will have a look at the usual suspects, such as improving quality, improving capacity, and speed. We will also discuss how to make the process more scalable and reduce friction\nProject Selection. In the 4th section, I will discuss different methods of selecting projects. In practice, you will map a lot of potential projects that can be used to optimize the process. You have to select from a huge list a few that give you the biggest potential. We will discuss how to do that in this section.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\n1. Useful frameworks and techniques\n2. Selected analyses shown in the course\n3. Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies\n4. Links to books worth reading\n5. Additional resources expanding the issues mentioned in the course\nAt the end of my course, students will learn to…\nOptimize process in practice\nHow to lower the cost of a specific process\nHow to measure the costs of processes\nWhat other KPIs matter when it comes to the process\nHow to make the process faster\nHow to increase the quality of products and services\nHow to make processes more scalable\nHow to select the projects for implementation\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness Analysts\nManagers\nAnalysts working in Strategic Departments\nStartup Founders\nControllers\nFinancial Directors\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

As a bonus, you'll also get access to our exclusive companion eBook, as well as practice exams and quizzes to help you measure your progress and knowledge.\nPlus, the instructor's 25+ years of experience come to life through engaging stories and anecdotes that will help you retain the material.\n\n\nPlanning complex software projects, organizing the work, and tracking the progress aren’t straightforward tasks. There are many moving parts, and to make matters worse, the team setup and the original goals may change over time.\nHow do we deal with this complexity and unpredictability?\nOver the years, with the increasing need for software systems, this question popped up more and more frequently.\nSoftware developers started to explore various practices, and gradually it became apparent what was working and what wasn’t. The results were distilled into a set of principles and values that stand at the core of the Agile approach to software development.\nNow, while Agile is a perfect fit for projects that can’t be planned upfront—that is, in the vast majority of cases—successfully implementing it can be tricky.\nIt requires us to think differently when it comes to organizing our work. Taking on just some of its elements—for example, working in shorter timeframes—won’t make us Agile.\nTo increase our productivity, we first need to understand the core values behind Agile practices.\nIn this course, you’ll learn how to apply proven methods and techniques to your own projects, such as planning and tracking work, creating estimates, designing user stories, organizing the work and teams, setting up Scrum, running standup meetings, and so much more.\nThroughout this course, instructor Karoly Nyisztor shares practical examples to solidify the presented concepts and techniques.\nBy the end, you’ll know how to organize your work and deliver complex projects successfully while responding to changing business needs.\n\n\nWhat Other Students Are Saying About Our Courses:\nVery informative and organized. (5 stars, Jeff Pratt)\nClearly explained while as concise as possible, with a good case study. Exactly what I needed. (Lenka C., 5 stars)\nA very good course with a very clean and neat style of teaching. (Dhilara Abbas, 5 stars)\nThis course feels like I'm in a brick and mortar school physically sitting in a class being introduced properly to a new subject. It is rare to get this kind of feeling from an online delivery system. (Paul Messina, 5 stars)\nProbably hands down the best course I've taken on Udemy. Karoly's teaching method is excellent!

This course has been designed to give you a quick download of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – 7th Edition content. Hence, the PMBOK 7th edition cannot be ignored anymore and must be studied for PMP exam prep in addition to the other reference books such as the PMBOK 6th edition and the Agile Practice Guide.\n\nThis PMP exam prep course is useful and will cover all the critical chapters and information required from the PMBOK 7th edition for the PMP exam. So, think of this course as another armour in your PMP exam prep arsenal. I will be adding all the performance domains very soon to this course. Currently, we have the 'Principles', Team and Stakeholder performance domains already as part of this course.\n\nThe PMP online exam is based on the PMP Exam content outline (also called PMP Exam ECO) which serves as the syllabus for the certification exam. If you’re using the PMBOK 7 PDF or the physical copy for the book, this is a course that will speed up your PMP exam prep for the PMBOK 7 areas of the PMP certification exam. Using this course, you’ll speed up your PMP exam study and waste less time going through other resources.\n\n\nGet additional free resources from CareerSprints dot com (see all resource links inside the course).\n\nCommon questions about the PMP certification exam and the PMBOK 7 training course.\n\nIs the PMP exam based on PMBOK 7th edition?\n\nYes, the PMP exam is based on the PMBOK 7th edition plus other PMP books such as the PMBOK 6 and Agile Practice Guide.\n\nIs the PMBOK 7th edition released?\n\nYes, the PMBOK 7th edition was released on August 1st, 2021.\n\nWhat are the PMBOK 7th edition changes?\n\nIn the new PMBOK 7th edition version, there has been a shift from process-based project management to principle-based project delivery. 8 performance domains and 12 principles have been introduced in the PMBOK 7th edition.\n\nWhat is the difference between PMBOK 6 edition vs PMBOK 7th edition?\n\nThe PMBOK 6th edition contained 10 knowledge areas and 5 process groups. That has been replaced in the PMBOK 7 with 8 performance domains and 12 principles. The standards for project management which used to feature at the end of the PMBOK 6 has been moved to the beginning of this new PMBOK version. An additional separate sections on tools has also been introduced in this version. The length of the PMBOK 7 has been shortened and is now roughly 1/5th the size of its 6th edition predecessor.\n\nWhat will this PMBOK 7 training course cover?\n\nThis PMBOK 7 training course will cover the 12 principles and the 8 performance domains. Additional materials and details will be added to this course as there is more clarity from PMI about what parts of the PMBOK 7 will be used for PMP test questions. This will be done very soon, within a few weeks you will get access to all the PMBOK 7th edition chapters. Currently, we already have the 'Principles', Team and stakeholder domains as part of this course.\n\nIs the PMBOK 7 also available to buy?\n\nYes, the PMBOK 7th edition can be bought from Amazon for around $40. If you're looking for the PMBOK 7 PDF version, then you will get that from PMI when you sign up for the PMI membership.\n\nHow does the PMBOK 7th edition impact your preparation if you are already midway?\n\nFew new concepts have been introduced in the PMBOK 7th edition. There is also some repetition of content from the PMBOK 6 in the 7th edition and the way in which the content is presented has also changed. If you're already gone through PMBOK 6 training or read the book, you can just read the PMBOK once. It's 1/5 the size of the PMBOK 6 so you can read this book much faster than the PMBOK 6.\n\nCan I start with this PMBOK 7 online course before taking other courses?\n\nCompletely. In fact since this course is based on the PMBOK 7th edition book, it's more condensed than the 6th edition course. Starting with this course is a better idea since 6th edition courses can be fairly lengthy (35-40 hours) and you might lose motivation along the way. This course will set the stage for going through the content from the PMBOK 6. Some people with project management experience who may not want to read the PMBOK 6 will also benefit from this PMBOK 7 course to expedite their PMP exam prep strategy.",

      "description": "Agile project management becomes more and more important, but after the initial hype, its weaknesses and downsides become more obvious.\nCompanies have started to realize that it's not \"the holy grail\", that solves all project management related challenges and they're looking for individual solutions for their particular projects.\nCompanies and project managers are looking for a better integration of agile techniques into standardized company processes, like formal project approvals, or resource and portfolio planning. They also need a better balance of reliable mid to long-term plans without compromising too much flexibility to quickly react to changing market situations or customer requirements.\nHybrid agile projects (also known as \"Scrumbut\", \"Waterscrum\") have the potential to be that solution.\nHybrid agile projects try to combine the best agile and traditional project management elements to create a unique solution for today's projects.\n\n\nThe challenge:\nCombining Waterfall and Scrum sounds easy, but can get really complex. Hybrid agile project management requires a solid understanding of agile and traditional project management to avoid confusion and absolute chaos.\nIt is much more than just combining two project management approaches, as different roles, events and ideas collide.\n\n\nThis is what students had to say:\nGreat course! The presentation and flow of topics were great. Especially, Section 4 and 5 are highlights of this course with clear and simple explanation of topics which gives you crystal clear clarity on Hybrid Agile Project Management. (S. Balijepally)\nVery interesting training, Good presentation and recourses. Explanations on topics where broken down and simple to understand. Would recommend. (E.J. Ferguson)\nThough I appreciate some of the earlier sections as a good refresher, Section 4 onwards was truly exceptional! Very grateful for the concise and clear explanations and breakdowns of how hybrid approaches can be adopted at each phase. I tried a few other courses on practical project management and I honestly think despite the higher ratings on the other courses, this course by far made the most sense to me realistically speaking and is the only one that really delved into and gave practical guidance on hybrid project management. I would highly recommend this course to anyone in project management whether you favor or mainly use either traditional or agile because for how short this course is, it covers very well the pros and cons of each approach and gives you a better arsenal of tools to best tailor the development approach your project needs. Thanks for an amazing course Neils! It has definitely exceeded my expectations. (M. Leong)\n\n\nIn this course you will...\n# … learn to understand the benefits and downsides of hybrid agile project management\n# … learn to avoid common mistakes in setting up your hybrid agile project, by applying a checklist and strategies provided by this course\n# ...be able to apply an idealistic best practice approach that includes agile and traditional components\n\n\nContent:\nThis course starts with an overview and a differentiation of various hybrid project management approaches.\nYou will than get a summary on agile and traditional Project Management incl. the respective mindset, processes and the benefits and downsides, for a better understanding of what we want to combine in our hybrid agile approach.\nWe will than guide you through the ideal set up of a hybrid agile project, based on best practices\nThe final chapter of this course will than teach you, how to plan the set-up of your hybrid agile project and you'll receive an Excel-checklist as additional support.\n\n\nAdditional Course material:\nYour learning experience will be supported by:\n# regular quizzes\n# a great and comprehensive slide-deck\n# One Pagers that summarize the most important ideas of each chapter\n# an Excel-checklist that helps to plan your next project\n\n\nEnroll right now and I'm hoping to see you in the course very soon!\nNiels",

      "description": "You have a great idea for an event or festival. But where do you start? What does it actually mean to organise an event for 300 people? Let alone 3,000 people. When I worked as a university lecturer I asked my students to organise a community festival. The ideas were there. The creativity, the performers, the enthusiasm...it was all there. But they still had to talk to the permit and license officer. What do they expect to see from an event planner? Welcome to the workshop Event Planning.\nIf you want to organise an event or festival you need to submit an Event Management Plan to your license or permit officer. I will teach you what you need to include in your plan.\nThis 13+ hour workshop is divided in 13 sections in which you will learn everything you need to include in your Event Plan.\nIn this workshop you will learn about:\nPlanning your event\nResearching your audience\nPermits, licenses & festival insurances\nHealth & Safety aspects at events\nEvent marketing and sponsorship\nEvent production\nContract & procurement\nSite survey and site design\nThe workshop is a combination of tutorials, presentations, exercises and interviews with event and festival professionals. Interviews with event and festival professionals will provide you with fantastic insight into an amazing industry!\nWhat other students say about this workshop\n\"The course is filled with great details and practical examples from real world. The interviews and the case study are really helpful. Overall, the course has an excellent structure and useful content.\" Anna Santiago\n\"I am an events coordinator and wedding planner. I found this course to be invaluable for organizing and enhancing my already successful businesses. It started out somewhat slow, but quickly moved on to relevant and timely instruction on what needs to be done, how to do it and how to work smarter, not harder. I absolutely loved this course and learned much new information from the instructor on topics I really had never thought about before. Thank you!\" Susan Konopik\nI have interviewed industry experts\nLightning in a Bottle Festival\nShambhala Music Festival\nStern Grove Music Festival\nThe Drugs Policy Alliance\nGentlemen of the Road Festival\nKlean Kanteen\nRFID technology company\nReading material such as the Event Safety Guide, the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds and more are incorporated into the curriculum.\nThe benefits of this workshop for you\nAt the end of the workshop you will understand what is expected of you in order to plan and produce a successful event or festival. You will be able to write an comprehensive Event Management Plan that complies with the rules and regulations set by your local authorities.\nThis workshop is for you if you are passionate about events and festivals, if you keep dreaming about organizing your own event, and for (aspiring) event producers!\nFAQ\n1. Can I contact you if I have a question about the course content?\nA. Absolutely! That's what a tutor is for. You can contact me via Jarno@eventtutor.com. My aim is to respond to your email as quick as possible.\n2. Is this event planning workshop only useful if I want to plan a festival?\nA. It is useful if you want to plan any type of event. The workshop covers a wide variety of subjects and will benefit any event planner. Truth be told though that I will teach you how to write an Event Management Plan. When you plan a wedding you most likely do not need to submit an event management plan to a license officer. If your event requires permits or licenses, than this workshop is for you!\n3. I've seen other online courses that are more expensive. Why is this course so cheap?\nA. I want to make sure the course is accessible to those who dream about organising their first event. I want to teach them what event planning entails. I do not want my students to be out of pocket.\nHow much is this workshop?\nOnly $50! Yes, let that sink in for a moment. 13 hours worth of content, interviews with event industry experts, and 1-to-1 tutorials on request. All of that for only $50.\nOther workshops\nI have created more workshops:\nEvent Marketing\nEvent Safety\nSustainable Event Management\nGay Wedding Planning\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\nSign up today and you will learn how to plan, organise, and produce a successful event.\nWelcome to The Event Tutor.",

For a beginner this gives a very extensive insight into the tool.”\n- Suresh Narasimhan\n\n“Great course!\n\nI've created some decent Access databases in years past but it was mostly self taught through reading and some early YouTube videos. There was much that I didn't know or comprehend that left my databases incomplete or didn't perform the way I wanted. This course explains all of the things I was missing.\n\nTons of information provided and explained very well. Access is very powerful with so many options, properties, and such that it will take a beginner quite some time to become proficient but this course explains so much, with many examples that reinforce learning. Macros, SQL, and VBA, has been a big mystery for years...for me. The instructor walks you through the basics and now I have a foundation to pursue these topics further without hesitation.\n\nThe instructor is pleasant to listen to and is very organized in the information given, both in order and detail.”\n- David Keach\n\n“It was really such a great course with step by step approach towards building the required skills and learning of Microsoft Project 2016.\nThe course is very detailed and the tutor made it very easy to follow and learn using all elements of Audio/Visual tools to the extent that makes it as if it is an in-class course not online.\nI was able to follow closely with each and every section successfully and attentively.\nHighly recommended!”\n- Hazem Kamal Abouagwa\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\nSimon Sez IT teaches all sorts of software, including:\n- Microsoft Excel\n- Microsoft PowerPoint\n- Microsoft Word\n- Microsoft Project\n- Microsoft Outlook\n- QuickBooks\n- Photoshop Elements\n- Web Development Languages\n- And so much more!\n\n\nJust search \"Simon Sez IT\" to see our full list of individual courses and incredible value multi-course bundles on Udemy.",

The essential topics covered include;\n1. Introduction to Monitoring and Evaluation\n2. Designing logical framework in Monitoring and Evaluation\n3. Monitoring and Evaluation Framework\n4. Monitoring and Evaluation methods\n5. Monitoring and Evaluation Tools\n6. Sampling in Monitoring and Evaluation\n7. Ethics & Informed Consent in Monitoring and Evaluation\n8. Data analysis and presentation in monitoring and Evaluation\nMonitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is used to assess the performance of projects, institutions and programmes set up by governments, international organizations and NGOs. Its goal is to improve current and future management of outputs, outcomes and impact. Monitoring is a continuous assessment of programmes based on early detailed information on the progress or delay of the ongoing assessed activities. An evaluation is an examination concerning the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and impact of activities in the light of specified objectives\nMonitoring and evaluation are critical for building a strong, global evidence base around projects for assessing the wide, diverse range of interventions being implemented to address it. At the global level, it is a tool for identifying and documenting successful programmes and approaches and tracking progress toward common indicators across related projects. Monitoring and evaluation forms the basis of strengthening understanding around the many multi-layered factors underlying projects and the effectiveness of the response at the service provider, community, national and international level.\nAt the programme level, the purpose of monitoring and evaluation is to track implementation and outputs systematically, and measure the effectiveness of programmes. It helps determine exactly when a programme is on track and when changes may be needed. Monitoring and evaluation forms the basis for modification of interventions and assessing the quality of activities being conducted.\nMonitoring and evaluation can be used to demonstrate that programme efforts have had a measurable impact on expected outcomes and have been implemented effectively. It is essential in helping managers, planners, implementers, policy makers and donors acquire the information and understanding they need to make informed decisions about programme operations.\nThe course will enable you build basics understanding of monitoring and Evaluation",

Agile is not only being applied in software development but beyond it such as marketing, finance, audits, product development, construction, drug development and so many more different types of projects.\nAs the adoption of agile has grown so has the demand for Scrum and in turn, Scrum Masters. More companies and people are jumping on the Scrum bandwagon.\n== What is Agile software development? ==\nThere are various definitions and explanations that exist on the internet. In a nutshell, Agile is a way of working that was initially applied in the world of software development to release value to customers faster. Agile is the amalgamation of values, practices, and principles such as iterative and incremental development, adaptive planning, high levels of team collaboration, self-organization, cross-functionality, and continual improvement. In combination, these practices have enabled several companies to get their innovative products to market faster and cheaper. The thinking from similar agile practice was embodied in the Agile manifesto that was written in 2001.\n== What is Scrum? ==\nScrum is the dominant agile framework used by the majority of agile companies across the world. Scrum is a lightweight method that enables companies to solve complex adaptive problems while delivering the highest possible value to end-users and customers.\nScrum has simple rules, roles, and artifacts that enable any organization or person to apply it in their environment and quickly gain benefits from it.\nIn the last few years, the popularity of Scrum and Scrum Masters has gone through the roof. Interestingly, it has surpassed the demand for Project Managers too.\n\n\n== Who is the Scrum Master? ==\nThe Scrum Master is a role in scrum that helps teams, stakeholders, and the organization at large to understand Scrum values, rules, artifacts, and its successful application. The Scrum Master leads the team using servant leadership techniques and unlike a traditional manager does not impose his/her opinions or ways of working on the team. The Scrum Master serves as a coach who leads the team from standing behind them.\n\n\nWhy must you get this course and the FCAS certification?\n· This is the only course on this Udemy platform that will help you get the FCAS certification.\n· The FCAS certification is a lightweight agile and scrum certification that can help you test your fundamental knowledge of Agile and Scrum.\n· The FCAS certification is growing in popularity and 2000+ of people have taken this certification.\n· You get your free copy of the Scrum Guide explained document.\n· This is a certification that you can take during your lunch break in 30 mins.\n· Taking this course makes the FCAS certification free.\n· The FCAS certification sets you up for higher certifications by CareerSprints dot com.\n· The FCAS certification tests you not only on Scrum but also on Agile. There are various Scrum certifications in the market but very few that test you on both.\n\n\nWhat is the format of the Foundational Certification in Agile Scrum (FCAS) Exam?\nThe FCAS Exam Format is as follows:\n\nExam Type: Multiple Choice\nNo. of Questions: 20\nPass Marks: 15 out of 20 (75%)\nExam Duration: 30 mins\nNo of Attempts: 2\n\n\nIs the FCAS Certification Free?\nYes, the Foundational Certification in Agile Scrum (FCAS) is free for now.

Many IT teams try to deliver everything that comes in at a time when IT departments are straining under the weight of reduced staff and budget. Some IT teams try to solve the problem by adding more people. The problem to solve isn't increasing capacity. It's:\n\n\nad hoc processes for accepting and prioritizing work in-take\npoorly defined work requests\noperational and process work compete for the same resources and time\nSimply put, when you have better quality requests coming through your work in-take, delivery becomes repeatable, sustainable and consistently adds value for the organization.\n\n\nYou're probably saying to yourself, \"Another process! How does that add value?\"\nI've had IT leaders tell me that want to stay \"agile\" so they don't implement processes.  Well, you can't solve the problems identified above by doing the same things that got you to this place.  Come on, even the Agile Manifesto doesn't say no process.\nThe 4-phase framework gives organizations easy guardrails and gates to get them started.  You can choose how and when to scale as you see improvements in quality and delivery. This course will teach you how to do that too.\nYou'll hear real life case studies in this course that you may encounter when rolling out this framework so you understand how to solve those problems. And finally you will get a starting point for some KPIs (key performance indicators) and other metrics so you can show your organization how this improving not just delivery but also the quality of the changes you are requesting.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn…\nWhat IT Demand Management process, where it falls in the software delivery lifecycle and its purpose\nHow ideas become work items and why that lifecycle is important to committing to the work\nThe primary roles that support IT Demand Management and their responsibilities\nA simple 4 phase process framework for demand management that will work for every organization\nThe high-level activities and key decisions that define each phase of Demand Management and how that impacts work coming through the process\nDifferent categories of work that come into an organization and how to apply these to your demand management activities\nHow to scale the IT Demand Management process for different types of projects that flow through the process\nHear case studies of common demand management issues and how they were solved\nUnderstand how Demand Management works with Agile and innovation practices\nLearn some key metrics to start reporting on the benefits of your Demand Management process\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will . . .\nCreate a backlog of the work that has been requested of your IT teams\nDraft your organization’s demand management process\nIdentify the roles and responsibilities you'll need to support your Demand Management process\nKnow the common challenges that come up in demand management and what steps to take to address them\n\n\nYou’ll have a set of actionable plans and artifacts to start a Demand Management practice at your organization.\nWho this course is for:\nPortfolio managers, Program managers, and Project Managers\nProduct Managers, Product Owners, Business Analysts and other roles who are responsible for defining, managing or reporting on work in-take.\nInnovation leaders who are accountable turning ideas into deliverable features\nIT or Business Managers who request technology work.\nIT leaders who are inundated with projects that all seem to have the same priority\nIT managers and supervisors who lead teams that are accountable for the delivery of projects",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nSometimes to create value in the firm or manage a huge number of complicated projects you have to set up a Project Management Office (PMO). PMO is responsible for making sure that all strategic projects will be delivered on time. PMO has to also analyze and select projects and support project managers in managing project delivery. Building and running PMO is pretty difficult, especially when it comes to selecting the right projects and later implementing them. I will teach you in this course how to do it efficiently. We will look at different types of PMO setups for different purposes. In this course you will learn:\nIn what situation PMO is used and how do its goals differ depending on the situation\nHow to select the right projects to implement using PMO\nIn the attached  resources, you will also find examples of PMO deliverables you will have to create and examples of tools you can use to run the PMO efficiently\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. I have also built and supervised PMOs in 10 different organizations. On many occasions, I had to grow, coach, and supervise managers, directors, and CEOs. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that, my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students, including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Adidas, Orange, and many others\nI teach through cases, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, tools, and end-products of PMO. To make the course more realistic and applicable we will go over many examples from our consulting practice, where we had to build and run a PMO. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lecture so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy did I decide to create this course?\nBuilding and running a PMO requires a specific approach and set of skills that you are not able to acquire easily. There are also hardly any practical resources that would help you in this job. Therefore, we have decided to describe our approach to this sort of project. This course will help you create a PMO, select the right projects, and deliver outstanding results to stakeholders (Board of Directors, Inventors, and your boss). What you will learn in this course will be extremely useful not only in consulting but also if you want to create a PMO internally to support the value creation process or to speed up the change management process. By giving you exposure to real-life cases and analyses I want to improve your skills in building PMO, selecting projects, and delivering tangible results through the PMO. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do once you are given the task of setting up and running a PMO.\nTo sum it up, the course will help you become an expert in building and running PMO on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, PwC, Deloitte, EY, and other top consulting firms. That is why, I highly recommend this course not only to Management Consultants and Project Managers who have to advise their customer but also to Investment Directors working for PE, Directors, and Managers responsible for running internal PMO departments.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze the business considered for acquisition. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nIn what situation PMO is used and how its goals differ depending on the situation\nHow to select the right projects to implement using PMO\nIn the attached  resources, you will also find examples of PMO deliverables you will have to create and examples of tools you can use to run the PMO efficiently\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nWhen PMO is used. In the second section, I will show you different situations in which PMO can be used. We will go through the differences and the goals of PMOs. PMO can be created in a Juggernaut situation, Performance Improvement situation, Turn Around situation, Private Equity situation, Drastic growth situation, and others\nHow to build PMO? In this section, I will show you the step-by-step process that will help you establish the PMO.\nProject selection. In the 4th section, I show you different frameworks that you can use to select the projects that you should concentrate on as a PMO. We will discuss the Strategic alignment framework, Value proposition alignment framework, Portfolio decision-making, and my favorite one - The bottleneck Framework.\nRecruit & Train the PMO team. In the 5th section, I will briefly discuss the process of recruiting and training team members that you will need to run the PMO. If you are working in a consulting firm you simply get well-prepared people, but if the PMO is built internally then the task is much more difficult.\nPMO Deliverables. In this lecture, we will discuss what you should deliver as a PMO. There will be examples of the main deliverables.\nTools used by PMO. In the last section, we will briefly discuss the tools used by the PMO such as project management tools, slide templates, and a library of slides.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nUseful frameworks and techniques\nList of resources useful during performance improvement projects\nSelected analyses are shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations, articles, and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nHow to set up a Project Management Office (PMO)\nIdentify the type of PMO you have to build\nSelect the right projects that will deliver the biggest value\nHow to prepare your team members for the work in the PMO\nWhat type of deliverables and tools you will need\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nProject Managers\nManagers responsible for building and running Project Management Office (PMO)\nBoard Members\nInvestment Directors\nManagement Consultants selling the PMO service\nBusiness Analysts & Management Consultants working within PMO\nDirectors\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

      "description": "WELCOME TO YOUR DIRECT PATH TO PASSING THE PMP EXAM!\n*Note: This course is designed to prepare you for the PMP exam, providing comprehensive practice tests and strategies to ensure you're ready for exam day.\n\n\nI- ABOUT PMP CERTIFICATE\nThe PMP (Project Management Professional) certificate from the American Project Management Institute (PMI) remains the most prestigious in project management. Since its inception in 1984, the PMP has been globally recognized as the benchmark in this field.\nHolding a PMP certificate demonstrates skill and is a significant career advancement tool. As reported by PMI, PMP holders earn, on average, 25% more than non-certified professionals.\nI.1- The PMP 2025 Exam\nThe PMP exam includes content that spans the value delivery spectrum, including predictive, adaptive, and hybrid approaches. It is based on Exam Content Outline (ECO), revised by PMI every 4 or 5 years.\nMost recently, the ECO was updated in January 2021. Accordingly, the exam has been tested on three different domains:\nPeople (42%)\nProcess (50%)\nBusiness Environment (8%)\nThe PMP exam was updated in 2021 with ECO to reflect our dynamic and global profession's fuller complement of skills and approaches. However, this update does not happen immediately. Instead, it includes changes planned to last from 2021 to 2023, which have stabilized.\nI.2- The PMP 2025 Exam Format\n180 questions\n230 minutes to complete the exam\nTwo optional 10-minute breaks for computer-based (online-proctored) tests, including center-based tests; paper-based exams have no breaks\nQuestion types: multiple-choice, multiple-response, matching, hotspot, fill-in-the-blank\nI.3- The PMP 2025 Exam Reference List (Important)\nPMI recommends ten books for exam preparation. The essential four include ECO, PMBOK Guide 7th Edition, The Agile Practice Guide, and Process Groups: A Practice Guide.\nECO\nThe Exam Content Outline is the framework that all questions and exam preparation materials must follow.\nPMBOK Guide 7th Edition\nPMBOK 7th Edition is a comprehensive book of standard knowledge (Standard) and guide (Guide) on project management. It can be said that PMBOK is very important and is a central learning material, but it alone is not enough to cover the PMP 2025 exam.\nThe Agile Practice Guide\nThe Agile Practice Guide is a document compiled by PMI and the Agile Alliance that provides practical guidelines for agile project planning and implementation. With the new PMP exam having about 50% of the content related to Agile or Hybrid, this is the material you need to read to learn Agile-related knowledge within the scope of the PMP exam.\nProcess Groups: A Practice Guide\nThis newly released book on PMI is an essential supplementary document to help students shape the process part of project management (accounting for 50% of the current PMP exam content) with concise, focused, and easy-to-understand writing. After this one was issued, PMBOK 6th Edition was excluded from the Exam Reference List.\nII- ABOUT THIS COURSE\nII.1- What does this course offer?\nThis course uses the above references to build the most relevant practice tests in a focused and consistent manner.\nThe questions and answers are arranged and compiled according to PMI's PMP 2025 exam standards.\nAbout 1000+ practice questions to master knowledge, including hundreds of other situational questions, are drawn from the exam.\nPeriodically (usually weekly), the latest REAL questions compiled from the most recent PMP exam are updated to the course, along with the answers and detailed explanations.\nReview questions are organized following ECO TASKS and are easy for anyone to grasp.\nStay focused, as all knowledge follows the latest PMI publications. No answer will be invoked from old ones, like PMBOK 6th.\nThe results of each test will help assess your readiness for the PMP exam.\nQuestions are collected through PMP real exams from actual candidates who have taken the exam and got high results (above target).\nThe explanation is thoroughly reviewed and audited by PMP certificate holders.\nII.2- Who is this course for?\nDepending on your readiness for the PMP exam, this course could be your first or last preparation.\nAbove all, when you need a straight path to your ultimate goal of passing the PMP exam, this course is designed for you.\nBecause of the PMP exam standards updates, the latest PMI publications will be the most factual reference source. While maintaining its accuracy, some information from older versions (such as the PMBOK 6th) has proved no longer close to the reality of the PMP exam. They are, therefore, no longer used as references for the practice tests of this course.\nII.3- How do you self-assess on the first attempt?\nYour result after the first attempt of any practice test is significant; write it down to self-assess your readiness for the PMP exam.\nEach practice is designed to include many questions (250). You don't need to do them all in one go, but try to do over 100 questions at a time, complete the test, and compare the results as follows:\nLess than 50% of correct answers: You must try harder.\nFrom 50% to less than 60%: You are on the right track.\nOver 60%: You are ready for the exam.\nOver 70%: You will likely achieve the highest exam score (All above target).\nII.4- Where to get more support?\nAfter enrolling in this course, you can ask questions through the course Q&A or Direct Message for a respectful prompt response.\n\n\nTo pass the PMP exam, you need to practice. However, the most effective way to be your best for the exam is to take the proper path combined with practice.\nENROLL IN THIS COURSE TODAY TO BEGIN EXPLORING YOUR PMP CERTIFICATION JOURNEY!",

This course is a unique and proven approach to project management, crafted from over 25 years of delivering complex projects and in-depth research into project success.\nConventional project management approaches focus on delivering lists of milestones without real business value, but Lean Project Management recognizes that projects are inherently unpredictable and structures your project to deliver regular, usable business value throughout the project lifecycle. This approach is perfect for IT-based projects, but it can be applied to all types of projects.\nIn this course, you will learn through a series of bite-sized videos with accompanying notes and references, for a total of over 4 hours of video content. You will understand how to structure your project to deliver usable business value, instead of the daily grind and stress of trying to keep things on course. The course includes 17 straightforward exercises that ask you to apply what you have learned to your own project, and for those without a project, a suggested \"case study\" is provided.\nThis course is the answer to the question of how projects become a year late, one day at a time. Don't let tomorrow be one of those days - sign up now and take advantage of the 30-day money-back guarantee.\nBy enrolling in this course, you will gain the skills to run projects differently and transform your approach to project management.

So all theory is paired with practical exercises we’ll complete together in your workbook.\n\nWith this course, you’ll be able to...\nPinpoint problems quickly and find solutions before productivity is at risk.\nAccess a set of practical activities to run with your team for evaluating & troubleshooting issues\nEnergize and focus team members so they collaborate more effectively\nThe practical activities you'll complete include...\nEvaluating your current team's Scrum maturity\n2 \"non-awkward\" team building activities\nA sprint retrospective for instilling Scrum values\nMerging multiple product backlogs\nAnd more...\nWhy do I need a Scrum repair guide?\nAgile Scrum is valuable because it is a flexible, lightweight framework. It offers a minimum set of values and practices but doesn't define everything a team needs to do to successfully build and release products. Teams are expected to complement the Scrum framework with practices to suit their unique environment. Many teams struggle in two areas: to 1) how to live by Scrum values and 2) how to adopt complementary practices.\nSo how do you fix this? In a field where so many teams follow counter-productive practices, copying others won’t work.\nThis course will help set your team on the right path by showing you how to establish best practices and troubleshoot existing issues\n\nSo Let’s Do This!

In this course you will not find 10 hours of lessons teaching you how to enter text in the chat GPT web application. We are going to learn a lot of things, and what is the most important, we are going to learn a lot of different things.\nVast experience in the subject: my company was one of the first on the market that started consulting clients about ChatGPT since GPT API was publicly exposed.\nQ&A Support and Close collaboration during the course: at the end of the day, you don't just get the video lessons, you also get support from me. We work in close collaboration, you ask your questions about topics discussed in the video, source code reviewed and other things. No matter what questions you have, I'm here to help.\nProfessional learning approach: I'm tutor with 900 students from more than 200 countries around the world. I was an offline tutor for a long time, and then I founded Learn IT Online University. I have big experience in the communication and teachnig student both: offline and online. And I can easily find the right approach to explain things, and make complex things easier to understand.\nHuge amount of source code examples: Even the first edition of this course already contains around 1000 files that can be used as examples. And this is just for one project that we develop with students. Not talking about examples that I share on the slides, or during the no-code development. This course is extremely oriented on practice and business use cases. And new examples are added to the course on a regular basis, because I update this course with new use cases, with new updates after new releases of OpenAI ChatGPT model.\nNo drama money back guarantee:  In case you didn't like the course, for any reasons, you should explain me nothing. You can easily get your money back within the 30 days after registration. I promise you. So, there is no risk at all for you. In case you don't like the course, you can quit anytime you want.\n\n\nTarget Audience of the Course:\nThe course is developed for Project Managers. There are two main parts in the course - the one that doesn't require any coding skills and API understanding. And the second part of the course is for advanced users to solve more complex tasks with the help of ChatGPT where we will learn basics of API and web development.\nThis course is designed for everyone who wants to learn ChatGPT. I can say that this is the most detailed and the most complete ChatGPT course available online based on today\nSignificant part of the course will be dedicated to learning of the OpenAI API.

      "description": "I welcome you to my course: Project Management with Earned Value Management (EVM) - 9 PDUs for PMP Certification, CAPM Certification, PRINCE2 Certification aspirants, and entry/mid-level Project Managers willing to learn EVM to monitor & control projects and drive business decisions (and willing to gain PDUs along the way).\nWhy learning Project Management is challenging?\nProject Management can be a difficult subject to master. Not because it has loads of framework and tools associated with it, but primarily because it's 'people' on the field who does projects, NOT the 'tools and frameworks'.\nYou can learn all the available tools for project management, be a master of excel spreadsheets and mathematical models...and still you can fail miserably as a project manager.\nThis is because, project management is a practical science, not a theoretical one.\nYou will become a better project manager once you are able to apply what you learn in real-life projects to lead teams that consist of 'people'. Microsoft Excel or MS Project will not 'do' the project physically for you in the field.\nWhen we start to learn project management, this is the key item that is lacking. The realization of how the tools, formulas, framework and techniques link to real-life projects and how they can be used effectively to deliver highly successful projects.\nWhy should you take this course?\nThis is where this course comes in.\nIn this course, I have picked one of the most effective tools of Project Management which is Earned Value Management (EVM).\nAnd, using that tool, I have explained how you can use this tool to lead & direct projects in real-life.\nI have used the Case-Study Based Learning Approach in this course which was pioneered by the Harvard Business School in 1921 and over the years this method has been progressively adopted by the leading universities and management schools across the world such as MIT, Stanford, Oxford, INSEAD, Wharton and ISB.\nThis case-study method will not only help you to understand the concept of EVM thoroughly, but also will help you to apply that in a real-life project scenario to solidify that understanding.\nIn the case-study detailed in this course, YOU will be the project manager for Project Neo which aims to construct a warehouse for an e-commerce company in the UK, install a robotic pick & place bay within the warehouse and program & commission the same. It is a £1,000,000 project that you would be leading.\nThe case study covers various aspects from the disciplines of Civil, Mechanical, Production and Information Technology.\nThrough the case-study of Project Neo as discussed in this course, you would learn the following items:\n\n\nUnderstand the linkage of project management principles with real-life projects\nGet to know how it is to be a Project Manager yourself\nLearn Earned Value Management (EVM) as a key tool for leading & directing projects\nLearn all the formulas and metrics linked to EVM such as PV, EV, AC, BAC, EAC. ETC, VAC, TCPI etc.\nKnow how to use EVM to take project decisions\nBecome efficient in tracking projects using Microsoft Project\nLearn how to use MS Project to perform Earned Value Analysis\nDevelop professional looking project dashboards using MS Project\nIf you are a MBA/Finance student, gain understanding of EVM in a project based scenario\nIf you are preparing for certification exams such as PMP, CAPM, PMQ, RMP, PgMP, PfMP, APM etc. get an overall understanding of EVM concepts and formulas which forms a key part of the syllabus for all of these exams\nWhen you enroll in this course, you should expect crystal-clear, easy-to-understand explanations and instructions so that your focus stays on the 'learning'.\nFrankly, I am a bit envious. I wish I had this tremendous learning opportunity when I was just getting started as a Project Manager.\nI am confident that you’ll experience instant results delivered by this course.\nThat’s why I invite you to click on the “Enroll Now\" button, secure your lifetime access now and begin to learn.\nYou are going to love it.\nEnjoy the Learning!\nNilotpal Ray, PMP\n\n\nWho is this course for:\nPMP, CAPM, PMQ, RMP, PgMP, PfMP, APM aspirants\nEntry level PMs, Project Coordinators\nMid level PMs willing to grow their career\nMBA/B-School/Finance/Undergrad Student studying EVM\nAny working PM willing to understand EVM\nAnyone who wish to learn how projects are led in real-world",

They are responsible to talk with the business, understanding their wants and needs, and then collaborating with the Development Team to create a product – a piece of software, a service, or a process – that satisfies those identified needs.\nIn this course, we prepare you for that Product Owner position. We’ll teach you about the mindset, the responsibilities, the activities, the skills, best practices, and the core concepts you’ll need to know to be a successful Product Owner (PO).\n\n\nWhy become a Product Owner in the first place?\n1. Potential Earnings – Let’s be honest it’s the main reason we work in the first place. So, you’ll be happy to hear that a typical Product Owner (PO) earns over $100,000 USD per year. And that is only the average. Work hard, continue to increase the value you provide through study and training, and just imagine how much you could end up making!\n2. Job Growth – With the abundance of organizations adopting Agile and Scrum, the Product Owner role has benefited with a 24% annual growth (US) and being declared an emerging job by LinkedIn. There is no better time than now to learn the fundamentals needed to be a Product Owner.\n3. Career Springboard – The skills you learn as a Product Owner are crucial to a host of many other professions, everything from Business to IT. This career path isn’t just a job, it’s an investment in your future, no matter where life takes you.\n4. Fulfilling Outcomes – Being able to positively influence and make decisions that shape the value a product provides to customers, generates a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. And this is probably a big reason the average Product Owner is highly satisfied with their job.\n5.

This technique will help ensure you with total comprehension of the topic at hand and maximum information retention long after you've completed the course.\nTEACH – You first learn the concept, in detail, from the ground up. But I won’t simply teach you the concept in isolation – you’ll learn HOW and WHEN to use it too.\nSHOW – Once you fully understand the concept, we enhance that by walking you step-by-step through real-world examples – so you can see exactly how the concept would pan out if you were to apply it in the real world.\nDO – Firmly cement everything you’ve learned so far and put your new knowledge to the test by completing the included activities and quizzes. Validate you’ve fully understood the concept and greatly increase your ability to retain the information you’ve learned.\n“Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn” – Benjamin Franklin\n\n\nIn short, this course provides you with the foundational knowledge and know-how that will prepare you for a successful career as a Product Owner.\nEnroll today and I look forward to engaging with you in the classroom!",

      "description": "Comparing Agile vs Waterfall Project Management\nWhich Project Management method is best between Agile and Waterfall?\n\n\nProject Management is an incredibly popular field and the rivalry between Waterfall and Agile has been long and bitter! Today we finally get two world experts in each together to battle over which should be truly crowned the Best Project Management Tool. Managing a project is often a pivotal moment in your life and choosing the right method can make or break your success. If you want to be confident in your choice then this Agile vs Waterfall course is perfect for you.\n\n\nIn this course we answer both big picture and technical project management questions to assess the two styles. For example; which is better for large projects, whether Agile is more expensive, and if it can be used for projects other than Software? You won’t learn the basics of the two styles, but if you already have a familiarity with both and want to settle your curiosity then this is the course for you. After this course you will feel confident in the similarities, differences and applications of Agile and Waterfall.

      "description": "Overview\n========\nIf you're just starting out in project management the amount of information on the internet is huge. I mean, where do you start? You might be asking the following questions....\nHow do I figure out what's actually useful information and is of value to me?\nHow do I know the course content is produced by qualified people who do this for a living?\nWhat's relevant and what is not at this stage?\nThis beginner-level course is aimed at anyone who needs to run a project but has NO previous project management experience or knowledge. Please note this is a general project management course (rather than IT). So doesn't include agile methodology/techniques or compare this with waterfall. Please check out the In Scope and Out of Scope sections below.\nYou'll learn the basic terminology and techniques of project management in non-technical language, so that you can run your own project.\nWe explain the methods step-by-step, and how to put these into practice, using clear and concise language.  The methods shown are real-world and practical.\n\n\nWhy would I choose this course?\n============================\n#1: It's produced by practicing, qualified project managers. We run projects all day, every day (apart from the weekends...:-) and we know what content is useful; what works and what doesn't.\n#2: Before you do your certification, such as PMP or Prince2, it's really helpful to learn project management fundamentals. It will make passing your exams easier.\n#3: Our content is real-world and practical. We're only giving you relevant information that is of value and you will be able to use on your own projects to deliver effectively. There's lots of concepts and approaches out there that no-one actually uses!!\n#4: We show you how to apply what you've learned using worked examples. The same tools we would use ourselves. You may find some courses give you a talking head and some bullet points (i.e. a lecture), but ours additionally shows you how to put the techniques into practice.\n#5: We keep it as simple as possible. We use straightforward language and don't try to make it more complicated than it needs to be.\n\n\nWho has produced this course?\n===========================\nOur team is from the UK and Canada. Between us we have decades of project delivery experience, delivering projects such as events, construction and IT. We've managed projects ranging from small to huge multi-million programs of work with multiple project managers, workstreams and development teams. We've made lots of mistakes along the way - which we can help you to avoid...!\nWe have PMP, Prince2 and Masters Degree (in project management) qualifications.\nWe are currently producing a project management blog and podcast to help you work in a smarter and more effective way.\n\n\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\n===================================\nOur course is broken down into 6 sections.\nSection 1: This is a foundation section - we cover PM fundamentals, the key concepts and terminology. This provides you with a good basis to move into the next sections.\nSection 2: We then go into the startup phase - again we'll cover some principles and fundamentals of what you'll absolutely need in order to be able to move forward. We'll also talk about what documentation you'll need to produce and walk though an example.\nSection 3: In this prepare section we cover the detailed preparations you'll need to undertake before you're ready to start delivering. This includes defining the overall scope, breaking it down into separate items, working out the detail and developing a plan/schedule. In fact we cover planning in a lot of detail as there are some key concepts which you need to understand, and to reinforce this we've added a module which walks you though creating a schedule. We also look at risk; how we assess and manage this, plus identifying what resources you'll need. We walk you through how to deal with external suppliers using a brief, and cover other items that you'll absolutely need to do (such as a kickoff meeting) in order to ensure you are ready.\nSection 4: For the delivery section we'll focus on how to keep things on track, how to manage problems you'll experience along the way, making sure you get the quality you expect, and really importantly how to communicate with your team, suppliers and stakeholders.\nSection 5: The closing section is quite short, but there are some key tasks you'll need to do. We explain what these are and how do do them in an easy straightforward way.\nSection 6: We then provide a summary, we'll provide a recap on the key things you've learned and point you to other sources of information and learning. You can also download the free templates which you can use on your own projects.\nAt the end of the course you should have enough knowledge and information to be able to confidently run your own small project.\n\nOur course includes:\nOver 20 step-by-step modules, which walk you through the fundamental concepts and process\nReal-world experience and content, with tips and tricks.\nWalk-throughs of how to complete documents using a made-up company – such as project estimates, requirements capture, project logs, reports & plans\nBonus: Exclusive project delivery checklist – to help you deliver your projects after you have completed the course\n\n\nWhat is covered: (In Scope)\n=======================\nFundamental principles of project management\nHow to assess and document project scope\nHow to break down a project using stages and WBS\nHow to capture the detail which is vital to project success\nHow to identify who should be involved\nProducing the key description document(s)\nWhat to use to estimate costs\nKey planning concepts and how to develop a plan/schedule\nThe process to identify and manage risks\nHow to work with suppliers and obtain quotes\nHow to keep the project delivery going through effective communications\nHow to deal with problems\nThe tasks in closing a project down\n\n\nWhat isn’t covered: (Out of Scope)\n=============================\nNote: This is a starter/beginner level course. If you are already familiar with project management you may find there is not enough detail and should perhaps choose an intermediate level or PMP/Prince2 course. Although we've had feedback from students who have said they are PMP qualified and still learned something!\nHow to manage large or complex projects\nThis is a BASIC level course so does not go into a huge amount of detail on each topic\nMore advanced project management techniques or concepts\nTraining for professional PM certification (such as PMP or Prince2), but you will find much of the course content helpful for this\nAgile methodologies such as Scrum & Kanban\nWe don't go into much depth on execution/delivery - this is an intro course and isn't intended to provide you with everything you would do in this phase.\nHow to use PM Tools such as Microsoft Project",

She is in a customer-facing role, and the success of this project will decide the fate of a long-term relationship with the customer.\nShe started working on the project and was confident it would accomplish its objectives.\nTwo months have passed, and one can see cracks developing in Neha's calm and composed demeanor.\nHer team members seem to be arguing a lot in the team meetings, the customer is sending escalation emails to top management, and Neha's boss is unhappy about not receiving regular project updates from her.\nHave you seen similar scenarios happening in your organization, OR do you see yourself in Neha, OR are you scared to take the PM responsibility for fear of failure?\nThis course would help you overcome the fears you might face as a first-time Project Manager.

Also, on the journey, there are a lot of landmines that you need to avoid as they can blow you and your herd.\nSounds Familiar!\nDon't worry; each one of us PMs had or will traverse this jungle many times in our career.\nMy course will give you enough tips to traverse this jungle and build your confidence to emerge as a successful project manager.\n\n\nI created this course from the webinar delivered earlier in the PMI forum.\nFew Review comments on the webinar:\n\"Great webinar.

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nDuring consulting projects, you will be doing plenty of interviews and meetings. In the beginning, you may find them very stressful and challenging, especially when you have to talk with directors and managers who are much older than you and who have much more experience than you. Luckily, there are a lot of interesting techniques that will help you conduct efficient interviews and meetings during consulting projects.\nIn this course, I will show you different tips and methods that will help you achieve your goals. Thanks to this course, you will learn the following things:\nHow to prepare and conduct initial interviews during consulting projects\nHow to conduct regular meetings\nHow to make sure that your final presentation is a success\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from the Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. We have helped numerous firms improve performance by using techniques and frameworks shown in this course. Based on what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who are now Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that, my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 315 000 students, including people working in EY, Walmart, Strategy&, Booz Allen Hamilton, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange Citigroup, Cisco, IBM, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses and tools that we use. To a lot of lectures, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excel files, as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures, so as part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy I have decided to create this course\nMost consulting firms and universities don’t devote much attention to softer skills related to conducting and managing meetings. Management Consultants also experience some problems due to the big age difference. Most of the people you will have to talk to during consulting projects are much older than you. Not having the right skills in this area may mean that you will spend too much time in meetings, and the quality of data may be low. That’s why I have decided to put the best practices when it comes to interviewing and conducting meetings into this course.\nThis course will help you conduct different types of meetings efficiently during consulting projects. These skills will prove very useful not only in consulting but also later on when you become a director or you move on to build your own business. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do, during different types of meetings to achieve your goals.\nTo sum it up, the course will help you become an expert in conducting meetings at the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, PwC, Deloitte, EY, and other top consulting firms. That is why I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants and Business Analysts.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of examples, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the way you conduct meetings. There is little theory – mainly examples, and a lot of tips from my own experience, as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that, thanks to the course, you will learn:\nHow to prepare and conduct initial interviews during consulting projects\nHow to conduct regular meetings\nHow to make sure that your final presentation is a success\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a short intro to the course, as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nInterviews – Preparation Phase. In the second section, I will show how you should prepare for the first interviews during consulting projects. We will discuss tools that will help you with the preparation.\nInterviews – Execution Phase. In this section, I will show how you should conduct the interviews. We will discuss useful tools and frameworks. I will also discuss briefly how to take notes during the interview\nRegular meetings with stakeholders. In the 4th section, I will discuss regular meetings that you have to conduct during the consulting projects. We will discuss the general framework. Afterward, I will shed some light on how to get buy-in as well as how to over-deliver\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\n1. Useful frameworks and techniques\n2. Selected analyses that are shown in the course\n3. Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies\n4. Links to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will learn to…\nHow to prepare for a meeting with managers\nHow to deliver presentations during consulting projects\nHow to conduct interviews with managers and directors\nHow to conduct internal meetings with your team during consulting projects\nHow to successfully manage implementation teams\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness Analysts\nFuture Managers\nAnalysts working in Strategic Departments\nProject Managers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

Yet, this is the probability of success of the average project.\nAnd because most successful Project Managers agree that around 80% of their time is dedicated to stakeholder management, this is the area in which you should invest once you’ve learned the basics of project management.\nA practical stakeholder management approach hugely increases the chances of belonging to the small elite of successful Project Managers. In fact, this course not only benefits you personally, but also your key stakeholders: the team you are working with, your company and clients.\nThe course focuses on the initiation phase: the period from the assignment of the Project Manager to the signature of the project charter. This project phase is regularly underestimated by Project Managers, while in reality this is the stage when you have the biggest chances to establish solid foundations for a successful project.\nDuring the course, you learn to build a trusting relationship with your sponsor (your most important stakeholder), to negotiate a set of smart objectives, to conduct a thorough stakeholder analysis and to write a project communication plan.\nFinally, you develop a realistic, feasible, project charter, and get it signed and supported by the sponsor.\nThis course is project based. After every presentation I recommend you apply the tools to a real project: I provide you with precise directions and templates. Using the tools in practice hugely improve your ability to play the project manager role.\nThis course is based on a very successful training program that I have developed for one of my best clients, a program still in place after more than 15 years.\nI’m absolutely confident that by completing the course and applying its tools to your project, you can become a member of the elite of successful Project Managers.\nBecome a successful Project Manager!",

Your next project could be a real opportunity for you and your team to shine!\nUnfortunately, too many professionals have never been given the essential toolkit needed to execute business projects successfully.\nWithout this powerful set of skills, many otherwise talented people are left wondering:\nWhy does working on this project feel painful and chaotic?\nHow am I going to tell my boss that we're going to blow the deadline?\nWhat will it take to stop feeling like I'm drowning at work?\nTrust me, I know what this feels like. Before I became a formal project manager of multi-million dollar projects—and later, an executive—I was what people sometimes call an \"Accidental Project Manager.\"\nAn accidental project manager (also sometimes called an \"occasional project manager\" or \"unofficial project manager\") is someone who is not a formal project manager by title or training, but who is still asked to lead business projects in addition to their day-to-day work.\nIn those early years of leading projects, I struggled to find training and advice that was tailored to me and my situation as a non-technical project manager. It took time, experience, and a lot of trial and error to learn to consistently deliver results.\nThat's why I felt it was so important to put together this course...to save you time and help you get results faster.\nIn our time together, you'll learn the 5 essential steps to leading a project from concept to completion:\nSTEP 1: STRATEGIZE.\nSTEP 2: PLAN.\nSTEP 3: EXECUTE.\nSTEP 4: TROUBLESHOOT.\nSTEP 5: WRAP-UP.\nFor each of these steps, you'll get:\nConcise, practical explanations of exactly what you need to do within each step\n20+ downloadable templates, examples, and teaching guides to help you apply what you're learning\nExternal articles, podcasts, and templates to give you even more options for your particular industry\nFeatured Q&A (actively updated) to address common pain points\nEmail coaching to bring the steps to life in practical terms\nYou'll also have a chance to practice along with each of these steps by either working on a live project you have or completing a case study project throughout the course.\nIf you're ready to ace your next project, let's get started!",

      "description": "Welcome to the Agile Project Management Essentials course. This is the first course of a series of eight that will form the Agile Project Management - The PMI-ACP (Agile Certified Practitioner) Certification Program.\nWhy Agile Project Management?\nAgile projects are characterized by the use of short work iterations and incremental development of products, made possible by focusing on business priorities and customer value. The course provides an introduction to common agile methodologies, describes the relationship between defined and empirical processes, and highlights the key difference in regard to the triangle of constraints of agile versus traditional methods.\n\nGuidance on how to take steps towards adopting an agile project management approach for those who currently use a traditional, plan-driven methodology is included. The relevant section discusses some common myths and misconceptions about agile development approaches, identifies factors to consider when deciding whether to adopt agile practices, and explains the general agile practices that a company may want to adopt.\nWho is your instructor?\nMy name is Sorin, and I will be your instructor. I am a trainer and project manager with more than 10 years of experience. Before Udemy, I trained hundreds of people in a classroom environment – civil servants, managers, project workers, aid workers and many more. And I managed projects in the fields of justice, corrections, regional development and human resources development.\nHow will you benefit?\nAnd, this course is intended for project managers, program managers, or anyone who wants to efficiently participate in agile projects. It is aligned with the Agile Certified Practitioner exam objectives developed by the Project Management Institute® and Certified ScrumMaster learning objectives.\nThe course includes training videos, examples, exercices and quizes. And, if you take your time to go through all the learning materials this will entitle you to claim 5 PDU’s for the PMI certification exams and to maintain your PMI certification.\nSo, thank you for condidering this course! Now, go ahead, and hit that \"Take This Course\" button. And, see you on the inside.",

      "description": "Are you apprehensive about all the math problems on the PMP exam? Like thinking about doing math instantly transports you back to being an awkward high school student that dreaded going to algebra class?\nIt’s not particularly pleasant to think about. But, for many folks taking the PMP, having to do math causes a lot of anxiety.\nWhy is this? Because many people just freak out thinking that the math on the PMP is upper-level, calculus designed to make us feel stupid.\nBut that is not the case. In fact, if we were to do an analogy showing what PMP math is really like it would probably look something like this:\nPMP Math : Calculus :: Easy Mac : Cooking Pasta from Scratch\nIn fact, all of the math on the PMP exam is basic arithmetic. Addition. Subtraction. Multiplication. Division. There is nothing complex about the math, it is just knowing the tricks of what they are looking for.\nThis course is designed to help you relax when it comes to math on the PMP exam, in particular focusing on the Earned Value Management (EVM) analysis. Since becoming a PMP in 2010, I have taught the EVM section to many different students. I start the lecture the same way, telling the students to take a deep breath in and to realize that the math questions are actually something that they should look forward to seeing on the exam.\nWhy? Because the math problems have a black-and-white answer that can be determined. There is not some abstract, choose-the-best-option type of answers that drive me crazy as a test taker. There is one answer that is the right answer and I can prove it out with a pen and paper.\nThis EVM course is the first of a series of PMP Math courses I plan on releasing to Udemy. My goal is to not just demystify the PMP math problems, but to also give you the confidence to solve them without having to clutter your mind with a bunch of formulas. Trust me. You will have plenty of other facts and information to memorize for the test that will take up valuable space in your brain.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll know all about EVM including:\nThe difference between Earned Value and Planned Value\nHow to answer the question as to whether the project is over/under budget\nHow to answer the question as to whether the project is behind/ahead of schedule\nThe difference between variances and indexes (and how to calculate them without having to fret too much about the formulas)\nHow to estimate the final cost of the project at various points in the life cycle\nRather than having a boring slideshow with a voiceover telling you about EVM, I filmed this entire course where you can see me explain each of the concepts and work through examples on a white board. Yeah, I apparently had a bad hair day with my cowlick sticking up—don’t make too much fun of me in the comments. Additionally, there is a PowerPoint file with each of the questions and answers that can help you follow along.\nIf you want to stop worrying about the math questions and start crushing them, this course is for you.\nThere is a ton of useful information in this course, and in just 60 minutes from now you can have mastery on how to answer all the EVM questions.\nNot convinced? Udemy offers a money back guarantee, so you can get your cash back if you aren’t satisfied. Sounds like a can’t lose deal to me. Enroll in this course now to gain the confidence you need to answer all PMP EVM Math questions.\nGarrett Heath, PMP",

And that's what this course enables you to do.\nIn this intermediate-level course, we’ll cover the role the business case plays in enterprise project selection and funding. We’ll start with the organization’s goals, trace down to the strategies that aim to deliver those goals, and then the projects that execute those strategies.\nWe’ll then focus on the full scope of analysis methods used to develop problems into solutions, analyze the financial and intangible costs and benefits of the solutions, and choose the solution that will best meet the needs of the enterprise.\nFrom there, we’ll move on to documenting business cases. And it’s not just filling out a template. This course gives you a method for crafting proposals in the most compelling way possible and developing the supplemental documentation you need to set you up for success.\nBut documentation will only take your project idea so far. It’s then up to us to promote the idea to management, and the course gives you a rational, non-salesy, and compelling way to do this.\nWe’ll then wrap up with a final insight (that might surprise you).\nTake ownership and control of your projects, by developing the influence you need to execute the right projects in the first place.

If so, you've come to the right place!\nWhile practicing Project Management, when you execute a large project, it is generally divided in five phases: Project Initiation, Project Planning, Project Execution, Project Monitoring and Controlling, and Project Closure. Amongst these five phases, it is said that the Project Monitoring and Controlling phase is the most difficult of all phases. This, Project Monitoring and Controlling phase, is considered difficult because during this phase:\nYou compare your planned work with the actual work that happens in your project\nYou identify deviation between the planned and the actual work\nAnd you deploy corrective or preventive actions to minimize the impact of those deviations.\nSimilarly, every large project has several project management knowledge areas. Of these, Schedule Management is considered a critical knowledge area. According to the Project Management Institute, ineffective Schedule Management is one of the top seven reasons why projects fail. And project managers never want their projects to fail. So, it becomes imperative to effectively manage your project schedule and keep it on-track to achieve the desired project objectives.\nThese are the reasons why I have created this course which is a complete project management guide that specializes in Monitoring and Controlling your Project Schedule.\n\n\nWhat's included in this course?\nYou will enroll in this course because you want to learn Monitoring and Controlling Your Project Schedule.

Learn to See Agile and Waterfall in a fresh new perspecttve as complementary to each other rather than competitive\nMany businesses and project managers are faced with a choice of choosing a traditional plan-driven approach (or what is sometimes called “Waterfall\") or a more Agile approach for critical projects which can be a very important decision with significant business impact. However, there are many stereotypes and misconceptions that exist about both “Agile\" and “Waterfall\" that can be very confusing and misleading. As an example, many people see this as a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between two extremes and attempt to force-fit projects to one of these two approaches when the right solution is to go in the other direction and fit the approach to the project.\nSince this is such a critical decision that has such a big impact, it's very important to get past these stereotypes and misconceptions and:\nDevelop a clear objective understanding of what it means (or doesn't mean) when people talk about \"Agile versus Waterfall\".\nSee these two approaches in a fresh new perspective as complementary to each other rather than competitive\n2. Learn how to blend the two approaches in the right proportions to fit any given situation to get the best of both worlds\nRather than force-fitting a project to one of these extremes, a much better approach is to fit the methodology to the nature of the project. Sometimes that requires blending the two approaches together in the right proportions to fit the situation to get the best of both worlds. It takes more skill to do that but it definitely can be done.\n____________________________________________________________________________\nOverall Agile Business Management Curriculum:\nThis course is part of an overall curriculum designed for business people to effectively participate and lead in an Agile environment. Agile significantly changes the role of business people in leading and managing projects and requires a much more active business leadership role to guide the direction of projects that are in progress. The overall curriculum consists of three primary courses:\n1. Agile BM 101 - Introduction to Agile Business Management (this course)\nThis course povides a solid foundation for the other courses in this overall curriculum and helps all business personnel develop a solid understanding of how to implement a hybrid approach that blends the two approaches in the right proportions to fit any given situation\n2. Agile BM 201 - Mastering Agile Business Management\nThis course is designed to provide a much deeper understanding of how to effectively lead Agile/Scrum projects for anyone in a Product Owner role or in an equivalent level of business responsibility. The Product Owner role in Agile is not well understood and many business managers who are assigned to perform that role are not well-prepared for it.\n3. Agile BM 301 - Enterprise-level Agile Business Management\nThe final course in this series is focused on advanced topics related to applying Agile to a business at an enterprise level including\nAlignment and Value Disciplines\nEnterprise-level frameworks (SAFe and DAD)\nEnterprise-level Agile Transformations\nOrganizational Culture and Change Management\n____________________________________________________________________________\nWhy Is This Curriculum Important?\nIn a traditional, plan-driven project management environment,\nA large part of the management of a project can be delegated to a project manager, and\nOnce the business requirements for the project are documented and approved by the business, the business role in providing leadership and management of the project can be limited.\nIn an Agile environment,\nThe requirements and the design of the solution evolve and are further refined as the project progresses\nFor that reason, it is essential that the business is much more directly involved in providing leadership and direction to the project as it progresses\nIn order to provide effective leadership and direction to projects, the business people who are either directly or indirectly involved in Agile projects need to fully understand how the process works in order to participate collaboratively in the process with the project teams who are responsible for developing the solution.\nMany existing courses for business people in an Agile environment such as Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) are limited to the \"mechanics\" of how to do Agile and are limited to a pure Agile approach. This course goes into much more depth to give business people a very solid and deeper understanding of both Agile/Scrum as well as traditional plan-driven project management and how to successfully apply it in a business environment.\n____________________________________________________________________________\nImportant Note: This course is a condensed version of some of the material in our 7-course curriculum for Agile Project Managers and there is no need for anyone to take both sets of courses.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nIn management consulting, you are delivering your advice, observations, and analyses using presentations. During some projects, you may be producing as many as 200-300 slides. Slide preparation is very time-consuming and you have to make sure that you structure your work properly to deliver according to promised deadlines.\nIn this course, you will learn how to prepare a great presentation for your customer that will help you deliver your thoughts in a coherent manner and win him over. I will teach you how to prepare the presentation in the right order so you do not waste your time. You will also learn what type of slides you can consider and when you should use a specific type of slide.\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COOs, CROs, CEOs, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nPresentations are not something people learn in school or even at universities. For most people, it is difficult to read presentations and express themselves using slides. Many people, experience also in the beginning problems in proper structuring of the whole presentation. They cannot make it understandable for the customer and quite often the presentation lacks the flow.  The biggest problem in consulting is that the presentation determines the analyses that you have to make. If your presentation draft is not well structured and thought-through you will not be efficient with interviews, data gathering, and analyses. Therefore, I found it critical to teach all my co-workers and employees how to express themselves. In this way, I made their work (not only related to presentation) much more efficient and also my life much easier :). Learn from this course and apply it also in your work\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of cases, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you work. You will learn how to prepare a great presentation both for internal as well as external purposes. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. My intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to structure the subject that the presentation is addressing?\nIn what order you should approach the preparation of the presentation?\nHow to prepare the sketch and the template of the presentation?\nWhat type of slides and when you can use them?\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly. How the course is organized?\nThe course is divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction.      We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on the role of presentation in consulting and when you actually prepare presentations\nCreating the template. In the second section, how to go from a general idea (i.e. from an issue tree) to a sketch and how to transform the sketch into a template\nFilling in the slides. In the next section, I will talk about general rules concerning the filling in the slides, the flow that you achieve, and how different is the template vs the end-product\nDelivery of the presentation.  In this section, we will talk briefly about the delivery of the presentation: how to do it and how different is the written presentation from the presentation that can be delivered to the audience.\nTypes of charts you can use. In this section, I will go through many types of slides and will show you what you can use for a specific purpose\nExample of presentations. In the next section, I show examples of real presentations and will discuss how I have structured them in such a way.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nTemplates of slides\nExamples of the presentations shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nCreate a great presentation in the style of top consulting firms\nUnderstand the main challenges in preparing the management consulting presentation\nExpress yourself with slides\nRead presentation\nCreate the flow in the story told via presentation\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nStudents of Business Schools\nResearchers\nBusiness Analysts",

Do you need a structured methodology to get you through the interview process? Then this course is for you.\nProgram managers have become ubiquitous at many tech companies and are quickly growing in more conventional industries and verticals as well. They drive progress across organizations, operate cross-functionally with different teams, and pivot on a dime to adapt to quickly changing market conditions and customer-centric needs. They also transcend beyond your typical project manager and come with domain expertise, design, and product sense.\nI made this course for those looking to land a role as a program manager, both technical and non-technical. By the end of the course, you will have a high-level understanding of the program manager role and be sufficiently prepared to interview for program manager roles at various tech companies.\nThe ideal student for this course is someone who is hoping to land a role as a program manager or preparing to switch roles and wants a structured method to prepare for the interview process. There are no requirements necessary to enroll, I only ask that you engage in the exercises in the course and stay open-minded.",

      "description": "If a project costs $1.2 million in year 1 and generates revenue of $400,000 in each subsequent year, how many years does it take to break even?\n\nIf you answered 5 years (including year 1) then you probably need to take this course because it's likely that this project loses money over that five year period.\nThe problem with break-even analysis and Return on Investment (ROI) calculation is that they usually ignore the fact that $1,000 in one year's time is not equivalent to the same amount today, That's because the money could be invested in a different way, brining interest rates into play.\nThe only sound way to determine whether a project is financially viable, is by calculating the project's Net Present Value. This project will teach you:\n\nWhy Future Value does not equate to Present Value.\nHow to Calculate Present Value.\nHow to calculate Net Present Value across a number of year.\nWhy Return on Investment, Break-even and Internal Rate of Return can be misleading\nWhat other types non-monetary value you can consider.\nIf you already have a good grasp of Net Present Value, Discounted Cashflow or Time Value of Money then this course is not for you. If, however, any of the terms make your stomach feel queasy then this course is for you.\nNet Present Value is one of this things that is obvious when you understand but baffling until that moment when the \"penny drops\". This course aims to get that penny to drop for you.\nNet Present Value is explained in 4 short, core videos (not including introductory and summary videos) using examples and exercises. Each exercise has a downloadable spreadsheet, containing the calculations to get the answers.\nIn addition, there are 2 additional optional videos, one covering Internal Rate of Return and Return on Investment, and another video on the treatment of inflation.\nAnd there are a further two bonus videos, taken from my Lean Project Management course, that discuss non-financial types of value and the role of emotion in value.",

      "description": "Functional and Non-functional Requirements Can Make or Break Your Project\n\nNEW in 2023: Are you tired of spending countless hours on creating solution requirements? Our course has got you covered! We're thrilled to introduce our latest section, which teaches you how to use Ai-writing tools to jumpstart the creation of solution requirements. With our cutting-edge AI-storming technique, you can generate top-quality solution requirements in a fraction of the time, saving you valuable resources and getting your project off the ground faster.\nDon't miss out on this incredible opportunity to learn about AI-storming and take your requirement analysis skills to the next level. Enroll today and join the ranks of over 8000 successful professionals who have taken this course and improved their expertise!\n\n\nTranslating Stakeholder Vision into Actionable IT Specifications\nBusiness Requirements, Stakeholder Requirements, Epics, and User Stories define business needs in business terminology that all involved parties can understand, but the devil lies in the detail. Solution Providers (i.e., those responsible for building, buying, assembling, or configuring an IT application) need to know what the application will do, what data it will deal with, and what additional qualities it requires to satisfy the business needs. In other words, they need Functional and Non-functional (aka Solution) Requirements at a level of detail that most subject matter experts can only provide when prompted and led.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nIn this course, you will learn simple and repeatable techniques for extracting solution-level specifications from requirements and user stories. The presented techniques will help you identify specific functions the solution needs, data it requires, and data it produces. You will also discover hidden, non-functional needs (e.g., performance, usability, reliability, etc.) related to the functions.\n\n\nAccelerate Your Team's Productivity with AI Assistance\nIn our newest edition, the course introduces the exciting new AI Writing Assistant Jasper which helps teams decompose requirements or user stories into functional and data elements with greater speed and accuracy than ever before! Get ready to unlock the power of AI-assisted requirements decomposition with the functional and non-functional requirements course. Join us today and maximize your team's productivity!\n\n\nSoftware Specifications Done Right: Lessons from Worldwide IT Initiatives\nMy co-author, Angela, and I have used these techniques on hundreds of IT projects around the globe and we know the value each provides. Using these approaches will improve your ability to identify and document requirements at the level of detail that solution providers (vendors or developers) need to deliver the right technology for their organization.\n\n\nAligning Business Needs with Technical Implementation\nThe presented techniques will work on any set of well-expressed requirement statements or user stories.\nRegardless of your job title or role, if you are involved in defining future business solutions, this course will help you communicate your business needs to solution providers. It will reduce or eliminate misunderstandings that undermine IT’s ability to deliver the right digital solutions for your business.\n\n\nHow to get the most out of this course?\nTo maximize the learning effect, you will have optional assignments to assess your understanding of each presented technique. They do not “test” your knowledge in the conventional sense. Their purpose is to demonstrate the use of the technique more real-life than our explanations can supply. We hope you enjoy them and that they make it easier for you to apply the techniques in real life.",

This Scrum package can serve as a knowledge base for those who are already working with Scrum or agile, those who have only heard about it and want to fully understand its principles and to those who are preparing for the Scrum Master certification.\nThe course was created by two agile enthusiasts who work with Scrum teams and experience Scrum every day. Jarek and Paweł are Scrum Masters who started their adventure with IT projects in a waterfall environment, then worked with multiple teams on introducing the agile change and are currently working as Scrum Masters. Their professional experience allowed them to obtain the „full image” of the agile methodology (and the Scrum framework in particular) and how it relates to the waterfall approach.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:\nThis course is not an official preparation for the Professional Scrum Master™ I (PSM I) certification by Scrum(.)org and it is not connected with this organization.

      "description": "Why PMI-ACP?\nAs most projects nowadays are approached using Agile methodologies, everyone wants to practice Agile and be a certified Agile practitioner. But the World has also realized that “one size does not fit all”, That's why PMI introduced \"PMI-ACP\" to help you perform a fit-gap analysis and use practices from various agile methodologies. The PMI-Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)® is a well-recognized certification globally and is the only certification worldwide that encompasses the practices from various Agile methodologies like Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and more.\n\n\nWhat Makes This Course Special?\nPMI recommends more than 10 books to read and more than 100 topics as a reference list to learn to get ready for the ACP exam. Most courses that we have seen talk about those topics in random order or in an order that hardly makes any sense.\nIn this course, we spent a lot of time putting the topics in order that would easily make sense to everyone. Unlike many courses, we don't believe that Agile is just a project management methodology. Agile is a mindset that should be applied to both the project management and the product development life cycles. These concepts made it easy to put a solid outline of this course that would map to the project management life cycle recommended by PMI from Initiation to Planning, Execution, and Monitoring and Controlling and also to product development life cycle from requirements gathering to design, implementation and testing. And this is what we are to teach you in this course.\n\n\nThis course is mapped to all domains in the PMI-ACP Exam Content Outline, including Agile Principles and Mindset, Value-Driven Delivery, Stakeholder Engagement, Team Performance, Adaptive Planning, Problem Detection and Resolution, and Continuous Improvement.\nThis course is aligned with the updated PMI-ACP Exam Content Outline and the PMI Agile Practice Guide.\n\n\nWe use various case studies, real life project examples & situations, and terminology to solidify understanding of how to answer behavioral-based PMI-ACP® exam questions.\n\n\nYou will be required to solve a quiz at the end of each section in addition to a simulation exam at the end of this course.\n\n\nThis course provides you with the 21 contact hours of agile project management education, required to apply for the PMI-ACP exam.\nWhat will The Students Learn In This Course?\nThis course is designed for those planning to take the PMI-ACP Certification exam as well as those interested in learning more about Agile project management. This course is specifically designed with every practitioner in mind.\nThe practical ability to use Agile techniques on projects, and during the exam;\nAn understanding of key concepts, terms, and tools;\nProven, expert exam-taking skills.\nEven if you're not planning to take the PMI-ACP exam soon, or if you haven't practiced Agile yet in your organization, still, this course is a great resource for everyone to learn and apply Agile best practices in your day to day job.\n\n\nSo, if you are involved in Agile in any capacity, this certification is going to help you achieve new milestones in your career easily. Though previously Agile methodologies were associated with the IT industry, now it is finding applications in other industries and areas like electrical and electronics, product development, construction, and so on. This has further enhanced the value of the PMI-ACP certification.\n\n\nTake your career to a new level by joining the best PMI-ACP training course. Be trained by the best.\nJoin our training today.",

      "description": "The conflict around estimates\nDo you have a love-hate relationship with estimates? Businesses demand them but agile teams see them as something stakeholders use against them. In a complex agile project, an estimate can feel like a binding commitment and a stranglehold. In this course, you will learn how to create agile estimates that work for both your team and your stakeholders.\n\nWhat you’ll get from this course\nI created this course and packed it with practical, real-world experiences that I’ve gained working with Agile teams around the world.\nThis is primarily a “learn by doing” course. So all theory is paired with practical exercises we’ll complete together in your workbook.\n\nWith this course, you’ll...\n\nDiscover how to set up an estimation process that suits your environment\nGain in-depth knowledge of the most popular estimation techniques used by modern agile teams\nBe able to identify and troubleshoot common estimation problems\nRecognize when to re-estimate & when not to\nGain skills you can apply immediately via “9 practical exercises”\n\nThe practical exercises you’ll complete include…\nEstimating the height of dogs using “dog points” (relative estimation)\nPerforming velocity calculations\nEstimating using a reference point\nRunning a pointing poker session\nWhich estimation technique to use for various scenarios\nand more…\n\nWhy learn agile estimation?\nAgile estimation is difficult. Most teams struggle with it. When the estimation process is broken, estimates feel impossible to achieve, or overinflated. Stakeholder relationships begin to deteriorate. And management starts to push back on estimates, thinking teams can complete more and more, and are disappointed when unrealistic goals are not met. In defense, teams begin to spend too much time in planning, at the cost of building.\nBut how do you fix this? In a field where so many teams follow counter-productive practices, copying others won’t work.\nThis course will help set your team on the right path by showing you how to establish estimation best practices and troubleshoot existing issues\n\nSo Let’s Do This! Enroll now and sharpen your Estimation skills.\n\n\nI’ll see you inside!",

      "description": "This UNOFFICIAL course and practice exams are neither endorsed by, nor in partnership, nor affiliated with Scrum .org.\nMany students use this UNOFFICIAL course will help prepare for the Scrum .org PSPO I exam. But you can use this UNOFFICIAL course to prepare for any exam that requires you to know the Agile principles and to understand the Scrum Guide.\nThe price of the PSPO I exam or any other certifications is NOT included in the price of this UNOFFICIAL course and needs to be paid separately.\nThe terms Scrum Open, Professional Scrum, Professional Scrum Master, Professional Scrum Product Owner, PSM I, PSPO I, PSPO 1, etc. represent the protected brand of Scrum .org.\n\n\n== Frequent questions ==\nIs this UNOFFICIAL course up to date for the 2024 exam?\nYes. This course is constantly being updated and improved. It is valid for the 2024 version of the exam.\n\n\nOn which version of the Scrum Guide is this UNOFFICIAL course based?\nThis UNOFFICIAL course is compliant with the 2020 version of the Scrum Guide.\n\n\nDoes this UNOFFICIAL course include everything I need to pass the exam?\nYes, all the information you need and the materials you can use are included in the UNOFFICIAL course. You don't need to worry about searching for other resources or courses.\n\n\nCan I earn PMI PDUs (Professional Development Units) by taking this course?\nBy attending this UNOFFICIAL course, previous students have successfully claimed PDUs. I cannot make any guarantees that your claim will be approved.\n\n\nCan I claim PMI PDUs (Professional Development Units) by taking the exam?\nUnfortunately not. PMI PDUs are obtained for attending a course but not for passing an exam.\n\n\nWhich Product Owner certification to take?\nFor aspiring or existing Product Owners, the most popular certification is PSPO I from Scrum. org. The good part is that there is no expiration date after passing the exam for your PSPO I exam.\nScrum .org is a certification and training organization that has focused on teaching Scrum as it was intended to be used. At Scrum .org you can take many Scrum certifications at a relatively affordable price.\nAn alternative is the CSPO certification from Scrum Alliance.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between PSPO and CSPO?\nBoth exams are based on the Agile principles and the Scrum Guide.\nThe CSPO certification requires you to take a course from Scrum Alliance. The certification status expires and needs to be renewed.\nThe PSPO I exam does not require you to take a course from Scrum .org. You could do that, but it is not mandatory. Once you have obtained the certification, you don't need to renew it.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between PSM I and PSPO I?\nThe PSPO I certification is relatively similar to another popular certification called PSM I. Even if you have passed the PSM I exam, it does not mean that the PSPO I exam will be the same.\nWhile the focus on the PSM I exam has focused on general Scrum rules and the role of the Scrum Master in different situations, the PSPO I exam is more focused on the role of the Product Owner in different circumstances and how the Product Owner can maximize value.\n\n\n== Is this UNOFFICIAL Product Owner course for you? ==\nThis UNOFFICIAL course is for those who are interested in working within an Agile team, especially from the position of the Product Owner.\n\n\nYou might be:\n- an aspiring Business Analyst who wants to improve their knowledge with more Product-related skills.\n- an experienced Project Manager who wants to transition to Agile projects\n- an existing Product Owner who wants the recognition of their skills\n- a Scrum Master who wants to enhance their mastery of Scrum\n- an experienced developer who knows the development process inside-out and wants to take their career to another level.\n\n\n== How does this UNOFFICIAL course help me? ==\n\n\nThe UNOFFICIAL course explains the Scrum Guide in an easy-to-understand way. It also tests your understanding of the Scrum framework with quizzes and assignments.\n\n\nWhat you should expect:\n- High-quality video lectures\n- Quizzes and assignments\n- Q&A section for support anytime you have questions\n- Practical examples of how Scrum is applied in organizations\n\n\n== Final notes ==\n\n\nThe terms \"The Guide\", \"the Scrum Guide\", \"Guide\" refer to the official The Scrum Guide available online at scrumguides .org.\nAnywhere in this UNOFFICIAL course there the Scrum Guide is cited or mentioned, it is referring to The Scrum Guide.\nThe statements made and opinions expressed herein belong exclusively to the creator of this UNOFFICIAL course and are not shared by or represent the viewpoint of Scrum .org.  This training does not constitute an endorsement of any product, service or point of view.  Scrum .org makes no representations, warranties or assurances of any kind, express or implied, as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, availability or currency of the content contained in this presentation or any material related to this presentation.  In no event shall Scrum .org, its agents, officers, employees, licensees or affiliates be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, business information, loss of information) arising out of the information or statements contained in the training.  Any reliance you place on such content is strictly at your own risk.",

      "description": "Do you struggle with releases?\nSome of the hardest Stakeholder questions Agile teams face are “what are you building?” And “by when?”. Many teams struggle to balance the immediate “release planning” needs of stakeholders, with the longer-term “release management” needs of the company.\nRelease management is a long-term endeavor.

      "description": "This beginner-level course offers an immersive journey into the world of Agile methodologies, focusing on two most popular Agile frameworks: Scrum and SAFe (the Scaled Agile Framework). Here's what you'll learn:\nUnderstanding Agile Principles The course begins by introducing the fundamentals of project management and Agile methodologies. After all, one can't fully understand Agile without understanding the product/project landscape from which it emerged.\nParticipants will explore the core values and principles underpinning Scrum and SAFe, such as iterative development, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Through engaging lessons and real-world examples, beginners will understand how Agile thinking differs from traditional project management approaches.\nBy delving into the Agile Manifesto and its twelve principles, students will gain insights into why Agile methodologies have gained widespread adoption across industries.\nGetting Fluent with the Language of Scrum The course then transitions to a deep dive into the Scrum framework. Participants will learn the roles, ceremonies, and artifacts of the Scrum process. From understanding the responsibilities of the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team to comprehending the purpose of Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, and Retrospectives, learners will clearly understand how Scrum promotes collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement. Practical exercises and case studies will allow students to apply Scrum concepts hands-on, solidifying their understanding of how to deliver value in a dynamic and flexible manner.\nNavigating the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) Building on the foundation of Scrum, the course then introduces participants to SAFe, a framework designed for larger enterprises and complex projects. Beginners will explore the four levels of SAFe: Team, Program, Large Solution, and Portfolio, understanding how each level aligns to deliver value seamlessly across the organization. Students will learn about essential components such as the SAFe House of Lean, Agile Release Trains (ARTs), and Lean-Agile leadership practices. By grasping the principles of SAFe's synchronization, collaboration, and continuous delivery, participants will be well-equipped to apply this framework in enterprises aiming for Agile at scale.\nBy combining theoretical knowledge with the \"boots-on-the-ground\" experience of the instructors, course participants will gain the skills needed to embrace Agile values, navigate Scrum practices, and comprehend the intricacies of SAFe's scaled approach.\nWhether pursuing a career in project management, software development, or any job that favors a familiarity with Agile, this course lays a solid foundation for beginners to thrive in today's rapidly-evolving business landscape.",

One of the best ways to prepare to pass your PMP exam is to understand the PMP exam terminology. If you know the terms, you’re better prepared to answer the tricky exam questions.\nI’ve been teaching PMP exam prep classes since 2003 – and I’ve written best-selling books on the PMP, the CAPM, and the PMI-ACP. In all these books and in my classes I tell people to create flashcards, by hand, to really learn all the terms, yet very few people actually follow-through on creating the cards.\nWhy? It’s hard work, time-consuming, and not easy to carry a huge stack of cards with you everywhere you go.\nI have the solution.\nMany people have asked me to create a simple course with all the PMP terms and definitions displayed on the screen and read aloud. Simple, direct, and a big-time saver.\nIn this unique course, I've identified nearly 700 PMP terms that you should know for your PMP exam success. I'll walk you through each of the terms and definitions. Now you can watch, listen, and learn all the PMP terminologies for your exam. If you know the terms, you're better prepared to pass the exam.\nI include several resources to help you pass the PMP exam:\nFull text of all the vocabulary in one location (Yes, you can copy and paste, but not share)\nPMP Vocabulary PDF full-screen slides\nPMP Vocabulary with two terms per page\nPMP Vocabulary with three terms per page\nPMP Vocabulary of text-only terms in PDF document\nWhile you can complete this course on your PC or Mac, I highly recommend you add the free Udemy app for your phone, put on your earphones, and listen and learn on the go.

      "description": "Although I have been doing project management for quite some time, it had been mostly waterfall based, and I started my first agile project using scrum six months ago. I had taken some classes in agile and scrum, and this project was the first time I had to apply what I had learned­ and I realized that I had many gaps.\nThe Robust Scrum master course was incredibly detailed and helped fill in those gaps. It provided wholistic guidance and practical “how-to” advice for facilitating the planning, review, and retrospective meetings. It helped validate what I was doing well, what I was missing, and where I could do better.\nI highly recommend this course to those who want to improve their skills as a scrum master.\n-Mia Turpel\n\n\nUpdated in Summer 2023. Over 2500 students enrolled.\n\n\nDo you feel like you're not yet a confident and successful Scrum Master?\nDo you want to build confidence and clarity to facilitate the key Scrum meetings?\nDo you want to collaborate effectively with managers?\nDo you want to learn how to communicate through conflict?\nThen this course is for you!\n\n\nThis course is the fastest path you can take to 'level up' your Scrum Master skills.\n\nThis course is for people who have taken a one to three day course on Scrum (or have equivalent experience) and want to ‘raise the bar’ on their skills. Introductory Scrum courses tell you ‘what’ you need to do but not ‘how’ to do it. This course shows you, through detailed examples and checklists, ‘how’ to be a Scrum Master.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nThe mindset of successful Scrum Masters. You will learn how your mindset influences your actions and how to construct an effective mindset.\nHow to create your daily, weekly, and monthly rhythms. What do you need to do every day as a Scrum Master? What do you need to do every week and every month?\nThe ABC technique: How to build relationships with key people in your organization to increase the success of your Scrum teams.\nEXACTLY how to facilitate the planning, review, and retrospective meetings. When you become an effective facilitator, you will radically improve your team’s cohesion and velocity.\nA way to communicate through conflict. Learn how to break down every difficult conversation into four steps.\nHow to collaborate with managers on Scrum. You will learn what managers care about and how they think about Scrum. You will learn how to set up and launch an Enterprise Agile Team.\nThe characteristics of a servant leader and how to increase your ability to serve the team.\nYou will get tools and checklists that take the STRESS out of being a Scrum Master.\nIn addition to the course material, you will receive two one-on-one 25 minute coaching sessions with me. I will share with you what I’ve learned training and consulting at Carbonite, edX, Paypal, Symantec, Philips, Verizon, and a dozen other companies. You will also be invited to a group monthly coaching call. In addition, you’ll be able to ask questions at any time using the questions area of the course. This is like having a PERSONAL TUTOR as you ‘level up’ your Scrum Master skills.\nWho am I? I am the co-author of Professional Scrum with Team Foundation Server, Why Agile Works: The Values Behind the Results, and Agile Coaching:Wisdom from Practitioners. I am a former VP of Corporate Strategy at Softricity, founder of Inquira (acquired by Oracle), and a PhD in Computer Science from MIT.\nI am here to pump you up as you deepen your understanding of Scrum and improve your Scrum Master skills!\nThe course is designed to be taken over eight weeks. If you follow this plan, you will spend approximately half an hour per day on the course. The first one or two days of every week will focus on videos and during the remainder of the week you will be doing assignments.\nWarning: This course is HARD. I like to say, “Practice in proportion to your aspirations.” If you are ready to sweat blood to become a better Scrum Master, I invite you to look at Section 3 of the course to see if this course is a good fit for you.\nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. I want you to be successful: more influential, confident, and visible.",

You have nothing to lose and so much knowledge to gain.\n\n\nJust ask the students who’ve already taken this course:\n★★★★★ \"A great step by step guide through Atlassian-Confluence. Menu items are explored and explained. Alternative routes to doing the same actions are also explained. Examples are worked through at a very good pace and the videos are not overwhelming. There is no homework, which means that you can actually focus on soaking in the material. Feel free to stop, edit your own confluence and explore, without the pressure of an assignment behind it. I thought everything in the video was helpful and even learned a couple new tricks on how to structure my spaces. There are a variety of use-case scenarios that give you an idea of how to use this tool in different ways (which happens to be my favorite part). Useful demonstrations on layouts, permissions, status changes, drop down menus and more. Confluence is a Canvass that can be used as a great communication platform. You have many tools at your disposal and this course covers that arsenal. Great work and Thank You.\"\n-David Fai\n\n\n★★★★★ \"This is a great course on Confluence's latest version. Really useful with clear & crisp explanations! Highly recommended. Thanks to the tutor.\"\n- Reena Shah\n\n\n★★★★★ \"I needed a refresher on Confluence capabilities before starting a project. This course presents all the relevant features nicely. It is good for any type of end user.\"\n-Iasan Montac\n\n\n★★★★★ \"The course is well planned and was impressed with instructor's knowledge of the subject & the detailed explanations. I am so glad that I choose this course.\"\n- Umesh Bansal\n\n\n★★★★★ \"To the point. I like it when the instructor is focused on teaching the topic and not wasting time here and there.\"\n-Rick",

      "description": "Udemy's \"Smart Tips\" is the ultimate micro-learning series. Short, standalone lectures let you learn new skills at your own pace, anytime, anywhere. Find what you need, when you need it. Elevate your learning with Smart Tips!\nIf you have been assigned to a project at work or if you are an ambitious person, this course is for you! Why? Because at some point or another every professional is asked to be part of a project or lead one as the project manager. But the world of projects is completely different than the world of operations and theory is very different than practice.\nProjects are unchartered, intense terrain, which I call: Projectland. Consider me your tour guide through the intense terrain of Projectland. I will share strategies and practical techniques to help you navigate and succeed in your own version of Projectland. By the end, you will be able to decide for yourself if navigating Projectland is scary or exciting. You’ll learn to think more like a professional project manager, equipped to assess and respond to project risk, so that you can deliver results. You will also be introduced to the project manager role, so that you can decide whether it is a good fit for you. If not, you can direct your career to be more suited to your strengths.\nIn this course, you will gain skills in planning, leading and delivering successful projects, which will help you to accomplish more, stress less, impress your boss and achieve your career goals.\n\n\nYou will learn...\n1. What a project is and what it is not, so that you can know which work on your plate will benefit from project management techniques\n2. Who is in Projectland including what the boss of a project is called, a deep dive into the project manager role and an introduction to different kinds of team members\n3. Who stakeholders are, how to think about them and make sure they don’t sabotage your project\n4. Tips for running great meetings in Projectland, because you simply can’t be a great project manager without this skill\n5. What a successful project is and how to set your project up for success at the start, including one simple technique every project leader MUST do in the beginning\n6. How to choose the right project management process to organize your project and move it smoothly from idea to done\n7. How to leverage best practices that professional project managers use including the schedule, budget, scope, resources, quality, risks and issues\n8. An introduction to four popular flavors of Agile, including Scrum players, ceremonies and artifacts\n9. Why agile can be used beyond information technology projects INCLUDING by a six-year-old\n10. An introduction to popular project management and agile professional organizations, including a deep dive about the Project Management Institute (PMI), their certifications, and how you can learn their complex, global gold standard through storytelling and gamification\n\n\nWhat people are saying:\n\"Clear, concise, and funny!\" ~ Rachel M\n“Excellent course. Short, and straight to the point presentation. Easy to follow with lots of nuggets. Highly recommended.” ~ Mark M.\n“Excellent course. I am mentoring someone now as they consider a project management career path and will highly recommend this course.” ~June N\n“I've taken graduate level project management courses at University of Chicago. So, I have a good foundation. Dawn's style and examples provide real world and practical tools to build on that foundation. I stepped away from managing projects for several years. This course rekindled the interest and makes me look forward to the challenges again.” ~ Mary Kay C.\n“For those who aren't all that familiar with project management principles, this is a fantastic overview. So many clear definitions, real-world scenarios to tie them to and action items so you can put things into practice. Great course!” ~ Rebecca J\n“Excellent course. Not only very good tips but key project management basics. Nice format, nice presentation (besides excellent quality videos) with practical downloadable resources and tools. Fully recommended!” ~ Juan R\n“I was a complete newbie to project management and this was just what I needed.” ~Aivars G\n\n\nA PwC study of over 10,640 projects found that only 2.5% of companies complete their projects 100% successfully. This course is full of practical tips that will help you improve your chances of being part of that tiny top 2.5%. Since initiatives or projects are formed because results are expected, NOT delivering can quickly become detrimental to your career. On the flip side, doing a great job on projects can boost your visibility and be a great opportunity to accelerate your standing in any organization.\nI am so excited about this course, because after teaching and coaching thousands of ambitious professionals around the world, leading a new Project Management Office in the Fortune 500, advising top executives and spending over 20 years in Projectland, I know that a quick video series that professionals could learn from and secretly lean on as a refresher is incredibly valuable.\n\n\nAre you ready to get to the next level in your career and have fun doing it?

The Olympics, developing a new disease cure, putting a man on the moon, launching a new product range, or even just planning a birthday party - if you can master Project Management you can lead any project of any size with the same simple process.

Instead, in this course, you’ll be walked through step by step on how to simply and effectively manage any project, in any industry, with any budget.\n\n\nThe Project Management process taught in this Project Management Fundamentals course is the APM (aka PMP or PMI) method. It’s based on decades of academic research and is widely accepted as the ultimate Project Management solution.

You’ll learn how to make a PERT diagram with Post-it notes, and a Gantt Chart using only Excel. Say goodbye to overcomplicated Prince2 or Agile, and enjoy the simplicity of this 12 Step Process. This course covers detailed tips for excellent planning using Gantt Charts and PERT diagrams, managing a team, avoiding overspend, predicting risks and dealing with multiple stakeholders.\n\n\nAfter this course, you will feel calm, collected, well prepared and confident that your project will be a success. You’ll know how to come in on time, on budget, and with a very happy boss. We look at lots of real-life project management examples (some of which will definitely get you laughing) and give you practical tools you can use right away to get better results in your projects. Whether you're managing a small at-home project or an entire global corporate expansion this course will empower you as someone who is always one step ahead.\n\n\nChris Croft is an international speaker, and widely published author, who's been teaching Project Management to companies for over 20 years.

Donors will only support proposals that:\nConvince them of the value of solving the problem\nDemonstrate that you have a solution\nPersuade them you can deliver results\nSo, you need to be a good communicator, too - presenting your ideas clearly and persuasively.\nWHAT OUR PRACTICAL PROJECT PLANNING & PROPOSAL WRITING COURSE WILL TEACH YOU\nYou will learn:\nHow to design your own project\nHow to write a proposal that donors will support\nHave a look at the video below and explore the curriculum to see what's in the course.\nCOURSE OUTCOMES\n\nThis flexible, self-paced, practical course will teach you how to:\nDesign a project your donors will support\nPlan, draft and edit a persuasive proposal\nCLEAR & PRACTICAL LEARNING\nThe course allows for maximum practical work. While you will get all the theory you need, you will learn the steps and tools in a way that you can apply time after time after the course is over so that:\nYou will always know what to do each time you have to develop a proposal\nYour proposals will be well-organised, clear and persuasive - contributing to better relations with donors and, more importantly, increased donor support\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n\nLifetime Access to the Whole Course\nAs soon as you sign up you get immediate access to all the course materials -course videos, printable exercises and extra resource materials.\nFlexible Learning\nYou can work at your own pace - starting when you want, and working at whatever times suit you best. The entire course should take around 20 hours, including all the tasks and developing your own project plan and proposal.\n\nCertificate of Achievement\nAfter you have completed all the modules you will be issued your certificate.\nYou will also learn some key tools and tips you won't find anywhere else - such as how to adjust your writing style to different readers, or how to use Mind Mapping to:\n\nPlan projects\nOrganise and analyse information\nPlan and draft your writing\nWelcome From Course Instructor Neil Kendrick\nHello - and thanks for checking out this course! I’m excited to share with you the skills involved in becoming a successful proposal writer.\nFor over 20 years I've helped development professionals get support from donors through winning proposals. From small NGOs to multi-donor million-dollar projects, I've worked with proposal writers from a range of sectors, helping them get support for their projects. From my worldwide experience, you’ll quickly learn what works and what doesn't.\nThis practical, step-by-step course is for all those aspiring proposal writers who can't join our face-to-face training due to time, work or expense. Now - without having to book time off, or jump on a plane - you'll soon be able to:\n\nDesign a project your donors will support\nPlan, draft and edit a winning proposal\nAnd, just like donors, you also want results and value for money. Flying to a training, with all its extra costs, can be expensive. And for less than the travel costs alone, in just a few moments you can have access to this step-by-step, practical training - all downloadable so you don't miss a thing.\nSo, join me now, on this journey towards winning project proposals.\n\nNeil Kendrick\nDirector\nELD TRAINING",

Stakeholders in any major project demand for CPM/PERT analysis to get convinced about the likely success of project. This course goes into the nuances of this powerful technique and helps project management professionals make use of it in gaining finer insight into the project. This course also discusses about how to use the CPM/PERT analysis for preparing Gantt Chart.\nAn interesting case has been included in exercise form that makes you apply these techniques in resource planning, resource allocation, prioritizing the activities and handling change in critical path. PERT/CPM examples discussed in this course are easy to understand even for beginners.\nA section has been added for Probabilistic models that help in evaluating and managing uncertainties. Risk is measured in terms of probability. This brings quantitative approach towards project risk management particularly related to time overrun.\n\n\nHere are few words of caution:\nA sure way of becoming a mediocre professional is to learn any topic by learning features of some software or tool on that topic. People make this mistake and pay dearly in their careers.\n\nIf you are thinking of learning Project Management by learning a Project Management Software, you are on the same path. As a professional, you have to deal with several adversities in projects. Understanding the nuances of projects and applying smart management techniques are necessary to manage projects in optimum way. Software can do computations and present results in various ways. But, you can handle adversities and do smart planning only with good understanding of techniques.\n\nThis course doesn't teach you any software.

I picked up several things I can leverage in my daily work right now. Good examples covering various use cases. - Josh Hinz\"\n\"This was an excellent match for me in my line of work. Even though I consider myself an experienced agile practitioner, the course brings together several relevant and new topics that I'd not thought about before. It does so in an accessible, understandable way. - Greg Skinner\"\n\"Background, term definitions, and examples were at the right level of detail and relevance. Key points were reviewed throughout the course, which enabled better absorption. Concepts were reinforced in a clear, impactful manner through the use of animation, easy to understand language and high quality, concise content. Lesson sequence and pacing was spot on. Humor incorporated into the course enhanced my overall enjoyment. As a non-IT professional, I appreciated the examples provided, specifically the example used to demonstrate batch size and single-piece flow concepts. This course proved valuable and worth the investment! - Brittany Daniels\"\n\"Best course on agile I've taken so far! Extremely useful and alive visualization is enhancing thinking process. Thanks for the adequate pace - easy to follow. Waiting for continuation! - Stepan Zaponkin\"\n\"As a member of an Agile team in a process environment, this training is spot on to explain the system and methods. The time spent with this course will definitely expedite your effectiveness on an Agile project - well done! - James Knight\"\n\"This course was particularly helpful for explaining the terminology that is frequently used out of context by those unfamiliar with the value proposition of Agile. Without this background, the terms and methods associated with Agile/Scrum/Kanban might seem faddish and silly. This course is very useful for getting the key messages across so that the value of these techniques is much more obvious. The material was delivered efficiently and it was also kind of fun. - Brent Eilerts\"\n\"I got sucked in from the very first minute. During the entire course kept applying acquired knowledge to my field of expertise. Ten out of ten!                - German Anashkin\"\n\"This course was helpful to get a fresh overview of Scrum and Kanban processes without being too overwhelming as more traditional training courses are. - Carlos Avila\"\n\n\nWhat’s included in the course?\nCourse enrollment grants you lifetime access, with no expiration, to all the course lectures and 2 short quizzes.

      "description": "Planning and Scheduling is a major and vital activity when it comes to managing the project successfully. As per AACE International there is less than 2000 planning and scheduling professionals worldwide and the same number goes for scheduling professionals as per PMI standards!. Imagine that!!. It means that you rarely have met one. How about becoming one?\nWe are from the top 2000  worldwide professional planners that are successfully managing more than 1 BILLION $ projects on hand today. In this course, we reveal how are we doing it.\nThere are lots of project management, planning and scheduling books and courses out there. We have tried most, combined the best practices and methods into this course.\nTo be recognized as a professional planner (PSP - Planning and Scheduling Professional) by AACE International or PMI (PMI-SP - Scheduling Professional) is given after a rigorous exam of 5 hours and 3.5 hours respectively. So, how about to become one of the few? - That's why this course came to life and to LOVE what you learn.\n\nSO\n>What is planning ?\n\n>What is Scheduling?\n>What makes the perfect plan?\n>What is the difference between planning and scheduling?\n>Is there even a difference between planning and scheduling?\n>When you say the plan, are you taking a project management plan, time plan, cost plan or what?\n>Is Planning and Scheduling a skill?\nThis is all answered in this course and tailored to make you of the planning and scheduling professionals.\nThis course is the Planning and Scheduling Definitive Guide.\nThe skill and the knowledge of planning and scheduling are really way underappreciated and unrecognized. We have seen a lot throughout our career life that does not know what the planner should do? How to do? And how important is he or she to the success of the project? Finding a professional planner to handle out the project time, saves the company rights, allocate the costs right is something so hard. That’s why this course is created, to cover this huge knowledge gap and even to make you more confident when applying to a job as a planner or even if you are working in a different position or a project manager to know how the planner works? And how to pick the best ones from the market? - Planning and Scheduling is a vital skill.\nThe contribution of a planner to projects is huge. It can totally affect the project's goals, believe it or not, a project could fail miserably if planned wrong. We have seen projects that took twice its planned time and cost because it has not been planned correctly. Imagine the frustration! Here comes the motto of “Fail to plan is planning to fail”. There should be a considerable effort in planning the project and then scheduling the project.\nI personally after graduation with a Bsc of engineering and before joining the workforce in construction section, I never knew what is a Planner? I even thought that it is not important and the most important thing is to make the right drawings and do it right on site, that’s it. I never knew that the efforts of all the project team might go different ways and every one might be working in a different direction if they are not planned correctly. I also never knew that to be a planner you have to study for it or it was just initiative. I always thought that all I have to do is to learn commercial software such as Primavera P6 and that’s it, I will be professional. I also never knew that there is a lot of knowledge, skill and, books about planning. I always thought what these books are going to write. I was exactly like many of you. The importance of perfect planning and scheduling to any project has valuable benefits to the project. I have seen how mega construction projects fail not due to poor construction methodology but due to no proper planning and scheduling. Learn in this course to produce a full construction project plan and schedule, and manage construction projects.\nSeeing all of that I was lucky enough to meet one of the professional planners in my first working years in the construction industry. I have decided that I would pursue the career of planning and started studying management and contract administration that took 3 years to complete 2 professional degrees and then to be certified from PMI as a Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) and AACE International as a Planning and Scheduling Professional (PSP) and read a lot of books. What initiated this course is this. I was really looking for some kind of help, a summary of all the books out there. I was looking for a guide. I wanted something to be special and include all the information that was scattered everywhere. Something that I could refer to, and because the professional planners are not much so this type of info is not anywhere. That’s why the course was created to fill this gap and help you to achieve what you want. If you ever think that planning is JUST using software, then this course is exactly what you want. It is to show you that the last thing you want is the software. The software acts as a tool where you use to create the output you require. The tool will never help you to find the inputs even if you are the best one in the world in using this tool. SO that’s why we are here to make you UNDERSTAND PLANNING AND SCHEDULING.\nThe course is divided to two main sections to take you to be the professional you wanted to be. The first section is to make you understand the project management fundamentals, the different knowledge areas and interaction with planning and the second is then taking you from having a general knowledge scattered there and there to a more organized way of thinking and in order. Your first section ends at the lecture named “Your Road to Your Profession” and all the excitement starts from here. Up to this point, the course is developing you and giving you the basic knowledge for becoming the planning and scheduling professional.\nFrom here Section 2 begins and you are going to get the information as a professional would do. You will know what is planning and scheduling with the exact steps to produce the perfect plan and schedule. You are going to know what is planning and what is scheduling, what are the considerations, constraints and the inputs for each stage. Each lecture is made to be easily reverting to later on whenever you need it in your lifetime. Lectures are made fun and as explaining simply to make you get the most with a summary at the end of the major lectures. Make sure to preview the lectures before enrolling. Scheduling is the art of making a schedule that is realistic and gets the buy-in from the team. Scheduling is done right after considerable studies have been done in the planning. As the main instructor of the course is a construction professionals, there are a lot of examples on construction projects\nThere is no other course even similar to that course. It is a guide and a guru in the planning and scheduling field. It has been done with care to add a value to you. At the end even if you wish to get recognized by one of the prestigious institutions as a professional planner there are exams to help you practice before going to the real exam.\nIf you have ever investigated the reasons behind the failed projects, You would most probably find that neither planning nor scheduling is given much care.\nUpon completion of this course, you will realize how any project will extremely benefit with the right planning and scheduling application.\nIf you wish to pass the Scheduling Professional Exam from PMI (PMI-SP) or the Planning and Scheduling Professional Exam (PSP) from AACE International, this course will be your Definitive Guide.\nLearn to love planning and scheduling, and apply it as a pro.\nCovering Topics:\nPlanning, Project Planning, Planning Professional, Scheduling, Project Scheduling, Construction Planning, Construction Scheduling, Construction Time management, Construction Schedule, Construction time schedule, Construction Project Management, Planning and Scheduling Professional (PSP) Exam from AACE International, Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) Exam from PMI, Planning Course, Scheduling Course, Planning and Scheduling Course, PSP Exam, PMI-SP Exam, PSP  exam preparation course, PMI-SP exam preparation course.",

I am a beginner, I just started exploring Agile and Scrum, and after this course I feel like I'm ready to implement things. Thank you so much. Great work!” – Dubravka\n“The course structure is a lot more than I was expecting regarding features. I can also make notes during the video without pausing or falling behind. I'm […] impressed with how the sections are broken down and have been placed into chronological order to help with understanding.” – Laura\n“Through my Agile journey, this is one of the top courses I have taken. Why? I enjoy this course because it goes over a large scheme of topics that are specific and useful, but also given to the learner in bite sized pieces.. This course is especially helpful if you are working in an Agile Team or looking to implement Agile into a team. I have a much clearer understanding on the ceremonies, structure of a team, team responsibilities and reasoning behind different pieces of software, such as Jira. I have gained a lot of knowledge from the course, quizzes, and activities that Jeremy and Vivek put together. I can absolutely see myself implementing what I have gained from this course into my team and future teams. Thanks for creating an easy to follow course!!” - Meghann\n\n\nLearn how Agile works as well as how it fits into the world of Business Analysis\nThis course is taught by two instructors, to ensure you get total coverage of the subject.\nJeremy Aschenbrenner (The BA Guide) is an expert in the Business Analysis field who will help you understand the part Agile plays in the Business Analyst role…\nVivek Khattri (The Agile Coach) is a highly experienced Agile practitioner and trainer whose expertise will give you a comprehensive understanding of Agile, Agile Mindset, and different Agile frameworks and practices…\nAnd together, not only will our varying perspectives give you a 360-degree understanding of Agile fundamentals, our varied content formats will enhance your learning experience and help you retain the concepts you learn.\n\n\nLet’s hear from some more students:\n“I was certified as a Scrum Master over a decade ago and had been away from using scrum in a product management role for several years. This course helped me quickly regain an overview of the key principles and remind me of all of the artifacts and other key practices to put scrum to use again. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand Scrum or Kanban.” – John\n“Training by Jeremy and Vivek was awesome. They were able to explain in detail about all the concepts which will help anyone to understand and try to implement these practices. The good thing about Jeremy is his technique to break into pieces and explaining to avoid confusion. Look forward to learning more from you guys in the future lectures.” - Venkatesh\n\n\nWhat’s included in the course?\n- High-Quality Video Lectures break down the complex terms and confusing Agile jargon to ensure you get a concrete understanding of the items being discussed\n- Downloadable Handouts help you to enhance your understanding and retention of the key concepts\n- Quizzes and Activities validate your learning and help to point out areas that should be reviewed for full comprehension\n- 1-on-1 Support means that any confusion or questions you have can be addressed and cleared up easily (no more frantically googling trying to figure out what your course instructor means).\n- Lifetime Access with NO Expiration so you can learn at your own pace, and come back at any time you feel unsure or are in need of a refresher\n\n\n“Not only the theoretical part associated to the Scrum Framework is good, but Jeremy and Vivek's experience, that is invaluable, thanks for that guys! [...] Jeremy and Vivek explained the terms and concepts in a logical and simple order way so it was much much easy to me to catch on all these concepts once and for all. Congrats to both!” – Silvia\n“While not 100% new to Agile, it had been some time since I worked in the environment so as a refresher this course is perfect. I also feel this would be a great course for beginners. The videos are clear and easy to listen to, with a good pace. I like the inclusion of printable material as it is true, when you write something down, you remember it easier. Well done Vivek and Jeremy.” - Shelly\n\n\nWhat ELSE is included in the course?\nAnd of course, anyone who has studied one of Jeremy’s courses before will know, it simply wouldn’t be a course by The BA Guide if I didn’t include some value-packed bonus material!\nHere’s what you get as complimentary extras with the Agile Fundamentals course:\n- The Agile Principles Handout and Infographic\n- Sample User Stories\n- Scrum Terms Worksheet\n- Scrum Terms Retention Worksheet\n- Checklist for starting Kanban with your team\n- Digital Kanban board setup instructions\n- Agile Word Search\n- Agile Terms Crossword Puzzle\n\n\nStill not convinced?\nAnd if you’re still not sure – here’s my promise to you:\nThis course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee! That means, if you aren’t completely satisfied with your purchase, I’ll give you a refund – no questions asked!\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a working understanding of the fundamentals of Agile as well as its most popular frameworks, setting you up to be the agile, adaptive Business Analyst every modern organization needs.\nAs one of my favorite ancient Chinese proverbs says, “when the winds of change blow, some build walls, others build windmills”.\nWith disruptive technology evolving at a faster rate than ever before, the winds of change are blowing.\nHard.\nSo, if you’re ready to build windmills, enroll today and get started learning the fundamentals of Agile.",

      "description": "Welcome,\nWhy PMP Maths is important\nIn the PMP Exam out of 200, there are almost 30-40 Questions that involve Mathematical Formulas, Equations and numerals. So even if you are not good at Maths you just cannot ignore them.\nPMBok Guide has loads of different formulas related to Earned Value Management, Critical Path Method, Activities duration and cost estimates, Risk Management, Project Selection Methods, Communications Channels, Decision Tree Diagram, Expected Monetary Value etc\nSimilarly, it has loads of acronyms associated with Mathematical Formulas i.e. EV, AC, EAC, SPI, ETC, TCPI, EVM, PERT, BCR, IRR, NPV etc\nThis is something that is not easy to master just by reading PMBok Guide or some other textbook.\nAt the same time, it's very important Understanding the concept and Logic behind Formula. Just take the example of the Point of Total assumption formula even if you memorize the Formula and you don’t understand what it means by Ceiling Price, Target Price then you will not be able to extract these values from questions in the exam.\nWhy to Take my Course\nSince PMP Exam and PMBok Guide are already very dry and boring so ideally, you don’t want a course that is just a Powerpoint Slideshow readout where Instructor is reading the Screens. This is nearly the same experience you have reading a book yourself.\nThis is where my course is different, I will explain all concepts in detail in interactive video-based style lectures on this whiteboard where.\nI will make sure this “Hard Math” is simplified in concepts and gives you detail regarding the background logic of the formulas using simple real-world examples. That makes it easy to remember.\nHow the Course is Structured\nI have structured this course in a way that first I will explain all formulas in detail in lectures then I will show you how to solve sample Exam questions and lastly there will be a quiz so that you can assess your knowledge.\nWhat is covered in this Course?\nCover all \"Earned Value Management\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in PMP Exam\nCover all \"Critical Path Method \" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in PMP Exam\nCover all \"Activities Cost and Duration Estimates\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in PMP Exam\nCover all \"Communication Channels\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in PMP Exam\nCover all \"Decision Tree Analysis\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in PMP Exam\nCover all \"Expected Monetary Value \" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in PMP Exam\nCover all \"Project Selection Methods\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in PMP Exam\nCover all \"Point of Total Assumption\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in the PMP Exam\nWhat's done for this course\nI have spent plenty of time brainstorming and researching to make this course as simple as possible.\nI have gone through the whole PMBOK Guide and covered each and every Mathematical formula in this course even if it simple formula like a standard deviation that is P – O /6 so this course will be enough to cover the Mathematical part of the PMP Exam.\nTrust me this Course is a Treasure and no one did this topic like this before Udemy.\nAfter taking this course, I can guarantee you, that you would not need to forcefully dump your brain with so many formulas rather you would be to able conceptualize the Formulas to remember them forever.\nStill, in case you change your mind, you have Money Back Guarantee So you have nothing to lose.",

I mean, seriously - come on. Just click on the “Take this course\" button. It’s no brainer with the risk-free, mega-generous 30-day money-back guarantee. Just do it! Enroll now and start to learn. You are gonna love it!\nIn case you are still here…\nI want to tell you my story.\nI discovered “Project” twenty years ago when a colleague whispered in my ear about this “awesome software package” and revealed a shiny, glossy shrink-wrap box from his desk drawer.\nAfter a quick look at the list of benefits that it could provide to you, I almost jumped with excitement and danced around the office.\nIt was a project manager’s dream come true.\nThink about it…\nAutomatic task scheduling\nDynamic task durations\nKeep track of resource assignments\nSpecify task dependencies\nReschedule the whole project instantly\nCreate Gantt charts\nAs you can imagine, all of that was like music to my ears. I wanted to install and learn it immediately.\nSo, I grab a copy, put it in and power it up. My whole body shakes with anticipation. And…\nIt looks mighty-similar to Excel.\nI go, “Sweet! I already know Excel, this will be a breeze - easy-peasy to learn instantly”.\nBy that time, I had already earned a reputation of a computer wiz who does not need to take a course to learn software. (It was even before my training career.)\nAnd I begin to learn MS Project with unbridled, white-hot enthusiasm.\nAnd then…\nLike a bucket of ice-cold water the reality hits. It turns out that MS Project is different from other software packages that I had used before.\nIt does things behind the scenes that surprise you. Nothing works the way you think - “logically”.\nAll of my assumptions get flushed down the toilet. I squander so much time on it that there is hardly any left for project management.\nMy eyes were hurting from staring at lines and lines of project data. My mind was ready to explode. My whole body would start itching the instant I saw another Gantt chart.\nAnd the worst part…\nMy computer-genius reputation was being murdered. It almost made me sick to my stomach as the paralyzing fear started to creep under my skin.\nThat’s when I told myself, “Slow down! There is a better way. You feel like a blind kitten. Stop this intuitive-learning nonsense and take a training course right now.”\nAnd I did.\nAs a matter of fact, I perused every single piece of instruction that I could get my hands on including great books and video courses. Plus, I met some more experienced users (there were not too many back then) who gave me their insights and shared their “secret” world-class techniques.\nWhich I promptly translated to my own situation and instantly improved my scheduling workflow.\nAs a result, I did manage to conquer MS Project. It was not easy, but I can’t describe the energizing sense of accomplishment it provides.\nOn my MS Project learning journey over the years, I was painstakingly collecting ideas, thoughts, tips and techniques fundamental to scheduling and problem-solving success with this powerful app.\nWhich is great news for you.\nBecause in this easy-to-follow tutorial I am just about to gently lead you step-by-step through your own MS-Project learning experience.\nAs you work through the course, you’ll quickly learn the exact strategies that helped me and will help you harness Project and get back in control of your scheduling.\nMy learning curve was steep as Mount Everest.\nYours will be smooth and intellectually pleasant, so you can enhance your Microsoft Project game immediately.\nI have accumulated a treasure chest of shrewd tactics, processes, tips and tricks which I’ll reveal to you in this course.\nAs soon as you begin the course, you’ll quickly grasp and become comfortable with the user interface and various important considerations when working in Project.\nAs you go through the course, You’ll learn that MS Project success is not simply about your ability to learn software.\nIt’s about your level of comfort with the essential practical project-management concepts. Like critical path, work breakdown structure, resource types and resource leveling, etc.\nAs you learn in this course, you’ll accumulate your own collection of favorite tactics and techniques and get multiple benefits.\nSome of the benefits are:\nBenefit 1: Become efficient in managing lists of tasks in Project.\nBenefit 2: Fine-tune your project plans with custom project calendars.\nBenefit 3: Speed up your scheduling by using task relationships and dependencies.\nBenefit 4: Get to understand recurring tasks in MS Project\nBenefit 5: Control your schedule by task constraints and task deadlines.\nBenefit 6: Use Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to bring sanity to multi-project environment.\nBenefit 7: Simplify your scheduling and communication with custom views and tables.\nBenefit 8: Become adept at task types (Fixed Duration, Fixed Work, Fixed Units)\nBenefit 9: Understand the behavior of the effort-driven scheduling.\nBenefit 10: Learn how to understand and profit from the Critical Path Method.\nSince my early days of teaching, I earned a reputation as a great teacher and a problem solver. Folks like to learn from me because I can explain complex things in such an easy and clear way so even a child can comprehend them.\nThat’s exactly why, when you enroll in this course, you should expect crystal-clear, easy-to-understand explanations and instructions.\nFrankly, I am a bit envious. I wish I had this tremendous learning opportunity when I was just getting started.\nI am confident that you’ll experience instant results delivered by this course.\nThat’s why I invite you to click on the “Take this course\" button, secure your lifetime access now and begin to learn.\nYou are going to love it.\nEnjoy!\nIgor Ovchinnikov",

      "description": "Earn the most recognized consultant certification in professional services - PSCC-1. This course prepares you for the PSCC-1 exam which can be taken through the PS Principles website for USD $99.\n\nThe Seven Principles of Professional Services, by Shane Anastasi, is a practical framework for the delivery of successful customer-facing project implantation consultants.  Applicable to project managers, consultants, solution architects and developers, this class is a guide on how to take your technical skills and turn them into proactive customer leadership that results in more successful projects, happier customers and a more enjoyable experience as a career consultant.\nWith more than 10,000 books of the Seven Principles of Professional Services sold, you can check out the reviews of this framework at Amazon or our PS Principles website. In use by thousands of consultants globally, this framework is the benchmark for how to deliver quality consulting services to paying customers.\nThe course outline is based on the Seven Principles of Professional Services which outlines everything a consultant needs in order to succeed in the field:\nPrinciple #1: Adapt to Your Environment\nIn this principle we will teach how a consultant needs to \"Read\" the project environment in order to adapt to it. The state of the SOW, the pre-sales cycle and the type of customer all have an impact on how a consultant should go about delivering a service.\nPrinciple #2: Always Know What \"Done\" Looks Like\nWe will then look at project scope and the dynamics that occur when consultants get too focused on the detail and lose sight of the big picture. We will teach a method we call Prescriptive Escalation that helps consultants use their existing technical expertise to lead the customer to the desired adoption of technical best practices when considering business solution options.\nPrinciple #3: Manage Expectations\nIn order to manage expectations, we have to know what they look like. This principles teaches the Anatomy of a Project Expectation and explains how we can proactively manage them more effectively.\nPrinciple #4: Have Difficult Conversations Early\nA project's success depends on how well it holds difficult conversations. This principle teaches a basic framework of empathy, Understanding and Resolution that helps a consultant guide a customer through a difficult conversation.\nPrinciple #5: Think F.A.A.S.T. for Quality\nConsultants are often measured by the quality of their service, but this always done in hindsight. This principle looks at how you can determine quality in real-time to make sure that as you deliver your service, you can get a pretty good idea if it is being done with quality.\nPrinciple #6: Participate in the Collective Wisdom\nTo maximize our value as consultants we are free to exploit the collective wisdom for our customer's benefit. To do that we need to be able to identify and protect the collective wisdom as well as recognize the myriad of ways that we can out it to use.\nPrinciple #7: Engage in Your Career\nConsulting is a challenging career. It is one of the few jobs were consultants spend more time working for the paying customer than they do with their employer. To that end, we provide consultants with a view of their ongoing skill progression within the field as well as provide tips and tricks on how to deal with burnout while also keeping themselves engaged!\nPrinciple-Led Consulting\nWe wrap the class up with a video exercise that shows how the principles work in the real world as well as ask you to identify violations of the principles as they are delivered in a consultant-customer interaction. After some final guidance on how to move forward, you are done and ready to deliver success to your paying customers.\nFor further inquiries drop us an email by searching for PS Principles online (no email addresses allowed in these windows apparently :-).",

I have had the pleasure of working with Oualid for the POPM practice exam and it has been an incredible experience. From the start, Oualid's deep understanding of SAFe Agile method was evident. I was having anxiety attacks because I failed the POPM test once. Oualid gave me tricks on how to study and he helped calmed my nerves. I suffer from test taking anxiety. It was Oualid's personal approach that truly made a difference. Oualid possesses a rare combination of patience and encouragement. He knows when to offer a word of encouragement. His tailored coaching strategy not only improved my testing skills but also instilled a deeper sense of confidence. I highly recommend this course if you want to pass the POPM exam!- Liz G.\n5 stars: I HIGHLY recommend this course, 5 out of 5.

Go for it! - Mohammad Ali R.\n5 stars: I don't know the reason why the general rate is 4.7. It should be 5.0. And I don't understand so many people \"wrong with life\", bad mood, come here and give 1, 2, 3, 4 of rate. They think the instructor has the owe to do the exam in their place. Is it?

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nNowadays, project managers have plenty of apps and software that support their work on a daily basis. Nevertheless, Excel still remains an important tool used to estimate the costs and benefits of the project. In some cases, Excel can be used to manage the project. In this course, I will teach how to use fast and efficiently Excel as a Project Manager.\nIn the course, you will learn the following things:\nEssential Excel functions that will be useful during your work as a Project Manager\nHow to conduct cost-benefit analysis using Excel\nHow to select projects using Excel\nHow to create and use rankings in Excel\nHow to create Gantt Charts, dashboards, and project cards in Excel.\nHow to summarize progress in Excel\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from the Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who are now Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that, my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 315 000 students, including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excel files, as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures, so as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nProject Managers will have to use Excel in a different way than Analysts. Moreover, in some cases, you cannot use more advanced tools for project management as your team is obsessed with Excel. Project Sponsor will also ask you to create dashboards, Gantt charts, and a summary of the results of projects. Therefore, I have decided to make this course that will help students work fast and efficiently in Excel before and during projects. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to prepare and manage efficiently any projects with the help of Excel.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Project Manager, you have to have a pretty decent understanding of Excel. That is why I highly recommend this course to Project Managers, especially those who have to report to the Steering Committee the results of many projects. The course will help you become an Excel expert at the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience, as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that, thanks to the course, you will learn:\nEssential Excel functions that will be useful during your work as a Project Manager\nHow to conduct a cost-benefit analysis using Excel\nHow to select projects using Excel\nHow to create and use rankings in Excel\nHow to create Gantt Charts, dashboards, and project cards in Excel.\nHow to summarize progress in Excel\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is currently divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little introduction to the course, as well as some general information on how the course is organized\nHow to merge data from different sources. In this section, we will see how we can use essential functions to merge data from different sources. You will need them not only to analyze data but also to summarize results and create reports for the Steering Committee\nTo-do lists in Excel. In the next section, I will discuss how you can create an easy-to-navigate to-do list in Excel. I will show you some hacks that will turn the to-do list into an effective tool for efficient project management.\nCost-Benefit Analyses in Excel. As a Project Manager, you will quite often have to see whether the project makes sense or not. That’s why I will explain to you how to create a cost-benefit analysis. We will look at useful frameworks, and we will apply them to case studies.\nHow to create a Project Charter using Excel. In this brief section, I will show you how to create a project charter and a project card in Excel.\nHow to use the IF function and what you can do instead? The IF function is not always the best choice. That’s why in this section I will show you what other, more flexible functions you can use instead.\nGantt Charts in Excel. In this brief section, I will show you how to create a Gantt chart in Excel.\nHow to create a dashboard in Excel. In this brief section, I will show you how to create a dashboard in Excel.\nRankings. In some cases, you may also need to present different options to solve specific problems. Your Supervisor will expect you to somehow rank those options. That’s why in this section, I will show you how to create rankings in Excel.\nProject selection in Excel. In the last section, we will see how you can select which projects should be started. We will look at strategic, portfolio, and bottleneck approaches.\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\n1. Useful frameworks and techniques\n2. Analyses shown in the course\n3. Additional resources\n4. Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies\n5. Links to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nHow to prepare a cost-benefit analysis\nHow to create a dynamic dashboard in Excel\nHow to create a Gantt chart in Excel\nCreate a ranking of different options\nSelect projects using Excel\nUse Pivot Tables and Excel Tables\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nProject Managers\nManagers\nStartup Founders",

      "description": "\"Wow, this is great stuff.  If anyone ever asks you 'What does a Project Manager do?' direct them to this course.\" – Leah Henig.\nWould you like to give your project management career a three decade shortcut?  Brought to you by the President of the Institute For Practical Project Management (IFPPM), the instructor has managed projects for more than 30 years, from just a few thousand dollars to $55M, and worked in senior roles on projects up to $3B.  Based on this experience, this course describes the ten most important factors that contribute to project success.  The course will make these learnings yours, jumpstarting your success.   Ten short videos describe:\nThe Magic Of Accountability.  How to leverage the power of accountability to give you the *authority* you need to ensure project success.  Includes the magic sentence that maximizes the probability of the organization giving you what you need.\nThe Importance Of The WBS.  How the work breakdown structure (WBS) makes everything else in PM easy.  Includes a real life story of how, as a very junior lead, I once got a senior and rather aggressive team to become WBS believers.  Also includes a real WBS my team prepared for a $140M aerospace project.\nThe Power Of Process.  The reason best practice process can solve almost any problem, no matter how complex.  With an example of why the precedence diagram is your most important PM tool, even more important than the Gantt chart.  Includes the real precedence diagram for the same $140M aerospace project.\nPlanning The Risk Budget.  How a well planned risk budget makes the entire PM life-cycle work.  With eight common risks you should always consider including in your risk register.  Why you should focus on managing only the top ten risks.  And a download of a professional risk register template in Excel.\nManaging The Risk Budget.  Hard won, real life tips on how to best manage the risks once underway.  The rule of thumb for how much risk budget you should have as your project proceeds.  And the show-stopping sentence that enables you to keep as much risk budget as possible when under pressure to give some up.\nBackfitting Scenarios When Needed.  How scenario-based acceptance testing helps convince your customer the project will do what they need *and* signs off the requirements at the same time.  With a real-life story of how backfitting scenarios once helped ensure the success of my $20M system integration project.\nMake Friends With Procurement.  A real, slightly embarrassing story about why it is so important to formally close your procurements to prevent additional spending even by mistake.  And why the PM should make friends with all the supporting departments to make their job much easier.\nThe Top 3 Drivers Of Project Success.  A useful, true story about a PM that made all three of the most common mistakes on a single project.  And how the three most important drivers of project success could have saved him.\nFocus On The Success Path.  The over-riding importance of the success oriented mindset that leaders should broadcast to their team.  With a real example of how my team was able to shorten a 3.5 year schedule to 3 years because we believed there was a solution before we knew what it was, and how we did it.\nThe Benefits Of Telling The Truth.  Why the truth is the most solid ground.  With a real story about how repeatedly telling the truth as a young project manager, when my boss obviously did not want to hear it, ended up being the best thing I could do for the project, my team, and my boss.  And ended up getting me promoted me to be functional manager of a 55 person organization.\nMaking these lessons yours will greatly increase the probability of your project management success, giving you a 30 year career shortcut.  With PDF downloads of all the key points.  The course also earns you two Professional Development Units (PDU’s) in the Business Acumen (Leadership) category.\nInstructor\nWilliam Stewart is President of the Institute For Practical Project Management (IFPPM), and a PMI certified Project Management Professional (PMP) who has managed projects for more than 30 years, from just a few thousand dollars to $55M, and worked in senior roles on PM teams on projects up to $3B.  He has managed projects in the domains of system integration, software development, business process, construction, real estate, and others.  Internationally recognized, he has spoken twice as a keynote speaker at International Project Management Association (IPMA) conferences.  He has delivered this course live more than 330 times to more than 3,300 people.  Previously, he worked for aerospace, government, academia, and founded and led the cloud computing company Cirrus Computing.  He has deep experience with project management, risk management, systems integration, software engineering, and negotiating.  He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science for discovery of an algorithm that builds multi-dimensional geodesic domes in optimum space and time, which to his knowledge has never been used for anything practical.\nStudent Feedback\n\"Decades of valuable project management experience.\" - Thibaut Lefebvre\n\"Project management comes to life!\" - April Bly-Monnen\n\"Great information for all PMs both new and old,

We will start this course with a brief overview of project portfolio manager’s responsibilities and the role of portfolio management within the PMO. We will then focus on the key aspects of the portfolio management process. Additionally, we will examine the history of project portfolio management (PPM), the three pillars of PPM, the distinction between project management and project portfolio management, and why bad things happen when organizations fail to utilize project portfolio management. We will then study Agile project portfolio management, the necessary core values, agile project processes, and how they are different vs. a more traditional approach, and how to select the most appropriate approach depending on the situation.\nWhy do companies like Apple, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson manage to deliver successful products to the markets year after year? And why do the majority of other organizations can’t replicate their success no matter how hard they try? This workshop is dedicated to the complicated and somewhat enigmatic topic of delivering successful products and services to the marketplace by selecting the best projects for implementation, proper assessment of the company’s throughput capacity and having a good grasp on project management.",

This course can help identify a variety of requirements gathering techniques that you can use to help tease out those customer wants and needs.\nConversely, working with customers who know what they want, but have not done any due diligence to know that they want that, can be equally frustrating! This course can help identify a variety of requirements gathering techniques that you can use to ensure the team create the right solution.\nSome of these techniques you might already know and use. Then, the sections for them can be nice refreshers of what to be doing and what to be looking out for. We all get into some bad habits now and then. It’s nice to be reminded of what we should be doing.\nOther techniques might be new for you. When your “go to” techniques aren’t working with a customer for some reason (who knows why?), you can pull these techniques out of your tool box and try them out. Sometimes it just takes a different perspective or a different way of looking at things that make things click.\nFor each technique there are exercises to practise before trying them out on a real project. I truly believe it helps to gain the confidence first and then start to apply.\nThere are also several additional resources to help you get started with the techniques.",

      "description": "The Project Management Office or the PMO as it's succinctly known, is the role or the department within an organization that is responsible for all things project management. It makes sure that the right things are happening at the right time by the right people in the right way. The person responsible for the PMO is the PMO Leader, with official titles varying from PMO Director to VP of Project Management and everything in between.\nThere are plenty of resources out there for other sections and offices in a corporation, but PMOs are often the neglected middle child – with everyone fighting turf wars over funding and finishing their projects, nobody works to coordinate projects and keep them on track.\nThey’re often treated like a layer of bureaucracy that comes between the company and its goals – but a well-managed PMO can be the opposite.\nI often come across many people who:\nare not aware of the differences between a project manager and a PMO leader\nare project managers within PMOs, haven't had the best of experiences with them, and are looking for better avenues\ndon't realize the major boost a PMO leadership role can provide to their career (& financial) growth\nwould like to become PMO leaders one day but are unsure of the career path to get there\nask about the skills, mindset, experience that they can feel confident with when pursuing the role\nwonder how to prepare and position themselves (& their resumes) when finding the role\nget caught up in finding the silver bullet when settling in and setting up a PMO\nstruggle when explaining the benefits of PMO and seeking buy-in from executive leadership and stakeholders\nseek proven roadmaps that guide to the successful setup and evolution of PMOs\nIf you can associate with any of these, then you've come to the right place.\nI invited some of the leading PMO, project management, strategy, and change management experts, authors and practitioners from around the world to a summit that I founded and hosted: the PMO Virtual Summit.\nThis course includes all the presentations (both audio/video and PDF versions) and bonus materials (tools, templates, eBooks and other resources) from the PMO Virtual Summit.\nIn addition to receiving educational insights and tools from me, this \"one-stop PMO learn fest\" also features thought leaders including:\nDr. Wanda Curlee (has helped Project Management Institute [PMI] prepare certification exams)\nMark Price Perry (pioneer of the Business-Driven PMO)\nBill Dow (author of multiple PMO books)\nChris Croft (has taught the most hours of project management in the world)\nand many, many more\nIn this course, you'll discover:\nDoes it make sense for a company to have a PMO if its project development is nascent or non-existent?\nHow to make the case for your office to higher-ups in management – to get more resources, time, and allies in your company.\nHow to make the case for YOURSELF as leader – knowing yourself, your place in the organizational culture, and getting a great role.\nHow to make your case as a PMO leader when your bosses want a totally different methodology!\nThe advantages (and follies) of a “virtual PMO” – working with people across your organization and around the world.\nWithout executive investment and understanding and support, your PMO won’t have a future – how to cultivate and keep support with stakeholders QUICKLY.\nHow to survive the politics of establishing your new office – both internal and external.\nHow to save your PMO when a mistake and you in hot water. Maybe you’re already here! You’ll discover how to commit triage and salvage your department and your reputation after a string of defeats.\nWhat are the WRONG things to focus on as you’re getting started?\nAnd that's not even close to everything you'll learn and see.\nThere’s so much diversity in the stories and battle-tested expertise of these experts, you’re virtually guaranteed to find something here that you relate to, that applies to your personal situation and needs.\nJust by taking this course, you’ll be ready to rock – with a ton of strategies, insights, ideas and action steps you need to become a professional PMO leader and KEEP your place in the company.\nYou’ll discover the peculiar strategies and success shortcuts that skyrocketed 20+ respected speakers and authors to the top.\nThey’ve done it all – wrestled with unhappy executives in the C-branch and underwhelming results. They’ve been tied up with massive amounts of reports and status updates that kept them from doing their jobs properly – or at all! They’ve struggled running operations on a day to day basis – but they’ve come out ahead.\nAnd now, this course compresses decades of experience and best strategies for you.",

      "description": "Projects are the way of doing business and organisations need skilled people who can manage them and operate effectively in a project environment.  As more organisations adopt Project Management as the tool for the implementation of work, these skills are becoming ever so in demand.\nUnderstand and Apply Cost Management.\nThis program has been drawn from International Project Management Best Practice and developed to meet the requirements of the relevant unit of competence within Nationally Recognised Certificate IV in Project Management Practice in Australia.\nThis course is delivered in a practical real world context and whilst it is supported by theory it focusses on delivering the practical skills you can apply directly to your projects.\nIf you are managing projects, working in a project team or affected by projects in one way or another this course is for you.  You will gain a practical insight into scope management exploring the following:\nIntroduction into Cost Management:\nKey Terminology and the importance of Cost Management\nUnderstanding key concepts; Tax, Depreciation and others\nIncrease knowledge of fundamental cost management concepts\nHow to Estimate the Project's Cost\nUnderstand estimates and the factors which affect them\nUnderstand Top down estimation\nUnderstand Bottom up estimation\nUnderstand contingency\nHow to budget the Project\nUsing the WBS to develop budgets\nUsing different budgeting methods\nChecking cash flow\nIdentifying approval requirements\nHow to Monitor and Control Costs\nHow to develop an effective framework\nUsing the Cost Management Plan\nS-Curves\nDealing with variances\nHow to Review the Project's Cost\nReview the Project's Budget\nReport on cost effectiveness\nConduct lessons learned\nAt the end of this program you will have a practical, working understanding of how to manage the scope of the Project.  By completing the activities, you will have met most of the requirements of the Nationally Recognised unit: Apply project cost management techniques  (BSBPMG412) as part of the Certificate IV in Project Management.\nThe reason for developing the course\nI found that the resources provided to many students undertaking studies in Project Management were lacking.  They were either;\ntoo theoretical, which prevented students applying it to their workplaces;\nnot engaging, such as books or PDFs;\nhard to understand: using complex language to illustrate otherwise simple concepts; or\nincorrect, usually written by people without a true and practical understanding of the subject.\nOnline learning is difficult- I know, I am the worst online student.  As a result, I have designed this course to provide students with an additional resource to enhance their understanding of the topic.  The course is based upon strong theoretical foundations, but delivered in a practical way- so you can apply what you learn to better your projects.\nI have also tried to make the course engaging using a mix of visual and auditory delivery accompanied by tasks which you can use to test your knowledge and apply the concepts.  I have also tried to approach the subject in a casual way, which will hopefully make it a fun learning experience.\nI have tried to keep the language to its simplest form, explaining industry words as I progress through the course.  This will enable you to understand the vocabulary used in Project Management, without being confused by it.",

If you can’t convince the buyers - both economic buyers and influencers - that you and your team can navigate through their organization, then you can’t sell...either internally or externally. For any project to succeed, you MUST have a stakeholder engagement strategy. You can not be an effective project manager if you can't manage stakeholders.\n(And yes, you can self-report one PDU for your PMP® continuing education.)\n\nAll change management efforts - both internal and at client sites - require you to sell your ideas. The sales staff should be able to communicate the vision of how things could be, but you – the specialist or subject matter expert – will show the \"buyer\" how to get there. Expect questions like “How will this change impact my people?” You’ll hear, “How much of my people’s time will this implementation take?” Or some form of, “How will we convince [insert group here] that this is a good idea?\"  You must answer clearly and concisely, and a good stakeholders analysis will help you do so, both in the sales meeting and during your work with your customer. If your stakeholder engagement skills are weak, you will fail even if you're lucky enough to get the sale.\nThis course is designed for technical people and subject matter experts who are frequently in front of customers. Participants will learn 1) the logic and process for a robust stakeholders analysis 2) some tips to build stakeholder engagement, and 3) a stakeholder matrix and a template designed for presentations to senior management.",

Instead of getting bogged down by memorizing countless textbook pages, you'll be introduced to an honest, results-driven approach that has been proven in dozens of projects since 2007. Learn the secrets to organizing yourself while effectively motivating and communicating with others, which is the true key to successful project management.\nBridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice\nTraditional project management certifications such as PMP, PRINCE2, and IPMA often leave a disconnect between what's taught in the classroom and what's applicable in the real world. This course aims to bridge that gap by providing genuine advice and tools that help you set up your projects and deliver them on time and with quality. Drawing from the instructor's 16 years of experience and numerous certifications, you'll gain insights that will allow you to outperform many traditional project managers.\nA Course for a Diverse Range of Professionals\nWhether you're a Project Manager, Developer, Manager, Software Engineer, Team Lead, or Team Member, this course is designed to help you excel in your project work. By focusing on the practical aspects of project management and providing actionable advice, this course empowers professionals from various fields to achieve greater success in their projects. Don't let the traditional methods hold you back; join this course and unlock your full potential in project management.\nThis course is designed to give you genuine advice and tools to set up your projects and deliver them on time and in quality. I will tell you enough of my best practices to outperform most traditional project managers you know.\nI have been a project manager for around 16 years and delivered dozens of projects on time and in quality. I also took many classes / am certified on project management (PRINCE2) and other areas of expertise (i.e. ITIL, TOGAF).\nHowever, the problem is that I see huge gaps between theory and practice. In other words: In the seminar everything seemed so practical, and later it turned out it's not.\nThis course is for Project Managers, Developers, Managers, Software Engineers, Team Leads as well as Team Members who want to substantially succeed in their project work.",

      "description": "Understanding your customer is VITAL if you are to continue to provide them with a service or product that satisfies their needs and requirements. In an increasingly competitive and innovative marketplace, those companies that do not put their customers front and centre of their improvement efforts will be the ones left behind and, ultimately, won't be in the marketplace in the future. How can you improve your customer journey, your customer experience and how your customer views your products and service if you do not know what they are thinking?\nIn this course, we come at this from 2 angles. Firstly, identify how you can get customer data in front of you to start with. Secondly, what to do with that customer data once you have it. It is all about mapping this data, tracking it, cutting it up into segments etc. so you are truly aware of what your customer is thinking. We will cover the following:\n- What is Lean Six Sigma?\n- What does the concept \"Voice of the Customer\" actually mean?\n- Customer segmentation tool.\n- Types and sources of customer data tool.\n- Interviews tool.\n- Point of use observation tool.\n- Focus groups tool.\n- Surveys tool.\n- Kano Analysis tool.\n- Critical to Quality Tree tool.\nWe will explore what these tools are, how to conduct them and for those with which it can be applied, give LIVE demonstrations of how these tools work in practice.\nAt the end of this course you will understand clearly how to source data from your customers and what to do with this data for the benefit of your improvement efforts.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Risk Management Certification Program (PMI-RMP). The Program is SRM, PMBOK6 and  PMBOK7 aligned and includes the courses on Planning Risk Management, Identifying Risk, Analyzing Risk and Responding to Risk.\nThis course based on the Standard for Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects (SRM), the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide – Sixth Edition, and the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide – Seventh Edition is fundamental for obtaining the PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) certification.\nThese guides provide comprehensive knowledge on risk management theories, practices, and the latest project management methodologies essential for the certification.\nIn the Planning Risk Management section of this program on the project risk management knowledge area we're going to learn about how to plan for risks on a project to make sure that when negative things do happen, we're ready for them.\nThe Identifying Risk covers the inputs you need to look at in order to identify risks. And how to use several techniques, such as Data Analysis methods, like SWOT Analysis, and Assumption, and Constraint Analysis, to help you develop an effective risk register.\nIn the Analyzing Risk section, we'll examine the two risk analysis processes of the project risk management knowledge area, namely, perform qualitative risk analysis and perform quantitative risk analysis.\nThe Responding to Risk covers the final three processes in the project risk management knowledge area. Plan risk responses, implement risk responses and monitor risks. You'll learn about some common risk response strategies and how to monitor and control risks as they occur.\nAll instructional activities will earn you the necessary for PMI certification and credential maintenance if you already are a certified PMI Risk Management Professional or Project Management Professional.\nSo, if you are a project professional and you want to improve your risk management skills, this course is for you. If you are an entrepreneur, a student, a manager or, you just want to learn and develop risk management skills, this course is for you.\nNow, go ahead and press that \"Take this course\" button and see you on the inside!",

It includes:\nTypes of Costs – distinguishing between direct, indirect, fixed, variable, and overhead costs.\nEstimating Costs Tools and Techniques – such as analogous estimating, parametric estimating, bottom-up estimating, and three-point estimating.\nHandling Risk Reserves Costs – including contingency reserves for known risks and management reserves for unknown risks.\nCost of Quality (CoQ) – understanding how prevention, appraisal, and failure costs affect the overall budget.\nDocumenting the Basis of Estimates – ensuring transparency by recording assumptions, constraints, methods used, and confidence levels for each estimate.\n2. Determining the Project Budget\nThis part consolidates the cost estimates into an overall budget for the project. It includes:\nDeveloping the Cost Baseline – creating a time-phased budget that serves as a reference for measuring performance.\nEstimating Funding Requirements – determining how much money is needed and when it will be required during the project life cycle.\nFinalizing the Project Budget – integrating all elements, including reserves, and gaining approval from stakeholders or sponsors.\n3. Controlling Project Costs\nThe final part focuses on tracking, reviewing, and regulating project costs to keep them within the approved budget. It includes:\nUsing Earned Value Management (EVM) – a powerful technique that integrates cost, schedule, and scope to assess project performance.\nCalculating Key Indicators – such as:\nCost Performance Index (CPI) – efficiency of budget usage\nSchedule Performance Index (SPI) – efficiency of time usage\nCost Variance (CV) – difference between earned value and actual cost\nSchedule Variance (SV) – difference between earned value and planned value\nForecasting Project Costs – predicting future cost performance using different EVM-based scenarios (CPI = 1, CPI = Current, CPI & SPI = Current).\nTaking Corrective Actions – applying adjustments when variances occur to bring the project back on track.",

      "description": "Are you and your team exhausted and frustrated because you are juggling multiple projects and constantly task-switching? Does working this way make it difficult to understand progress or to feel a sense of purpose in your daily work? How often do you discover that what you delivered doesn't achieve desired outcomes? Does quality often get sacrificed under pressure to do more faster? If you are looking for a better way to approach complex work and deliver high value solutions, Scrum is the way.\nScrum done well enables business agility, which is essential in our unpredictable and rapidly changing world. Scrum is a framework that helps people productively and creatively solve complex problems and deliver greater value. Scrum enables you to deliver Increments of value working in short cycles. This approach helps you incorporate learning as you do the work, get feedback frequently to make sure you are on the right track, and respond quickly to change.\nI created this Udemy course for you - filled with my unique insights as a licensed Professional Scrum Trainer, Steward of the Professional Scrum Master (PSM) curriculum, and owner of an agility training and coaching business. I have taught over 1,300 students on 5 continents. I am co-author of the book Mastering Professional Scrum, published in 2019 by Pearson Addison-Wesley. I am also a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and started my career working in traditional project management, which gives me a unique perspective to help people understand the difference and make the transition to Scrum and agility if it makes sense for them.\nNote: This course is up-to-date with the 2020 Scrum Guide.\nScrum may have its roots in software, but it has been used well beyond software for decades. I designed the course to help you apply Scrum in any context - from operations to marketing, from projects and products to research and problem solving, and even running departments or entire organizations. I offer a wide range of examples to help you see how the concepts can be applied for different types of work.\nStudent Review --> \"This was a phenomenal course. Stephanie's lectures were fun to watch, and it's clear she knows her material. She spoke at a cadence that was easy to follow, and you can tell she's into what she's teaching. I found her guides to be very helpful and highly recommend signing up for her newsletter. I look forward to taking more courses from Stephanie in the future.\"\nThis course is built to help you learn Scrum the right way - in alignment with the official Scrum Guide and leveraging the foundational values and principles. Zero previous Scrum experience is required. In fact, it is often beneficial to have zero experience because you won't have as much to unlearn. In my experience, there are many misunderstandings and myths about Scrum that prevent teams from applying Scrum well and gaining the benefits of agility. This course can also serve as a great refresher and validation of knowledge for people who do have Scrum experience but little to no professional Scrum training.\nIn this course, you will learn to:\nIdentify the key differences between a traditional plan-driven approach and an agile value-driven approach\nShift your mindset towards an agile way of thinking\nDefine the roles, artifacts, and events of the Scrum framework, the importance of each one, and how they all fit together to maximize value delivery\nLeverage empiricism and the Scrum values to navigate challenges and maximize the benefits of Scrum\nDetermine when to use Scrum\nDefine and meaure value\nCreate and evolve a definition of \"Done\"\nBreak out of the mindset of focusing on tasks and deliverables and see opportunity to deliver value in entirely new ways\nRethink how you can iteratively and incrementally deliver value\nApply the Goldilocks Principle to Product Backlog Refinement\nMake the minimal decisions needed to get started with Scrum\nEstimate and forecast using agile techniques\nAvoid using velocity in the wrong ways\nLeverage an agile approach to managing budgets and schedules\nApply my model for improving your Scrum implementation (because there are no best practices when dealing with complex work)\nGet additional resources to go deeper in your learning\nAgility is essential in today's environment. Agility is the real competitive advantage. Teams and organizations must be nimble, creative, and resilient in order to effectively navigate complexity and thrive in a constantly changing world. Scrum is used by over 12 million people around the world. While Scrum does have its origins in software development, it has been used well beyond software for decades as more and more teams and organizations have realized their work is complex and their environment is unpredictable and rapidly changing. I offer a wide range of examples to help people understand the concepts and how to apply in their own context.\nThroughout the course, you will have opportunities to reflect on questions that will help bring the course concepts to life in your own context. I have included two canvases I use with my coaching clients that will help you start applying Scrum in your work environment. And for those of you who are eager to take your learning deeper, I'll guide you toward next steps.\nThis course is different because it is true to the Scrum Guide and Ken Schwaber's vision, and it is not prescriptive. Agile is not a silver bullet. Scrum is a framework - not a methodology - that leverages the power of a small, self-organizing team. The Scrum Team decides their process within the framework, and that process will evolve as they inspect and adapt, learn and grow.  There are no best practices in Scrum because we are dealing with complexity. Best practices only exist in simple environments. A lot of the information you find online and even what is delivered in training does not clarify what is required by Scrum versus what is an example or personal opinion. I aim to teach you the foundational knowledge you need to effectively navigate in your own context. I provide examples of helpful practices and advice from my own experience, however, I make clear distinctions and help you understand why you might use a practice and the benefits it can provide.\nWhen applied with discipline and intention, Scrum helps you confidently navigate complexity and uncertainty, deliver greater value, and thrive in a constantly changing world.\nAre you in for that?\nEnroll today and begin your Scrum journey with me!\n(Trust a former project manager and perfectionist... This can change your life!!  See you in the course!)",

This ACMP approach is called \"The Standard\" and aligns closely with the Project Management Institute's common approach to project management and is more easily adopted into existing project structures.\nThe OCM Strategy is crafted with high-level analysis and assessments. Detailed change management plans are built out in the OCM Plan, which is not covered in this course.\nThe course instructor, Kerstin Wade, has 10+ years of change management experience in large organizations.

I respect that.\nThe course has been carefully developed to only give you the essentials you must know to become a successful product owner. No Fluff...Not just boring theory... No wasting tens of hours of time learning abstract concepts that won't help you in the real world as a product owner.\nYou will learn how to actually start building a real product backlog for a consumer banking application using the techniques taught in this course.\nTime is money. That is why you don't need an 80+ hour course!\nWhy should you choose to learn becoming a product owner?\nIn today's global digital marketplace, software and digital products are in high demand.\nAnd, as a result, jobs as a product owner are in high demand and learning the skills to become a product owner will give you the edge in your career, even if you aren't a product owner but want to understand what it takes to build products using an agile approach.\n\nWill this course give me core product owner skills?\nYes it will. While this course isn't about getting a certification, understanding the concepts here will help you land your next job as a product owner and may strongly give you the skills to make getting certified much more easily.\nWhy should you take this course?\nThis course assumes no previous product ownership experience and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you how a product owner fits into an agile scrum team, to writing your own epics and user stories to develop your product. You will learn the core product owner skills you need to become job ready in just under a couple hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course to build upon what you've learned.\nIt's a one stop shop to learn how to become a complete product owner.

Strategies towards delivering digital products in a more streamlined way are changing and improving every day.\n\nA lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated. Learning older concepts on product ownership can be counter productive - you could will be learning the \"old way\" of doing things, rather than using current best practices.\n\nMake sure you check the last updated date on the page of any course you plan to buy - you will be shocked to see some have not been updated for years!\n\nThat’s why I’m always adding new, up-to-date content to this course at no extra charge.

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nManaging Consulting Projects is extremely difficult. You work in a hostile environment, long hours on difficult things. On top of that, the bill for your services for the customer is pretty high so he will want to squeeze out of you as much as possible. At the same time, his people may dislike you as you are an outsider who in their point of view pretends to know better.  Therefore, many Project Managers fail on deadlines or cannot deliver value for the customer. Luckily there is a way to do a consulting project on time, get your customer and the people happy with the result, as well as get well paid for your work. This course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in managing a consulting project. It is designed for project managers, especially those working in consulting. After finishing the course you will know:\nHow to prepare for the project to make your customer and your team happy as well as to finish the project much earlier than your competitors\nHow to create value for your customer\nHow to deliver the project within the budget and way ahead of deadlines\nHow to execute the project without having to work 7 days a week 15 hours a day\nHow to overdeliver and get buy-in from your customer\nHow to build a strong foundation for future projects\nWhat tools to use\nHow to be efficient as a team\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nAs I said, I not only managed and delivered consulting projects, but I was also on the receiving end. What always surprises me is that despite all the knowledge there is on managing projects, consultants time and again fail miserably and deliver something the customer doesn’t want or need, usually after the deadlines.  At the same time, I could not help noticing that I on the other hand was done with my work way ahead of time. Therefore, I decided to describe my approach so it can be used by others who face the same challenges. Thanks to this course you will become a priceless member of your company and you will outperform other project managers. It will help you land a job not only with consulting firms but also with private equities and businesses that need somebody to supervise projects (i.e. Project Management Officer).\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to be a top project manager you should implement my approach towards consulting projects. That is why, I highly recommend this course not only to project managers or consultants that have to manage projects but also to managers and directors working in the business.\n\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of tips, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you conduct the project. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to train your team and turn it into an effective machine\nHow to prepare the project in order to deliver value to the customer within the budget and deadlines\nHow to execute the project to make your customer and your team happy\nHow to finish the project and at the same time build the foundations for new cooperation\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into 6 sections. Currently, you will find the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course as well as some general info on projects.\nTeaching Phase. In the second section, I will explain the importance of teaching and how to implement it in your team or company. If you want to do fast, efficiently good projects you have to have the right kind of people. You can say that preparation for the consulting project starts with proper teaching. In this section, I will discuss how through teaching get good business analysts.\nPreparation Phase. Most consulting projects are done in a bad manner. A lot of things that should be done ahead of time are done during the project and this slows you down drastically and causes later on a lot of problems. If you prepare properly you can shorten the execution time, create more value, and earn more. In this section, I will show you how to prepare and what kind of tools to use.\nExecution Phase – Technical Tips. In section 4 I will show you some technical tips you should follow to make sure that you deliver value to      the customers within the deadlines\nExecution Phase – Tips regarding the relationships with the customer. In this section, we continue with tips on how to execute the project. This time around it will be more devoted to soft tips: how to treat people on the project to get great results.\nWrapping up the project. The way you finish the project is of utmost importance. In this section, I will show you how to finish the project to maximize the happiness of the customer with the results of the project as well as to create opportunities for new projects.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nAdditional tools shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nManage Consulting Project with your eyes closed\nFinish the project ahead of time and below the agreed budget\nCreate value for the customer that will help you sell new projects\nCreate finished products that can be reused on other projects\nPrepare yourself efficiently for the project\nCreate a dream team\nBecome a really efficient manager, working on a totally different level",

      "description": "It’s been said that project management is 90 percent communication – and it can certainly feel that way when you consider all the people you have to communicate with daily. Did you know that you can use Microsoft Excel to help you communicate more effectively, define your project charter, build out the project scope, and even the work breakdown structure? You sure can!\nIt’s paramount that project managers work with the project team to plan and define the project scope. Then, when the team is executing the project work, the project manager needs to monitor and control the work. Part of monitoring and controlling is to record what’s happening in the project. Based on this work performance data, you’ll process the project’s successes (and possibly failures) and report to the project stakeholders accordingly.\nMicrosoft Excel can help you with so much of that! In this course, we’ll explore many things that Microsoft Excel can do for project management. We’ll dive into formatting, charting, conditional formatting, and building a custom dashboard and report. If you don’t have more advanced project management software, that’s okay; you can do much of that business in Microsoft Excel.\nThis course is worth five (5) Professional Development Units with the Project Management Institute. Take this course at your leisure, learn more about Microsoft Excel and project management, keep your PMI certification, and most importantly, manage your projects with better control and communication.",

The PMBOK Guide is only one of many inputs for the exam. It's best to closely read the PMP Exam Content Outline (ECO) and know all of the domains, tasks, and enablers. This course walks you through the ECO in a fun and creative way. This is a course designed by expert Mike Griffiths and taught by leader Joseph Phillips.\n\n\nThe PMP exam is built around the concepts in the PMP Exam Content Outline - a must-read for all PMP candidates. But simply reading the PMP Exam Content Outline isn't enough for passing the exam - if it were, everyone would do it.  To pass the PMP exam, you need to fully understand all of the concepts of the PMP Exam Content Outline - and that's what this course helps you do.\n\n\nThis course is an excellent course to complement your existing study strategy or a good place to start studying. Either way, knowing exactly what you're tested on will help you better prepare to pass the PMP exam. In this course you'll learn:\n\n\nPeople - this domain accounts for 42 percent of PMP exam\nProcess - this topic is 50 percent of your PMP exam\nBusiness environment - this is 8 percent of your PMP exam\n\n\nWe will walk through the entire PMP Exam Content Outline and review each domain, task, and enabler you must be familiar with as you prepare to pass the PMP exam. This is an excellent foundational course as you prepare to pass, not just take the PMP exam.",

To do this, we will cover:\n- What is CI (its purpose, benefits and key methodologies)?\n- What are the main indicators that a CI Initiative is needed?\n- What are the main tools to deploy when building out a CI Initiative?\n- Exploring the importance of teams, communication and the toolkit.\n- Introducing key methodologies and concepts such as Lean & Six Sigma.\n- Understanding how to deliver CI in the right way, an effective way that will garner the highest impact.\nContinuous Improvement has the power to deliver big savings, big reductions in waste and improvements to quality, customer and employee satisfaction. Deliver the CI mind set right, and the rest will do the work for you. And focus on that phrase mind set! As much as CI is made up of a process, a toolkit and several methodologies (such as Lean Six Sigma) it will only be truly successful if the mindset of those embarking on CI is right.  By taking this course and delivering on the learnings, you will see the power of CI for you, your fellow colleagues and the wider organisation.",

This type of \"advanced\" course is usually 3 to 4 days long, with a certification at the end and a cost of more than $1.500.\nThe course I offer on Udemy is an \"essentials\" course, with about 1h of video content + about another hour of quizz. Usually learners take around 3 to 4 hours to complete it. It's a good first step that you can take to understand well how to start measuring and reducing CO2 emissions for your company.\nThe course is as condensed and as immediately actionable as possible. Concrete examples and exercises enable you to practice what you learned after each section.\n\n\nAfter taking it, you should have a clear view on how to conduct a CO2 inventory for your organization. The next step will be to dive in depth in a GHG accounting framework (GHG protocol, ISO 14064, etc) and take a training to know how to conduct an GHG inventory following that framework.\n\n\nIt covers the following topics :\n1. Introduction : global warming and the international framework on climate change\nUnderstand the enhanced greenhouse effet, its impact on global warming and the international framework on action against climate change\n2. CO2 inventory : What is it? Why doing one? How to do it?\nDefinition of the CO2 footprint / CO2 inventory of a company, overview of the ISO 14064-1 and GHGP frameworks and the different options for a company to realize its CO2 inventory\n3. Set organizational and inventory boundaries\nBefore starting to list sources, collect data and calculate emissions, it is necessary to take a moment to set the organizational and inventory boundaries, in a complete, transparent and coherent way.\n4. Identify emission sources and collect data\nGet to know the method for listing emission sources and starting to collect data before calculating the emissions for each source.\n5. Calculate emissions\nKnow how to calculate the CO2 emissions for a given source, using the appropriate activity data and emission factor\n6. Analyze results, set reduction targets and build an action plan\nAnalyze the inventory's results, set science-based reduction targets and build an action plan to reach them\n7. Manage emissions : monitoring and continuous improvement\nSet up a CO2 management and inventory continuous improvement system in your organization\n8. Reporting and external communication\nCommunicate in a proper way on your organization's CO2 emissions, reduction targets and action plan, avoiding greenwashing\n\n\n\n\n-",

But everyone in the team has his or her own understanding of what is important for the customer. The development manager insists on documenting each and every little detail, the marketing manager wants you to focus on sharing success stories from the customers, while the editor thinks you should focus on improving the language quality of the documentation. Meanwhile, everybody on the team just wants to take a couple of days off!\nSounds familiar?! Somehow all the expectations fall on you, right?!\n\"There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.\"\n-- Colin Powell\nHow can you balance all these conflicting requirements towards the documentation? How can you ensure that the customer interest is properly defended and you manage to really be the customer advocate?\n\n\nToday everybody speaks about project management, proper planning, and prioritization. But the entire project management training and up-skill happens after days and months of training and applying what you have learned on the job. Not to mention the cost! Simply finding the time to learn project management can be an overwhelming experience that requires time and serious commitment.\n\n\nIn this course, Jordan Stanchev (PMP #2174692, User Assistance Development Architect at SAP) with many years of experience in the field of technical writing, user assistance, and architecture will share the secrets of the project management framework that you can use to run the development of your software documentation with the team.\n\n\nJordan has been using the same approach to identify and prepare the delivery and successful publishing of numerous user assistance assets for software development projects, such as user guides, multimedia, and video assets.\n\n\nYou will learn:\nThe importance of meeting customer needs & how to properly identify and capture them\nHow to define the correct deliverables: should you use written software documentation; video, images, and infographics to guide your user?\nWhat is the healthy balance of deliverables for your project\nWhat is realistic to plan for\nThe steps to prepare a documentation project\nWhich criteria to use to define the quality of your software documentation\nHow to deliver your content to your customer on time and schedule\n\n\nEnroll now and learn how to apply the project management principles to a software documentation development project!\n\n\nP.S.

Please see the end of this description for more information.\n\n\nBoost your CV with a more advanced Product Owner qualification.\nMany people have beginner level certifications, but you can become one of the few with a more advanced certification on your CV.\n\n\nLearn how Product Owners actually maximize value with a much deeper knowledge of what it is to be a Professional Product Owner. Do you want to take your Scrum Product Owner knowledge to the next level?\nGreat, then this course is for you.\n\n\nThis course will cover all the topics you need to know about for certifications. Firstly I explain many advanced concepts such as the project management vacuum, the product mindset and the experimentation loop.

I go over these questions in depth explaining the answers so you can fully grasp the knowledge and be fully prepared to take certifications such as those from Scrum. I even provide you with 2 practice tests and links to many other free advanced Product Owner tests to give you lots of practice before taking the real thing.\n\n\nI  cover the 5 different levels of being a Product Owner. With this knowledge, you will identify where you currently are and what you need to do to become an even better Product Owner and progress to the next stage. We look at the Product Owner stances meaning, what things good Product Owners do. I also cover some of the bad but common stances that you should avoid. I'll also take you through organizational design and building an Agile culture, portfolio planning and business strategy.\n\n\nIf you are an entrepreneur with an idea, or currently a Product Owner or just aspiring to be one, this course will teach you how to manage risk ensuring you produce a Product your customers really want. We will look at the concept of a Minimal Viable Product, experimenting, and paper prototyping so you don't waste time and money.\nI even cover the tricky situation of budgeting in Scrum and which contract types can work with iterative agile development.\n\n\nHave you ever finished a project and the item developed was over budget, delayed and once launched it didn't get as many users as you hoped?\nIf this sounds familiar, then this course will help.\nMy course will teach you how to keep your focus on the Product and deliver value via regular releases.\n\n\nWho is your instructor?\nMichael James is a UK Business and Leadership Instructor who has over a decade of experience in management and leadership in the corporate environment and has been working in product development for over 10 years as both a private consultant and for one of the largest organizations in the UK. Michael James has also managed and built many private entrepreneurial mobile app and website products with 1000s of downloads and users.\nMichael James has taught tens of thousands of students worldwide to pass Scrum exams, most getting an almost perfect score first time.\nWhat students are saying:\n\"I have been a product owner in a scrum team for almost two years now, without certification, and he is really showing me how to be better at it. I am enjoying this course and I think I will be in a great position to write my exams when I am done.\"\n\"Very good course thus far.

      "description": "The modern world we live in has brought about chances in abundance and many a career from back in the day will soon find itself redundant, thanks to the immense technological advances brought about by the fourth industrial revolution. There is however one career choice that is reaping major benefits from the capriciousness that goes hand in hand with modern day business. And that career is project management. More and more businesses are realizing the immense benefit associated with the strategic advantages that real project management can provide them and as a result more and more project management vacancies are created.\nLearning more about project management is something you will always benefit from, whether you are actually a project manager, a business manager in general or someone aspiring to become a project manager. The art of disciplined management of the uncertainty that comes with project management is something that will always be to the benefit of those who take the time to learn it.\nProject scope management forms one of the core aspects of project management. It is one of the ten project knowledge areas recognized as a core component of project management and when executed correctly it ensures that your projects start off right, every single time. The ultimate goal of a project is to fulfill a business need by creating something of value and scope management is the discipline that defines what that something is.\nThere is nothing worse than the idea of successfully completing a project only to find out that the deliverable created does not meet the expectations of the end users, rendering it effectively useless and the project a complete failure. The six processes of scope management, namely plan scope management, collect requirements, define scope, create WBS, control scope and validate scope help you avoid just that.\nThis project management course will teach you everything you need to know about scope management by way of imparting the necessary theoretical knowledge as well as working through actual examples of the processes and giving you the opportunity to do some practical exercises yourself.\nThe course starts of laying the foundation of effective initiation, especially in terms of initiation influences on scope planning. The basics of project planning as a whole are also covered and then the six aforementioned scope management processes are covered in deep detail. You will not only be thought what these processes are, but also how to go about conducting them in what is considered an effective and efficient manner. More than just that, you will also be provided with several template documents that you can use as detailed guidelines on your own projects.\nThe course design caters for those who already have the foundational knowledge of project management and are familiar with the PMI project management methodology. Beginners are however welcome to take it up as well as this course will add value to all project management professionals, whether you are a veteran or a greenhorn. It is an excellent way to refresh good scope management practices or to learn them from scratch.",

      "description": "In this course, we will learn everything about Agile methodologies, we will learn about agile values & principles, then talk about agile roles like scrum master & product owner, then we will talk about the most famous methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme programming. Also, we will talk about agile ceremonies like Daily Stand-up meeting, retrospective meeting, and Sprint review. We will learn about writing user stories & acceptance criteria. We will talk about planning for Agile projects using planning poker activity. This course will prepare you to understand everything about Agile whether you are a software developer, product owner, scrum master, software tester, or product manager.\n\n\nThe four values of the Agile Manifesto\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools.\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation.\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation.\nResponding to change over following a plan.\nThe following 12 Principles are based on the Agile Manifesto.\n\n1-Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\n2-Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.\n3-Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\n4-Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n5-Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\n6-The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\n7-Working software is the primary measure of progress.\n8-Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n9-Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\n10-Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.\n11-The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n12-At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.",

      "description": "Ever sat in a sprint planning meeting that dragged on for hours without clarity?\nOr daily scrums that felt like question sessions?\nOr retrospectives where the same problems come up every two weeks without any real solutions?\nI was...\nAnd here's the truth. It's not Scrum's fault. Your events just aren't being run the way they should be.\nMost companies treat Scrum events as boxes to check rather than powerful tools for getting results. Teams go through the motions, sprint planning, daily scrums, retrospectives. Yet their speed doesn't improve, delivery stays unpredictable, and executives question whether \"going Agile\" is worth it.\nThere's a better way. And I'll show you exactly how to make every Scrum event drive real business results.\nI'm Dejan Majkic, Chief Information Officer and Certified Scrum Master and Product Owner. I've trained 133,126+ students. I also lead Agile changes that delivered 30% better efficiency and 20% lower costs in complex government work. I don't teach Scrum from a textbook, I teach the proven methods I use every day managing 500+ employees under tight budgets, government rules, and people who resist change.\nIf these methods work in government IT projects (where politics, old systems, and red tape make \"textbook Scrum\" impossible), they'll work in your environment.\nWhat makes this course different:\nInstead of just explaining what happens in each Scrum event, you'll learn how to run them in ways that improve the four Key Value Areas that companies actually measure:\nCurrent Value – Run sprint reviews that clearly show the business value you delivered to stakeholders who doubt you\nTime-to-Market – Run sprint planning that cuts waste and speeds up delivery\nAbility-to-Innovate – Lead retrospectives that find real improvements, not just surface problems\nUnrealized Value – Find new opportunities through well-run events\nThis isn't just about running better meetings. It's about connecting Scrum events to the business results executives care about, customer happiness, money earned, beating competitors, and long-term growth.\nHere's the change you'll experience:\nSprint Planning Mastery\nTurn vague goals into clear promises that teams actually keep. You'll learn the real-world methods I use to get stakeholder support, manage added work, and set sprint goals that balance big dreams with what's really possible. No more promising too much and delivering too little.\nDaily Scrums That Take 15 Minutes (Not 45)\nStop the status-report trap that wastes everyone's time. You'll learn the simple structure that keeps standups focused, finds problems right away, and keeps your team aligned, without turning into mini-planning sessions or complaint time.\nSprint Reviews That Stakeholders Actually Enjoy\nStop boring executives with technical words they don't understand. Learn to show completed work in business terms that prove ROI, show value, and justify continued money. Your stakeholders will start looking forward to sprint reviews instead of dreading them.\nSprint Retrospectives That Drive Real Change\nMove past the same complaints meeting after meeting with no improvement. You'll get exercises with step-by-step guides that find root causes, expose system problems, and create real action items. Build retrospectives where teams actually want to join in.\nPlus advanced quality methods:\nSoftware walkthroughs for design alignment\nTechnical reviews for code quality and knowledge sharing\nRequirements checks for preventing defects before they're built\nReal examples from real changes\nEvery lesson includes practical examples from complex government IT projects where I've used these exact methods. You'll see how to handle difficult stakeholders, work within limits, overcome people who resist change, and deliver results even when everything isn't perfect.\nPerfect if you're:\nNew to Scrum and want to learn from someone who's doing this work daily, not just consulting\nA Scrum Master struggling to make events productive and prove value to leadership\nA Product Owner who wants better stakeholder involvement and clearer priorities\nA team member tired of wasting time in meetings that don't accomplish anything\nAn executive checking out Agile adoption and need to understand what good looks like\nPreparing for certifications (PSM, PSPO) and want real-world context beyond theory\nWhat you get:\n2.5 hours of focused, action-ready video content (no fluff, no filler)\n25 practical lessons you can use in your very next sprint\nRetrospective exercises with guides\nTemplates and checklists you can download for each event type\nLifetime access with free updates as Scrum evolves\n30-day money-back guarantee. Take the course, use the methods in your next sprint, and see the difference. If you don't find immediate value, get a full refund—no questions asked.\nJoin 5,390+ students who have changed their Scrum events from time-wasting checkbox ceremonies into value-delivery engines that stakeholders trust and teams actually enjoy.\nYour Scrum events can either be the best part of your sprint or the most frustrating. The difference is knowing how to run them properly.\nEnroll now and start running Scrum events that drive real results.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nConsulting firms are hired very often to help in Headcount Optimization. Those projects are difficult as you have to find the right balance between reducing costs and maximizing the value of the business. You not only have to find ways to remove inefficiencies but also calculate in Excel the potential impact on the company and its value. In this course, I will teach how to perform fast and efficiently different types of analyses during projects dedicated to Headcount Optimization.\nIn the course you will learn the following things:\nWhat kind of analyses you will be performing during Headcount Optimization Projects?\nWhat frameworks you can use for Headcount Optimization\nHow to estimate in Excel the impact of potential improvements\nHow to optimize processes, to do the same job with fewer people?\nHow to analyze the motivation system\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nHeadcount Optimization Projects are fast-paced and require a lot of hard work. You have to not only understand the business and the process but also see how this impacts the headcount now and in the future. Most firms don’t give you the full toolbox that you need to analyze the headcount. This may lead to huge frustration during consulting projects and a lot of inefficiencies.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students do analyses related to the headcount, especially done during consulting projects devoted to performance improvement. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do during Headcount Optimization Projects. You will master how to analyze data and draw conclusions from the analyses. On top of that, you will also master the essential information related to motivation systems.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of Headcount Optimization and analyses done during consulting projects devoted to that area. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those that did not finish business school. The course will help you become an expert in Headcount Optimization on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nWhat kind of analyses you will be performing during Headcount Optimization Projects?\nWhat frameworks you can use for Headcount Optimization\nHow to estimate in Excel the impact of potential improvements\nHow to optimize processes, to do the same job with fewer people?\nHow to analyze the motivation system\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little introduction to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nEssential Analyses. There are several analyses that can be used for Headcount Optimization. In this section, we will discuss the most popular of them and show how to use them.\nFrameworks. It’s always a good idea to have standard frameworks that you can use during consulting projects to know what to do. Let’s look at frameworks that will be useful during Headcount Optimization.\nCase Studies. Now, we will have a look at different case studies where we will apply the things, we have learned in previous sections to optimize the headcount.\nOptimization of in-store processes – Case Study. In this section, we will optimize the processes in a chain of home improvement stores. This will show you how you can do the same work with fewer people.\nMotivation System Analysis. As a part of Headcount Optimization projects, you will also have to analyze the Motivation System System. Let’s have a look at some examples of such analyses.\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\n1. Useful frameworks and techniques\n2. Analyses presented in the course\n3. Additional resources\n4. Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies\n5. Links to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nHow to conduct fast and efficiently analyses in Excel related to Headcount Optimization\nHow to estimate the required number of people for a specific set of tasks, or projects\nWhat kind of analyses you will be performing during Headcount Optimization Projects?\nWhat frameworks you can use for Headcount Optimization\nHow to estimate in Excel the impact of potential improvements\nHow to optimize processes, to do the same job with fewer people?\nHow to analyze the motivation system\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness Analysts\nManagers\nFinancial Controllers\nStartup Founders\nProject Managers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics\nBasic or intermediate knowledge of finance & accounting",

In the chapter on Scrum, you'll then learn all about roles, artifacts, sprints, meetings and much more.\nIn the next chapter we will learn about the Kanban methodology in detail, here we learn all about Kanban boards, cards, WIP limits, swimlanes, flight levels and more.\nIn the last chapter we look at the OKR method made famous by Google. We learn all about the definitions of Objectives and Key Results, how to formulate them correctly and how to get the maximum out of our team.\nOf course, the chapters are structured in such a way that you can do them independently of each other and if you are interested in a particular method, you can easily start with that one. We hope you enjoy the course!\nWe will likely add more content to this course over time. If you have any specific ideas or topics you would like to learn more about when it comes to agile project management you can let us know anytime!",

Jennifer has carved out the topic so precisely and her explanation is simple, understandable and applicable. I look forward to more sessions from her. Thank you for putting in such a great effort.\" - Ashwin Mekad\n\n\n\"Practical course to dive into the most used Agile methodologies and frameworks. Well explained, with real problems and real solutions broken-up step by step. Highly recommended.\" - Sara Castellino\n\n\n\"A lot of good content on agile. I've done a few other agile courses before but this one is the longest and covers a lot of aspects that are often left out. Thanks for making a lot of things clearer for me, thumbs up!\" - Tobias Aebi\n\n\n\"This is my first course on agile and I am very happy with what Jenny provided. Even for me, as a beginner, it was very detailed, insightful and easy to follow! I especially liked the Design Thinking exercise and the well balanced blending of practical and theoretical examples. Thank you so much for this great course!\" - Benny Zibis\n\n\n\"Really love the breadth of this course. I've done a few other courses on agile before but they only cover one specific topic. This one covers 3 methods and really helped me understand the bigger picture. Video quality is good, exercises simple but effective and chapters not too long. Especially appreciate the certificate after course! Would def recommend this course to all beginners looking to get a good overview on the entire topic of agile!\" - Mona Smith\n\n\n\"I was completely new to the Agile concept and have been able to take away a lot from this. The way Jenny explains the course material and uses real-life examples makes it super easy to grasp the content and I think I will be able to apply this in many different ways. Thanks!\" - Luca Tamina\n\n\n\"I'm not a total beginner in agile, done a few projects already and was looking to understand more agile methods in more depth. This course was very useful in that sense. You hear a lot about SCRUM but agile is much more, not only other methods like Design Thinking, but also in terms of having a totally different mindset and values. Jenny really drew the complete picture and made me see connections where I didn't see them before. Lots of hands-on advice on how I can now convince my boss to go agile too, I'll definitely try that! If you want to see beyond what everybody is seeing, this course is a must. Thank you!\" - Tom Willow\n__________\nCLICK ‘BUY NOW’ TO GET STARTED RIGHT AWAY!\nNot yet 100% convinced? Then read on ;-) But don’t forget: Investing in yourself is the best investment you can ever make – especially if you’re investing to become an expert in one of the most highly sought after fields in today’s business environment – Agile!\n__________\n\n\nWHO WILL TEACH YOU?\nA true expert in Agile/ Professional Design Thinking coach/ Certified SCRUM Master and product owner who…\n…trained more than 1000+ people in 5+ countries\n…wrote several published articles on Agile\n…led more than 15 large agile projects in the context of product/ service/ business model innovation and digital transformation\n…combines an in-depth understanding of all aspects of Agile (mindset, values, principles, methodologies) with years of practical experience and very hands-on advice\n…is 100% convinced that Agile will be the pre-dominant way we work in the future\n…wants to contribute her part in helping people to go agile and develop an expertise in one of the fastest growing fields in today’s business world\n__________\n\n\nTHE FACTS\nThis course is the broadest course on Agile on Udemy. If you want to get the complete picture, this is the course to take! Many courses here focus only on project management or SCRUM, but completely leave out the key aspects of agile mindset, values, principles, agile transformation on an organizational level as well as the other 2 highly important agile methodologies Design Thinking and Lean Startup which are used everyday to reinvent companies and innovate successfully.\n\n\nThis course is one of the longest courses on Agile on Udemy. Including the professional video lectures, all quizzes and exercises, you get more than 13 hours of value, not even considering the 3+ months of personal growth journey that you’ll go through by completing the special bonus part.\n\n\nThis course is taught by an agile expert. I’m deeply experienced in all 3 agile methodologies and have spent my entire professional career on advocating Agile and transforming organizations into agile ones. If you listen to the video lectures, you will realize how motivated I am to spread the word about Agile and broaden the community of agile experts. The world needs more of them, and the next one could be you! ?\n\n\nThis course will certify you as an expert in Agile. There are lots of people out there who know one method, usually SCRUM. But there are very few people who truly see the big picture and understand how all of the top 3 agile methods, Design Thinking, Lean Startup and SCRUM, work together. Even fewer people understand Agile beyond the process/methodology scope. The mindset, values and principles are so much harder to develop. If you understand all this, this will definitely help you to boost your professional life to the next level. If you want to, this can be the starting point of your career as an Agile or Innovation Coach, one of the most sought after job profiles in today’s business environment.\n__________\n\n\nGaining more knowledge about Agile and its three most important methodologies, Design Thinking, Lean Startup & SCRUM, can only benefit you! These topics are increasing in relevance every single day, as the world continues to move faster; as markets, competitive landscapes and customer expectations are changing every second, and as job profiles such as Agile Coach, Innovation Coach or SCRUM Master become highly sought after and very well paid.\n\n\n--> --> --> Click the ‘BUY NOW’ button now! <-- <-- <--\n\n\nGet ready to go agile!

You may find that multiple answers may be correct but you have to select the best option - for the given scenario.\nWhile there is a lot of excellent training & video content available on Udemy and other sources online to learn the exam topics for PMI ACP Exam, you still need to make sure that you go through the practice tests to reinforce and ascertain you are fully prepared for the exam.\nThese practice exams will test your understanding of the PMI ACP content/syllabus and help you decide if you are \"ready for the exam\"\nIf You start passing these practice exams with a consistent score of 75% or above - it is a good indication that you will be able to pass the PMI ACP Exam too - as these practice tests cover all the aspects of the PMI ACP Exam with similar difficulty level.\nThe real PMI ACP exam has 120 questions & exam duration is 180 minutes.\nFor these practice exams too, I kept 120 questions in each practice test and timed for 180-minutes to give you a real-life, simulated environment to prepare for the real PMI ACP exam.\nCome, join in & get ready to earn the coveted PMI ACP certificate --- All the best!!\nDISCLAIMER:\nSource of questions in these practice test: Questions in this mock tests are created entirely by myself taking into account my personal experience of preparing & writing the ACP  exam and assessing the difficulty level of the same. Also, the scenarios are developed by me from my project management experience.\nI have used ONLY publicly available information regarding the new format of the ACP Exam (ECOs, Crossover Maps, PMI Articles etc.) to develop the questions.

I am very happy to take this up.\"\n-Harish Nekkanti\nThere are no prerequisites for starting this Scrum Fundamental course.\nHere are some FAQs about Scrum before you get started:\nWhat is Scrum?\nScrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.\nScrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products. The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.\nScrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.\nScrum is:\nLightweight\nSimple to understand\nDifficult to master\nWhat is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?\nAgile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.\nWhy do we need Scrum?\nYou don’t “need” it, per se.\nBut to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.\nWhen should I choose Scrum?\nScrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.\nWith Scrum your team will:\nDeliver the main value quicker\nHave a bigger chance of meeting the deadline\nCreate the product for less\nBe more motivated\nCollaborate better\nBe more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful\nWhen should I not choose Scrum?\nScrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.\nIs Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?\nScrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster’s role as well.\nCan Product Owner and ScrumMaster’s roles be played by the same person?\nNo, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.\nHow might Scrum work for research projects?\nScrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a “product”), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.\nWhat about Professional Scrum Certification?\nThere are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including Professional Scrum Master™, Professional Scrum Product Owner™, Professional Scrum Developer™, Scaled Professional Scrum™, Professional Scrum™ with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership™ and Professional Scrum™ with User Experience.\nThese assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.\nYou can visit the official Scrum website for more details.\nLet's get started. I'll see you inside the course :)",

      "description": "I. The Risk Management Certification Program (PMI-RMP)\nWelcome to the Risk Management Certification Program (PMI-RMP). The Program is PMBOK6 aligned and includes the courses on Planning Risk Management, Identifying Risk, Analyzing Risk and Responding to Risk.\n1. Planning Risk Management. We're going to learn about how to plan for risks on a project to make sure that when negative things do happen, we're ready for them.\n2. Identifying Risk. Covers the inputs you need to look at in order to identify risks. And how to use several techniques, such as Data Analysis methods, like SWOT Analysis, and Assumption, and Constraint Analysis, to help you develop an effective risk register.\n3. Analyzing Risk. We'll examine the two risk analysis processes of the project risk management knowledge area, namely, perform qualitative risk analysis and perform quantitative risk analysis.\n4. The Responding to Risk covers the final three processes in the project risk management knowledge area. Plan risk responses, implement risk responses and monitor risks. You'll learn about some common risk response strategies and how to monitor and control risks as they occur.\nAll instructional activities will earn you the necessary for PMI certification and credential maintenance if you already are a certified PMI Risk Management Professional or Project Management Professional.\n\n\nII. The Business Analysis Certification Program (IIBA - ECBA)\nThe Business Analysis Certification Program is aligned with the (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge Guide) BABOK version 3 and has a total of 14 sections that are also presented as individual courses for your convenience.\n1. Introduction to Business Analysis. Foundational concepts related to business analysis. First we're going to look at business analysis and what it is, what a business analyst does, and some of the core concepts related to working in this field. Then we'll look at some of the key terms, such as stakeholder, requirements, and design.\n2. Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring. The tasks in this knowledge area produce documents that direct you as a business analyst throughout a project. These documents include the general approach you'll take, the plan for engaging stakeholders, and how you'll manage information, and changes to the requirements.\n3. Business Analysis Elicitation and Collaboration. Find out how business analysts identify and reach agreements with stakeholders on requirements. The tasks in this knowledge area describe how you as a business analyst reach a mutual understanding of various types of business analysis information with stakeholders. The activities associated with this task include workshops, surveys, and ad hoc collaboration and conversations.\n4. Business Analysis and Requirements Life Cycle Management.  Requirements are the foundation of all your business analysis activities. If the objective of a project is to deliver solutions that best meet requirements, then you'd best keep a close eye on those requirements and the designs that address them. So, we’ll look at what your role is in tracing and maintaining requirements and designs.\n5. Business Analysis and Strategy Analysis. It covers everything from assessing the current state of operations, doing some visioning regarding a desired future state, determining what the risks are that will need to be managed, and then coming up with the best strategy for realizing the desired future state.\n6. Business Analysis and RADD: Requirements Definition. This course covers the first three tasks, which involve creating a list of requirements and then verifying that they are of sufficient quality to be used for further work. And then, validating them to ensure they deliver benefits to the stakeholders, align with business goals, and align with the objectives of the change.\n7. Requirements Analysis and Design Definition. Related to creating a requirements architecture. You develop a set of designs and analyze those to determine where the best value is. The final step is to develop the solution recommendation that represents the best design.\n8. Business Analysis and Solution Evaluation. It involves measuring and analysing solution performance as well as identifying limitations within the solution and the enterprise that may be keeping the solution from reaching its full value potential. The final task is to recommend actions to remove the limitations and thereby increase the value of the solution.\n9. Analytical Techniques Used for Business Analysis. Analytical techniques assist the business analyst to identify problems and to find solutions. This course will introduce Analysis Tools for Scoping and Planning, Models that Support Business Analysis and Analyses that Support Decision making.\n10. Activities and Tools Used for Business Analysis. The categories of techniques covered in this course include idea generation and data gathering techniques that you can use with groups, such as brainstorming, collaborative games, and workshops. We'll also look at decision-making techniques, such as estimation and prioritisation.\n11. Documentation and Criteria Used for Business Analysis. Some of them are glossaries and business rules you'll need, others are documents you'll create that contain business cases, use cases, and user stories. The final type of documents we'll look at contain metrics and criteria you'll use for evaluating performance and establishing requirements.\n12. Business Analysis Competencies: Personal Skills.  These competencies represent skills and knowledge that all business analysts should have in order to excel at their jobs. There are six categories of competencies altogether, and in this course we'll be looking at three of them: analytical thinking and problem solving, communication skills, and interaction skills.\n13. Business Analysis Competencies: Professional Effectiveness. Covers behavioural characteristics such as personal accountability, trustworthiness, adaptability, and organisation and time management. We'll also look at various areas of business knowledge that are important to business analysis. Finally, we'll talk about some of the tools and technology that business analysts use on the job.\n14. Business Analysis Perspectives, we'll be looking at five different perspectives from which business analysis may need to view their work. Perspectives are used within business analysis to provide focus for the tasks you will carry out. They'll also come with a set of techniques that are specific to the context of the change initiative.

I have been a BA for over 10 years (for a small company), and I learned what I was doing correct, what I could improve on, and all the things that I've been told which are incorrect. This course was amazing and enlightening! Igor brings a 'realistic' approach to the course and takes time to personally explain any questions you might have throughout the course.\" — Steven\n———————————\nThis course will offer:\nDetailed explanation of business analysis knowledge areas, soft skills, and perspectives.\nOverview and examples of all 50 business analysis techniques from the BABOK® Guide\nCase studies of examples and practical applications of selected techniques\nExamples and practical explanations of sometimes complicated definitions from the BABOK® Guide and other resources\nA way to systematize your experience and bring it into a common BA method through IIBA® Core Concept Model™ and the BABOK® knowledge areas\nQuizzes with detailed explanations of the answers to check your knowledge\nAdditional reading materials to further deepen your knowledge.\nA sample set of CBAP® exam questions with detailed explanations of answers to prepare for the exam\nA way to earn a few extra PDUs/CDUs online: this course has been reviewed by IIBA experts and qualifies for 35 development units.\nAn official IIBA Endorsed Education Provider certificate of completion in addition to the standard Udemy certificate.\n———————————\nThis course is an updated and refined version of my previously published CBAP courses.\n———————————\nThe course is 100% aligned with the Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK® Guide) - the key standard explaining the business analysis profession.

Having an updated project schedule at any time in the project lifecycle is vital for project success. The project plan makes the difference.\nI've been working in project for more than a decade, I lead projects for big corporations, startups, growing businesses\nThroughout my project management career I experienced that the project timeline is created at the beginning and updated ONLY when the project gets in trouble. And this happens because keeping the project timeline up to date every day or week can be a very time consuming activity. But since it is so important to do, I came up with a very very simple way of creating the project plan and of course easy to maintain it, so it ONLY takes 1 hour to create and less than few minutes to maintain.\nThis is more than a course you take to learn a new skill. It is a an workshop you can take over and over again you need to create or update a project plan. Because you start the course, you do the exercises and you know that at the end of 1 hour you'll have your project plan up to date.\n1. Do you want to define the project goal now?\n2. Do you want to define all the activities of the project?\n3. Do you want somebody to guide you through all the different aspects that you have to include in your project plan?\n4. Do you want to learn to organize your project activities in a strategic way?\n5. Do you want to add duration, assign responsible and start dates for your project tasks in a simple way?\n6. Do you want to create your project GANTT now?\n7. Do you want to start NOW?\nIf your answer is HELL YES! Then, this course is for you!\nI prepared examples, templates, guiding questions, and a lot of other support materials for you.\nAt the end of this 1 hour course, you'll have your project timeline created and ready to use.",

      "description": "Project management, as with everything else, starts at the beginning.  There is no better way to ensure successful project management and success as a project, manager and that is to master the art of initiating the project the right way.\nWould you start a 100m race facing backwards and still hold on to the idea that you stand a chance to beat your competition? Of course not! Neither will you start a vacation trip travelling east if you know your destination is west. So why does it happen so often that projects are commenced without due consideration of the intended final destination?\nSure, you can initiate a project in any way you wish and realign it during planning and execution, but that goes against the grain of project management philosophy, which in essence circles around the idea of optimization of project effort. Initiating the project the right way, will not only simplify the project planning process, but it will also play a major role in early project effort efficiency and correct team orientation, which will ultimately add to the chances of avoiding any unnecessary project blunders.\nIn this course you will learn everything you need to know about the project initiating process group. Furthermore you will also gain a working understanding of the very important work that happens before a project can be initiated. Understanding pre-project work makes a big difference in your ability to start your project on the right foot. The knowledge you will gain in this course regarding project initiation and how to ensure you start the project the right way will prove to be invaluable. The techniques thought in this course will not only help you to effectively initiate your projects, but it will also ensure that you facilitate stakeholder alignment before project planning even starts, giving you a great head start and ensuring that you eliminate or at the very least limit the effect of two of the largest contributors to project failure namely lack of stakeholder engagement and misalignment of stakeholder expectations.\nThis course was designed to arm you with the essential knowledge you require to lay the foundation upon which the remainder of your project will be built.\nThe course covers all of the essentials of pre-project work or project conception, which is the work done at a program or portfolio level that aims to ensure the viability and practicality of the project before it is even initiated. The stakeholder engagement techniques taught as part of the needs definition process will prove to be one of the most useful skills you can have as a project manager. The course then goes on to teach you what initiation is all about and how to compile a project charter containing all the precursor information you will need to effectively plan the project later on. Particular attention is given to the compilation of the initial scope that forms part of the charter and the techniques taught here will set the pace for the rest of the project. The course also covers stakeholder identification and analysis in detail. The last topic of the course is that of the project kick-off meeting, what its purpose is and how you can use it to get project team buy in.\nBuilding a house on the wrong foundation will ultimately cause a countless problems later on and the same holds true for project management. This course will arm you with the knowledge you need to lay a strong foundation, ensuring you eliminate a lot of the problems that may have presented itself in the future had you not done so.\nThe course design caters for those who already have the foundational knowledge of project management and are familiar with the PMI project management methodology. Beginners are however welcome to take it up as well as the course is structured to add value to all project management professionals.\nNewcomers to project management will find this knowledge very beneficial, as it will enable them to start projects the way they are supposed to be started, greatly reducing the chances of issues popping up in later project phases.",

Instructions for claiming PDU's are provided with the last lesson in the course.\nMoney-back Guaranty: Try this course and if you are not satisfied with the value you received from the course, just send an email to Udemy support and they will give you a 100% refund within 30 days.\nIntended Audience: The primary audience for this course is Agile/Scrum Product Owners who are responsible for leading Agile Projects from a business perspective. The Product Owner role in Agile is a very demanding role. The Product Owner in Agile is the role primarily responsible for the success or failure of the project from a business perspective and is often known as \"The CEO of the project\". Many existting courses for Product Owners such as Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) are primarily focused on the basic \"mechanics\" of how to do Scrum. This course goes well beyond that to provide a much deeper understanding of how to be an effective Agile Product Owner.\nIn addition to the Product Owner role, this course will also appeal to:\nBusiness Analysts - who work in an Agile environment and need to optimize their skills to provide a high level of value in that environment\nBusiness Sponsors - who want to learn more about Agile Project Management in order to provide more effective leadership for the initiatives that they are responsible for\n____________________________________________________________________________\nCourse Summary:\nThis course is designed to provide a much deeper understanding of how to effectively lead Agile/Scrum projects for anyone in a Product Owner role or in an equivalent level of business responsibility. The Product Owner role in Agile is not well understood and many business managers who are assigned to perform that role are not well-prepared for it. This course includes material on:\nAgile Values and Principles\nDesign Thinking, Systems Thinking, and Complex Adaptive Systems\nKanban and Managing Flow in Agile Projects\nLean Software Development, Value Stream Analysis, and Value-driven Delivery\nAdaptive Planning and Agile Requirements Definition Practices\nAgile Risk Management, Metrcis, and Stakeholder Management\n____________________________________________________________________________\nOverall Agile Business Management Curriculum:\nThis course is part of an overall curriculum designed for business people to effectively participate and lead in an Agile environment. Agile significantly changes the role of business people in leading and managing projects and requires a much more active business leadership role to guide the direction of projects that are in progress. The overall curriculum consists of three primary courses:\n1. Agile BM 101 - Introduction to Agile Business Management\nThis course povides a solid foundation for the other courses in this overall curriculum and helps all business personnel develop a solid understanding of how to implement a hybrid approach that blends the two approaches in the right proportions to fit any given situation\n2. Agile BM 201 - Mastering Agile Business Management (this course)\nThis course is designed to provide a much deeper understanding of how to effectively lead Agile/Scrum projects for anyone in a Product Owner role or in an equivalent level of business responsibility. The Product Owner role in Agile is not well understood and many business managers who are assigned to perform that role are not well-prepared for it.\n3. Agile BM 301 - Enterprise-level Agile Business Management\nThe final course in this series is focused on advanced topics related to applying Agile to a business at an enterprise level including\nAlignment and Value Disciplines\nEnterprise-level frameworks (SAFe and DAD)\nEnterprise-level Agile Transformations\nOrganizational Culture and Change Management\n____________________________________________________________________________\nWhy Is This Curriculum Important?\n\nIn a traditional, plan-driven project management environment,\nA large part of the management of a project can be delegated to a project manager, and\nOnce the business requirements for the project are documented and approved by the business, the business role in providing leadership and management of the project can be limited.\nIn an Agile environment,\nThe requirements and the design of the solution evolve and are further refined as the project progresses\nFor that reason, it is essential that the business is much more directly involved in providing leadership and direction to the project as it progresses\nIn order to provide effective leadership and direction to projects, the business people who are either directly or indirectly involved in Agile projects need to fully understand how the process works in order to participate collaboratively in the process with the project teams who are responsible for developing the solution.\nMany existing courses for business people in an Agile environment such as Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) are limited to the \"mechanics\" of how to do Agile and are limited to a pure Agile approach. This course goes into much more depth to give business people a very solid and deeper understanding of both Agile/Scrum as well as traditional plan-driven project management and how to successfully apply it in a business environment.\n____________________________________________________________________________\nImportant Note: This course is a condensed version of some of the material in our 7-course curriculum for Agile Project Managers and there is no need for anyone to take both sets of courses.",

Managing projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities as a program enhances the delivery of benefits by ensuring that the strategies and work plans of program components are responsively adapted to component outcomes, or to changes in the direction or strategies of the sponsoring organization. Programs are conducted primarily to deliver benefits to the sponsor organizations or constituents of the sponsoring organization. Programs may deliver benefits, for example, by enhancing current capabilities, facilitating change, creating or maintaining assets, offering new products and services, or developing new opportunities to generate or preserve value. Such benefits are delivered to the sponsoring organization as outcomes that provide utility to the organization and the program’s intended beneficiaries or stakeholders.",

      "description": "Ever work on a project where your methodology didn't quite fit? Maybe you were using waterfall but needed a bit more flexibility. Or you were using agile, but needed a bit more structure and predictability.\nEnter “hybrid” project management – a merging of old and new.\nAgile and Waterfall are two different visions of project delivery methods. Agile is about iterative development and flexibility, while Waterfall requires careful planning, with predictable outcomes, making change management a challenge.  Organizations trying to use one or the other are coming to the realization that using principles of both approaches can be more beneficial than choosing a single approach.\nBut how do you know when hybrid methods are best?\nThis course will teach you about the evolution of project management methods and how “hybrid” methods have come into vogue as the most useful.  We'll cover the advantages and disadvantages of each method, and how to us those to analyze the best track for your project to take. We will also cover the elements and skills needed to deploy hybrid project management and some key examples/case studies by project type/industry.\nIn this course, you will:\nUnderstand the benefits and drawbacks of waterfall and agile methodologies and how they benefit projects\nLearn the skills needed to choose and manage projects using hybrid\nDecide which hybrid methods to apply to your project based on key attributes\nI built this course for experienced project managers who are new to using hybrid and want to learn the best way to start using it for their projects. I've managed a variety of projects in my career in several diverse industries and the biggest lesson by far for project success is  understanding how and when to tailor the project methodology for success.  It's a matter of finding the right approach - we all know that one size doesn't fit all! Therein lies my passion for hybrid!\nIf you're ready to get the best of both worlds using hybrid project management, join me in this course!",

      "description": "Important:\nThis course is part of an integrated, university-level curriculum of seven courses (See details below).  This course is the second course in that series and should be taken in sequence.  Please take the prerequisite course before taking this course.\nCourse Statistics:\nOver 200,000 students in my courses!\nOver 7,000 5-star reviews in my courses!\nEarn PDU's: Students who complete this course are eligible to receive 2.25 PDU's in PMI continuing education credits. Instructions for claiming PDU's are provided with the last lesson in the course.\nQualify for PMI-ACP Certification:  Completion of all seven courses in this series will meet the requirement for 21 hours of training to qualify for PMI-ACP certification.\nAccelerate Your Career:  Agile and Lean are having a profound impact on redefining \"project management\" as we have known it since the 1950's and 1960's. A lot of project managers are confused about what this means to their careers. This course is designed to help project managers better understand the impact of these changes and re-orient their careers as needed to become a very high impact Agile Project Manager..\nMoney-back Guaranty: Try this course and if you are not satisfied with the value you received from the course, just send an email to support@udemy.com and you will receive a 100% refund within 30 days.\nCourse Summary:\nThe use of Agile methodologies is growing at an incredible rate, the basic way we do traditional plan-driven project management hasn't changed significantly since the 1950's and 1960's and the rate of technology change today is making a pure plan-driven approach very cumbersome and impractical to implement in many real-world situations. That doesn't mean that traditional plan-driven project methodologies are obsolete and no longer useful; however, within a relatively short amount of time, a project manager who only knows how to use traditional plan-driven methodologies will be at a serious disadvantage in the job market.\nThat's a big challenge for many project managers who have been schooled and indoctrinated in a plan-driven project management approach because Agile changes the very nature of how we do project management in many environments.   This course will help you understand the impact of these changes and learn how to adapt your career to move into a high-impact Agile Project Management role.\nSpecial Note:\nThis course is part of an overall curriculum that is designed around helping students develop the skills required for a high-impact Agile Project Management role.  Most students will want to take the complete curriculum rather than individual courses.  The complete curriculum should be taken in the following order:\nAgile PM 101 - Learn the Truth About Agile versus Waterfall\nAgile PM 102 - What's the Future of Agile Project Management?\nAgile PM 201 - Understanding Agile at a Deeper Level\nAgile PM 202 - Introduction to Agile Project Management\nAgile PM 301 - Mastering Agile Project Management\nAgile PM 401 - Advanced Agile Project Management\nAgile PM 402 - Enterprise-level Agile Project Management\nStudents who complete the entire curriculum of all seven courses shown above will receive a signed certificate of completion from the Agile Project Management Academy.  The complete set of seven courses will also meet the 21 hours of training required for PMI-ACP certification.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAgile Business Management Curriculum\nThere is also a condensed version of this curriculum that is designed for any business people who are involved in Agile projects including Product Owners, Business Sponsors, and Business Analysts\nIntroduction to Agile Business Management\nMastering Agile Business Management\nEnterprise-level Agile Business Management\n\n\nNote: These courses for Agile Business Management are an abridged version of the Agile Project Management courses and there is no need to take both",

All key processes, roles, artifacts and events are first explained to provide a foundational knowledge and understanding, and then incorporated in an example project that takes the student through all key stages of a Scrum initiative.\nThroughout the course, 'real-world' behaviour and practises are highlighted to prepare students for what they might encounter in the business world, and enable them to adapt as required.\nQuizzes are included to test your knowledge, and subtitles are available that can be displayed below the screen to avoid obscuring lecture information.\nFinally, on successfully finishing the course, you will receive a Certificate of Completion in recognition of your newly-acquired knowledge and skills.",

      "description": "This is the six course out of eight of the Agile PMI-ACP (Agile Certified Practitioner) Certification Program. This part is on Leading an Agile Team.\n\n1. The Agile Project Leader\nTraditional and agile project management roles differ in their approaches to decision making, project planning, and management generally, but both need excellent people management and leadership skills, as well as technical knowledge. An agile project leader should view the customer as a collaborator and focus on continuous improvement throughout a project. The project leader should also serve as both a servant-leader and facilitator, and view a project as a CAS.\n2. The agile team\nAgile teams are typically cross-functional in their makeup and self-organizing, with members who are empowered to make their own decisions during the development process. Problems in agile teams result from management miscues, including confusion over a project's mission and scope, and team dysfunctions that occur when teams don't follow agile principles.\n3. Managing Distributed Agile Teams\nManaging a distributed agile team poses particular challenges. To help overcome these, you can focus on creating cross-functional teams, building solid working relationships, using interactive modes of communication, ensuring knowledge sharing between team members, organizing regular meetings at appropriate times, promoting collaboration, and using online collaboration and meeting tools.\n4. Coaching an Agile Team\nAgile coaches are responsible for developing team and individual performance, and for helping team members apply agile practices in their daily work. Agile coaching occurs at the team and individual levels. At the start and end of each iteration, agile coaching occurs largely at the team level. While an iteration is in progress, individual coaching is most appropriate.\n5. Improving Team Performance\nYou can improve the performance of an agile team by expecting high performance and technical excellence. As project leader, you should also remove obstacles that could hinder high performance, such as an inadequate product backlog, poor engineering practices, and multitasking.\nTo ensure that a team can identify and fix problems quickly, you should remove obstacles that could hinder performance, such as individuals working in isolation, a culture of tolerating defects, and a project leader that tries to solve problems for the team. A final strategy you can use to improve performance is to ensure that team members stay energized by eating healthily and taking regular breaks.\nThis course has two sections: The Basics of Agile Teams and Managing Agile Team Performance.\nAfter completing the section called The Basics of Agile Teams, you will be able to:\nindicate how the role of project manager differs between traditional and agile project management,\nrecognize practices that reflect the mindset of an agile project leader,\nrecognize the characteristics of an Agile team,\nidentify causes of problems on agile teams, and\nrecommend strategies for overcoming challenges faced by dispersed agile teams.\nAfter completing the section called Managing Agile Team Performance you will be able to:\nmatch iteration phases with corresponding coaching activities\nrecognize strategies for boosting team performance\nWho is your instructor?\nMy name is Sorin, and I will be your instructor. I am a trainer and project manager with more than 10 years of experience. Before Udemy, I trained hundreds of people in a classroom environment – civil servants, managers, project workers, aid workers and many more. And I managed projects in the fields of justice, corrections, regional development and human resources development.\nHow will you benefit?\nThis course is intended for project managers, program managers, or anyone who wants to efficiently participate in agile projects. It is aligned with the Agile Certified Practitioner exam objectives developed by the Project Management Institute® and Certified ScrumMaster learning objectives.\nTraining videos, examples, exercices and quizzes will help you learn all about the Leading an Agile Team.
