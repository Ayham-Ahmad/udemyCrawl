      "description": "Automation, objects, and policies are replacing traditional networks as we know them. North-to-South or East-to-West traffic flows—do you know the difference between the two? Don't worry if you don't: this course will remedy that! Traditional campus networks are static, and won't change much because they can't scale up. Data centers are not meant to be static.\nToday's Data Center architecture requirements are: scalability, geo-redundancy, security, multi-tenancy, and speed! Data center traffic flow should be highly available and predictable. As the demand for talented ACI engineers and architects is rapidly increasing, knowing the foundational aspects of SDN-based architectures and being able to implement and support them are crucial for your career development.\nThis fast-paced course uses a whiteboard-based approach with hand written explanations. We start with an introduction to fabric data center designs, Spine and Leaf architectures, and ACI. We then start to implement them and deploy a fabric from the ground up. Then we build a multi-tenant environment.\nAfter completing this video training course, you will have gained a solid understanding of how to administer an Application Centric Infrastructure.\nAbout the Author\nRene Cardona is a Network Solutions Architect with over 8 years' experience in core data center and security infrastructure designs, architecture, consulting, and implementations. He has performed many security and data center architecture refreshes for major US corporations in the logistics, retail, healthcare, and education fields, and provided expert insights during datacenter migrations (Campus to VXLAN, ACI, and UCS environments) as well as multi-pod and multifabric architectures. Areas he is more than proficient in range from hyper-converged data center environments, VXLAN, SDN, SD-WAN, and Multi-Datacenter High Availability (MDHA) all the way to network security (firewalls, network admission control, and network security architectures).\nHe has also performed numerous VXLAN, BGP, EVPN, and ACI deployments for major corporations in various corporate sectors—all with great success! Rene is a CCIEx2 #62050 holding two CCIE's in Data Center and Service Provider track.\nRene is driven by experience.

So hang in there.This is a course that starts off with some theory and then flows right in some fun. Configuring interfaces, setting up zones, filter routes, and setting up routing protocols. All of this is done on the Juniper command line. You are about to walk into a world which Juniper is no stranger to providing a powerful operating system that make their devices provide granular or simple tasks.\nBy the time you are finished with this course, you will have the skills to be comfortable on JUNOS. But this does not happen over night. It takes practice and you need to spend the time practicing. I have taken the time to provide you with a course that helps you get familiar with the command line.\nI will be using real Juniper equipment with my lectures and there is a lots of time spent on the command line. That is correct, you will be seeing a lot of configurations. Lets face it, that is why you are here. You will learn how to configure IP addresses, set up zones, allow traffic into and between zones, static routing, routing protocols, route filtering, and so on.\nYou can take for granted that you will find this course relaxing and a joy to follow. There is some boring things in the beginning, but when we start configuring, it just keeps going and going. Juniper is usually a device that others start with after having experience with other networking vendors. So you will need the basic skills in Network Fundamentals, IP addressing, TCP/IP, OSI Model, and Basic Communicated between two host.\nThis is a course that is designed for one purpose....... To leave the course and gain the ability to configure a Juniper device. That is my goal and that is the mission of this course.",

      "description": "Coding for kids\n** Welcome to the most comprehensive and in depth course of its kind on Udemy !! **\nSo what makes this course different from the tons of courses out there? Simple answer: EVERYTHING!\nThis course is so much more than merely teaching kids how to code.\n--\nBut first a very important aspect :\nThose under 18 may use the services only if a parent or guardian opens their account, handles any enrollments, and manages their account usage. We love it that young ones want to learn, and that parents or guardians allow for this, but is extremely important to us that all of this is done with your child's safety in mind.\nThis is why we've added a short video to this course about the safety of our kids while online. Please take the information contained in it to heart and apply it to your child's time online.\nTo facilitate this it is important to know that the course is intended for PURCHASE by adults, and that account usage must be under full-time management by a parent or guardian. We've also added Academy's terms of usage on this matter to the end of this page.\n--\nOK, so back to the fun stuff !\nSure, kids, young adults, and anybody interested will learn to code with this course, yes, but as you will discover this is the mere tip of the iceberg. For one, we teach this course using the principles behind the term Computational Thinking, effectively preparing our students for the brave new world that lies beyond the much talked about Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). What this boils down to is that we use Scratch 3.0 as a tool for bigger and bolder things.\nWe instill the very essence of complex ideas like Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction and the all-important Algorithm Design without our students even realizing that they are using these principles. (They just think they are having fun !)\nWe look at basic Algebra, Trigonometry, and yes, even Robotics, all the while encouraging and focusing on critical 21st century Life, Literacy and Learning Skills. Skills like Creativity, Collaboration and Initiative are encouraged during this course as we cycle through easy to understand small bits of information. (And YES, we even build a robot together, using the skills learned during the course!)\nAfter we are done with code-based programming (using Scratch 3.0 ) we move over to the incredibly popular, incredibly powerful Python, and teach our students the basics using the same principles as we utilized up to this point, linking the two coding platforms as not to overwhelm our budding student coders. (FUN being one of these principles)\nYou see, we believe, very much like Mitch Resnick, director of the MIT Media Lab, that people should not be merely learning to code, but instead coding to learn, and when people learn to code in the right way, they learn important strategies for solving problems, designing projects, and communicating ideas.\nThis is but a glimpse of an absolutely MASSIVE course, not only in terms of content and variety of topics, but also in terms of the critical skills that we all , but especially our young ones will need to possess in order to be relevant in this modern environment where concepts like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and the Internet of Things are fast becoming commonplace.\nThis , for us as the course creators and educators, Is the true essence of what a \"Masterclass \"needs to be : not a course that attempts to cram as much (or as little) information as what is deemed to be required into brains, but rather a course where a student walks away with a true understanding of not only the technical aspects of the subject matter,  but the reasoning behind the methodology. We have found, time and time again, that this way of doing things result in a student that can apply what he or she have learned to whatever the need may be, and carry these skills with them for the rest of their lives.\nThis, however, is not all! For your hard-earned money you also get :\nLifetime access to this course\nConstant updates and additions to course materials\na Very responsive instructor (that loooves what he does)\nQuizzes formulated to ask the right questions, testing knowledge in a very specific way,  not just \"fillers \"to make a course seem longer and devoid of substance.\nChallenges that challenge the right skills at the right time, with step by step walkthroughs of solutions.\nA Certificate of Completion\nSo what makes this course different you ask? E-VE-RY-THING !!\n\n\nPS : We also have a huge bonus for those students that successfully finish this course : a Certificate !\nWe will send you a digital certificate detailing all of the outcomes of this course, apart form the standard Udemy completion certificate, absolutely free of charge. How awesome is this !\n-------------\nVERY IMPORTANT\n** It is very important for us that our young ones remain safe while online, and as such we adhere to Udemy's Terms of Use , especially regarding young people using this facility. Please read the terms of service below very carefully **\nTerms of Use\nUdemy’s mission is to improve lives through learning.

An organization's IT systems and applications are able to create and manage data flows and how they are processed.\nThere are a lot of processes and methodologies that address data at rest, data in motion, data sets, and how they relate to data-dependent processes and applications. An organization's data sourcing and management strategy should include the primary data entities, types, and sources. A data architect usually designs, creates, deploys and manages data architecture.\nData architecture is imperative for many reasons, including: Helps you better understand your data. Describes how to manage data from initial capture to information consumption. Develops and implements a structured data management system.\nThree layers make up enterprise data architecture:\n· Data conceptual/business model: Includes all data entities and provides a semantic model\n· Data logical/system model: Describes how data entities are linked up\n· The physical/technology model is how a specific process and functionality are implemented on the underlying technology infrastructure.\nThere are 5 main topics I'd like to teach in this Fundamental Course of Data Architecture 2.0 (101 level):\n1. What Data Architecture 2.0 is and why it's relevant\n2. An overview of types, layers, frameworks, and DBMSs\n3. Data Architecture 2.0: Functions, Principles, and Patterns\n4.

      "description": "Ethical Hacking is a field of computer security that involves penetration testing to ensure the security of the software, network, and systems. Ethical hacking is performed by penetration testers and thus has similarities with penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and social engineering.\nThe objective of ethical hacking is often to identify system weaknesses that could be exploited by a malicious attacker or criminal, or even identify potential damage that could be caused by an accidental system failure, before a real-world attack occurs.\nTo accomplish this objective, the ethical hacker typically performs four basic types of tasks: system discovery, documentation and analysis, system exploitation, and system defense. The outcome of a test is often a report that describes how an organization can better secure their systems from real-world attacks and accidents.\nIn this course you will learn about exploitation using a password cracker. You will program three different password crackers using the Python programming language. This is a beginners course but it's recommended that you already programmed with Python. You will learn how to do a dictionary attack and how to program different types of crackers.\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to do dictionary attacks and create your own password crackers.",

NSX-T Data Center supports cloud-native applications, bare metal workloads, multi-hypervisor environments, public clouds, and multiple clouds.\nNSX-T Data Center is designed for management, operation, and consumption by development organizations. NSX-T Data Center allows IT and development teams to select the technologies best suited for their applications.\n+++ First 3 Section belonging to basics of VMWARE Virtualization with vSphere 6.7\n+++ Then we have full fledged NSX-T 2.4 Topics in Detail .\n\n\nVMware NSX-T\nVMware NSX-T 3.0 is the latest generation of VMware’s network virtualization product series. NSX-T is the successor to the NSX-V product. NSX-T supports third-party Hypervisors and next generation overlay encapsulation protocols such as Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve). NSX-T acts as a network Hypervisor that allows software abstraction of various network services that include logical switch (segments), logical routers (Tier-0 or Tier-1 Gateway), logical firewalls, logical load balancers, and logical VPNs.\n\n\nNSX Manager—Integrated management component of NSX-T, provides the functionality of controller, manager, and policy. It is installed as a virtual appliance in the vCenter server environment.\nESXi (Transport Node)—Servers and edge nodes that have NSX-T prepared in the NSX-T data center.\nN-VDS—NSX-managed Virtual Distributed Switch (N-VDS), derived from VMware vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS), de-couples the data plane from the compute manager (vCenter). It is a software abstraction layer present between servers and physical network for network connectivity. It can be created on both host and edge transport nodes and can co-exist with VMware Standard Switch (VSS) and VDS.\nSegments—Formerly known as logical switch in NSX-V, similar to VLANs, reproduces switching functionality in NSX-T environment to provide network connections between attached VMs.\nNSX Edge—Provides gateway and security services to the virtual network. It enables east-west traffic between the VMs on the same host in different subnets without accessing the physical network. It also enables north-south traffic for VMs to access the public networks.\nService Router—Instantiated on the NSX Edge node and provides gateway functionality and services such as NAT, load balancing, and so on.\nDistributed Router—Runs as a kernel module and is embedded in all transport nodes to provide basic routing capabilities such as east-west routing and local routing inside hypervisor.\nNSX Tier-1 Gateway—Provides east-west connectivity.\nNSX Tier-0 Gateway—Provides north-south connectivity. It supports static routing, BGP dynamic routing, and equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing. It is required for traffic flow between logical and physical networks.",

If there are misconfigurations in the Linux system, you are able to change your user: become another user (horizontal escalation) or even become root (vertical escalation).\n\n\nIf you have initial access to a Linux system, but want to become administrator or get access to other Linux accounts, it's possible that you can get that access. If there are misconfigurations in the system, then you can abuse those in order to gain different user privileges on the Linux system. So this type of hacking is about getting more access into a system.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to get root access if the Linux system is misconfigured. The course contains practice labs that will let you practice what you have learned in the course. You'll be able to gain root and practice in several labs. You'll also be able to find if a system is vulnerable to this type of escalation.\n\n\nThis is a beginners course, but basic Linux knowledge would be beneficial. You don't need anything else, not even Kali Linux as the course includes practice labs itself.",

Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, this course offers a comprehensive, hands-on approach to understanding OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, token-based authentication, and more. Throughout the lessons, you’ll explore access tokens, refresh tokens, JWTs, SAML, and other cutting-edge security protocols to effectively secure your modern applications and services.\nYou’ll learn when and how to apply local token validation versus token introspection, how to choose between public and confidential clients, and how to define scalable OAuth scopes that fit your project’s exact requirements. With in-depth coverage of user-initiated flows—such as the Authorization Code Flow, Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), and Implicit Flow—you’ll gain a firm grasp on configuring these flows in real-world scenarios. We’ll also tackle advanced topics like mutual TLS (mTLS), advanced client authentication methods (including JWT and SAML assertions), FAPI-compliant token security mechanisms such as Demonstration of Proof of Possession (DPoP), and even PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) basics to support secure certificate-based solutions.\nFor machine-to-machine communication, you’ll master the Client Credentials Flow and learn how to integrate external identity providers or legacy systems without compromising performance or security.\nYou’ll walk through hands-on cURL simulations, attacker scenarios, and decision trees that make it easy to map OAuth best practices to your specific project environment. By understanding each chapter’s detailed agenda and applying core concepts step by step, you’ll build robust API security strategies that scale—whether you’re migrating a legacy system or launching a new zero-trust architecture.\nDon’t let confusion about flows, configurations, or integrations hold you back.

      "description": "With the growing number of cyber attacks, system invasions, data theft, malware attacks such as Ransomware among others, vulnerability management to prevent invasions and ensure information security has become an indispensable task for IT professionals and organizations in general. In addition to implementing security mechanisms to protect oneself, it is necessary to know the vulnerabilities and deal with them. The issue of vulnerability management is so serious that even in the phase of a penetration test or cyber attack, the phase that precedes the invasion, is the discovery of vulnerabilities, i.e. when an attacker wants to attack a system, he will need to know the vulnerabilities and after knowing them, exploit them. Therefore, in this course you will have the opportunity to learn how to find the vulnerabilities in systems, find solutions, and elaborate a mitigation plan for them and implement countermeasures with the best practices guide according to the Center for Internet Security (CIS Control Set), an entity that works to support organizations to implement best practices for asset management and data backup. It is important to know how vulnerability scanners work for better positioning when it comes to decision making after analysis. After completing this course, you will be able to implement and manage OpenVas as well as assign tickets to the different people responsible for each department where vulnerabilities are detected as well as to IT professionals.",

You'll start with an overview of MPLS and its operation, after which you'll concentrate on MPLS Virtual Private Network (VPN) deployment. The MPLS fundamentals covered in this class will provide the theory and hands-on knowledge to implement, integrate, and deploy an MPLS infrastructure. The MPLS VPN lecture and labs will cover the models, diversity, implementation, troubleshooting, and flexibility of MPLS VPNs.\n\n\nMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a high-performance method for forwarding packets through a network. MPLS enables routers at the edge of a network to apply simple labels to packets. This practice allows the edge devices to switch packets according to labels, with minimal lookup overhead. MPLS integrates the performance and traffic-management capabilities of data link Layer 2 with the scalability and flexibility of network Layer 3 routing. When used in conjunction with other standard technologies, MPLS gives the ability to support value-added features.\n\n\nImplementing Cisco MPLS (MPLS)  training course is designed to gain the skills and knowledge about multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) concepts, installation, migration, operation, inspection, and troubleshooting. In this course, you will learn about VPN technology issues involving MPLS from the service provider perspective and how to configure some of those features and functions in an existing routed environment.\n\n\nThis training course is recommended for the individuals who are responsible for designing, implementing, or troubleshooting MPLS networks or solutions based on MPLS technology and also for individuals seeking the Cisco CCNP service provider certification.",

But even the so-called IT experts drawing huge salaries do not know anything about firewald configuration, and this is why you see news where systems are routinely compromised. IT managers and administrators refuse to learn new technologies, and whatever little they know is shared amongst their colleagues. As soon as someone leaves a company, small organizations, everything is in disarray. I have seen customers screaming at the vendors because they did not get the administrator's password from the old employees. Please do not heed headless and illogical reviews saying that this is an introductory course, and such people would not be able to start firewalld and never seen a Centos system. This is a free course and will meet your expectations, but if you are the complaining jobless type, you will never succeed in life anyway, and you are NOT welcome to take this class.

      "description": "Cybersecurity is a constant challenge for all organizations. When talking about cybersecurity, Read Team and Blue Team are often mentioned as the Red Team that teaches the attacking techniques while the Blue Team helps us know how to defend. The only way to be good at cybersecurity is to learn both the techniques of an attacker as well as a defender. If you are someone who thinks like a hacker and want to deeply explore what are the threats are and how to protect yourself from such threats, then go for this course.\n\n\nThis course starts with setting up hacker’s development lab before moving to Red Team tactics, where you will learn the basic syntax for the Linux tools that are commonly used to perform the necessary operations. You will gain hands-on experience of using Red Team techniques with powerful tools such as Python and Kali Linux, which will enable you to discover vulnerabilities in your system and to exploit them. You will also learn how a system is usually compromised by adversaries, and how they hack user’s identity, and the various tools used by the Red Team to find vulnerabilities in a system.\nIn the next section, you will learn about the defense strategies followed by the Blue Team to enhance the overall security of a system. You will learn about an in-depth strategy to ensure that there are security controls in each network layer, and how you can carry out the recovery process of a compromised system. Finally, you will learn how to defend yourself from social engineering attacks.\nBy the end of this course, you will be well-versed with Red Team and Blue Team techniques and will have learned the required techniques used nowadays to attack and defend systems.\nMeet Your Expert(s):\nWe have the best work of the following esteemed author(s) to ensure that your learning journey is smooth:\n● Sergii Nesterenko is Information Security Consultant and Penetration Tester with 20 years’ experience in the information security and 6 years’ in the cybersecurity field.

Except for IDA Pro, many other debuggers out there are not capable of performing graphical representation of a disassembled software. x64dbg however can do it. It can disassemble a program and also represent it as a graphical representation.  This makes it ideal as a free tool to perform what IDA Pro can do - i.e. static analysis.\nUnfortunately, there is not much information on the Internet on how to use x64dbg to do static analysis, hence this course.  You can use its powerful graphical tool for Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis and Software Debugging. In this course we will learn  how to disassemble a program and represent it an a graphical view so as to be able to easily analyse and understand how the program works - and also to patch programs. The hidden power of x64dbg lies in its ability to run a live debugging session simultaneously with graphical static analysis. And I will show you how to do it in this course.\nWhat you will learn:\nHow to disassemble programs into assembly code and show it in a graphical representation\nGraphical Static Analysis\nSetting breakpoints and stepping through code\nModify program behaviour\nReversing jumps\nChanging register values\nPatching programs\nMoney back guarantee:\nThis course is backed by a 30-day money back guarantee.  So, go ahead and enroll in this course now and start reverse engineering programs the fun and easy way using graphical static analysis!",

No matter if you are totally new to the fascinating world of OSINT and hacking or have some experience, this course will walk you through how both hackers and investigators use these tools and why.\nNow I have been very fortunate in being able to teach OSINT over the years here and on other platforms teaching people from all over the world and in various jobs. You will generally see my OSINT courses as the best seller and sometimes highest rated (It's really competitive out there! And that's a good thing for everyone!) so I think that goes to show that I do work hard on these courses and that people are both learning and enjoying them.

      "description": "OSPF routing protocol is one the best (if not the best) interior routing protocol that many networks' companies use it. It has a lot of features and it is very reliable to be configured on our networks' routers as a routing protocol - that's the good side of the story.\n\nThe bad side of the story: OSPF is a COMPLEX routing protocol to understand and to configure. Many network engineers working with MikroTik products find OSPF difficult and many of them try to replace it with a simple routing protocol which doesn't requires a lot of IT knowledge such as RIP. That's the easiest way to solve the problem, but believe it that RIP will become a big issue and will cause for you a lot of problems when your network becomes bigger with many routers.\n\nFor this reason, I have planned to design this course to go fully into OSPF and to show you how you can configure it on MikroTik RouterOS v7. During this course, I will pass through all OSPF topics & I will explain them in a very simple way then I will do a LAB on each of those topics to show you how you can configure this on MikroTik.\n\n\nFor the whole course, I will be using GNS3 emulator with the Free Mikrotik CHR license to be able to do my labs. If you are already an old students of my courses, then you may already know how to download/install GNS3 and make it work with the CHR image. With this method, you don't need to invest in buying physical MikroTik routers to follow my course.\n\nSo in brief, If you want to understand OSPF in the easiest way possible, don't wait to purchase this course so I can share my knowledge to you.\n\nHope to see you in my course.",

      "description": "If you had always wanted to learn how to reverse and patch packed programs - without unpacking,  then this is the course for you. This course is a follow-up from the earlier course on Reverse Engineering & Memory Hacking. It is the practical application of what you have learnt in the first course. If you think that packing and anti-debugging is good enough to prevent reverse engineering, then you may be in for a surprise. In this course, I will show you how to test the effectiveness of several popular packers by packing crackmes and then reversing them - without unpacking.\nTraditionally packed programs are unpacked before debugging is carried out. This is because a packed program's file cannot be patched. Much of software protection has centered on making it difficult to unpack programs. However,  the important question is: how effective is packing, obfuscation and anti-debugging as a means to prevent reversing? This course explores several packers to find the answers.\nWe will do the analysis using a tool called Cheat Engine, which is a prominent tool used by game hackers. This tool could also be used to study and analyze packed program's processes that is running in memory. You will learn how to perform debugging in spite of anti-debugging being implemented. There is no need to unpack and dump memory.  Instead of unpacking and then patching the dumped files and fixing IAT (Import Address Table) tables,  we will write scripts to hack memory using byte patching using an advanced technique called AOB (Array-Of-Bytes) Injection, by injecting code into code caves (inline memory patching).  In this course you will learn how to do all of the above and more.\nAt the end of this course you will be able to gauge the effectiveness of software packers, obfuscation and anti-debugging protection and also to have a good idea of how to implement extra countermeasures to improve the security of software.\nIn all the practical exercises and walkthroughs, we will use Crackme's which I have written. You will learn how to pack them using several popular packers and then hack them using Cheat Engine.\n\n\nWhat you will learn\nHow to set hardware breakpoints and debug packed programs in spite of anti-debugging protection\nDoing Break and Trace to identify Algorithms for reversing\nIdentifying addresses to do memory patching\nWriting custom trainers (loaders) using Cheat Engine to hack and patch memory\nModify program behavior\nProcess Patching programs\nCreating Lua Scripts for process patching\nTest the effectiveness of Anti-Debugging technology\nPacking crackmes using popular packers\nHack the packed crackmes and patch their memory during runtime\nPrerequisites:\nBefore taking this course, you should preferably be already familiar with how to use x64dbg and Cheat Engine\nWindows PC\nSome knowledge of Assembly would be useful but not compulsory\nSo, go ahead and enroll now and I will see you inside!",

      "description": "The challenges of IT infrastructures and the need to automate common activities has become the major requirements in many large organizations. Puppet is one such configuration management tool that allows to efficiently manage and automate all your IT infrastructure. If you’re a developer, a system administrator, or you are simply curious about learning Puppet, then go for this Learning Path. This Learning Path will help you to automate all your IT configurations and take control over what you do to each Puppet agent in a network, including when and how you do it.\nPackt’s Video Learning Paths are a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that each video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.\nThe highlights of this Learning Path are:\nAn all-you-need-to-know guide for configuring a scalable and highly available Puppet infrastructure\nDevelop the skills to run Puppet on single or multiple servers without hiccups\nLet's take a quick look at your learning journey. This Learning Path gets you up-and-running with Puppet straightaway using real-world examples. You will learn to install and set up Puppet. You will then learn how to use different resource types available with Puppet, writing better manifests, handling dependencies, and using tags to gain more control with Puppet manifests. You will explore DSL, look at dependencies and how Puppet treats individual code blocks. You will also look at how you can manage Cron jobs and run arbitrary commands with Puppet.\nMoving ahead, you'll take your Puppet knowledge to the next level by delving deep into concepts such as scaling the Puppet infrastructure, utilizing storeconfigs with PuppetDB, and using different external node classifiers. Get your hands dirty by running Puppet components in Docker containers, using Puppet to create Docker images, and running applications on Docker along with orchestration using Mcollective. Finally, you will learn how to write custom plugins for Puppet such as facts, resource types, providers, and functions.\nBy the end of this Learning Path, you'll have a solid understanding of Puppet and be a confident Puppet user.\nMeet Your Expert:\nWe have combined the best works of the following esteemed author to ensure that your learning journey is smooth:\nToni Schmidbauer has been working with various Unix/Linux and BSD systems for the last 17 years. He started working with configuration management in 2005 with CFEngine 2 and switched to Puppet in 2010. Currently, he is responsible for a Puppet infrastructure containing around 2000 nodes running Solaris, AIX and Linux. When he's not writing Puppet code he likes to tinker with different programming languages and computers in general.\nAnirban Saha is an infrastructure professional with more than six and half years' experience in infrastructure management at various industries and organizations ranging from early startups to corporate environments. He has worked extensively with configuration management and automation tools including Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Saltstack, and Terraform, to name a few. He has extensive experience in architecting, deploying, and managing large infrastructures. He speaks at various conferences on the latest technologies and is also the author of Salt Cookbook published by Packt Publishing.",

This can happen with Trojan horses, rootkits, or other malicious files. The goal is to maintain access to the target until he completes the tasks he intends to perform in that target.\nCyber attacks are not to be taken lightly. It doesn't matter if you have the most secure firewall in the world; every step in the cyber kill chain reduces your security and leads to breaches of your network. That's why it's so important to know how to spot an attack when it happens -- or ideally, stop it in the first place.\nIn this course you will learn how you can hack a computer using an office document and also using an html application. You'll learn how to create a reverse shell giving you complete access over the computer. You will be able to launch a reverse shell as soon as the user opens the office document. You will learn about metasploit too, a tool that is often used in computer hacking. You will learn how to use the metasploit console and use it to create a reverse shell.\nThis is a beginners course, you don't need any prior knowledge but some computer knowledge like Linux basics and networking is recommended.",

Features include Client connection manager, File explorer, Registry Explorer, etc. More features of C2 will be added from time to time. We will see how to code a traditional reverse shell with C2 which by default bypasses Constrained Language Mode. Next we will see some privilege escalation techniques. Next we will enumerate Active Directory with C# and build our own automation tools. We will write tools that automate Kerberoasting, DCSync capable users, Delegation Attacks and much more. We will write a simple loader that loads .NET executables in memory and executes them. Next we will see how to use WinAPI functions in C# and write tools for Shellcode Injection, DLL Injection, Debugging checks, Backdooring of PE Files and much more. We will also see the structure of PE File format.\nNo programming or Activedirectory experience required.\nThis course explains all the theory necessary to get started into building your own tools.",

      "description": "Protocol analysis is a complicated, and often intimidating, subject. Many engineers, even ones with significant experience, feel powerless and lost when confronted with the sea of data that a network capture can provide. Most courses approach this problem with more overload; diving into each menu item and option with detailed explanations. But when you get done with those courses, you still find yourself wondering “How do I actually use this stuff to resolve problems?”\nThis course is different\nThis course is specifically designed to walk you through the mindset and methodology an expert uses to diagnose problems with Wireshark. No time is wasted on options or features that are not heavily used. Instead, the key skills are trained, with a focus on making sure you understand why this skill is useful, and how the skill is used. Real problems are examined from real network captures, and the techniques used to diagnose these problems are laid bare.\nThroughout this course, you will open the same captures as the instructor, and use the same techniques he uses to see the same results he gets. In this course, you will learn:\nHow to install Wireshark to both take and view captures\nHow to take the best possible captures, maximizing signal and reducing noise\nHow to filter captures using both individual and combined filtering, to arrive at the exact information you need\nAdvanced techniques like comparison captures and ring buffering to diagnose complex corner cases\nHow to use RFCs to understand the function of the protocols you are examining\nHow to use captures to troubleshoot both common and complex problems, such as TCP retransmissions and Black Hole routers\n\n\nAdditionally, you will receive access to all of the example traces used in the course, so that you can follow along as the instructor walks you through his techniques. And all of this is provided in high-quality video, allowing you to complete the course at your own pace.\nFinally, in addition to the course, you will receive:\nDirect access to the instructor\nUpdated content\nA certificate of completion\n30-day, money-back guarantee\n\n\nAll you need to take the course is a computer capable of running Wireshark (Windows, Linux, or Macintosh), and an Internet connection.\nJust click Buy Now, and you can begin immediately.",

Each interview sometimes can be different, but understanding the general requirement for the most interviews is one of the most effective methods to get ready for any cyber security interview.\n\n\nDue to past experience, at least more than 80% of the questions are often asked in most SOC or Incident Response-related job interviews. Students or job seekers will feel more confident when going in for a similar job-related interview. Job seekers are also encouraged to review recruiters of the hiring company's website to understand what the company is all about.\n\n\nSome hiring companies can be tricky sometimes.

      "description": "If you want to build a RAT from scratch and understand every bit of code, instead of modifying some complex RAT that you find on the Internet without knowing how things work, then this is the course for you.\nRemote Access Tools also known as RATs are used to remotely control another PC over the Internet or the Local Area Network. This course shows you in an easy and simple step-by-step approach to start writing such a tool from scratch. RATs are used in network management, remote surveillance, system administration, classroom teaching systems, and so on. It is also commonly misused as a malware known as Remote Access Trojans.  This course is about C# programming and networking but learning it in a fun exciting way by building a Remote Access Tool.\nEven though there are existing open source RATs on the Internet. They are quite complex and the authors do not explain from beginning how they work. This course is created to fill that gap. It assumes you have zero knowledge of networking and coding and is suitable for absolute beginners. The emphasis of this course is to teach the fundamentals of networking, client-server communication, multi-tasking, control and management of server processes, command creation and handling and so on. This will enable you to better understand more complex client-server or RAT projects out there. We focus on the basic building-blocks of any RAT and client-server technology.\nYou will learn first-hand from a Malware Developers’ perspective what it is like to write a remote access tool from scratch.\nThis course is based on the classic RATs development  book entitled How to Write Your Own Remote Access Tools in C#,  which is authored by me in 2007 and published in Amazon in 2011. All source code are taken from that book and updated to make them current in 2021.\nFeatures:\nBuild programs that simulate Windows Remote Access Trojans from scratch.\nLearn C# and networking.\nThe best way to understand how Remote Access Trojans work is to write one.\n\n\nEverything is highly practical.  No boring theory or lectures. More like walk-throughs which you can replicate and follow along.\nBy the end of this course, you will have the basic knowledge to further your studies in RAT development by looking at existing open source RATs on the Internet. This knowledge and skills are suitable for those aspiring to be Red Teamers. Even if you have no intention of creating malware, the insider knowledge and skills you gain from this course will make you a better security professional.\nAlso, having practical knowledge of RAT development will give you a better understanding of how to reverse engineer malware. By the end of this course, you would have gained a solid foundation for understanding how RATs work from the inside out.\n\n\nFree Tools:\nWe will use free tools provided by Microsoft Visual Studio 2019/2022 Community Edition.\nI will also teach you how to enable the Telnet windows feature in Windows 10\n\n\nSuitable for:\nReverse Engineering and Malware Analysis Students\nProgrammers who want to know how Malware is created\nStudents planning on entering Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering, or Penetration Testers as a Career Path\nPenetration Testers and Ethical Hackers\n\n\nPrerequisite:\nWindows PC\nBasic programming knowledge is helpful but not mandatory\nBasic networking concepts is helpful but not mandatory",

You can follow the course using any clean instance of Ubuntu 18.04LTS in your selected VPS provider. Everything will be done from scratch and step by step, without relying on additional services.\nInstall and deploy a complete system with Linux/Ubuntu 18.04, PHP, Nginx and MySQL or MariaDB; in addition to obtaining security certificates in an automated way through Letsencrypt, all for free at no extra cost for your systems.\n\n\nWhy must you take this course?\nBecause it uses the most recent version of Ubuntu (Ubuntu 18.04) which is a Long Term Support (LTS) version. This version allows you to obtain updates and security patches for at least two years, which means that you can deploy your system in Ubuntu 18.04LTS and you will not have to worry about moving to another version for a long time\nBecause there is not another online course which explains every step at this level of detail\nBecause Letsencrypt is a trend, and you will not find content that teaches you how to use it in the way it is done in this course (the correct and simple way)\nBecause the best standards are used to obtain the highest security rating (A+) in the sites that you ensure following the course\nBecause today, the main browsers are demanding secure HTTPS connections in any online site or service, and by following the course, you can secure all your systems for free using Nginx and Letsencrypt\nBecause you will learn to deploy two of the most popular types of projects in PHP, which are Wordpress and Laravel sites\n\n\nWhat will you learn and obtain by following and finishing the course?\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to deploy your VPS server in a very short time and with great ease, using powerful, innovative and safe tools. You will then have your projects online without additional charges, no matter how many domains, sub-domains or projects you put in your VPS, the cost will remain the same.\nAt the end of all classes, you will have all your projects under a completely secure server, with HTTPS/TLS connections completely free through Letsencrypt and with an A+ rating in the secured sites.\n\n\nBut... What exactly will you learn?\nHere you have everything you can get from this course:\nCreate your own VPS server with Digital Ocean or any provider you choose\nHave a safe and friendly system with Linux / Ubuntu in its most recent LTS version (Ubuntu 18.04)\nDeploy an Nginx web server in a few minutes and with the best security settings\nDeploy a MySQL or MariaDB database server wholly secure and without delay\nEasily configure and use Git to deploy the different projects on your VPS via SSH\nObtain external packages and install them globally (composer and Letsencrypt acme·sh as examples)\nCreate and configure your domain and all sub-domains, without having to pay extra\nPoint your domain to your VPS server by configuring the DNS entries\nConnect to your VPS remotely, quickly and securely using SSH keys\nManage user accounts and prevent automated and external systems from accessing privileges (root)\nLearn to use the essential commands (cd, systemctl, cp, sudo, mv, rm, mkdir, reboot, and many more)\nLearn how to manage VPS packages with apt easily\nAssign permissions on folders and files in the correct way with\nDemand for the use of secure connections with SSH, and forget about insecure passwords for all the users\nCreate and handle users correctly with administrative permissions (sudo)\nDeploy different Wordpress and Laravel projects each in a different domain or sub-domain\nUnderstand and take advantage of the use of SSH to connect to your VPS or external services\nConnect with third party service through SSH keys correctly\nEasily configure a firewall (UFW) and dramatically increase the security of your VPS\nConfigure your services (Nginx, PHP, MySQL / MariaDB, etc.) to make them more secure\nMitigate DoS and DDoS attacks with proper configuration of the Nginx webserver\nPrevent automated systems from trying to access your VPS, through Fail2Ban\nSet expiration headers for your projects\nEnable the Gzip compression system on your web server\nAvoid CSS/XSS attacks with Nginx\nGet security certificates for HTTPS connections for your projects with Letsencrypt\nInstall the security certificates in Nginx correctly, to obtain the A + security rating\nUse acme · sh to obtain and automate the installation of Letsencrypt security certificates\nCreation and use of domains and all sub-domains that you require easily\nHow to quickly deploy any project in your VPS\nHow to deploy complex projects in the VPS (Laravel as a case of use)\nAnd it does not end there! You will have lifetime access to all classes, which includes new future classes and upgrades. You will also have first-hand access to the system of questions, messages, and answers, where I will answer all your questions and comments immediately (I always respond). I will be pleased to help with any problem or doubt you have during the course.\nDo not wait anymore. To learn all these skills click on \"Register\" and start feeling the freedom of having your own VPS.\nI will see you in classes :)",

      "description": "In this FirePower Cisco skills training, We will prepare network administrators to learn about next-generation firewalls. This network infrastructure training may not map to a Cisco exam, but it's still an excellent primer for anyone who needs to learn about Cisco’s next-generation Firepower firewalls.\nSecurity is everyone’s responsibility, and Cisco FirePower helps you ensure that everyone is living up to that responsibility with application-layer filtering and control. The resulting ASA firewalls are Cisco’s next-generation firmware (NGFW) devices. With the increasing emphasis on defense-in-depth and security posture, network administrators with FirePower knowledge can set themselves apart professionally, while making sure their users are doing the right thing.\nAfter completing this Cisco Firepower training, you'll know how to use lists and feeds, how to blacklist IP addresses and URLs, and how to implement Security Intelligence (SI) as part of an access control policy in Firepower. Network administrators who complete this network infrastructure course will be well-positioned to step into network security positions or senior network administrator roles.\n\n\nCisco Firepower: What You Need to Know\nThis Cisco Firepower training contains videos that cover network infrastructure topics including:\nConfiguring and verifying routing and network address translation (NAT)\nImplementing high availability (HA)\nBlacklisting IP addresses and URLs\nImplementing security intelligence (SI) as part of an access control policy\nFiltering websites with URL filtering and categories\nImplementing discovery policies\nRegistering an FTD for centralized management\nConfiguring, saving, and deploying changes to FTD from FMC\nWho Should Take Cisco Firepower Training?\nThis Cisco Firepower training is considered administrator-level Cisco training, which means it was designed for network administrators. This next-generation firewalls skills course is designed for network administrators with three to five years of experience with network infrastructure.\nNew or experienced network administrators. Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) are becoming the norm for modern networks. IT pros looking to break into network administrator roles will benefit from knowledge of Cisco’s industry-leading ASA Firepower NGFW appliances. Additionally, the information in this course is an excellent supplement to many Cisco exam prep courses.\n\n\nWhat is FTD and FMC?\nFTD and FMC are Cisco security applications and management dashboards for enterprise-grade networks by Cisco. FTD stands for Firepower Threat Defense and is a security software image that combines the Cisco ASA and Firepower software into one component. FMC stands for Firewall Management Center and is a management application for Cisco security products.\nWhat is difference between firepower and ASA?\nThe difference between Firepower and ASA Cisco Security products is the features included with each appliance. Cisco purchased Sourcefire in 2013 and converted that product to Cisco Firepower. As a result, Cisco Firepower features more advanced IPS features. Though Cisco still offers both products, the ASA-only line of products is slowly being phased out.\nWhat is Cisco FMC and FTD?\nCisco FMC and FTD are security firewall appliances and a piece of management software, respectively. FTD stands for Firepower Threat Detection and is an advanced security appliance that combines both ASA and Firepower Cisco security applications. FMC stands for Firewall Management Console and is a dashboard for configuring and managing Cisco security appliances.\nWhat is Cisco IPS Device?\nA Cisco IPS device is an intrusion prevention system that can perform a deep-packet inspection to prevent a wide range of network attacks. An IPS device can be considered a device like an ASA or Firepower enabled firewall appliance.",

This makes WordPress more popular than Microsoft SharePoint, Blogger, or Drupal. It also means that WordPress is a large target for hackers.\n\n\nHalf of the WordPress sites out there are self-hosted, which means that the WordPress administrator carries the lion's share of responsibility for a secure installation. Out of the box, there are several ways that WordPress security can be tightened down, but only a fraction of sites actually do so.

      "description": "A computer virus is a malicious software program which has the ability to make copies of itself. The computer virus infects the files and programs present on the computer system without the knowledge or permission of the user. It spreads from one computer to another, leaving infections as it travels. Almost all viruses are attached to an executable file, which means that the virus may exist on a system but will not be active or able to spread until a user runs or opens the malicious host file or program.\nThere are a lot of viruses in the world and new viruses are coming up every day. It is good to be aware of viruses and other malware so that we may take necessary actions to protect our system from them rather than being sorry. Computer viruses are a cause of great concern as they cause billions of dollars’ worth harm to the economy each year. So let us understand some more points about Computer Virus.\n1)What is a computer virus?\n2)What are the different types of computer virus?\n3)What are the symptoms of computer virus?\n4)Why people create virus?\n5)What a computer virus can do?\n6)How viruses enter in the computer?\n7)How to protect computer from virus?\n8)Also, we will read what is an Anti-virus and why it is required in our computer devices?\nand much more…….",

In addition, this course will also focus on the transport of SS7 across IP based transport networks. As part of this, the Sigtran User Adaptation layers will be examined, as well as the operation of SCTP.\nSS7 is a key element in the control plane of fixed and mobile networks and in Intelligent Network scenarios. It facilitates communication between SS7 hosted ‘applications’ enabling end-to-end service delivery. This course provides a comprehensive description of SS7 protocols, functions and procedures.\nThe drive towards all-IP networking necessitates the transport of SS7 protocols over an IP domain. This course provides a thorough explanation of how this is achieved using the SIGTRAN ‘toolkit’.\nWhy to take the Course\nEnroll in the course if you need a detailed understanding of the implementation and functions of SS7.\nEnroll now if you need understanding of the need for SS7 and the solutions available for transporting SS7 signalling over IP-based networks.\nCourse Support\nHave you even took a Course and you didn't find the required Support?\nFine, This course is different, We are committed in making this course the best Telecom Course from the support perspective.\nIn This course we are not talking about a specific vendor Solution, But we are talking about Packet Core standards.\nAre there any course requirements or prerequisites?\nAn understanding of the PSTN architecture and circuit- and packet-switched concepts",

Network Access Control, shortly NAC server, jumpers, and anything else are all built on a flavor of Linux OS such as openSUSE, AlpineLinux, Debian, Ubuntu, etc., or a Unix-like OS such as FreeBSD.\nNetwork security should be embedded into the nature of the corporate's network and that is what we learn in this course.\nWe do not care much about vendors and logos, but practical concepts. For example, we dive into Shell commands, TCP/IP and networking fundamental concepts, and core network security principles using open-source, yet industry-proven products.\nWe aim to teach you how standard networking concepts are \"designed\" and are also \"applied\" in work environments.\nWhy a pure Linux-based network? Besides the fact that Linux runs the world, if you learn the secure networking using Linux, Unix, and open-source tools, you will feel pretty confident about their commercial equivalents. For example, if you learn network firewalling using iptables and nftables, you won't have any issues with Cisco FirePower, FortiGate, or Juniper firewalls.\nAs said, we are not into vendors, we are interested in standardized theoretical concepts and practical technics. This method will give you a firm conceptual understanding of underlying technologies and ideas about how finished products like Cisco switches, Fortigate Firewalls, Cisco ISE NAC, HPE Aruba, and so on, actually work behind the scene.\nIn the end, you will run the most common network attacks using Kali Linux against the network you built yourself.\n\n\nYour Learning Key-Terms:\nVirtualization\nGNS3 Lab (with Hyper-V & VirtualBox Integration)\nTCP/IP\nOSI Model\nNetwork Topologies\nIP Subnetting\nVLAN\nTraffic Tagging\nTrunking\nNIC Teaming\nLAGG (Link Aggregation)\nMLAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation)\nBond Modes: Active-Backup, 802.3ad (LACP)\nBridging\nSpanning Tree\nInter-VLAN Routing\nRouting & ARP Tables\nMAC Flood\nIEEE 802.1X & MAB (MAC Address Bypass)\nNetwork Access Control (NAC)\nPacketFence (Open Source NAC)\nExtensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) (EAPoL)\nRADIUS (FreeRADIUS)\nLinux Open Source Networking\nNvidia Cumulus Linux Switch\nopenSUSE Linux\nUbuntu Linux\nAlpine Linux\nLinux Shell Command Line\nFirewalls\nNetfilter Framework\nPacket Filtering\niptables\nnftables\nPacket Capture Analysis\nWireshark, TShark, Termshark, and TCPDump\nLinux Clustering\nkeepalived\nVRRP\nConnTrack\nVirtual Private Network (VPN)\nOpenVPN\nstrongSwan IPSec (swanctl)\nWireGuard\npfSense Firewall (FreeBSD)\npfSense Cluster\nNext-Gen Firewall\nDemilitarized Zone (DMZ)\nEthical Hacking Network Attacks and Technics\nSSH BruteForce Attack\nMITM with Mac Spoofing Attack\nMITM with DHCP Spoofing Attack\nDOS Attack (POD, SYNFLOOD, BPDUs, CDP)\nYersinia\nDHCP Starvation\nDNS Spoofing\nOffensive Packet Sniffing\nARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning attack\nNetwork hacking\nCyber security\nNetwork Hardening Solutions",

      "description": "Welcome to Learn Ethical Hacking / Pen testing & Bug Bounty Hunting A:Z\n\n\nThis Ethical Hacking tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Ethical Hacking. Our Ethical Hacking tutorial is developed for beginners and professionals.\nEthical hacking tutorial covers all the aspects associated with hacking. Firstly, we will learn how to install the needed software. After this, we will learn the 4 type of penetration testing section which is network hacking, gaining access, post exploitation, website hacking.\nIn network hacking section, we will learn how networks work, how to crack Wi-Fi keys and gain access the Wi-Fi networks. In Gaining access section, we will learn how to gain access to the servers and personal computers. In the post-exploitation section, we will learn what can we do with the access that we gained in the previous section. So we learn how to interact with the file system, how to execute a system command, how to open the webcam. In the website hacking section, we will learn how the website works, how to gather comprehensive information about website. In the end, we will learn how to secure our system from the discussed attacks.\n\n\nThe course is divided into four main sections so let's see what we are going to learn:\nNetwork Penetration Testing\nNetwork penetration testing is the first penetration testing that we are going to cover in this section. Most of the systems and computers are connected to a network. If a device is connected to the internet, that means the device is connected to the network because the internet is a really big network. Therefore, we need to know that how devices interact with each other in a network, as well as how networks works.\nGaining access\nGaining access attack is the second part of the network penetration testing. In this section, we will connect to the network. This will allow us to launch more powerful attacks and get more accurate information. If a network doesn't use encryption, we can just connect to it and sniff out unencrypted data. If a network is wired, we can use a cable and connect to it, perhaps through changing our MAC address. The only problem is when the target use encryption like WEP, WPA, WPA2. If we do encounter encrypted data, we need to know the key to decrypt it, that's the main purpose of this section.\nPost-Connection Attacks\nAll the attacks that we performed in the pre-connection and gaining access section, we weren't connected to a network. In this section, we are going to be talking about post-connection attack that means the attacks that we can do after connecting to the network. Now, it doesn't matter that the network is a wireless or a wired network and it doesn't matter that the target was using the WEP or WPA key, we can launch all of the attacks that we're going to talk about in this section.\n\n\nWebsite / Web Application Hacking\nIn this section you will learn how websites work, how to gather information about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc) and how to discover and exploit the  dangerous vulnerabilities to hack into websites.\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone interested in learning ethical hacking\nAnyone interested in  how hackers hack computer systems\nAnyone interested in  how to secure systems from hackers\n\n\nNotes:\nThis course is created for educational purposes only, all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against systems that I have permission to test.",

The only course that you need to start running Kali Linux and ethical hacking tasks on Amazon cloud!\nThere are a lot of options for ethical hacking & penetration testing training, but this course is designed in a way you can practice newest & best techniques on ethical hacking. Here is why:\nInstead of using your own host device, you will learn how to boot & run Kali Linux entirely on the Cloud.\nYou can use any browser to access your Kali Linux.\nYou will have an ethical hacking lab entirely on the cloud. This includes a Windows victim machine as well.  No more cpu & memory problems, no more virtual machines in your local device.\nYou won't have to spend a dime up to 1 year as you will use Amazon AWS Free Tier account for the entire training, provided that you take good care of the running instances to stay under the free limits. I will show you how you can do that.\nYou can access any Linux or Windows machine, directly within your browser. You can continue working in any PC and don't lose the sessions.\nYou can save the entire screen like a movie so that you can show it as a proof of actions. You can later watch these screencasts to improve your skills.\nYou will practice nmap, metasploit, included in the course! Even if you are a complete beginner in cyber security and ethical hacking, or you want to refresh your skills, you will enjoy the course.\nFurthermore, you can apply the skills in many hosting providers or even your own server! Amazon AWS is not the only option here. This is because some of the skills in this course is beyond the topic of ethical hacking.\nThe practical skills you will learn after you complete the course:\nCurrent limitations of an ethical hacking lab\nBenefits of running your VMs in the cloud\nHow to create an Amazon Free Tier account\nHow to run Kali Linux as an Amazon EC2 instance\nEC2 dashboard management\nAlternative terminal operations: A handy chrome extension for SSH sessions\nInstalling xRDP to Kali Linux.

You might have heard of the terms Broken Access Control (BAC) and Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) before, but do you really understand what it is all about? In this course, we are going to go through a list of tools, methodologies, tips, and tricks that will help you level up your BAC game.\nWho am I?\nMy name is Wesley, I own a pen testing company and throughout the years I have had to design my own way of working. This has led me to my favorite issue type XSS but it also came with a surprising exploit type I turned out to adore! I am of course talking about BAC and IDOR. With several years of teaching experience, I wanted to build a course to pass my knowledge on to you and to help you grow without having to go through the same growing pains I experienced.\nWho is this course for?\nIf you are a beginner hacker who is looking to add a new exploit type to their repertoire or even a medior hacker who wants to further explore BAC and IDOR to the point of automation/semi-automating the search for the noble exploit type of BAC.\nWhy BAC?\nWhy BAC? Because it's the most common exploit type of the OWASP top 10 - 2021 of course! This deceptively difficult exploit pulls you in with its allure of easy exploitation but you will soon realize there is much more than just the surface-level exploits you have to take into account. In my bug bounty journey, I have seen how incredibly common this exploit type is and I hope to bring down its prevalence by teaching you how to find and exploit this bug with different tools.",

Instead of letting that get me down, I decided to create an online course as a means of helping me master the concepts I encountered in my training and on the exam.   I created this course as a means of helping me pass the exam and helping others as we go through the journey together.\nThe good news is the training in this course will help you because you'll develop the attacker tradecraft and technical skillset needed to compromise systems.  You'll also learn why attacks work.  This isn't a course about push-button-hacking.  You will learn the rationale behind various real-world attacks and understand the gotches and pitfalls newbies make when using select tools.\nWe are about to have a lot of fun and I can hardly wait to come along side you on your journey to earning your OSCP. Are you ready to have fun studying for this thing?\nGet prepared to go on a ride. You’re about to learn a lot and many of the tactics and techniques we leverage align with real world scenarios.\nAll attacks and techniques are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.\nIf you're a software engineering dreaming about how to pwn boxes then this course is for you.\nIf you're the curious type who wonders what could have been done differently after rooting a box or if you want to know WHY exploits fail... then this course is for you.\nIf you want to stop feeling like an imposter who acts like you know what you're talking about and want to finally feel the confidence, pleasure and peace that comes from REALLY knowing what you're talking about.. then this.... course.... is for you.\nLet's go!  You got this baby!",

The tool is created by Cisco Systems. The purpose of Packet Tracer is to offer students a tool to learn the principles of networking as well as develop Cisco technology specific skills. However, it is not be used as a replacement for Routers or Switches.\n\nIt can be downloaded for free if you have a Netacad account. As Cisco says, the best way to learn about networking is to do it. Hands-on equipment gets students started, but is limited to the number of devices in the lab. Furthermore, Educators use Packet Tracer to demonstrate complex technical concepts and networking systems. Students use Packet Tracer to complete assignments, working on their own or in teams.\nAs a network engineer, I used to simulate complex scenarios first on packet tracer and then deploy them on the real equipments. Please notice though, this course will not teach you networking, but rather let teach you how to simulate and apply your networking related knowledge.",

      "description": "VoIP for Dummies - Asterisk VoIP Server setup with Android, iOS, Win Apps - Using Fully Open Source Server and Clients\nIn this course, we will setup a VoIP server and the client devices and the clients can make calls in between them using the VoIP server. And no prior experience is required.\n\n\nVoIP or Voice over Internet Protocol is a technology that allows you to make phone calls across devices without using the normal analogue phone connection. So your calls will be placed across internet and the normal phone lines are not required.\n\n\nVoIP allows you to make calls from a computer, a mobile phone which is connected to internet, or a normal phone which is connected to a specific adapter called the 'VoIP Adapter'. The major benefit is that since this call is placed over internet, you don't need a separate line or a dedicated line in-order to make the call. Just an internet connection is more than enough to make a call.\n\n\nIf you are a business owner trying to get down the cost of communication at your office, or you are trying to setup a vast call based call centre operation or you are a technical enthusiast who  wants to host your own VoIP server and provide this service to your client users, then this is the course exactly for you.\n\n\nLet me now give you a brief overview of what are the topics that we are going to cover in this course.\n\n\nIn the first session, which is basically a theory session, we will be covering the technology behind VoIP. And we will be covering the architecture and the working of VoIP technology compared to the normal PSTN (Public Switching Telephone Network) that has been there from the beginning.\n\n\nAnd in the next session we will be setting up own own ubuntu based VPS server in an Amazon (AWS) ec2 instance. I am preferring Amazon , because they have a very flexible plan and they have an option called 'Free Tier', which we can use free for one year with a very minimal cost if you are keeping your usage in an optimal state.\n\n\nAnd after setting up the VPS server, we will installing Asterisk, which is a very popular open source VoIP server software available, and we will be installing it into our VPS server and we will also configure the ports, the specific number of ports that are required for the client devices to communicate with other client devices through the server.\n\n\nAnd in the next session, which is an important session, in which we will be configuring the dial plan and the extensions that we are going to use with our server. We will also make configuration to accept audio calls as well as video calls through our VoIP server.\n\n\nFor our VoIP client applications we will be using an application called Linphone. It is also a completely open source application and the advantage is that it is available for all the platforms. For windows, Linux, Mac, Android and iOS device and the source code is completely open. You can download it and customize it as per your needs.\n\n\nThe same configuration settings that you are going to make in this softphone, do the same configuration if you have a physical, hard wired, IP Phone with you. You can enter all these configuration into that and it will also work in the same way as we configure the soft phone clients.\n\n\nAnd in the next session, we will be configuring a windows based softphone, which is our linphone. We will be installing it in our windows and we will configure the option so that it can register with the server and make video and audio calls in between devices.\n\n\n\n\nAnd later, we will configuring it for Android. The same configurations. We will be installing it from the play store in an android device and we will make the configuration so that video and audio calls can be placed.\n\n\nAnd after that, we will have it for iPhone We will directly download it from the iPhone App Store and we will be installing it into our iPhone and then we will try to make calls from iPhone to other devices and we will be testing the video calls as well as audio calls across the devices.\n\n\nLearning and becoming an expert in VoIP technology is actually a very rewarding career because VoIP technology is very extensive so far and there is some time in future where we will discard all those analogue telephone lines and we will rely completely on VoIP based IP telephones. Because we need only a single internet channel , rather than having multiple channels.\n\n\nSo world is evolving into that kind of a technology and VoIP experts are very much required in the market. And by the end of this course, we will be providing with you an experience certificate (Course Completion Certificate), which you will have great benefits, if you are trying for a VoIP based career.\n\n\nSo see you soon in the class room. Let's make our first call ! Have a great day !!",

Generally speaking, hacking is the act of accessing a computer system or network.  The practice of hacking is commonly done by black hat hackers, but white hat hackers also engage in the task. Hacking can be done to facilitate criminal acts such as theft, destruction and extortion. For example, a hacker may access a system without malicious intent and then inform the owner of the incident, who may be able to fix the problem. But it can also be used for securing a companies assets.\nIn this course you will learn how both Windows and Linux can be hacked. It starts with initial access. Then it goes deeper into exploring the system, the meterpreter shell and how to crack passwords on both Windows and Linux systems. By the end of the course, you should be able to hack both systems as long as you gain initial access.\nThis is a beginners course, you don't need prior knowledge of ethical hacking, both knowledge in networks and the command line can definitely help. In this course you'll use Kali Linux, a computer system that is designed for hacking.",

Passwords are in general the keys to get access into a system or an account.\nIn general, people tend to set passwords that are easy to remember, such as their date of birth, names of family members, mobile numbers, etc. This is what makes the passwords weak and prone to easy hacking.\nOne should always take care to have a strong password to defend their accounts from potential hackers. A strong password has the following attributes −\nContains at least 8 characters.\nA mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.\nA combination of small and capital letters.\nPassword cracking is the most enjoyable hacks for bad guys. It increases the sense of exploration and useful in figuring out the password. The password cracking may not have a burning desire to hack the password of everyone. The actual password of the user is not stored in the well-designed password-based authentication system. Due to this, the hacker can easily access to user's account on the system. Instead of a password, a password hash is stored by the authentication system. The hash function is a one-way design. It means it is difficult for a hacker to find the input that produces a given output. The comparison of the real password and the comparison of two password hash are almost good. The hash function compares the stored password and the hash password provided by the user. In the password cracking process, we extract the password from an associated passwords hash.

I'm Ahmed Elhefny, and I am the author and lead product creator at Cyvitrix learning, You'll notice that the course narration uses advanced voice cloning technology. I want to be clear: this isn't a fully automated process. It incorporates a \"human-in-the-loop\" (HITL) methodology, which means:\n\n\nSupervised Quality Control: Every segment of cloned voice narration is carefully reviewed and approved by a human expert (myself, or a qualified team member) to ensure accuracy, appropriate tone, and alignment with the learning objectives.\nAuthenticity Maintained: While my voice is synthetically generated, the content, pedagogical insights, and overall message are authentically mine and reflect my direct guidance. The human oversight guarantees that the voice expresses the nuances and emphasis I intend for effective learning.\nFocus on Content, Not Production: This technology lets us spend more time refining and updating the educational content rather than on time-consuming re-recording. This means you get a more frequently updated and richer learning experience.\nFutureproofing: Embracing this technology allows us to scale our efforts and potentially offer more courses and resources efficiently, without compromising on quality or my unique instructional style.\nWe believe this transparent approach, combining technological innovation with rigorous human oversight, delivers a superior and consistent learning environment. Your understanding and engagement are paramount, and we're committed to providing clear, high-quality instruction.\nNow, let's dive into through this learning journey.",

      "description": "What is ethical hacking?\nEthical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.\nAlso known as “white hats,” ethical hackers are security experts that perform these assessments. The proactive work they do helps to improve an organization’s security posture. With prior approval from the organization or owner of the IT asset, the mission of ethical hacking is opposite from malicious hacking.\n\nWhat Is A Red Team?\nA red team consists of security professionals who act as adversaries to overcome cyber security controls. Red teams often consist of independent ethical hackers who evaluate system security in an objective manner.\nThey utilize all the available techniques to find weaknesses in people, processes, and technology to gain unauthorized access to assets. As a result of these simulated attacks, red teams make recommendations and plans on how to strengthen an organization’s security posture.\n\n\nHow Does A Red Team Work?\nYou might be surprised to learn that red teams spend more time planning an attack then they do performing attacks. In fact, red teams deploy a number of methods to gain access to a network.\nSocial engineering attacks, for example, rely on reconnaissance and research to deliver targeted spear phishing campaigns. Likewise, prior to performing a penetration test, packet sniffers and protocol analyzers are used to scan the network and gather as much information about the system as possible.\n\n\nWhat Is A Blue Team?\nA blue team consists of security professionals who have an inside out view of the organization. Their task is to protect the organization’s critical assets against any kind of threat.\nThey are well aware of the business objectives and the organization’s security strategy. Therefore, their task is to strengthen the castle walls so no intruder can compromise the defenses.\n\n\nHow Does A Blue Team Work?\nThe blue team first gathers data, documents exactly what needs to be protected and carries out a risk assessment. They then tighten up access to the system in many ways, including introducing stronger password policies and educating staff to ensure they understand and conform to security procedures.\nMonitoring tools are often put in place, allowing information regarding access to the systems to be logged and checked for unusual activity. Blue teams will perform regular checks on the system, for example, DNS audits, internal or external network vulnerability scans and capturing sample network traffic for analysis.",

Prior experience with installation and administration, either hands-on or conceptually is highly recommended.\nThe course is organized into a series of video lectures followed by a hands-on tutorial. This course comes with a detailed Lab Guide that you can use at home or work.\nAs an Architect during the day, I am responsible for ensuring that any solutions or services that are deployed to production are architected and deployed in a secure manner. Security is of the utmost importance and it should be yours too.\nIf you have enterprise deployments of WebLogic in production and you are responsible for how these systems are deployed and secured, then this course will help you understand where to start with securing WebLogic.\nSecurity is a broad and deep topic. This course does not attempt to cover every possible security topic related to WebLogic, however. This course does attempt though to cover what I feel are some of the most important aspects of securing a deployment.",

Similarly, If you want to enter into networking field, fundamentals of IP Addressing and Subnetting should be crystal clear to you. This course is designed to make your IP Addressing and Subnetting fundamentals very strong.\n\n\nIn real life, if we want to communicate with someone, we need a phone, it could be landline or mobile. In addition we also need one number, which should be unique, then only we will be able to communicate. Same way if we want 2 or more than 2 systems to communicate, we need unique numbers for the systems, these numbers are called IP addresses. The IP addresses are of two types,  IPv4 (32 bit) and IPv6 (128 bit). But In this course, our focus will be on 32 bit IPv4.\n\n\nIP Addressing and Subnetting is the main ingredient of networking. Understanding and mastering it is going to pay rich dividends to you.\n\n\nWe are going to cover:\n* What is IP Address\n* IP Address Format\n* IP Address Classes\n* What is Gateway/Router\n* Public/Private IP Address\n* What is Subnetting\n* Criteria For Creating Subnets\n* Fixed Length Subnet Mask (FLSM)\n* Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)\n* FLSM vs VLSM\n* Why Subnetting\n* How to Subnet C Class Network\n* How to Subnet B Class Network\n* How to Subnet A Class Network\n* How to Perform VLSM\n* Class A, B, C Subnetting Demo\n\n\nIn real life, to deal with certain things, we have to sometimes use carrot  and stick  policy. In this course, we are going to follow the same policy. Please do not get afraid. For me, Carrot (means Practicals) and Stick (means Theory). This course includes both theory and practicals.\n\n\nLots of material has been provided with this course for your reference. For properly understanding routing and subnetting, We have also created labs on FLSM, VLSM using Packet Tracer and provided lab files along with the course.  The course includes lots of examples on Class C, Class B and Class A subnetting. Two methods of creating subnets has been covered. One detailed method and other shortcut method of subnetting has been covered.

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to \"TryHackMe- Fun Way to Learn Ethical Hacking & Cyber Security\" course.\nTryHackMe- Learn Cyber Security, Ethical Hacking, Penetration Testing with gamified labs to be certified ethical hacker\n\n\nWhether you want to get your first job in IT security, become a white hat hacker, or prepare to check the security of your own home network, we offer practical and accessible ethical hacking courses to help keep your networks safe from cybercriminals. You don't need to know anything for this course.\nIn this course, we will show you a platform that really helps you to get your place in cybersecurity field.\nTryHackMe is a platform that delivers real-world cyber-security training.\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re a complete novice in the security field or a seasoned CTF veteran. TryHackMe has you covered, from a variety of learning paths/walkthroughs/labs to competing against crazy hackers on scoreboards. Ethical hacking, hacking, penetration testing, Tryhackme, certified ethical hacker, kali linux, cyber security, security, hack, ultimate bug bounty\nYou don't need a good computer for preparing a lab. In TryHackMe labs already prepared.\nTryHackMe is an online platform that teaches cyber security through short, gamified real-world labs. The plaform has content for both complete beginners and seasoned hackers, incorporation guides and challenges to cater for different learning styles.\nCyber security is the knowledge and practice of keeping information safe on the internet. It can mean keeping your personal information safe when you browse the internet and visit your favorite websites and social media pages.\nEthical hacking (or penetration testing) involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities.\nPenetration testing skills make you a more marketable IT tech. Understanding how to exploit servers, networks, and applications means that you will also be able to better prevent malicious exploitation. From website and network hacking, to pen testing in Metasploit, Oak Academy has a course for you.\nKali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution released in March of 2013, primarily created for advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. It used to be known as BackTrack Linux.\n\n\nTo allow users to share their knowledge, TryHackMe allows other users (at no charge) to create a virtual room, which contains a combination of theoretical and practical learning components.. In early 2019, Jon Peters started creating rooms and suggested the platform build up a community, a task he took on and succeeded in.\n\n\nThe need for qualified cyber security professionals has never been greater. Cyber attacks are increasing, and so is the cyber security skills gap. Unfortunately, expensive courses and certifications makes it harder for individuals to get into the industry.\n\n\nTryHackMe is created to make learning cyber security more affordable and more accessible, removing as many barries to entry as possible.\n\n\nFAQ about TryHackMe\nWhat is TryHackMe?\nTryHackMe is an online platform that teaches cyber security through short, gamified real-world labs. TryHackMe have content for both complete beginners and seasoned hackers, incorporation guides and challenges to cater for different learning styles.\n\nWhat is TryHackMe used for?\nTryHackMe takes the pain out of learning and teaching Cybersecurity. Our platform makes it a comfortable experience to learn by designing prebuilt courses which include virtual machines (VM) hosted in the cloud ready to be deployed. This avoids the hassle of downloading and configuring VM's.\n\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\n\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\n\nIs TryHackMe free?\nTryHackMe has a both a free and subscription model. The free tier allows access to a large number of 'rooms' or 'hacktivities', whilst the subscription-based offer allows full access to the site.\n\nIs TryHackMe free for students?\n20% student discount is guaranteed to accounts created using a student e-mail address. TryHackMe supports all student e-mail addresses and automatically recognizes domains like . edu and . ac .uk.\n\nCan TryHackMe get me a job?\nMany employers are actively looking for TryHackMe experience - if you type “TryHackMe” into job platforms like indeed, you can see companies who list us it desired experience. This is a great way to shortlist jobs to apply to.\n\nDoes TryHackMe give certificates?\nNot only is the community a great place to ask about certs in general, rooms on TryHackMe can provide amazing and either free or low-cost practice - not to mention we supply one of the most popular cyber security certifications.\n\nWhy do you want to take this Course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you sign up, you will feel the Instructor's expertise.

      "description": "I don't know how exactly this course will change your life. Because it can do it  in many ways, depending on who you are and what you do.\nThat's why before jumping into it you'd better  read the following details to see your benefits.\nSocial Engineering nowadays is considered a kind of communicational black magic that forces people to execute any command of a Social Engineer. And when we say Social Engineering, what it comes to mind first is cybercriminals. Yes, social engineering is a part of their dark arsenal but not limited by it. For example, law enforcement uses Social Engineering to catch the bad guys too. In reality, Social Engineering is an essential part of many walks of life, including politics, intelligence and law enforcement, sales and marketing and even personal relationship.\nIn short, social engineering is hidden influence.\nIf you work in the security sector, be it cybersecurity, business intelligence, law enforcement, private investigations, etc., the benefits are obvious. Your professional skills will skyrocket, so it pushes your career and gives you a bunch of advantages over your competitors. And reward you with that amazing feeling of satisfaction that comes only when you know that your job performance is outstanding.\nBut what if you’re not a kind of a security specialist? Fortunately, you can gain even more. Would not it be dreamy if you’ll be able to detect at a glance when people try to conceal something important from you? What about knowing what your competitors are up to? What about easy spotting scammers, criminals and other bad guys hunting for you? What about your friends and loved ones who fear owning up to something? And would you like to know how others covertly elicit your secrets from you —and finally stop this dangerous process?\nYou’ll be able to do everything from the list after taking this course. In fact, you’ll be able to do much, much more.\nIn this course, I’ll also teach you a special part of social engineering – unlocking people's secrets. Making people voluntary share their secrets, to be precise. And this is the only way to learn how to keep your secrets safe.\nThis course is unique. Because unlike many courses on Social Engineering existing on the market, it’s not about technical tools and software. It’s about the essence of Social Engineering: people’s psychology. It’s not about the vulnerabilities of a computer. It’s about vulnerabilities of the human brain -- how it can be attacked and how to protect it.\nThis course is unique for many other reasons. Firstly, it’s based on my 20 years in psychological security and 12 years in cybersecurity areas experience. In this way, I was privileged to work with brilliant intelligence and law enforcement pros. I’ve learned from them plenty of exclusive useful techniques and tricks that help me in work and life. I share some of these techniques in this course.\nMore of that, the course is also based on tens of authoritative psychology books and science research. So you’ll not only learn the techniques but deeply understand the patterns behind them and why they work. It gives you a fantastic possibility to create your own techniques precisely suitable for your special circumstances. After learning these principles, spotting scam or phishing of different kinds will become a walk in the park for you let alone revealing secrets\nIn the first section, you'll learn what is Social Engineering and why it's so effective. You'll discover the main principle that makes Social Engineering almost unbeatable for most people. Then, in Section 2, we'll deep into tactical Social Engineering. You'll find out about various natural vulnerabilities of the human brain and how they can be exploited in seconds.\nYou'll discover why so many people, including most intellectual ones, fall prey to phishing attacks and give away their bank credentials or infect their computers with their own hands. You'll know sophisticated techniques used by cybercriminals to force their victims to give away their important secrets like passwords and private data. You'll learn how your basic instincts and emotions can be used to play against you and how easily they are triggered.\nIn Section 3 you'll learn the magic of the effective HUMINT elicitation techniques used by law intelligence agencies, law enforcement, secret agents and other pros of such kind. You'll learn to become a person to whom people want to confide their secrets. In this way, you'll know how to gain trust instantly, grab attention, set emotional bonds and become likable for everyone you want (no exaggeration here!). Then you'll learn some extremely effective time-proven techniques that make people share with you even the darkest secrets. More of that, those people will be obliged to you for providing them with this possibility.\nFinally, in Section 4 we'll see how all the techniques we've learned work in the wild. We'll consider three different Social Engineering scenarios. You'll see how an ethical hacker, an intelligence officer, and a police officer can use these techniques to establish their mission of obtaining secrets.\nAnd of course, in the final video, you'll find the answer on how to protect yourself from even the most sophisticated Social Engineering attacks and keep your secrets safe. You'll understand why untrained people can't fight back against a social engineering attack and how to train yourself to never fall prey to a Social Engineer.\nAnd now...imagine yourself, possessing all these skills. Imagine how you apply them and get fantastic results. Imagine yourself as a person who can reveal any secret and... let’s kick off.",

      "description": "n00b To Ninja\nThink You Understand The Basics?\nOne of the questions we often see goes like this: \"Do I need to pass the CompTIA Network+ exam before taking the Security+?\"\nNow this is an excellent question because, although the Security+ exam doesn't have any prerequisites it is still highly recommended that all students have a firm understanding of basic networking technologies.\nThe n00b to Ninja course is a great prep tool to get you mentally and psychologically ready to tackle the Security+ exam (but you can also use it to simply gain a better understanding of how networks work)\nWhat You Will Learn\nNetworking Basics from the ground up (everything everyone already THINKS you know but you know you don't)\nRouters and Switches - what they really do and why we need them\nAll about DHCP - it's not just about automatically getting an IP address\nBONUS: DHCP penetration testing attacks to show you how an attacker might abuse DHCP on a local area network\nDNS from A to Z.  After this lecture you will finally completely understand what DNS is, why we have it and how it really works. All secrets revealed.\nARP: Have you ever wondered why we have both MAC addresses and IP Addresses?  Have you been confused about this?  After this lecture you'll know why we need both (Hint: 90% of IT professionals don't even know the answer to this basic question - but you will after completing this lecture)\nYou'll learn all about IP addresses - we'll break it down to the binary level and show you how to convert between binary and decimal and back again\nYou'll learn the purpose of the Subnet Mask and how (and why) to Subnet Networks - it's a lot easier than you think\nAll about NAT - the greatest inhibitor to innovation but also the reason the internet hasn't collapsed on itself!  IT people like to throw this term around but you'll finally GET it - it'll just make sense after you finish this lecture.\nAll about ports - what are ephemeral ports, well known ports - why we have ports - all that jazz\nWAN technologies - we'll take a step back and look at the internet at large and how routing protocols work.\nHere's what this course will do for you\nThe purpose of this course is really simple: to give you the confidence you need to pass the Security+ exam.\nSure you're going to have fun along the way, and sure you can use these skills to stay in your current job and be a more competent employee but we designed this course to spring-board your entry into the exam.\nOnce you know the fundamentals taught in this course you'll not only be better prepared but also eager to begin your studies for the Security+ exam.\nSo what are you waiting for?  Jump in now!",

The report created may have information, which addresses personal details of an individual or business, who may not have consented to such publication. Those researching for personal reasons; law enforcement, private investigators, etc., must be mindful of this before utilizing this method of information research/gathering.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn many OSINT techniques like collecting email addresses of companies, finding geo location information in images, searching by image, google dorking and much more. While some of the skills are more technical, you don't need to be a computer expert or advanced hacker to do this course. This is a beginners course that doesn't have any prior requirements. If you want to learn about Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), this course is for you.",

and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to

      "description": "A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the primary function is to enable an attacker to gain remote access to and control of a machine, typically for malicious purposes. This is achieved by the attacker sending commands through the reverse shell which are executed on the target machine. In many cases, a reverse shell may be used to bypass firewalls or other security measures that have been put in place on a network or system.\n\nThere are numerous ways to create a reverse shell, but some of the most common methods involve using tools. In some cases, an attacker may even be able to use built-in tools such as telnet or ssh. The choice of tool will often depend on what is available on the target system and what privileges the attacker has.\n\nOnce an attacker has established a reverse shell, they can then begin to run commands on the target system just as if they were sitting at the keyboard. This provides them with a great deal of power and flexibility when it comes to carrying out attacks or performing other tasks on the system.\nOnce you completed this course, you will be able to Hack Windows and Linux computers and completely take over their computers using reverse shells.",

It lacks endorsement from the certification vendor, and participants will not receive official certification study materials or a voucher as part of this course.\nOAuth 2.0 is an open standard for authorization that allows third-party services to access a user’s resources without sharing their credentials. It provides a secure way for applications (clients) to interact with APIs and access protected data on behalf of a user or another system.\nIn this comprehensive course on OAuth 2.0, you will dive deep into one of the most widely used authorization frameworks for securing APIs and managing access control. Whether you’re a developer looking to implement secure authentication or an architect responsible for designing scalable security solutions, this course will equip you with the knowledge and practical skills needed to master OAuth 2.0.\nThroughout the course, you will explore the core concepts of OAuth 2.0, including its workflows, grant types, and token-based authentication mechanisms. You will learn how to implement OAuth 2.0 to secure your APIs and web applications, ensuring that only authorized users can access your resources. The course breaks down complex concepts into easy-to-understand lessons, enabling you to follow along regardless of your prior experience with authentication protocols.\nWe will cover real-world scenarios such as securing third-party access to APIs, using refresh tokens for extended sessions, and handling token expiration. You’ll also learn how OAuth 2.0 works in conjunction with other security protocols like OpenID Connect, and how to apply best practices for token storage and validation.\nBy the end of the course, you will have hands-on experience implementing OAuth 2.0 in a variety of environments, including both server-side and client-side applications.\nWhether you’re building web, mobile, or enterprise applications, you will understand how to secure your systems with OAuth 2.0 and ensure compliance with modern security standards.\nThe main purpose of OAuth 2.0 is to enhance security while simplifying the process of delegating access to resources between clients and servers, all without exposing user passwords. It is commonly used by popular services such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub for secure API access and third-party integration.\nJoin me to gain a competitive edge in developing secure, scalable, and robust systems using OAuth 2.0!\nThank you",

      "description": "THE COMPLETE JAVA WEB SERVICES COURSE\nAre you looking to improve your Java programming skills by learning how to create Java Web Services using SOAP and RESTful web services? Do you want to secure a promotion at your job?\nMy Java Web Services course is all you need to take your Java skills to the next level and position yourself for a pay-raise.\nThe course is a step-by-step introduction on how to develop and implement Java Webservices using all of the industry standard software like REST, SOAP, XML, JSON, Spring Core, Maven and more.\nAll taught by an experienced Java developer with years of academic and business experience.\nThis course will give you a solid theoretical understanding of Java Web Services programming, as well as the practical skills to develop Java Web Services at your job.\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN\nThe primary objective of this course is to help students learn developing Java Web Services using both the widely used technologies that are SOAP Web Services and RESTful Web Services. So in this course students will learn developing these using Apache’s CXF framework which is an implementation of JAX-WS specifications.\nAdditionally I have added lectures to other technologies that are needed to develop these web services like XML, XML Namespaces, XML Schema Definition or XSD, JSON, Java annotations introduction, Spring Core introduction, JAXB, JAX-WS and Maven that will help students also develop basic to slightly more than basic skills on these as well.\n\n\nWHAT IS JAVA WEB SERVICES (AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?)\nWeb Services is a technology or framework that enables applications to make themselves available or expose their APIs to be invoked by other applications over HTTP coded not necessarily in the same programming language. So web services really make applications platform and technology independent and help other applications use the functionality of other applications e.g. A Vehicle Check web service would help another application to provide details of a car by providing only the registration number of the car. Java Web Services is a specification called JAX-WS and JAX-RS that provides collection of Java APIs to be implemented by other third party libraries like Apache AXIS, Jersey, Apache CXF and others.\nJava Web Services provide APIs for both Big Web Services aka SOAP which is JAX-WS and RESTful Web Services which is JAX-RS. Developers use these implementations like Apache CXF to program web services and web service clients. Java Web Services simplify app development by taking the complexity out of application developers when implementing web services and letting application developers focus more on solving the business problems.\nJava Web Services also provide APIs to secure web service using different authentication methods and also add interceptors to web services. Java Web Services can be accessed by applications or web service clients programmed in other technologies like .NET, PHP, C# etc. The new, improved and open source frameworks continue to be created for Java Web Services.\nAll these advantages certainly ascertain a wide adoption by enterprises and hence bright future for Java Web Services.\n\n\nTOP 3 REASONS YOU SHOULD LEARN TO DEVELOP JAVA WEB SERVICES\n1. Huge demand\nJava came a close second among the languages used in GitHub, in the annual popularity contest organized by TIOBE, a Netherlands-based provider of software quality assessment services . Even after 20 years of it's birth, its popularity has grown by 5.94% last year. Its presence is in demand so much that it is currently the No.1 in the enterprise backend domain andhaving significant growth in mobile application development as well.\n2. Future proof\nJava Web Services has become the standard on which many enterprise deployments are built.\nAs Java is open source, there are a number of non-proprietary Java Web Services open source projects\nthat have helped create frameworks like Apache CXF and Spring Boot making Java Web Services more\nrelevant for the changing industry demands.\n3. Get chosen over your competitors\nAdding Java Web Services to student’s skill portfolio at an early stage of their career in programming will\ncertainly provide an edge over other junior developers who generally lack experience in developing web\nservices.\n\n\nGUARANTEE\nIf within 30 days of buying the course you decide that its not for you, please get a Udemy-backed refund. No questions asked - just press the refund button, and all of your money will be returned to your credit card.\n\n\nARE YOU READY TO TAKE YOUR IT CAREER TO THE NEXT LEVEL?\nPlease press the \"Take This Course\" button and start learning 2 minutes from now!",

      "description": "Cloud computing is growing at an astounding pace and Amazon web services are at the forefront of this technological revolution. They were the first one to launch a publicly available cloud infrastructure and ever since Amazon has been a clear market leader in this space. Whether you are an experienced AWS user or are just getting started with cloud computing. You know it is quite easy to get your infrastructure components deployed in the AWS cloud.\n\nBut do you ever wonder what happens behind the scenes:\nWhen you deploy a new RDS database?\nA new EC2 instance?\nHow does AWS manage the complexity of deploying your cloud resources in a secure and isolated environment\nHow do the network packets travel within your cloud infrastructure and how can you and your users access those resources?\nIf so, then we know exactly where you're coming from.\nAWS does provide a very robust and mature network management infrastructure which is ever pervasive in all aspects of the AWS infrastructure. Indeed, it is not necessary to understand the intricate details of these networking details. AWS hides most of these complexities very well. You can simply log in to your AWS management console and start using AWS services. AWS will deploy all the necessary networking components for you in the background automatically.\nBut if you unveil the curtain slightly and take a peek at all sophisticated components that AWS provisions for deploying a secure and robust operating environment – you will get a much deeper understanding of the AWS cloud. You will be able to design, architecture and operationalize your cloud application with more efficiency and confidence.\nThe AWS management tools work very hard to hide these details from you. But for a cloud architect or a cloud administrator who is responsible for designing and architecting cloud applications – this deeper understanding of the AWS cloud’s inner working is essential knowledge.\nTo isolate the cloud environment for each of its users, AWS uses a powerful concept called AWS VPC.\nAWS VPC stands for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. It is a virtual private network that enables us to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that we've defined. It is one of the core components of networking infrastructure within the AWS cloud – which allows us to setup our cloud resources security and privately (isolated from all other AWS cloud users).\nThis course teaches you how to build, configure and manage your own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The course will start with basics of Virtual Private cloud and then move deeper into details about AWS VPC like:\nWhat exactly is AWS VPC and what are its uses\nWhat are the different types of VPCs supported by AWS\nHow to build your own Virtual Private Cloud\nWhat are the various Components of the AWS VPC\nWhat are subnets, gateways, route tables, internet gateways etc.\nWhat are the security mechanisms in the context of AWS VPC\nIf you are serious about understanding your AWS based cloud infrastructure – then gaining this knowledge about the AWS networking components in conjunction with other tools and frameworks is the only way to go. When any startup or technology company is looking to implement their software solutions in the AWS cloud infrastructure – they are willing to pay big money for cloud engineers and consultants to help them manage their cloud infrastructure. In fact, the hourly rates cloud engineers are easily few hundred dollars an hour.
