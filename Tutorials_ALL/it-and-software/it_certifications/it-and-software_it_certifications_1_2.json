      "description": "Description\nWelcome to the ServiceNow Certified Application Developer practice TEST. I have made my best to put down a list of ServiceNow CAD real exam questions. Please note these questions will likely be 90% same on the real test, so please make sure you go through them at least 5 times. I have been digging into the answers so all of them are the correct ones. No true/false questions like on other tests (there are no true/false questions on the real exam either).\nThe questions in the live exam match with the questions provided here. This TEST will help you pass the exam if you knock down the test and look into the answers several times. Enjoy!\nExam Structure The exam consists 2 Tests delivered in a 90-minute period.\nAlmost each question has an explanation of the answer given with a screenshots from ServiceNow instance or the official ServiceNow documentation.\nAbout Questions and Responses For each question on the examination, there are four (4) possible responses. The person taking the exam reviews the response options and selects the most correct answer to the question. A wrong answer, called a distractor, is an incorrect answer a candidate with incomplete skill or knowledge may choose. A distractor is a plausible option that fits into the topic area defined by a test objective, but is not the correct response. Questions are presented in one of these formats. Multiple-Select (one or more answers) An examinee selects at least one response that accurately answers the question. These questions use the phase “Select all that apply” to indicate that there may be more than one correct response. Multiple Choice (single answer) An examinee selects one response that most accurately answers the question. The breakdown of questions is as per the below table\n\n\nLEARNING DOMAIN : Questions %\n1. Designing and Creating an Application: 15\n2. Application User Interface: 20\n3. Security and Restricting Access: 20\n4. Application Automation: 20\n5. Working with External Data: 10\n6.

It covers the SELECT statement in detail, with additional requirements for controlling user access. It is divided into 6 sessions, each of which should take a morning or afternoon to complete.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Oracle.\n\n\nWhat do people like you say about this course?\nPrashant says: \"Course has been designed in way that a person with no knowledge of Oracle can understand it. Good learning and thanks a lot for making such nice course.\"\nShubho says: \"Awesome course. The instructor explains the concepts very thorougly and in a easy-to-grasp way. Also, the practice exercises are super helpful. If you want to master Oracle SQL, this is the course for you.\"\nHenry says: \"I want to thank Phillip for this formidable course. This course along with other materials helped me to pass the 1Z0-071 Exam last Saturday.\"\n\n\nSession 1\nWe'll install for free Oracle Express Edition and Oracle SQL Developer. Then we'll take a look at the 6 principal clauses of the SELECT statement: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY.\nThen we'll start creating tables, but find that we can't get very far without understanding data types. We'll then look at string, date and number types and functions, together with looking at functions converting between them.\nSession 2\nWe'll revisit the SELECT statement and go into more detail. We'll create tables and JOIN them together. Once you have finished this session, you should be secure in your knowledge of the 6 principal clauses of the SELECT statement, the most important part of Oracle SQL.\nSession 3\nIn session 3, we'll looking for missing data, and find out how to delete and update data. We'll look at the difference between implicit and explicit transactions, and various constraints, including primary and foreign keys.\nSession 4\nWe'll start off by saving our queries in views. Then we'll combine tables, not by adding additional columns using JOINS, but adding additional rows such Oracle SQL set operators such as UNION, INTERSECT and MERGE. Then we'll look at analytical functions using the OVER clause.\nSession 5\nSession 5 starts off by adding totals to our SELECT queries. We'll then look at subqueries, and how you can add them into the FROM, SELECT and WHERE clauses, and also into the WITH clause. Finally, we'll look at Oracle SQL self-joins, which are useful when you have hierarchies.\nSession 6\nSession 6 starts off with two additional data types, TIME ZONE and INTERVAL data types and functions. We'll then have a look at SEQUENCEs and INDEXes, together with how these are shown in the Data Dictionary. We'll then create new users, and assign privileges and roles to them, and we'll finish with the last few requirements for the exam.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even install Oracle Database and Oracle SQL Developer on your computer for free!\nOnce finished, you will know what how to manipulate numbers, strings and dates, and create database and tables, create tables, insert data and create analyses, and have an appreciation of how they can all be used in Oracle SQL.",

      "description": "\"Very informative and a great way to start learning more about NSX.\"  - Steve\n\"Best explanation of the OSI model ever!\"  - Nancy\n\n\nAre you looking for NSX Training? Do you want to learn from an experienced trainer who makes complex concepts simple and easy to understand?\nI am a VMware Certified Instructor who has taught thousands of hours of live training directly for VMware. Most lectures in this course are 5 - 15 minutes long. A few deeper topics are slightly longer. This course gives you a complete understanding of NSX concepts. So join me in becoming an NSX Guru today!\nVMware NSX is the most disruptive network technology in recent memory. Demand for employees who understand NSX will continue to grow as the product reaches maturity. This course is designed to help you understand all of the concepts behind NSX. We'll start at the very beginning, and learn basic networking. If you are a vSphere Administrator with a limited networking background this will be a huge help.\nWe'll then learn about the networking tools included with vSphere Enterprise Plus, including Standard and Distributed virtual switches. Basic concepts such as port groups and VMkernel ports will be explained in a clear and simple manner. We'll also look deeper into the feature set, covering topics like Private VLANs, Port Mirroring, and Network I/O Control.\nNSX will be covered in a few different sections. First we'll learn the basics about NSX objects, and differentiate the Management, Control, and Data Planes. From there we'll dig deep into switching and routing functions within NSX. We'll also cover security, and how NSX can provide microsegmentation. I'll explain how Service Composer can be used to provide third party integration. And we'll look at Cross-vCenter NSX, which was released with NSX 6.2.\nThis course will also help you prepare for the VMware VCP exam. The new VCP-NV 2019 Certification can be achieved by passing the NSX 6.2 exam that this course is based on. In order to take the VCP6-NV exam you will need to complete some course requirements from VMware as well. Be sure to check those out as you prepare to get certified.\n\n\nWhat you’ll learn\nDescribe basic network concepts such as ARP, MTU, Spanning Tree, Routing, and Switching.\nUnderstand vSphere networking components and terminology, including Standard and Distributed Virtual Switches, VMNICs, vNIC, and VM Port Groups.\nUnderstand key concepts related to VMware NSX Switching, Routing, and Security.\nDescribe the features of the NSX Edge Gateway, such as NAT, VPN, and Load Balancing.\nAre there any course requirements or prerequisites?\nYou should have a basic understanding of networking and virtualization concepts prior to taking this course.\nWho this course is for:\nThis network virtualization course is meant for system administrators and network engineers who need to understand how VMware NSX works.\nAnyone planning to take the VCP 6 NV Network Virtualization exam (2V0-642)",

      "description": "* Updated for the 2024 CISSP curriculum and 2023 exam registration process *\nWelcome, I am Thor Pedersen, and I am here to help you pass your CISSP certification.\nWith over 700,000 enrollments from 201 countries, my CISSP, CISM, and Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) courses are both the “Best Selling” and “Highest Rated” here on Udemy.\nIn this course I will cover how to approach practice tests, how to deconstruct practice questions, time management, how to make your own CISSP study plan, and finally you get 125 HARD CISSP questions in a full CISSP practice test.\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam questions does.\n\n\nGetting your CISSP certification now is a very smart career move.\n1. The CISSP certification is the gold standard for IT Security certifications.\n2. There are more than 82,000 job openings for CISSPs in the US.\n3. The average CISSP salary in the US is over USD147,000 a year.\nWhat our other students are saying about my CISSP courses:\nI passed the CISSP with the ISC Book and Thor's lectures and practice questions. Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of the test you will get an explanation for each question and explaining to why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does.\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions\nAsset Security – 13 questions\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions\n\nI recommend students to do 1,500-3,000 easy/mid CISSP practice questions and 1,000-1,500 HARD CISSP practice questions before the exam.\nI only know of 3 hard CISSP practice sets: my own hard questions, Boson questions, and SNT. Wentz Wu also has hard questions on his CISSP blog, but not as full practice tests.\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it. This is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right and answering from an IT Security manager's point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.\nOn hard questions, you will score lower. It is normal to score 80%+ on easy/mid questions and 50-60% on hard questions.\nThe point of all questions is to find the gaps in your knowledge, learn how to deconstruct questions, argue WHY the answer you chose is the RIGHT answer in this scenario, making you ready for exam day.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nYou'll Also Get:\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days no questions asked, money back guarantee.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

      "description": "You’ve just stumbled upon the most in-depth Computer Organization & Organization course series online. With over 4000 students enrolled and 500+ 5 star reviews to date in the area of computer science, my computer science courses are enjoyed by students from 101 countries.\nWhether you want to:\n- build the skills in computer architecture and organization\n- crack interview questions on cache memory and mapping techniques of computer architecture and organization.\n- or just understand computers on how they make use of cache memory.\n\n...this complete Masterclass on cache memory is the course you need to do all of this, and more.\n\nAre you aiming to get a degree in the area of computer science as a topper ?\n\nThis course is designed to give you the skills you need to answer any question on cache memory. By the end of the course you will understand cache memory topic of computer organization extremely well and be able to answer any question on cache memory.\n\nLots of students have been successful with getting their first job or a promotion after going through my courses on computer science.\n\nWhy would you choose to learn Computer Organization & Architecture ?\nThe reality is that there is a lot of computer science courses out there. It's in the hundreds. Why would you choose my courses ?\nThe number one reason is its simplicity. According to many students in udemy, my courses are simple to understand as I always teach concepts from scratch in a simple language.\nThe second reason is you get a mentor for computer science through this course. I get lot of doubts from students regarding their career in computer science like which elective subject to choose, which book to refer, etc.\nThe third reason is, you are not just watching my videos, you can also ask doubts if you get one while watching the lectures.\nWhich text book should you refer ?\n\nI have used Computer Organization by Carl Hamacher. Its a great textbook. You can follow it. But I have referred lot of other textbooks like Hennessy Patterson, William Stallings, etc. So its upto you on which textbook you are comfortable with but follow a standard author book. If you complete this course, you will find it much easier to understand these textbooks. But anyway if you complete this course with good detailed notes, you don't need to read any textbook as I am reading them for you and giving the contents in an easy to understand manner.\n\nWhy should you take this course?\n\nYou will be joining over 4000 students who are already enrolled in one of my courses.\nThere are 1000+ reviews left by students. My Courses are rated as the best course to learn computer science for beginners.\n\nWhat makes this course a standout?\nLike you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with incomplete Youtube tutorials which assume you already know a bunch of stuff and also bulk textbooks able to send even the most intuitive person to sleep.\nLike you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics and all-round confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in my courses. It’s designed in a simple manner so that anybody who has a basic idea of paging (which is covered in my operating systems part 2 course) will be able to understand.\n\nWhat if I have questions?\nYou can ask questions anytime using the Q/A section or through personal messages. I take it very seriously and answer these questions in a detailed manner with simple english words so that anybody can understand it.\nStudent Quote: “Everything you always wanted to know about OS but were afraid to ask\"...And Vignesh Sekar gives the right answers” by Claus Kaliba.\nThere’s no risk either!\nThis course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let me know and I’ll refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.\nYou either end up with Computer Organization skills, learn other core computer subjects, get placed in top notch companies or research areas or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it…\nYou literally can’t lose.\nReady to get started ?\nEnrol now using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to computer science.\nSee you on the inside (hurry, Computer Architecture & Organization Series is waiting!)",

      "description": "These AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals practice exams are patterned after the latest exam format and updated regularly based on the feedback from our team of expert exam question authors. Our AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals practice tests are TOP-NOTCH and the CLOSEST to the actual exam, covering every objective listed on the Microsoft AZ-900 exam page.\nBefore you attempt the certification exam to earn a Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification, it is recommended for you to take these AZ-900 practice tests. It is possible that you have read all the available Azure documentations online yet still fail the exam! These Azure AZ-900 practice tests simulate the actual certification exam and ensure that you indeed understand the subject matter.\nThis Exam AZ900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Practice Exam is for anyone who is looking for study material that provides the following:\n120 TOP-NOTCH Questions - has 2 sets of questions split by the official exam domain areas, with UNIQUE questions in each set, and a 120-minute time limit for each set as follows:\n\n- Describe cloud concepts (25–30%)\n- Describe Azure architecture and services (35–40%)\n- Describe Azure management and governance (30–35%)\n\n\n· SIMULATES ACTUAL EXAM QUESTIONS- mimics the actual, and the latest Azure Fundamentals certification exam to help you pass and even ace the AZ-900 exam!\n· DETAILED EXPLANATIONS, SCREENSHOTS, REFERENCE URL LINKS - our answer keys for each question provide comprehensive learning and links to official docs Microsoft com reference materials so you can check and verify yourself that the answers are correct and to help you better understand the concepts.\n· MOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\n· CLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has a reference link that can validate the answer, but you can also post in the QA section, so we can discuss any issues.\n· Prepared by an Azure Certified Professional who has passed the exam!\nPlease also note that these AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals practice tests are not brain dumps and since Microsoft shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of Azure services and this is what our AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals practice tests are meant to do.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these Azure practice tests for you to pass the test and earn your Fundamentals level badge of honor. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nOur Azure Fundamentals practice exams have a passing score of 72% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 75% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the Azure exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in Azure. Nonetheless, these Microsoft Azure services practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment on which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!\nWho this course is for:\n· For those who are about to take the AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification exam\n· For all IT Professionals who want to gauge their Azure knowledge for their upcoming job interview\n· For anyone who want to take their career, and salary, to a whole new level with an Azure Fundamentals certification!\n\nGood luck!",

Even though many business applications use other forms of computing, the Mainframe occupies a coveted position in the current e-business environment. The mainframe computer continues to form the foundation of modern business in industries such as banking, health care, insurance, public utilities, and government. When you work in the mainframe computing world, you must know JCL (i.e. job control language or Mainframe JCL), which tells Z/OS what resources are required to process a batch job or start a system task.\n\n\nWhat is JCL in Mainframe?\nThe term JCL stands for Job Control Language. JCL is a scripting language used by IBM's mainframe systems to instruct the systems on how to initiate a batch job or start an online subsystem particular, Mainframe JCL (i.e., job control language) specifies which programs to execute with which input and output devices, as well as whether or not there are additional conditions which need to be met before proceeding with the step.\n\n\nThere are three basic JCL statements (i.e., job control statements):\nJOB: Provides a job name to the system that will be used for this batch workload. In addition to accounting information, there are a few job-related parameters that may be present.\nEXEC: Identifies a program to be executed. A job may contain more than one EXEC statement. These statements are referred to as job steps.\nDD: The Data Definition provides inputs and outputs to the execution program on the EXEC statement. Using this statement, you can link a data set or other I/O device or function with a ddname coding in the program. A DD statement is associated with a particular job step.\nJCL details can be complex, but the general principles are quite straightforward. In addition, a small subset of JCL is used for at least 90% of the process.\nThis JCL course discusses all key concepts. The following are some highlights of the course.\nMainframe Architecture and Tools.\nJCL Overview and Basic Concepts.\nJCL Procedures and overriding techniques.\nMainframe utilities and how to use them in JCL's.\nMainframe Datasets, VSAM and GDG's.\nJCL tips and tricks and advance parameters.\nJCL interview questions and answers.\nJCL abend code and return code.\nDemo Class and practice test.\nJob Control Language is the language used to control z/OS. Therefore, if you're a developer or operator who works with a mainframe running one of the operating systems, you need to understand JCL. Despite the fact that programmers often get by with minimal JCL skills, the best ones acquire a solid set of skills as it helps them get more done in less time.\n\n\nNote: This course does not include Mainframe IDs. You must arrange your own Mainframe ID. For a list of topics covered, please refer to the content section. It is a pleasure to have you as a student. I would appreciate it if you would leave feedback because your feedback is important for us!\n\n\nTags: #jcl #mainframejcl #jclcourse #jclconcept #jclinterviewquestions #learnjcl #mainframeconcepts #vsam #gdgconcepts #cics #tutorialpoint #topictrick",

      "description": "Welcome! This course has been updated on 4/2020.\n\nThis course has been evaluated and is up to date for the new curriculum for those students seeking the new 200-301 CCNA Exam. This course focuses on the ground work to any network administrator or engineering career and certification path. All of the protocols, standards, and processes discussed in this course are the foundations required not only for the current, and future exam, but for your career.\n\nYou will notice two sections:\n1.) The older section which is still important and relevant to your CCENT or CCNA Studies for Networking Fundamentals\n2.) The newer section which is a highly reputable training I have done for years and after popular demand and requests, have decided to add it to this course for my students.\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING THROUGH THE FUNDAMENTALS FIRST THEN GOING THROUGH iOS ADMIN SECTION. Even though most of you will find the iOS Administration Lectures more 'fun', you need the fundamentals. So please, go through the entire course and you will leave this course with excellent knowledge on the subject matter, and a smile on your faces.\n\n\nThis course is going to be super rewarding for all of you new comers as far as Networking is concerned.\n\nJoin the STUDENTS that LEARN and SUCCEED! (Reviews from ALL courses)\n★★★★★   Really enjoyed the network diagrams and detailed explanations. I would take more courses from this instructor!\n★★★★★  Great course and excellent teaching methodology!\n★★★★★  Love the way Keith teaches. He phrases concepts in a manner that is easy to follow and understand!\n★★★★★ Great course! Definitely will recommend this to others. If you like non dry material with good overall explanations and not just explanations written from a book, then take this course!\nAbout this course!\nMaybe some of you are not even in the IT industry yet, or maybe some of you are stuck at the bottom in a position you really don’t care for. Maybe you need to prep for  your Cisco CCNA exam but just keep getting soo overwhelmed with the amount of material, or maybe your are having a hard time knowing where to begin or, maybe your just having trouble staying on track with your studies. Well, let me tell you something - if you fall into any of these situations.. LOOOK NOOOO FURTHER!\nAlthough this is an Introduction course… guess what!\nWe are going to be covering many important topics in this course related to Cisco’s curriculum, to get you ready and get that ball rolling! I specifically designed this course so you can see the basics of a lot of the main topics, and have a solid understanding of them. This way, when you dive into my full ccna course, or any of the other awesome instructors ccna courses out there, the foundation is already set. So what do I mean by all of this? It means  youll have a clear, basic understanding of all the overwhelming amount of information in the full ccna course, and when you begin your Full CCNA course, you will then only be required to fill in the missing details to have a full understanding and to successfully pass your cisco exams.\nSo, how am I going to do this?\nWell, This course will be comprised of two major components.\nFirst comes Theory – Yes the boring stuff, but - You need to understand some key terms, protocols, and well fundamentals as a whole so you can have a good basic understanding of what is going on, and really to know what the heck networking even is. I promise if you listen to the information I present you, you review the information, study the information… you will be golden. You will have that foundation you need to move forward with the Full CCNA curriculum.\nNext, we have  Practical – Yes the FUN stuff, like hands on labs! Like most of us out there, a lot of us are hands on learners and we need to physically configure or build something to see how its actually working. Well, this course will be made up of about 2 thirds of labs. You will learn how to install a virtual network simulator, and learn every basic component for switches and routers, and then we will begin configuring them. We will start off building simple labs, and then review all the Theory we learned while building these simple labs at first so all the informtion you learned before this LABS section will make more sense, and you physically see them working together. Once we start getting the basics covered, we will move into more complex labs and really start building some nice labs with many different features. By the end of the practical section, I promise... you will be able to configure a small office, home office Local Area Network, using cisco hardware, and be able to troubleshoot these networks for any network issues.\nSo, is this course for you? Well, only you can really make that assumption. I will encourage you to consider this course as I said, it will make your life easier when you dive into the Full CCNA curriculum. You wont spend so much time trying to retain so much information at once.  This course, we keep the material to the basics and key points so it makes sense. Yes you will have to study and put a little work in on your end, but if you work with the material and tools I give you, you will be set!\nIf you have any questions what so ever, please leave me a message or personally shoot me an email. One thing to know is that if you're ever in need of help – I am here for you!\nSo, without further ado, I hope you make the right decision which fits your current level of knowledge and education best. If you are new this whole IT and Networking industry, and you feel that this course would be right for you, I really look forward to being a part of your journey!",

Here's what some of my other students have to say about them:\nI passed my exam as of yesterday. Thanks so much for all the information. The way the course taught me how this test was going to ask me questions was so accurate. Thanks so much! (Katie 5-stars)\nUsed this course to prepare for the exam and passed first time. So far the best instructor I have found on this platform.  (Annette 5-stars)\nThanks Thor, this was excellent-keep up the great work! I passed on my first attempt after going through the course , this also helped in studying and passing Comptia Security+ because some of the concept I already got from studying for Certified in Cybersecurity. (Rosanne 5-stars)\nI passed my exam yesterday, I must say this course helped me a lot! it was my second attempt. I bought this course after I failed on my first attempt. THOR is a great teacher, with lots of techniques and insights during the lessons. this course is very easy to understand. Don't think twice go for it. The secret in life is not to give up!

We respect the Trademarks of the mentioned company and institution.***\n\nMikroTik MTCRE is at the 2nd level certificate from MikroTik, and it is considered in the Engineering level. This course will speak about everything related to Routing at the Intermediate level. Being MikroTik MTCRE certified is a prerequisite for the higher level Routing certificate which is MTCINE\nFor this reason, I have designed this course to help you understanding how Routing happens in MikroTik and be read for the MikroTik MTCRE exam.\n\nThis course will contain theories but a lot of LABS. For this reason, if you want to follow this course I advice you to have 1 PC and 5 or MikroTik Routers with UTP Cables. Alternatively, you can use MikroTik CHR on GNS3 to emulate the LABS, and which GNS3 you don't require any physical Routerboards as all LABS can be done on GNS3\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn the following topics:\nMore specific routes\nECMP\nHow to force gateway over specific interface\nGateway reachability check and route distance\nRouting mark and route policy\nRecursive next-hop and scope/target-scope usage\nWhat is OSPF?\nHow OSPF protocol works\nHello protocol\nDatabase distribution and LSA types explained\nOSPF network structure\nAreas\nRouter types\nOSPF neighbors and neighbor states (DR and BDR election)\nExternal Route Distribution methods (type1, type2)\nInterface cost and interface types (broadcast, NBMA, etc.)\nSPT calculation algorithm\nOSPF and multicast (problems with NBMA)\nStub, NSSA and area ranges (route aggregation)\nVirtual links, usage and limitations\nSPF routing filters and limitations\nWhat is VPN?\nDifferent types of VPN\nSite to site connectivity with tunnels\nIPIP, EoIP, PPTP, SSTP, L2TP, PPPoE\nVLAN and it's usage\nVLAN and managed switch\nVLAN and switch chip configuration on RouterBOARDs\nQ-in-Q implementation\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are many topics that are covered in this course and on each of the topics there are sub-topics. A lot of LABS will be done on each of the topics so you can understand practically how you can configure all these topics on the MikroTik.\n\n\nFinally, if you want to have a global understanding of all MTCRE topics and be ready for the MTCRE exam, all you need to do is to register to my course and I assure that your goal will be achieved.",

      "description": "Hi, welcome to the 'NumPy For Data Science & Machine Learning' course. This forms the basis for everything else. The central object in Numpy is the Numpy array, on which you can do various operations. We know that the matrix and arrays play an important role in numerical computation and data analysis. Pandas and other ML or AI tools need tabular or array-like data to work efficiently, so using NumPy in Pandas and ML packages can reduce the time and improve the performance of the data computation. NumPy based arrays are 10 to 100 times (even more than 100 times) faster than the Python Lists, hence if you are planning to work as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist or Big Data Engineer with Python, then you must be familiar with the NumPy as it offers a more convenient way to work with Matrix-like objects like Nd-arrays. And also we’re going to do a demo where we prove that using a Numpy vectorized operation is faster than normal Python lists.\n\n\nSo if you want to learn about the fastest python-based numerical multidimensional data processing framework, which is the foundation for many data science packages like pandas for data analysis, sklearn & scikit-learn for machine learning algorithm, you are at the right place and right track. The course contents are listed in the \"Course content\" section of the course, please go through it.\nI wish you all the very best and good luck with your future endeavors. Looking forward to seeing you inside the course.\nTowards your success:\nPruthviraja L",

Our AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator practice tests are TOP-NOTCH and the CLOSEST to the actual exam, covering every objective on the Microsoft AZ-104 exam page.\nBefore you attempt the certification exam to become a Microsoft Azure Administrator, it is recommended for you to take these AZ-104 practice tests. It is possible that you have read all the available Azure documentations online yet still fail the exam! These Azure AZ-104 practice tests simulate the actual certification exam and ensure that you indeed understand the subject matter.\nThis Exam AZ104: Microsoft Azure Administrator Practice Exam is for anyone who is looking for study material that provides the following:\n180 TOP-NOTCH Questions - has 3 sets of questions split by the official exam domain areas, with 60 UNIQUE questions in each set, and a 120-minute time limit for each set as follows:\n\n\nThe practice tests  cover the following areas of study:\n- Manage Azure identities and governance (20–25%)\n- Implement and manage storage (15–20%)\n- Deploy and manage Azure compute resources (20–25%)\n- Implement and manage virtual networking (15–20%)\n- Monitor and maintain Azure resources (10–15%)\n\n\n· SIMULATES ACTUAL EXAM QUESTIONS- mimics the actual, and the latest Azure Administrator certification exam to help you pass and even ace the AZ-104 exam!\n· DETAILED EXPLANATIONS, REFERENCE URL LINKS - our answer keys for each question provide comprehensive learning and links to official docs Microsoft com reference materials so you can check and verify yourself that the answers are correct and to help you better understand the concepts.\n· MOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\n· CLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has a reference link that can validate the answer, but you can also post in the QA section, so we can discuss any issues.\n· Prepared by an Azure Certified Professional who has passed the exam!\nPlease also note that these AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator practice tests are not brain dumps and since Microsoft shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of Azure services and this is what our AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator practice tests are meant to do.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these Azure practice tests for you to pass the test and earn your Associate level badge of honor. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nOur Azure Administrator practice exams have a passing score of 72% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 75% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the Azure exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in Azure. Nonetheless, these Microsoft Azure services practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment on which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!\nWho this course is for:\n· For those who are about to take the AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator certification exam\n· For all IT Professionals who want to gauge their Azure knowledge for their upcoming job interview\n· For anyone who want to take their career, and salary, to a whole new level with an Azure Associate certification!\n\nGood luck!",

It will allow you to develop spring apps, with a lot of ease.\nThis course will talk about pretty much all the Spring REST concepts with beautiful examples (Including O’Auth, Reactive programming, etc), In beginner friendly way.\nThis course will also give you a brief understanding on Spring Boot and it’s features. Along with examples.\nCheck the complete curriculum below..\nWhy should you learn Angular?\nAngular is the front end app, that makes REST API Calls to a remote webservice created using spring.\nAngular is the most popular front end JavaScript framework\nKnowledge on Java Script framework is an absolute must for any job role\nLearning about angular will lay a solid foundation to learn any other JavaScript frameworks like React, Node, Vue JS, etc.\nAlthough, this course is not an exclusive course on Angular, this course includes a 3 Hour crash course on Angular, that will familiarize you with all the Features of Angular with examples.\nThis is enough for you to work on Angular Projects.\nWhat will you learn in this course?\n‘Spring Boot REST with Angular’ will teach you all the essential concepts, in detail and with practical examples (Including, creation of an end-to-end Full Stack Application). The following is the course curriculum.\n‘Spring Boot REST API with Angular’ syllabus :\n\n\nFoundations of RESTful Web Services: Learn the principles of REST, the pitfalls of traditional MVC, and how Spring Boot revolutionizes API development.\nComprehensive CRUD Operations: Master building RESTful endpoints, including creating, updating, and deleting resources, while handling real-world challenges like content negotiation and HTTP status codes.\nAdvanced Concepts: Explore cutting-edge topics like:\nContent Negotiation: Learn techniques like HTTP headers, request parameters, and path extensions for customizing API responses.\nHTTP Caching: Delve into caching mechanisms like ETag, Cache-Control directives, and efficient handling of stale data.\nError Handling and Validations: Implement robust error-handling strategies and create custom validation rules.\nReactive Programming with Spring: Discover how to handle asynchronous data streams, backpressure, and live streams with reactive paradigms.

Topics include Angular components, routing, HTTP client, dependency injection, and data binding.\nKey Topics Covered\n\nThe nuances of RMI and SOAP vs REST\nPOSTMAN client usage for API testing\nSpring Boot features like JAR and WAR deployments\nReal-world challenges with PATCH, PUT, and DELETE requests\nImplementing parallel streams and handling timeouts with REST templates\nUnderstanding idempotency and safe HTTP methods\nPractical examples with live streaming data and reactive MongoDB integration\n\n\nFew random reviews on my teaching style\n★★★★★\n“Instructor has great knowledge on the topics he covered.”\n\n★★★★★\n“An excellent trainer.I would really to take his courses always .The trainer prepares the student to go in the market and secure a job.”\n★★★★★\n“This course is really worth it. The tutor has ample practical knowledge and discusses about almost everything that is there to know. I am glad i took this course and would encourage any aspirant to go for it.”\n★★★★★\n“Good, clear instructor with uncluttered focused examples – recommended.”\n★★★★★\nOn my Java course : “Liking the course so for. Very good explanation of each concepts, explaining the fundamentals on each topic, all the way till what happens in memory in each, explaining the “Why’s” in the beginning of topic (which is very important to me, otherwise one would be just memorizing). I liked the author’s approach to start with explaining methods and then expanding it to classes, objects and others. This course is good value for the money.”\n\n\nKnowledge Notes!\nWhat is Spring Boot REST?\nI don’t want to get too technical (Assuming that you are beginner). This was explained well in detail in the course. But roughly speaking, the main purpose of REST API is to decouple presentation from Business and Data tier, so that the same code can be used for both Mobile and Web applications.\nIn other words, a REST API will not return HTML, like in case of traditional applications. But, will return Data. Because, guess what! HTML works on browsers but not on mobile app.\n\n‘Spring Boot’ on the other hand will help us develop spring apps in rapid manner. Basically, it follows “convention over configuration” principle. Which means, with spring boot, developers can focus on writing the code that matters and don’t have to take care of configurations and other boilerplate code.\nThis is all discussed in the course, in detail.\nWhat is reactive programming in Spring boot REST?\nAgain! This was explained well in the course, but to put it simply, reactive programming will reduce the thread wait time on the server. So that, more requests can be processed at a time.\nIf you want to know ‘How’! Then, it’s hard to explain in typing. It’s explained well in the course.\nWhat is Angular?\nTraditional apps used to return HTML and so they can be rendered directly on the browser. But, a REST API will return ‘Data’ without presentation.\nSo then, who will take care of presentation part? Well, you guessed it. Angular!\nAngular is an application that runs on the browser and acts like a client app for REST API. Angular is much more than just that though! Better check out the course lectures.\nI hope to see you in the course. Either way, I wish you good luck for your future endeavors!\n\n\nYour well wisher,\nKarthikeya T",

I always like to organize my Salesforce study for any certification to be based on the objectives. I always get the latest exam guide, understand each objective, and go through every requirement of every objective, this way I am sure to cover everything needed to pass the exam.\nThe sections of this course are aligned with the objectives, and they are:\nData modeling/Database Design\nMaster Data Management\nSalesforce Data Management\nData Governance\nLarge Data Volume considerations\nData Migration\nAll supporting references are also included. These include Trailhead modules and trails, external links for articles and videos.\nI will make sure to update the videos after every release, if Salesforce changes the exam objectives.\nFinally, I have been there, I spent hours and hours preparing for this exam, I dissected each and every topic of the Study Guide, and took tons of notes, just like I did when preparing for my other certifications. I guarantee that after completing this course, after exploring all the provided resources, and after practicing on the Salesforce environment, you will pass this exam, and you will become a Salesforce Certified Data Architect!\n\nGood Luck!\nWalid",

This exam validates an examinee’s comprehensive understanding of using AWS services to design, build, secure, and maintain analytics solutions that provide insight from data. Take your career and salary to the next level with an AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty certification!\nThis AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty Practice Exam course is for anyone who is looking for study material that provides the following:\n100 TOP-NOTCH Questions\nSIMULATES ACTUAL EXAM ENVIRONMENT - mimics the actual, and the latest AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty exam to help you pass and even ace the AWS exam!\nDETAILED EXPLANATIONS, REFERENCE LINKS, AND CHEAT SHEETS - our answer keys at the end of each set have full and detailed explanations along with complete reference links so you can check and verify that the answers are correct. Plus bonus cheat sheets to help you better understand the concepts.\nEXAM STUDY GUIDE - this is added as a reference in the explanations in the practice tests. They are based on our own exam experience and intense research on the most important topics and the most helpful resources to help you pass the exam.\nACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD - with inputs from the instructors and exam feedback from our students, our Q&A board gives you the opportunity to know which topics recently appeared on the exam and better understand the AWS services and concepts covered in the test.\nVERY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTORS - our friendly team of AWS experts is able to address all your issues and questions within 3-5 business days.\nCONTAINS A TEST REPORT - to track your progress and show you which Knowledge Areas you need improvement.\nMOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\nCLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has a reference link that can validate the answer but you can also post to the QA section so we can discuss any issues.\nPrepared by AWS Certified Data Analytics professionals who actually passed the AWS Data Analytics Specialty exam! (Please see our LinkedIn profile to view our AWS Certificates)\nSome people are using brain dumps for the AWS DAS-C01 exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge, but these can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.\nPlease also note that these AWS practice tests are not exam dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the AWS certification exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty practice tests are meant to do.\nThese AWS Data Analytics Specialty practice exams are designed to focus on important exam domains such as Processing and Storage and Data Management, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic was carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official AWS DAS exam guide.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your Data Analytics Specialty exam. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty practice exams have a passing score of 75% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 85% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these Data Analytics practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment on which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!",

In this course, we will be looking at a variety of different types of programs and concepts around programming.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\n\n\nWhat do people like you say about this course?\nJo says: \"As a SWE with experience. This course is an awesome refresher. I will definitely recommend to anyone taking this certification.\"\nBiruk says: \"It is quite easy to follow and the instructor's depth of knowledge is amazing!!! Enjoying the lesson\"\nDarryl says: \"Great Course From An Excellent Instructor. Really Deep And Informative Learning 5*\"\n\n\nWe'll start off with looking at Core Programming. We will download for free the Visual Studio Community edition, and use it to investigate the fundamental C# statements. We'll look at decision structures such as If and Switch [Case Select], repetition such as For loops, While loops and recursion, and then we'll look at errors and find out how to handle them.\nWe'll then look at Object-Oriented Programming. We'll go deeper into concepts that we have already used, such as namespaces, methods and classes, and add to them using events and constructors. We'll see how you can duplicate and develop classes using inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.\nNext up is General Software Development. We'll look at various different data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues and linked lists, and we'll also look at sorting algorithms. We'll then take a step back and look at application life cycle management, and how to interpret application specifications.\nThe next thing to look at is Web Applications. We'll look at web page development using HTML, Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript. We'll then investigate ASP.NET web application development, web hosting and web services.\nThen we'll look at Desktop Applications. We will have been creating a lot of Console-based applications earlier in this course, but we'll add to this with Windows apps and Windows Services.\nWe'll finish by looking at Databases. We look at the basics of Relational Database Management Systems, look at database query methods, including the six clauses of the SELECT statement, and find out how to connect to databases from Visual Studio.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get Visual Studio for free!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of Software Development.\nSo, without any further ado, let's have a look at how you can use Udemy interface, and then we'll have a look at the objectives for the exam and therefore the syllabus for this course.",

      "description": "Hello everyone! If you are reading this, you are most likely looking for answers to two questions. How to prepare and pass the ISTQB Foundation level exam? What is istqb? What is the istqb foundation level? How long will it take? Let's quickly find the answers to these.\nThe exam shall comprise 40 multiple-choice questions. A score of at least 65% (26 points or more) is required to pass. The questions are divided into 6 chapters. 8 questions are related to the chapter one, 5 questions are related to the chapter two, and so on.\nBecause of this, I have created this course with the 5 sample exams, for training before a real exam.\nNOTE!!! One important thing before buying a course. You won't find 100 videos in this course that last 10, 20, or 40 hours in total, where I explain the theory. I find this approach to exam preparation ineffective. First, no one can explain the theory better than the authors of the exam. Since the book and syllabus are available, I don't see the point in filming a video presentation where I read the book aloud. Second, it is a theory of software testing. There are many classifications, terms, definitions, tables, charts, and 1000 facts. This theory needs to be studied, not listened to.

      "description": "Now is the time to get certified for Python!\n\nPython Institute PCAP-31-03: Certified Associate in Python Programming\n\n\nThere are six Practice Tests with preparation questions from all knowledge areas\nto prepare for the PCAP-31-03 exam at the Python Institute.\n\n\nEvery question has an explanation and a Try-It-Yourself-Code\nwhich you can run to better understand the topic.\nYou can download the Try-It-Yourself-Code for all questions.\n(The download link will be in your welcome message.)\n\n\nExam Syllabus\n\n\nModules and Packages\nimport variants; advanced qualifiying for nested modules\ndir(); sys.path variable\nmath: ceil(), floor(), trunc(), factorial(), hypot(), sqrt(); random: random(), seed(), choice(), sample()\nplatform: platform(), machine(), processor(), system(), version(), python_implementation(), python_version_tuple()\nidea, __pycache__, __name__, public variables, __init__ py\n\n\nExceptions\nexcept, except:-except; except:-else:, except (e1,e2)\nthe hierarchy of exceptions\nraise, raise ex, assert\nevent classes, except E as e, arg property\nself-defined exceptions, defining and using\n\n\nStrings\nASCII, UNICODE, UTF-8, codepoints, escape sequences\nchr/ord(), literals\nindexing, slicing, immutability\niterating through,\nconcatenating, multiplying, comparing (against strings and numbers)\nin, not in\n.isxxx(), .join(), .split()\n.sort(), sorted(), .index(), .find(), .rfind()\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming\nideas: class, object, property, method, encapsulation, inheritance, grammar vs class, superclass, subclass\ninstance vs class variables: declaring, initializing\n__dict__ property (objects vs classes)\nprivate components (instance vs classes), name mangling\nmethods: declaring, using, self parameter\ninstrospection: hasattr() (objects vs classes), __name__, __module__, __bases__ properties\ninheritance: single, multiple, isinstance(), overriding, not is and is operators\nconstructors: declaring and invoking\npolymorphism\n__name__, __module__, __bases__ properties, __str__() method\nmultiple inheritance, diamonds\n\n\nMiscellaneous (List Comprehensions, Lambdas, Closures, and I/O Operations)\nlist comprehension: if operator, using list comprehensions\nlambdas: defining and using lambdas, self-defined functions taking lambda as as arguments; map(), filter();\nclosures: meaning, defining, and using closures\nI/O Operations: I/O modes, predefined streams, handles; text/binary modes, open(), errno and its values; close(), .read(), .write(), .readline(); readlines() (along with bytearray())\n\n\n\n\nWhy learn Python?\nPython is easy to learn. The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:\nAutomation\nPython can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.\nWeb Development\nPython is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.\nData Science\nEarlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.\n\nPython is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.",

[1]\nThe framework is business focused and defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT, with each process defined together with process inputs and outputs, key process-activities, process objectives, performance measures and an elementary maturity model\n\n\nEnterprise Governance of Information and Technology\nIn the light of digital transformation, information and technology (I&T) have become crucial in the support, sustainability and growth of enterprises. Previously, governing boards (boards of directors) and senior management could delegate, ignore or avoid I&T-related decisions. In most sectors and industries, such attitudes are now ill- advised. Stakeholder value creation (i.e., realizing benefits at an optimal resource cost while optimizing risk) is often driven by a high degree of digitization in new business models, efficient processes, successful innovation, etc. Digitized enterprises are increasingly dependent on I&T for survival and growth.\nGiven the centrality of I&T for enterprise risk management and value generation, a specific focus on enterprise governance of information and technology (EGIT) has arisen over the last three decades. EGIT is an integral part of corporate governance. It is exercised by the board that oversees the definition and implementation of processes, structures and relational mechanisms in the organization that enable both business and IT people to execute their responsibilities in support of business/IT alignment and the creation of business value from I&T-enabled business investments",

      "description": "Most students try learning Python from several different resources and eventually lose their interest and sabotage their progress. If you are a complete beginner in Python, DO NOT WORRY because this course would help you learn everything you need to know in less then a week. We have consciously sculpted the course for absolute Python beginners to make the learning curve smooth for you.\nProgramming is not just about the basics. This is the biggest picture that most people fail to see. This is exactly why I'm not going to bore you to death by teaching you the basics over and over again. We are going to go nice and slow. Starting off with the installation (Python & IDE) we'll slowly move ahead into the basics. This includes variables, conditionals, loops, functions, file processing, user inputs, modules etc., Once you know enough to start building applications, we're going to jump right into it.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll be able to apply in confidence for Python programming jobs. And yes, this applies even if you have never programmed before. With the right skills which you will learn in this course, you can become employable and valuable in the eyes of future employers.\n\n\nWill this course give you core python skills?\nYes, it will. There is a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.\nWill the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?\nNo, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming. And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.\n\n\nHere's what we're going to build:\n\n1. Question Recognizer (Micro Project)\n2. Password Fort (Mini Project I)\n3. Guessing Game (Mini Project II)\n4. Word Book (Application)\n5. Currency Converter (GUI)\n6. Jumble Bot (Software)\n7. Ping-Pong (Mobile App)\n\n\nWe are not going to waste any more time! Not even to read the description! Let's Go!",

It has,\nDetail discussion on Why, What for the choices made\nDemos\nUseful Scripts\nQuizzes\n\n\nThis course is presented as 4 Levels of optimizations.\nLevel 1 covers the usual suspects and low hanging fruits.\nLevel 2 covers recommendations that require a bit more effort to implement, but doable.\nLevel 3 covers options that are advanced and can be looked at for mature users/environments.\nLevel 4 takes you to ACE level in Azure cost optimizations\n...with more to come in the future as the Azure services adapt.\n\n\nYou will never approach Azure resource provisioning the same way after going through this course!\nI encourage you to try out this course to improve your skills.\n\n\nThanks,\nSumesh P.",

Even a person, currently in a Scrum Master role will need to prepare and study.\nThese mock exam questions are perfect for agile project managers who want to have a complete and thorough grounding of the Scrum guide, the scrum body of knowledge.\n(Note: This test has been updated to the 2020 version of the Scrum Guide. Please note that there are many subtle changes from the 2017 guide and these questions and answers reflect the changes)\nWe recommend three stages to complete before taking your first Scrum Master exam\n1) Take my accompanying Udemy Scrum Master 101 course (Search under my name \"David Keenan\"!!)\n2) Read the Scrum Guide\n3) Take this Scrum Master practice test and make sure you understand all the questions and answers.\nImportant: Each question also has the corresponding Scrum Guide answer, to allow you to completely understand both the answer and the context.\nThere are 6 practice tests. I would recommend you take Test 1, then review your answers against the correct answers from the Scrum guide before moving onto the next. This is the key learning from each test. Not only is it a practice, but it also gives you the ability to revise the Scrum guide. In many ways, it is a second pass at reading the Scrum Guide.\nIt focuses on all aspects from Scrum history, definition, theory and Values and moving to deep dive into the the 3 Scrum roles, the 5 Scrum events and the 3 Scrum Artifacts.\nWe designed these mock exam questions to act as a core learning tool to utilize, before sitting your first scrum master certification.

After experimenting with several models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, you find that none of the models individually achieves the desired level of accuracy and robustness. Your goal is to improve overall model performance by combining these models in a way that leverages their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses.\nGiven the scenario, which of the following approaches is the MOST LIKELY to improve the model’s performance?\n\n\n1. Use a simple voting ensemble, where the final prediction is based on the majority vote from the logistic regression, decision tree, and support vector machine models\n2. Implement boosting by training sequentially different types of models - logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines - where each new model corrects the errors of the previous ones\n3. Apply stacking, where the predictions from logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines are used as inputs to a meta-model, such as a random forest, to make the final prediction\n4. Use bagging, where different types of models - logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines - are trained on different subsets of the data, and their predictions are averaged to produce the final result\n\n\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 3\nExplanation:\nCorrect option:\nApply stacking, where the predictions from logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines are used as inputs to a meta-model, such as a random forest, to make the final prediction\nIn bagging, data scientists improve the accuracy of weak learners by training several of them at once on multiple datasets. In contrast, boosting trains weak learners one after another.\nStacking involves training a meta-model on the predictions of several base models. This approach can significantly improve performance because the meta-model learns to leverage the strengths of each base model while compensating for their weaknesses.\nFor the given use case, leveraging a meta-model like a random forest can help capture the relationships between the predictions of logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.\n\n\n<Solution reference image>\n<via - reference link>\n\n\nIncorrect options:\nUse a simple voting ensemble, where the final prediction is based on the majority vote from the logistic regression, decision tree, and support vector machine models - A voting ensemble is a straightforward way to combine models, and it can improve performance. However, it typically does not capture the complex interactions between models as effectively as stacking.\nImplement boosting by training sequentially different types of models - logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines - where each new model corrects the errors of the previous ones - Boosting is a powerful technique for improving model performance by training models sequentially, where each model focuses on correcting the errors of the previous one. However, it typically involves the same base model, such as decision trees (e.g., XGBoost), rather than combining different types of models.\nUse bagging, where different types of models - logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines - are trained on different subsets of the data, and their predictions are averaged to produce the final result - Bagging, like boosting, is effective for reducing variance and improving the stability of models, particularly for high-variance models like decision trees. However, it usually involves training multiple instances of the same model type (e.g., decision trees in random forests) rather than combining different types of models.\n\n\n<With multiple reference links from AWS documentation>\n\n\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

And more questions are being added over time!\n\n\nQuality speaks for itself\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nA data engineer is encountering slow query performance while executing Amazon Athena queries on datasets stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, with AWS Glue Data Catalog serving as the metadata repository. The data engineer has identified the root cause of the sluggish performance as the excessive number of partitions in the S3 bucket, leading to increased Athena query planning times.\nWhat are the two possible approaches to mitigate this issue and enhance query efficiency (Select two)?\n\n\nTransform the data in each partition to Apache ORC format\nCompress the files in gzip format to improve query performance against the partitions\nPerform bucketing on the data in each partition\nSet up an AWS Glue partition index and leverage partition filtering via the GetPartitions call\nSet up Athena partition projection based on the S3 bucket prefix\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 4,5.\nExplanation:\nCorrect options:\nSet up an AWS Glue partition index and leverage partition filtering via the GetPartitions call\nWhen you create a partition index, you specify a list of partition keys that already exist on a given table. The partition index is sub list of partition keys defined in the table. A partition index can be created on any permutation of partition keys defined in the table. For the above sales_data table, the possible indexes are (country, category, creationDate), (country, category, year), (country, category), (country), (category, country, year, month), and so on.\n\n\nLet's take a sales_data table as an example which is partitioned by the keys Country, Category, Year, Month, and creationDate. If you want to obtain sales data for all the items sold for the Books category in the year 2020 after 2020-08-15, you have to make a GetPartitions request with the expression \"Category = 'Books' and creationDate > '2020-08-15'\" to the Data Catalog.\n\n\nIf no partition indexes are present on the table, AWS Glue loads all the partitions of the table and then filters the loaded partitions using the query expression provided by the user in the GetPartitions request. The query takes more time to run as the number of partitions increases on a table with no indexes. With an index, the GetPartitions query will try to fetch a subset of the partitions instead of loading all the partitions in the table.\nOverview of AWS Glue partition index and partition filtering:\nReference Image\nvia - Reference Link\n\n\nSet up Athena partition projection based on the S3 bucket prefix\nProcessing partition information can be a bottleneck for Athena queries when you have a very large number of partitions and aren’t using AWS Glue partition indexing. You can use partition projection in Athena to speed up query processing of highly partitioned tables and automate partition management. Partition projection helps minimize this overhead by allowing you to query partitions by calculating partition information rather than retrieving it from a metastore. It eliminates the need to add partitions’ metadata to the AWS Glue table.\n\n\nIn partition projection, partition values, and locations are calculated from configuration rather than read from a repository like the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Because in-memory operations are usually faster than remote operations, partition projection can reduce the runtime of queries against highly partitioned tables. Depending on the specific characteristics of the query and underlying data, partition projection can significantly reduce query runtime for queries that are constrained by partition metadata retrieval.\n\n\nOverview of Athena partition projection:\nReference Image\nvia - Reference Link\n\n\nIncorrect options:\nTransform the data in each partition to Apache ORC format - Apache ORC is a popular file format for analytics workloads. It is a columnar file format because it stores data not by row, but by column. ORC format also allows query engines to reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded in different ways. For example, by storing and compressing columns separately, you can achieve higher compression ratios and only the columns referenced in a query need to be read. However, the data is being transformed within the existing partitions, this option does not resolve the root cause of under-performance (that is, the excessive number of partitions in the S3 bucket).\n\n\nCompress the files in gzip format to improve query performance against the partitions - Compressing your data can speed up your queries significantly. The smaller data sizes reduce the data scanned from Amazon S3, resulting in lower costs of running queries. It also reduces the network traffic from Amazon S3 to Athena. Athena supports a variety of compression formats, including common formats like gzip, Snappy, and zstd. However, the data is being compressed within the existing partitions, this option does not resolve the root cause of under-performance (that is, the excessive number of partitions in the S3 bucket).\n\n\nPerform bucketing on the data in each partition - Bucketing is a way to organize the records of a dataset into categories called buckets. This meaning of bucket and bucketing is different from, and should not be confused with Amazon S3 buckets. In data bucketing, records that have the same value for a property go into the same bucket. Records are distributed as evenly as possible among buckets so that each bucket has roughly the same amount of data. In practice, the buckets are files, and a hash function determines the bucket that a record goes into. A bucketed dataset will have one or more files per bucket per partition. The bucket that a file belongs to is encoded in the file name. Bucketing is useful when a dataset is bucketed by a certain property and you want to retrieve records in which that property has a certain value. Because the data is bucketed, Athena can use the value to determine which files to look at. For example, suppose a dataset is bucketed by customer_id and you want to find all records for a specific customer. Athena determines the bucket that contains those records and only reads the files in that bucket.\nGood candidates for bucketing occur when you have columns that have high cardinality (that is, have many distinct values), are uniformly distributed, and that you frequently query for specific values.\nSince bucketing is being done within the existing partitions, this option does not resolve the root cause of under-performance (that is, the excessive number of partitions in the S3 bucket).\n\n\nWith multiple reference links from AWS documentation\n\n\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

      "description": "* Updated for the 2024 CISSP curriculum and 2023 exam registration process *\nWelcome, I am Thor Pedersen, and I am here to help you pass your CISSP certification.\nWith over 700,000 enrollments from 201 countries, my CISSP, CISM, and Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) courses are both the “Best Selling” and “Highest Rated” here on Udemy.\nIn this course I will cover how to approach practice tests, how to deconstruct practice questions, time management, how to make your own CISSP study plan, and finally you get 125 HARD CISSP questions in a full CISSP practice test.\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam questions does.\n\n\nGetting your CISSP certification now is a very smart career move.\n1. The CISSP certification is the gold standard for IT Security certifications.\n2. There are more than 82,000 job openings for CISSPs in the US.\n3. The average CISSP salary in the US is over USD147,000 a year.\n\n\nWhat our other students are saying about my CISSP courses:\nI passed the CISSP with the ISC Book and Thor's lectures and practice questions. Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of the test, you will get an explanation for each question and explaining to why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does.\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions\nAsset Security – 13 questions\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions\n\nI recommend students to do 1,500-3,000 easy/mid CISSP practice questions and 1,000-1,500 HARD CISSP practice questions before the exam.\nI only know of 3 hard CISSP practice sets: my own hard questions, Boson questions, and SNT. Wentz Wu also has hard questions on his CISSP blog, but not as full practice tests.\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it. This is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right and answering from an IT Security manager's point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.\nOn hard questions you will score lower. It is normal to score 80%+ on easy/mid questions and 50-60% on hard questions.\nThe point of all questions is to find the gaps in your knowledge, learn how to deconstruct questions, argue WHY the answer you chose is the RIGHT answer in this scenario, making you ready for exam day.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nYou'll Also Get:\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days no questions asked, money back guarantee.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

Clear and lucid explanations for both correct & incorrect answers.\nd. Supporting visuals created by me to drive better understanding (Not taken from Microsoft documentation)\ne. Explanations run parallel to the product. Every detailed explanation has corroborating evidence with the Microsoft product (like Azure or Microsoft 365 security center, etc.) shown in the form of screenshots and clear callouts.\nf. Explanations are NOT directly copied from Microsoft documentation. I have rephrased all the reasoning in a simple and easy-to-understand language.\ng. No step-motherly treatment of incorrect answer choices. I took enough effort to explain the rationale for each answer choice (whether correct/wrong), including the reference links.\nh. Don't worry about inaccurate sentence framing/wrong grammar/incorrect punctuations. I use Grammarly to review every question.\ni. Almost non-existent repetition of questions only to increase the question count.\nj. For some questions, you may have to search for answers in the given reference link. A Quick Preview feature shows a screenshot of the relevant paragraph to which the correct answer refers.\nk. I love to help you succeed. If you need to discuss, we have an Active Q&A dashboard and expect fast responses (save for my sleeping hours, which are generally less).\nl.

I will compare the differences between the IPv4 to IPv6, and the benefits that IPv6 brings to the future of networking.\nDISCLAIMER:   Please note that the simulators/emulators used in this course are not part of the course. It is the students responsibility to have these to practice with. The Cisco Packet Tracer and/or VIRAL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab) are Cisco proprietary software and can only be obtained through Cisco. It is up to each student to obtain the simulator/emulator of their choice to study along with this course.\n\nStudents will get a thorough understanding of IPv6 and how we would implement it in a real world environment.\nWe will discuss the format of an IPv6 address, and breakdown the different components, like the Network Prefix, Interface ID, what each 16 bit section does and specifically the subnetting section of IPv6. We will learn about the new types of addresses that comes with IPv6, its configurations using RIPng, EIGRP for IPv6, OSPFv3 using both static assigned addresses and the EUI-64 format. We will also learn about the transition methods such as ISATAP, 6to4, and NAT-PT.\nThis is a lecture based course using the Touch-IT Technology Smart board, which will make learning very interactive and engaging. Hands on labs will be used to drill down the concepts learned in each lecture using Cisco’s Packet Tracer.\nMy method will make you feel like you are sitting in a classroom environment and give the most needed hands on experience!\nHandouts will be available to facilitate learning and practice.\nThis course will help the student become familiar with the use of IPv6, recognizing IPv6 addresses and how to implement them in your environment…but it will also help in preparing for any networking certification or Computer Science Degree; not to mention the fact that for those already in the field, it will further improve routing decisions in their particular networks.",

It doesn't have to be.\n\n\nIf you're looking forward to learning how to implement HCX and how to confidently work with it, you've found the right course.\n\n\nVMware HCX is a workload mobility tool that makes moving Virtual Machines really easy. It supports a wide variety of features, such as migrating to other on-prem datacenters, migration waves, or moving VMs to the public cloud. In addition to this, HCX introduces innovative features which help make migrations faster, more efficient, and more predictable. It does this through the use of things such as Replication Assisted vMotion (RAV) - which allows you to migrate multiple VMs at the same time, non-disruptively.\n\n\nHCX also supports the scheduling of migrations, which means you can begin replicating your VM files in advance of your scheduled maintenance window, and the actual VM switchover can occur during the maintenance window.\n\n\nOur VMware HCX Training help you learn how HCX migrations work, and most importantly, how to install VMware HCX. Whether you're considering using HCX yourself, or you are trying to help a customer use HCX to make their migrations easier - this is the course for you.\n\n\nNote: NSX experience is not required for this course, but it can be helpful. I recommend a basic NSX course prior to taking this one.\n\n\nLearning VMware HCX doesn't have to be hard, join thousands of other students who have learned how to configure VMware HCX in just a few hours.",

Cloud services are extremely affordable for both large and small businesses.\nDisadvantages of cloud computing: The cloud service provider takes care a number of clients each day. This can lead to your business process being temporarily suspended if your internet connection is offline, you will not able to access any applications, server, data from the cloud.\nIntroduction to AWS: AWS is a cloud service from Amazon, which provides services in the form of building blocks, these building blocks can be used to create and deploy any type of application in the cloud.\nAWS Basic steps to follow: It focus follows this- Prerequisite to create AWS account, Steps to Create AWS account, Step to log into AWS account, Step to create a User in AWS IAM.\nPrerequisite to create AWS account: Follow this procedure to create an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon SNS topic, and an IAM role with attached policies.you can then use AWS CLI to specify the bucket, topic, and role for AWS config.Before you begin setting up your Amazon EMR cluster, make sure that you complete the prerequisites in this topic.\nContents:\nCreating an Amazon S3 bucket\nCreating an Amazon SNS topic\nCreating an IAM role\nSteps to Create AWS account: When you sign up Amazon Web Services, your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including Amazon Polly. You are charged only for the services you used.\nWith Amazon Polly, you pay only for the resources you use. If you are a new AWS customer, you can get started with Amazon Polly for free. For more information see Amazon Free Usage Tier.\nTo create AWS account follow the steps: open Amazon.AWS link and then choose to create an AWS Account.>follow the online instructions>part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using phone keypad.\nNote your AWS account Id because you will need for the next steps.\nStep to login to AWS account: when you first create Amazon Web Services account, you begin with a single sign-in identify that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing with the email address and password that you used to create the account.\nStep to create a User in AWS IAM: you can create one or more IAM users in your AWS account. You might create an IAM user when someone joins your organization or when you have a new application that needs to make API calls to AWS.\nAmazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3): Amazon Simple Storage Service(S3) is storage for the internet. You can use S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the Web.  It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers. This guide explains the core concepts of Amazon S3 such as buckets and objects and how to work with these resources using the Amazon S3 application programming interface.(API)\nAmazon Glacier:  Amazon Glacier works for storage service optimized for infrequently data or cold data.It is secure, durable, extremely low-cost cloud storage service for data archiving and long-term backup.Amazon hopes this new service will move businesses from on premises.Amazon Glacier provides three options for access to archives,  from a few minutes to several hours.\nAmazon EC2: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides that secure resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make Web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain configure capacity minimal fiction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.\nAmazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC): Amazon VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.The virtual networks closely resemble traditional networks that you’d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.\nElastic Load Balance: Elastic Load Balance automatically distributes the incoming application's traffic across multiple targets such as EC2 instances. It monitors the health of registered targets and routes traffic only to the health targets. Elastic Load Balance supports three type of load balance Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers.\nAuto Scaling: Auto Scaling is a method used in cloud computing whereby the number of computational resources in a server farm, typically measured in the terms of the number of active servers, scales automatically based on the load on the farm.Auto Scaling monitors your application and manages capacity to maintain steady predictable and performance at the lowest cost.\nAWS IAM: AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service securely controlling access to AWS services. Using IAM you can create and manage AWS Users and groups and take permission to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.IAM is a feature of AWS account offered at no additional charge. You will be charged only for use of other AWS services.\nAmazon CloudWatch: Amazon cloudwatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you start on AWS.Using Amazon CloudWatch You can collect and track metrics, collect monitor log files, set alarm and automatically react to change your AWS resources.Amazon Cloud Watch can monitors AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB Tables instances, Amazon RDS DB instances and as well as custom metric generated by your applications and services.Amazon provisioned system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.

The questions in these practice tests do not show up in the real certification exam. The questions in these practice tests cover a wide range of GCP services that are relevant for the certification. You can use these questions to identify gaps in your knowledge and be better prepared for your certification exam.\n\n\nEvery question has a detailed explanation of why an option is correct and why the other options are wrong. Here is an example:\n\n\nQ. You are migrating an application from an on-premises network to Google Cloud. The application should be resistant to regional failures, so your team has decided to deploy the application across two regions within the same VPC and fronted by an external HTTP(s) Load balancer. The workload depends on Active Directory, which is still hosted in the on-premises network. How should you configure the VPN between GCP Network and the on-premises network?\nA. Enable network peering between GCP VPC and on-prem network.\nB. Tweak IAM rules to enable VPC sharing & expose VPC to on-prem network.\nC. Deploy a global VPN Gateway with redundant VPN tunnels from all regions in the VPC to the on-prem network.\nD. Deploy a regional VPN Gateway and make sure both regions in use have at least one VPN tunnel to the on-prem network.\n\n\nEnable network peering between GCP VPC and on-prem network. is not right.\nGoogle Cloud VPC Network Peering allows internal IP address connectivity across two Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks regardless of whether they belong to the same project or the same organization. You can use VPC Network Peering to establish connectivity between VPC and on-premises networks.\nRef: https: //cloud. google. com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering\n\n\nTweak IAM rules to enable VPC sharing & expose VPC to on-prem network. is not right.\nYou can use Shared VPC to establish connectivity between VPC and on-premises networks. Shared VPC allows an organization to connect resources from multiple projects to a common Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network so that they can communicate with each other securely and efficiently using internal IPs from that network.\nRef: https: //cloud. google. com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc\n\n\nDeploy a global VPN Gateway with redundant VPN tunnels from all regions in the VPC to the on-prem network. is not right.\nCloud VPN Gateway is not global. Both Classic VPN and the newer HA VPN connect your on-premises network to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network through an IPsec VPN connection in a single region.\nRef: https: //cloud. google. com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/concepts/overview#vpn-types\n\n\nDeploy a regional VPN Gateway and make sure both regions in use have at least one VPN tunnel to the on-prem network. is the right answer.\nBoth Classic VPN and the newer HA VPN connect your on-premises network to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network through an IPsec VPN connection in a single region.\nRef: https:// cloud. google. com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/concepts/overview#vpn-types\nTherefore, we have to deploy Cloud VPN Gateway in each region and ensure that each region has at least one VPN tunnel to the on-premises peer gateway.\n\n\nSee you on the inside (hurry, your practice tests are waiting!)",

      "description": "Learn Google Cloud from a certified, experienced Google Cloud Architect, and become a certified Google Cloud Architect.\n\n\nGoogle Cloud is one of the most popular public clouds in the industry, and it gets bigger and bigger by the day. Thousands of organizations, from all sizes and shapes, are moving to the cloud, and being able to work with it is one of the most important skills for every developer, architect, or IT admin.\nAnd this course does just that.\nIf you'll take this course, you'll become a Certified Google Professional Cloud Architect.\nBeing a certified Google Architect comes with a lot of perks: You'll gain worldwide recognition of your skills, you'll find it much easier to land jobs, you'll join the experts cloud community, and lots more.\nWe start from the very basics - what is the cloud and what it's good for - and go to the most advanced concepts such as Organization Policy, Cost management, and lots more.\nBy the end of this course you'll be familiar with the most important services in Google Cloud, and also some real hidden gems known only to the few (Metadata services, for instance), and you'll be able to work with Google Cloud and design and build modern cloud apps, utilizing the most up-to-date cloud services.\nHere is a partial list of what we'll talk about in this course:\n- What is the cloud\n- Google Cloud vs other clouds\n- The Console\n- Compute - Virtual Machines, App Engine, Cloud Run, GKE, Cloud Functions and more\n- Networking - VPC, Subnets, Firewall rules, Load balancers and more\n- Data Services - Cloud SQL, AlloyDB, Memorystore, BigTable, Cloud Storage and more\n- Messaging - Pub/Sub, Eventarc\n- Identity management with Cloud IAM and Identity Platform\n- Logging and Monitoring\n- Implementing security in the cloud\n- Cost Management\n- Disaster Recovery (DR)\nAnd lots and lots more...\nNow, to make sure that this course is the best Google Cloud course out there, I've decided to make it a little bit different.\nInstead of going through the various services of Google Cloud, talking about each one and perhaps even doing a demo - this course takes a different approach.\nWe're going to build, together, a full blown modern cloud system on Google Cloud.\nTogether, we're going to build the Readit website, a fictional bookstore that's built in Google Cloud.\nWe're going to begin with the very basics - take a code and put it on a virtual machine in the cloud.\nAnd then we're going to add more compute elements, add networking, databases, messaging, monitoring, security, and even DR! (Take a look at the video preview - you can see there the architecture diagram of the system at the beginning, and how it looks like when we're done with it. Worth watching...)\nAnd when we're done - you'll be able to say that you've built a complete system in Google Cloud!\nThis is something you can show future employers and clients, and explain them how the system is designed, and what are the reasons it's built like this.\nNow, don't worry about the code. Everything it going to be provided to you.\nThe system is built using .NET and nodeJS, but you don't have to be familiar with these languages, you just better have some development knowledge.\nThere is no other course like this!\nThis is the only Google Cloud course that takes you step-by-step towards a complete, full blown system in the cloud. At the end of it - you can definitely call yourself Google Cloud Expert.\nAnd the course will not just help you become an expert in Google Cloud, it will also help you get the Google Professional Cloud Architect Certification.\nAfter learning about the services in the cloud, you'll find a special section explaining about the certification process, and how to prepare for it. We'll cover the exam structure, question types, exam length, room preparation, time allocation and lots more.\nAnd after that - you'll have a change to take a practice test, simulating the questions you'll actually have in the real exam. This will greatly help you in preparing for the exam.\n\n\nBut that's not all...\nAt the end of this course, you'll be able to download the Google Cloud Architecture Summary, a comprehensive, step-by-step guide that summarizes what we've learned in the course, and that will help you design great Google Cloud apps.\nThis summary is an extremely handy doc to use when designing apps in Google Cloud. I use it and it helps me a lot - and so should you...\n\n\nThis course takes you from the absolute basics of Google Cloud to the most advanced topics, known only to few. Completing this course will give you all the knowledge required for designing modern, robust, secure and reliable cloud systems, and, as a bonus, will put you in a great position when looking for your next job.\nNo other course covers this topic in such a comprehensive and thorough way. I've put all my 20+ years of experience with hundreds of clients in this course, and I'm sure you will greatly benefit from it.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWhat do my students have to say about my cloud courses?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\"This is the best course I have encountered on Udemy or anywhere.

I did the exercises right along with him. A great way to learn from my own and his mistakes.\nOverall very overwhelmed content and neat Explanation!\nReally enjoyed that the instructor did things live as opposed to premaking all the scripts.

Want to be sure? Every chapter in my course has at least one free preview lecture and a 30-day, no questions asked, money back guarantee.\nI originally developed the content in this course for 5-day Instructor Led training classes - the kind of class that can cost $4,200+USD/seat  at major training companies. But now, it is here on Udemy - so you can get the same high quality training for a lot less.\nDon't settle for VMware video training that is just a few hours of recorded PowerPoint slides. In this mega-course, I include both lecture and hands-on lab demo videos. In the lecture material, I explain concepts, provide an overview of using vSphere 6.7 and include best practices and design and troubleshooting tips, etc. In the hands-on lab demos, I log into one of our live vSphere rental labs and show you exactly how to get the job done, step-by-step.\nThis course now includes a free 231pg sample PDF ebook with the presentation and lab chapters for the first 4 lectures and labs of this course.\nPlease note that this course does not provide access to live labs but does include video demonstrations of how to complete tasks using vSphere 6.7.\n\n\nWhat I Cover In This Course\nIn this course, I explain step-by-step how to upgrade or migrate from vCenter for Windows or vCenter Appliance to vCenter Server Appliance 6.7 and how to use VMware Update Manager to upgrade ESXi hosts and how to upgrade Virtual Machine virtual hardware and VMware Tools. I also cover advanced topics such as Fibre/iSCSI shared storage, Raw Device Maps, working with VMFS 6 Filesystems, Storage Profiles, Storage DRS Clusters, High Availability Clusters, Fault Tolerance and Distributed Virtual Switches.\nI'll show you how to diagnose, isolate and fix common problems. We will use Host Client, Web Client, HTML 5 Client and command line tools to explore, configure, update, investigate and zero in on performance bottlenecks and trouble spots. Up to 45% of class time is devoted to labs so concepts, skills and best practices are developed and reinforced.\nBy the end of the class, attendees will have learned practical, actionable skills in vSphere design, implementation, upgrading, sizing, scaleability, performance optimization and troubleshooting.\n\n\nUse This Course to Prepare for VMware Certification Exams\nMany of my Udemy students use this course to help them prepare for vSphere certification. You can use this course to gain knowledge and skills that are tested for in VMware certifications including:\nVMware Certified Associate (VCA)\nVMware Certified Professional (VCP-DCV), and\nVMware Certified Advanced Professional (VCAP)",

The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:\nAutomation\nPython can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.\nWeb Development\nPython is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.\nData Science\nEarlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.\n\nPython is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.",

      "description": "*** Course has been updated as per the latest official exam update of 30th April, 2025 ***\n\n\nNOTE: Most of the code samples in the course are in C#.\n\n\nWelcome to the Azure AI Engineer Associate AI-102 - Practice Test Course!\nAre you preparing for the Azure AI Engineer Associate (AI-102) certification exam? This course is designed to help you succeed by providing high-quality practice tests that closely mirror the real exam.\n\n\nWhat You'll Get:\n\n\n350+ Latest exam questions with detailed explanations to each answer (includes case study questions)\n\nRealistic Exam Simulation: My practice tests are designed to reflect the format, style, and difficulty of the official Azure AI Engineer Associate exam. This ensures you get a realistic testing experience.\n\nComprehensive Coverage: The practice tests cover all the domains and objectives of the AI-102 exam, including :\nPlan and manage an Azure AI solution\nImplement generative AI solutions\nImplement an agentic solution\nImplement computer vision solutions\nImplement natural language processing solutions\nImplement knowledge mining and information extraction solutions\n\nDetailed Explanations: Each question comes with a detailed explanation to help you understand the concepts and reasoning behind the correct answers. This is crucial for deepening your knowledge and ensuring you're fully prepared. For each question, I have explained why an answer is correct and have also explained why other options are incorrect. You will also find supporting reference links for a quick read.\n\nVariety of Questions: You'll find a mix of multiple-choice, multiple-response, and scenario-based questions to fully prepare you for what to expect on exam day.\n\nPerformance Tracking: Keep track of your progress with the test review feature. Identify your strengths and areas for improvement to focus your study efforts effectively.\n\n\nSneak peak into what you will get inside the course:\n\n\nQ1. You collect IoT sensor data from 100 industrial machines for a year. Each machine has 50 different sensors that generate data at one-minute intervals. In total, you have 5,000 time series datasets.\nYou need to identify unusual values in each time series to help predict machinery failures.\nWhich Azure service should you use?\n\nAzure AI Computer Vision\nAzure AI Search\nAzure AI Document Intelligence\nAzure AI Anomaly Detector\n\n\nAnswer(s):\nAzure AI Anomaly Detector is CORRECT because it is specifically designed to detect anomalies in time series data. It uses advanced machine learning models to identify unexpected patterns or behaviors in data, which is essential for predictive maintenance. With the ability to analyze and detect irregularities across multiple time series datasets, this service is ideal for monitoring IoT sensor data to predict machinery failures.\n\nAzure AI Computer Vision is INCORRECT because this service is primarily focused on analyzing images and extracting information from visual data. It does not have the capabilities to handle time series data or detect anomalies in sensor readings.\n\nAzure AI Search is INCORRECT because it is a search-as-a-service solution that provides indexing and querying capabilities for various types of content, such as documents and databases. It is not designed for time series data analysis or anomaly detection.\n\nAzure AI Document Intelligence is INCORRECT because it focuses on extracting structured information from unstructured documents, such as forms and receipts. It does not have the functionality to analyze time series data for anomalies.\n\n\n***\n\n\nQ2.  You have an Azure OpenAI resource named AI1 that hosts three deployments of the GPT 3.5 model. Each deployment is optimized for a unique workload.\nYou plan to deploy three apps. Each app will access AI1 by using the REST API and will use the deployment that was optimized for the app's intended workload.\nYou need to provide each app with access to AI1 and the appropriate deployment. The solution must ensure that only the apps can access AI1.\nWhat should you use to provide access to AI1?\n\n\nAn API key\nA bearer token\nA shared access signature (SAS) token\n\n\nAnswer(s):\nAn API key is CORRECT because it is a common method for authenticating applications when accessing APIs, including Azure OpenAI services. API keys are straightforward to use and provide the necessary authentication to ensure that only authorized applications can access the specific deployments optimized for their intended workloads.\n\nA bearer token is INCORRECT because bearer tokens are typically used for authentication in OAuth 2.0 frameworks, which involves a more complex process including obtaining tokens from an authorization server. This is not as straightforward as using API keys for the given requirement.\n\nA shared access signature (SAS) token is INCORRECT because SAS tokens are primarily used to grant limited access to Azure Storage resources. They are not designed for authenticating access to Azure OpenAI resources via REST API.\n\n\n***\nQ3. You have an app named App1 that uses a custom Azure AI Document Intelligence model to recognize contract documents.\nYou need to ensure that the model supports an additional contract format. The solution must minimize development effort.\nWhat should you do?\nLower the confidence score threshold of App1.\nCreate a new training set and add the additional contract format to the new training set. Create and train a new custom model.\nAdd the additional contract format to the existing training set. Retrain the model.\nLower the accuracy threshold of App1.\n\n\nAnswer(s):\nAdd the additional contract format to the existing training set. Retrain the model is CORRECT. This approach directly addresses the need to support an additional contract format without starting from scratch. By adding examples of the new contract format to the existing training set and retraining the model, you enhance the model's ability to recognize the new format while leveraging the already trained capabilities for existing formats. This minimizes development effort compared to creating and training a completely new model.\n\n\nLower the confidence score threshold of App1 is INCORRECT because lowering the confidence score threshold might allow the model to recognize more documents as contracts, but it won't improve the model's ability to accurately recognize the new contract format. It could also increase the likelihood of false positives.\n\n\nCreate a new training set and add the additional contract format to the new training set. Create and train a new custom model is INCORRECT because creating a new custom model from scratch is more labor-intensive and time-consuming than updating and retraining the existing model with additional data.\n\nLower the accuracy threshold of App1 is INCORRECT because lowering the accuracy threshold does not enhance the model's ability to correctly identify and process the new contract format. It simply reduces the criteria for what is considered a successful match, which could lead to inaccurate results.",

      "description": "Welcome to “SCRUM, The Masterclass: Learn SCRUM Here and Get Certified.”\nATTENTION PRODUCT CREATORS: Learn, Understand & Experience The SCRUM Framework And Success Is YOURS!\nCOURSE TESTIMONIAL (after the first week of the course release)\n\"And thank you for your course! I just passed my certification exam (92.5%) after listening to your course once and reading Scrum guide three times over.\"\nDmity S.\nIn 2018, the following was written by Jeff Sutherland Junior, (JJ), CEO of Scrum Inc, who replaced dad, Jeff Senior in that position, as Jeff Senior was elevated to the position of Chairman of the Board. At that time, Jeff Junior wrote the following:\n“In December of 1993 my father, Jeff Sutherland, gathered a team of people and asked them to go on a new journey with him, a new way of working. A way he had started developing forty years prior while a cadet at West Point, developed through years as a fighter pilot, as a professor seeking new treatments for cancer, and leading six different technology companies. A way of working rooted in respect for people, a way to unleash human potential, a way that delivered results faster than anyone had ever thought possible. A way with the unlikely name of Scrum.\nThere is a “Tidal Wave” today that is sweeping our Globe. It began as a ripple in the late 1980s and has progressed into this enormous wave that is sweeping over the “Product Development Arena.” Products all the way from Automobiles to Government Policy creation to the delivery of massive Software Systems. To many of us who have been involved in this arena for over 20 years, we label it as the “Agile Revolution!”\nAnd the key framework, the most used framework, and the most successful framework in the Agile “space,” is Scrum. Scrum, the framework that came from the work of the co-founders, Jeff Sutherland (senior) and Ken Schwaber (Scrum org). This course is all about that framework called SCRUM!\nWhy You Should Take This Masterclass!\nRecently, one of the top Global Information Technology oversight organizations, Forrester, said this:\n” “The organizational structures that got us to where we are today, are failing us — they are not the structures that will take us forward. Times have changed, and our organizations must adapt to catch up and begin to keep pace with business change”\nTo be at the forefront of working with our organizations to adapt and catch up and begin to keep pace with the changing world around us in the area of product development, you need to know what we are teaching in this course. You then need to take that knowledge and understanding and get yourself “certified” to be able to receive the credibility you need to get positions to lead your organizations in this direction.\nOur intent is that when you finish our course, you will take the next step and get yourself certified from Scrum org. This is what so many of our students have done, and now we have hundreds who have been certified around the world as using this organization.\nFor you to achieve this, in this course we teach you all about that “way with the unlikely name of SCRUM.” We teach you:\n· What Scrum Is.\n· Where Scrum comes from.\n· The foundation of Scrum.\n· The Scrum Framework.\n· Scrum Theory.\n· Scrum Values.\n· Scrum Artifacts.\n· The Scrum Team.\n· Scrum Roles.\n· Scrum Leadership.\n· What works and what does not work with Scrum.\n· The nuances of Scrum from Organization to Organization – why it is so different from team to team.\n· All “6” Scrum Ceremonies.\n· The visible Scrum Information Radiators\n\n\nAll of this is based on the November 2020 Scrum Guide.\nTo sum this all up, at the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge and understanding to not only become a PSM1 but to begin working with your organizations to help them move into the forefront of their industries.\nNow, I want my students to always feel comfortable when they make a purchase, that's why I have uploaded multiple free videos for you to view at any time.\nYOU HAVE NOTHING TO RISK BUT EVERYTHING TO GAIN!\nProfessor Ed …. “We Are Agile!”",

      "description": "Just like how real world shipping containers revolutionised the way goods are packaged, handled and transported across the globe  industry, Docker along with open container ecosystem is transforming the software delivery by brining in the standardisation.  Docker offers a way to run isolated processes and also allows one to package an application along with its run time environment using primitives such as dockerfiles.  However, when it comes to running docker in a production like environment, with container work loads  spanning across more than one nodes,  you need a COE ( Container Orchestration Engine). COEs offer clustering and convert your nodes into one super computer, make intelligent  decisions as to where to schedule the containers, connect containers running on different nodes by setting up multi host network and offer many other interesting features such as fault tolerance, zero downtime deployments etc.\nKubernetes is the gold standard in the world of container orchestration. It was originally created by Google, based on their experience of building and managing containers at scale ( at Google Scale). However its now driven by Cloud Native Compute Foundation ( CNCF), an open body, which also offers the official certification i.e. \"Kubernetes Certified Administrator\".  Kubernetes comes with mind boggling features, is very reliable, and extremely sophisticated container orchestration engine. It can let you convert your infrastructure into a Container as a Service (Platform),  brining in some of the awe inspiring features such as Zero Down Time Deployments, Fault Tolerance, Auto Scaling, Cloud and Storage integrations, which were extremely difficult to implement.  And it brings it to the masses with its truly open, lock in free eco system.\nWith Kubernetes' sophistication however, comes the complexity too. Even though I have been using Kubernetes for more than 2 years now, almost every month, I find something new about kubernetes, something really cool, be it cloud integrations, or the newly introduced RBAC, be it dynamic storage provisioning, or stateful sets, its a fascinating world once you start exploring it. However, you would definitely need a guide once you while you navigate the complex world of Kubernetes, and this course serves just that. its been created in a way that you start learning kubernetes fround grounds up, one small step at a time, feature by feature.\nThis course brings to you a distilled experience with my knowledge of building and managing infrastructures, experience of helping companies with their devops journey and more than 300 corporate trainings. This is a well researched program and I have tried many variants of applications, with different flows, took feedback, and iterated many times. Thats one of the reasons why it took us more than 4 months to even launch the course in its first form.  We have also started incorporating some new and useful techniques including glassboard, mindmaps to explain the concepts better and make things easier. I and my team wants to make this program the best in the world, and are constantly working towards it.\nHere is what this course would cover, one step at a time,\nIntroduction to Kubernetes and the key concepts\nSetting up learning Environment\nPods\nReplication Controllers and Replica Sets\nDeployments\nServices\nConfigMaps and Secrets\nPersistent Storage\nOur next version would include many additional topics including,\nRelease Strategies\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaler\nHelm Package Manager\nRBAC\nIngress Controllers\nCI/CD with Kubernetes\nWhen you sign up for this course now, you are guaranteed to receive these updates, that our promise to you !  We wish you all the best while learning Kubernetes !!",

Plus bonus cheat sheets to help you better understand the concepts.\nEXAM STUDY GUIDE - this is added as a reference in the explanations in the practice tests. They are based on our own exam experience and intense research on the most important topics and the most helpful resources to help you pass the exam.\nACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD - with inputs from the instructors and exam feedback from our students, our Q&A board gives you the opportunity to know which topics recently appeared on the exam and better understand the Google Cloud services and concepts covered in the test.\nVERY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTORS - our friendly team of Google Cloud experts is able to address all your issues and questions within 3-5 business days.\nCONTAINS A TEST REPORT - to track your progress and show you which Knowledge Areas you need improvement.\nMOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\nCLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has a reference link that can validate the answer but you can also post to the QA section so we can discuss any issues.\nPrepared by Google Certified professionals who actually passed the GCP Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE) exam! (Please see our LinkedIn profile to view our Google Cloud Certificates)\nSome people are using brain dumps for the GCP ACE exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you from attaining in-depth Google Cloud knowledge, these can also result in you failing the actual Google Cloud certification exam since Google regularly updates the exam coverage.\nPlease also note that these Google Cloud practice tests are not exam dumps and since Google shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the GCP certification exam is a good understanding of Google Cloud services and this is what our GCP Associate Cloud Engineer practice tests are meant to do.\nThese Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer practice exams are designed to focus on important exam domains such as planning and configuring cloud solutions, and deploying and implementing cloud solutions, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic was carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official GCP ACE exam guide.\nThere are a lot of existing Google Cloud Practice Tests in the market, however, most of them contain both technical and grammatical errors that may cause you to fail the actual exam.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these GCP Associate Cloud Engineer practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your GCP ACE exam. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer practice exams have a passing score of 75% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 90% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in Google Cloud. Nonetheless, these GCP ACE practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment on which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!",

This is THE practice exams course to give you the winning edge.\nThese practice exams have been co-authored by Stephane Maarek and Abhishek Singh who bring their collective experience of passing 18 AWS Certifications to the table.\nThe tone and tenor of the questions mimic the real exam. Along with the detailed description and “exam alert” provided within the explanations, we have also extensively referenced AWS documentation to get you up to speed on all domain areas being tested for the DAS-C01 exam.\n\n\nWe want you to think of this course as the final pit-stop so that you can cross the winning line with absolute confidence and get AWS Certified! Trust our process, you are in good hands.\nAll questions have been written from scratch! And more questions are being added over time!\n\n\n\n\nQuality speaks for itself...\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nA credit card company is looking for a solution that detects anomalies in order to identify fraudulent transactions. The company utilizes Amazon Kinesis to transfer JSON-formatted transaction records from its on-premises database to Amazon S3. The existing dataset comprises 100-column wide records for each transaction. To identify fraudulent transactions, the solution needs to analyze just ten of these columns.\nAs an AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialist, which of the following would you suggest as the lowest-cost solution that needs the least development work and offers out-of-the-box anomaly detection functionality?\n\n\nLeverage Kinesis Data Analytics to detect anomalies on a data stream from Kinesis Streams by running SQL queries which compute an anomaly score for all transactions and then store all fraudulent transactions in Amazon S3. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the results from Amazon S3\nTransform the data from JSON format to Apache Parquet format using an AWS Glue job. Configure AWS Glue crawlers to discover the schema and build the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Leverage Amazon SageMaker to build an anomaly detection model that can detect fraudulent transactions by ingesting data directly from Amazon S3\nLeverage Kinesis Data Firehose to detect anomalies on a data stream from Kinesis Streams via a Lambda function which computes an anomaly score for all transactions and stores all fraudulent transactions in Amazon RDS. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the results from RDS\nTransform the data from JSON format to Apache Parquet format using an AWS Glue job. Configure AWS Glue crawlers to discover the schema and build the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Leverage Amazon Athena to create a table with a subset of columns. Set up Amazon QuickSight for visual analysis of the data and identify fraudulent transactions using QuickSight's built-in machine learning-powered anomaly detection\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 2.\nTransform the data from JSON format to Apache Parquet format using an AWS Glue job. Configure AWS Glue crawlers to discover the schema and build the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Leverage Amazon Athena to create a table with a subset of columns. Set up Amazon QuickSight for visual analysis of the data and identify fraudulent transactions using QuickSight's built-in machine learning-powered anomaly detection\nFor the given use case, you can use an AWS Glue job to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from the data source (in JSON format) to the data target (in Parquet format). You can then use an AWS Glue crawler, which is a program that connects to a data store (source or target) such as Amazon S3, progresses through a prioritized list of classifiers to determine the schema for your data, and then creates metadata tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.\n<reference image>\nAmazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage, and you pay only for the queries you run, thereby making this solution really low cost. You can also use Athena to build a table with only the subset of columns that are required for downstream analysis.\nFinally, you can read the data in the given Athena table via Amazon QuickSight to identify fraudulent transactions using QuickSight's built-in machine learning-powered anomaly detection. QuickSight uses proven Amazon technology to continuously run ML-powered anomaly detection across millions of metrics to discover hidden trends and outliers in your data. This anomaly detection enables you to get deep insights that are often buried in the aggregates and not scalable with manual analysis. With ML-powered anomaly detection, you can find outliers in your data without the need for manual analysis, custom development, or ML domain expertise.\nIncorrect options:\nLeverage Kinesis Data Analytics to detect anomalies on a data stream from Kinesis Streams by running SQL queries which compute an anomaly score for all transactions and then store all fraudulent transactions in Amazon S3. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the results from Amazon S3 - Using Kinesis Data Analytics involves some custom query development to analyze the incoming data to compute an anomaly score for all transactions. In addition, this solution processes all columns of the data instead of just the subset of columns required for the analysis. Therefore, this option is not the best fit for the given use case.\n<reference image>\nTransform the data from JSON format to Apache Parquet format using an AWS Glue job. Configure AWS Glue crawlers to discover the schema and build the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Leverage Amazon SageMaker to build an anomaly detection model that can detect fraudulent transactions by ingesting data directly from Amazon S3 - Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. Using SageMaker involves custom code development to build, develop, test, and deploy the anomaly detection model that is relevant to the given scenario. Instead, you can directly use QuickSight to identify fraudulent transactions using QuickSight's built-in machine learning-based anomaly detection functionality. Therefore, this option is not the right fit for the given use case.\nLeverage Kinesis Data Firehose to detect anomalies on a data stream from Kinesis Streams via a Lambda function which computes an anomaly score for all transactions and stores all fraudulent transactions in Amazon RDS. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the results from RDS - This option involves significant custom code development on a Lambda function to examine the incoming stream from Firehose and then compute an anomaly score for all transactions. In addition, the lambda looks at all the fields in the data instead of just the subset of fields required for the analysis. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n\n<multiple reference links for a deep dive>\n\n\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

Updated lectures based on student feedback.\nThis course is specially built to prepare you for taking and passing the Microsoft 365 Certified Fundamentals MS-900 Exam.\n\nWhat's different with a Crash Course? Most courses just cover the curriculum while students are still left wondering what questions might be on the exam. Here each section and lecture is looked at from an exam perspective and what questions might be asked which not only helps in understanding the key concepts but also key differences between related concepts and services which most likely will be part of each exam question.\nAlso as much as possible the core of the course is done in the Microsoft 365 Portal which further increases your understanding of the Microsoft 365 Platform. This is aligned with the new performance based testing approach from Microsoft.\nThis exam from Microsoft focuses on all the aspects of the Office 365 Platform. In this course we will cover the following:\n1 - Understanding Cloud Concepts\n2- Understand core Microsoft 365 services and concepts\n3- Understand security, compliance, privacy, and trust in Microsoft 365\n4- Understand Microsoft 365 pricing and support\nSee Curriculum for list of lectures within each of the above course sections.",

I really enjoyed this course . Packed a lot of information , I found it very interesting and useful . Thank you .\"\nGasper says \"Phillip always does a great job, this is my third course from him. Passionate and informed, I will take as many courses as I can from him.\"\nJonas says \"Explaining SQL on a very easyway! Takes you though everything you need to know nice and calm.\"\n\n\nWe start off by installing for free on your Windows desktop or laptop SQL Server, and learning how the six clauses of the SELECT statement - SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY.\nWe'll examine how data is stored in tables, and see why normalisation is important for the proper building of tables.\nWe'll then look at constraints, which allows you to set up rules for your data. Following this, how can we insert, update and delete data? We'll also create views, procedures and functions.\nFinally, we'll investigate how to speed up your queries using indexes, add security, and back up your data.\nNo prior knowledge is required - I'll even show you how to install SQL Server on your computer for free!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce finished, you will have a good introductory knowledge of how databases work and be able to construct your own SELECT statements.

Again, the key to passing the AWS certification exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Database Specialty practice tests are meant to do.\nThese AWS Database Specialty practice exams are designed to focus on important exam domains such as Workload-Specific Database Design and Deployment and Migration, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic was carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official AWS DBS exam guide.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS Certified Database Specialty practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your Database Specialty exam. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese AWS Certified Database Specialty practice exams have a passing score of 75% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 85% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these Database practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment of which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!",

In brief Podman is more secure and a bit more isolated to use than Docker.\n\n\nLegal Notice:\nOpenShift and the OpenShift logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Red Hat, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries.

My boss also bought the test paper after seeing the level of description of answers.\" Joy Vineet Grover.\n\n\n\"I appreciate all your hardwork, the practice questions are really awesome as it won't only familiarize you with the exam but also to guide you throughout the exam topics! I'm looking forward to enrolling on your ACP-420 or ACP-120 whichever comes first. Let's keep in touch!\" Rodney Alfafara.\n\n\n\"This course is very helpful for those who doesn't have knowledge about Jira. Because in this course everything is given related to ACP-620 certification exam. Along with that every question's answer description & link is provided there for more detail related to topic. Question's & answers pattern nicely given in mock exam.\" Pankaj Thengane.\n\n\n\"I was able to pass on my first attempt. I got a 66.66% on the exam. I was scoring in the high 70's and high 80's on the two practice tests here. The other comments are true when they state that the explanations are the most important thing here. Thanks, Razi, you have put together a great knowledge transfer base.\" Owen Pyatt\n\n\n\"Good questions some also were so much tricky but this, builds the confidence and ability to give the attempt for ACP 620 exam. Just give multiple attempts so that you will get used to it.\" avdhut nalawade\n\n\n\"I've passed ACP-620 and I would like to say the materials of this course is very useful. Especailly the explanation, don't just focus on the question only. Try to deep dive into the explanation and make sure you understand why the answer is correct AND why other options are incorrect. Good luck!\"  Ycng.Donald",

There are various types of questions ranging from MCQs, Yes/No type, and questions based upon case studies. I have covered the AZ-104 syllabus extensively and have included questions on topics asked on the official exam.\n\n\nBenefits of taking this course\n\nLatest exam prep content: This course contains AZ-104 questions based on the latest exam syllabus. Questions are based on topics covered in the official AZ-104 exam guide. So, you will be practicing the most up to date questions on the Azure Administrator Exam.\n\nDetailed Reasoning for answers: I have provided detailed explanations for answers. Every question has 4-6 options. Among these options there will be one or more than one correct answer(s), and the rest of the options will be incorrect. I have not only explained why an answer is correct, but have also explained in detail, why other options are incorrect. This will help you UNDERSTAND the answer to a given question and why other options are not correct. Along with the detailed reasoning for each answer, I have also included reference links from the official documentation for a quick read about the concept(s) asked.\n\nUnderstand the exam format/Learn time management: By taking this course, you will get familiar with the type of questions asked on the official exam. Since, this might be your first attempt taking the official AZ-104 exam, being familiar with the exam format will be quite helpful. You will have to answer around 50-60 questions in about 100 minutes. I have kept the tests in the same format. By taking the tests several times, you will also get used to the time management needed to complete the test within the allotted time frame.\n\nIdentify areas of improvements: You can take these tests as many times as you want. These is absolutely no limit on the number of retakes here (You only get 1 attempt in the official exam. For every retake you need to pay the same exam fee to take the exam again). When you finish a test, you get to see the test report. This report will tell you your score and section wise performance. You will also be able to see which questions you got right, and the questions that you didn't answer correctly. By reviewing the test report for each test, you can identify the areas that are strong for you, and also learn about topics/concepts where you need to improve. By taking the tests multiple times, you will be improving your score every time.\n\n\nThis course offers the following\n534 latest exam questions (including questions based on multiple case studies)\nDetailed explanations for answers\nReference links from official documentation for a quick read\nResponsive instructor support\n\n\nQuestions in this course are based upon the following exam domains\nManage Azure identities and governance\nImplement and manage storage\nDeploy and manage Azure compute resources\nImplement and manage virtual networking\nMonitor and maintain Azure resources\n\n\nOfficial AZ-104 exam details\nTotal number of questions asked: 50-60\nTime allotted: 100 mins\nOfficial Exam Cost: USD 165\nExam languages: English, Chinese (Simplified), Korean, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Arabic (Saudi Arabia), Chinese (Traditional), Italian, Indonesian (Indonesia)\nExam can be taken Online (from home/office) or from an Authorised Test Center\n\n\nDo the following two things to pass the AZ-104 exam in the first attempt\nTake each test several times until you are able to score at least 90% here.\nRead the detailed explanations carefully and throughly.\n\n\nNote: In the official exam, you will typically face 50–60 questions, but this practice test contains 80+ questions per test and allows more time for completion. We instructors are limited to creating a maximum of six tests. To ensure all the latest questions are included, I had to consolidate them into these six tests, which is why each test contains more questions than the official exam. If needed, you can pause the test at any time and resume it later.\n\nSee you inside the course.",

      "description": "This course is going to be your bible on solving each coding interview question and competitive programming challenge. The content is based on my 6 year experience of struggling to find and solve a wide range of problems and develop the system for mastering this skill. I cover the exact same content that has helped my students' performance skyrocket and got them offers at top companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon and solid results in the International Competitive Programming Contests.\nWe start from basics such as Mathematics Fundamentals: Prime Numbers, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Fast Modular Exponentiation. Then we dive into interesting challenges and gold tricks on arrays and matrices, followed by Binary Search, Recursion and Divide and Conquer. We continue by exploring fundamental data structures such as Stack, Queue, Deque, Heap and Hash Table. Then, after building a solid foundation, we explore complex topics such as Greedy and Dynamic Programming, in which I reveal bulletproof formulas that guide you in solving every single problem of that specific type.\n\n\nHere's what make this course amazing:\nI guide you through the line of my thought when solving each problem, focusing on building the general approach for any type of problem you can encounter in competitive programming contests or software developing interviews.\nYou will learn all the theory needed, but our main focus here is on practical applications.\nI share with you problem solving tricks and good coding practises that took me years and hundreds of problems to figure out.\nIt's interactive and engaging: I try to keep the theory as simple and natural as possible and we work as a team in solving any problem.\nDo you think it's finally the time to get the Software Developer Job or the results in Competitive Programming you deserve?

If you have a network then you have traffic generated and the Mikrotik Router can control the traffic the way that you want.\nFor example you can create filter rules to filter the unwanted traffic passing via the router or to the router itself. You can use the MikroTik firewall to block all type of attacks such as DOS, Ping flood, Syn Flood etc...\nYou can also create the QOS so you can classify the bandwidth based on type of traffic they do and you can prioritize important traffic. And much more things you can do with the control of your traffic on the MikroTik Router\nIn this course I am going to explain about all of these topics and will go in depth in each one of them.\nThis course will help you to be ready for the MikroTik MTCTCE exam and it will contain a lot of real LAB scenarios to explain in details the best way to make traffic control in your network.",

Computer system validation (CSV) is a process used in the pharmaceutical, healthcare, and other regulated industries to ensure that computerized systems are designed, developed, and operated in a manner that meets predefined requirements and regulatory guidelines. The goal of CSV is to ensure the reliability, integrity, and security of computer systems used in critical processes such as manufacturing, laboratory testing, data analysis, and documentation.\n\n\nRegulatory Compliance: CSV is driven by regulatory requirements imposed by organizations such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and other regulatory bodies. These regulations outline specific requirements for computerized systems in terms of data integrity, security, audit trails, electronic signatures, and other relevant aspects.\n\n\nValidation Lifecycle: CSV follows a lifecycle approach, typically consisting of four main stages: (a) User Requirements Specification (URS), (b) Functional Requirements Specification (FRS), (c) Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ), and (d) Validation Summary Report (VSR). Each stage involves specific activities and documentation to ensure system compliance and performance.\n\n\nRisk Assessment: Risk assessment is a crucial component of CSV. It involves identifying and evaluating potential risks associated with the computer system, such as data integrity issues, security vulnerabilities, software errors, hardware failures, and human errors. Risk assessment helps determine the level of validation effort required and guides the selection of appropriate validation activities.\n\n\nTesting and Documentation: Validation activities include various testing procedures, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). These tests aim to verify that the system functions as intended, meets user requirements, and operates reliably. Comprehensive documentation, including test plans, test scripts, validation protocols, and validation reports, is generated throughout the process to demonstrate compliance.\n\n\nChange Control: Once a computer system is validated, any changes made to the system or its associated processes need to be carefully managed. Change control procedures ensure that modifications, such as system updates, configuration changes, or software upgrades, are thoroughly evaluated, tested, and documented to maintain the validated state of the system.\n\n\nAudit Trail and Data Integrity: CSV emphasizes the importance of audit trails and data integrity. Audit trails are electronic records that capture and document activities performed within the system, providing a reliable chronological history of actions. Data integrity controls, such as secure access, data encryption, backup and recovery mechanisms, and prevention of data tampering, are implemented to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data generated and stored by the system.",

With this course, we will dive into the necessary technologies that you will need to prepare for the CCNA exam and be a serious CCNA at your job. This course is meant for anyone who wants to be in the networking field or to get certified.\nNOTE: This course is not to teach you how to pass a test. It is a course that is design to create serious and strong CCNAs. If you are just looking for course to pass a test, you will find that this course provides you more info than needed.\n\nUse this course along with your CCNA books and your labs. You will find that there is lots of topics and lots of training. If you want to be a CCNA, here is the place to do it.\n\nWith this course you will learn the below topics and more:\n\nNetworking Fundamentals, How a switch operates, IP Address and Subnetting, Routing Protocols like RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF, Access-list, DHCP, and Redundancy. You will need to practice what you have learned on real equipment which includes at least 3 routers and 3 switches.\n\nIf you do not have real equipment, you can purchase it off ebay. If that is sill not an option, then you can use an emulator like GNS3 but this will not allow you do perform switching is a reliable method. You can also get Cisco VIRL which will allow you to perform task on Routers and Switches. All configurations in this course is done on real live equipment.\n\nTake the time to view the free previews of lectures 1, 15, 26 and 54. This will give you over an hour to get comfortable with my teaching style and see exactly what you are purchasing.\nThis is a detailed course and requires the mindset of discipline and patience to become a CCNA.

      "description": "** Course is fully up to date in respect to the official exam update of May 2nd, 2025**\n\n\nWelcome to the Azure AI Fundamentals AI-900 - Practice Test Course!\nAre you preparing for the Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) certification exam? This course is designed to help you succeed by providing high-quality practice tests that closely mirror the real exam.\n\n\nWhat You'll Get:\n\n\n338 Latest exam questions with detailed explanations to each answer\n\nRealistic Exam Simulation: My practice tests are designed to reflect the format, style, and difficulty of the official Azure AI Fundamentals exam. This ensures you get a realistic testing experience.\n\nComprehensive Coverage: The practice tests cover all the domains and objectives of the AI-900 exam, including :\nDescribe Artificial Intelligence workloads and considerations\nDescribe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure\nDescribe features of computer vision workloads on Azure\nDescribe features of Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads on Azure\nDescribe features of generative AI workloads on Azure\n\nDetailed Explanations: Each question comes with a detailed explanation to help you understand the concepts and reasoning behind the correct answers. This is crucial for deepening your knowledge and ensuring you're fully prepared. For each question, I have explained why an answer is correct and have also explained why other options are incorrect. You will also find supporting reference links for a quick read.\n\nVariety of Questions: You'll find a mix of multiple-choice, multiple-response, and scenario-based questions to fully prepare you for what to expect on exam day.\n\nPerformance Tracking: Keep track of your progress with the test review feature. Identify your strengths and areas for improvement to focus your study efforts effectively.\n\n\nSneak peak into what you will get inside the course:\n\n\nQ1. You have 100 instructional videos that do NOT contain any audio. Each instructional video has a script.\nYou need to generate a narration audio file for each video based on the script.\nWhich type of workload should you use?\n\nlanguage modeling\nspeech recognition\nspeech synthesis\ntranslation\n\n\nAnswer(s):\nspeech synthesis is CORRECT because it refers to the process of generating spoken language by a machine based on written input. In this scenario, you have a script (written input) for each video, and you want to generate a narration audio file (spoken language). Therefore, speech synthesis is the appropriate workload to use.\n\n\nlanguage modeling is INCORRECT because language modeling deals with predicting the next word in a sequence based on the previous words. It is commonly used in tasks like text generation or autocomplete suggestions. While it can generate text, it doesn't convert text to speech.\n\n\nspeech recognition is INCORRECT because speech recognition is the process of converting spoken language into written text. In this scenario, you already have the script in written form and need to convert it to spoken language, which is the opposite of what speech recognition does.\n\n\ntranslation is INCORRECT because translation involves converting text or speech from one language to another. The scenario doesn't mention any requirement for translating between languages, only generating narration from a script.\n\n\n***\n\n\nQ2.  Select the answer that correctly completes the following sentence.\n\"A traffic monitoring system that collects vehicle registration numbers from CCTV footage is an example of _________________ in the Azure AI Vision service.\"\n\n\nimage classification\nobject detection\nspatial analysis\ntext extraction\n\n\nAnswer(s):\ntext extraction is CORRECT. The objective is to obtain vehicle registration numbers from the CCTV recordings. Utilizing OCR algorithms for text extraction is the ideal option. These algorithms can identify and pull out textual data from pictures, facilitating the retrieval of registration numbers from video frames. This allows for automated tracking and assessment of traffic data by extracting pertinent textual details.\n\n\nimage classification is INCORRECT because it involves categorizing an entire image into one of several predefined categories. It doesn't extract specific information like text from the image.\n\n\nobject detection is INCORRECT because it identifies and locates objects within an image. While it can detect vehicles, it doesn't specifically extract text like registration numbers.\n\n\nspatial analysis is INCORRECT because it analyzes the movements and interactions of people within a given space. It's not focused on extracting text from images.",

      "description": "As more and more companies migrate their on-premises workloads to the cloud, the demand for highly skilled and certified AWS Professionals will continue to rise over the coming years ahead. The AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 is consistently among the top-paying IT certifications and you can earn over $150,000 per year with an AWS Solutions Architect certification!\nThis AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 video training course is a concise collection of lectures on the most important AWS services that you need to know in order to pass the SAA-C03 exam. It contains the following lessons:\nEXAM OVERVIEW – discusses the exam scope and coverage, exam format, and other important information that you need to know before booking the exam.\nAWS BASICS – an overview of AWS and its global infrastructure.\nAWS SERVICES WALKTHROUGH – thorough discussion of the various AWS services under Compute, Storage, Database, Security, Networking, etc. Note: If you are already enrolled in our other AWS Associate-level video courses, then this Services Walkthrough section is the same across all our Associate training courses. You can opt to skip this part but we recommend that you still go through these at least once.\nAWS DEEP DIVES – provides more in-depth discussions on the most critical AWS services that you must thoroughly understand in order to pass the exam, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, AWS IAM, Amazon VPC, Amazon RDS, etc. Each deep dive section also contains a mini-quiz at the end.\nCOMPARISON OF AWS SERVICES – a versus section that compares two or more seemingly similar AWS services and discusses their use cases.\nEXAM TIPS AND TEST-TAKING STRATEGIES – a run-through of some critical exam-taking strategies that will help you confidently answer the actual exam questions.\nHANDS-ON LABS – some sections have step-by-step demos on how to execute important tasks in the AWS console.\nFULL PRACTICE TEST – one full set of sample test under time pressure that simulates the actual exam environment. All questions have detailed explanations and references after finishing the quiz.\nDOWNLOADABLE COURSE PDF - Access our 1000+ Solutions Architect Associate Course PDF to easily review all the related SOA-C03 exam topics\nAll video lectures in this course have professionally made subtitles to help you gain a better understanding of the concepts discussed. This course will be regularly updated to the new SAA-C03 version, which was released on August 2022. This course is also beneficial for those who are planning to take the initial preparation for the much-advanced AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional SAP-C02 exam.\n\n\nDoes this cover all SAA-C03 topics even if the course length is less than 15 hours long?\nAbsolutely yes. A lengthy video course does not mean it is relevant to the actual SAA-C03 version. We carefully designed our lesson to cover all the relevant topics and AWS services in a more concise way by providing an overview of all AWS Services by category. Then we offer deep dive sections on specific AWS services that are covered more in-depth on the SAA-C03 exam.\n\n\nIs there a new version for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate exam?\nAWS made an announcement last March 2022 that there would be a new version of their popular AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate exam. The new SAA exam code has been upgraded to SAA-C03 and was released on August 2022.\n\n\nWhen will the new SAA-C04 version for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate exam be released?\nThe AWS team has not yet released any information on this.\n\n\nIs this an exam dump for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 exam?\nNo, it isn't. AWS is always updating its exam content, and thus, the exam dumps you are seeing over the Internet are mostly inaccurate and outright illegal. The provided answers are wrong, and you are not provided with the proper explanations as to why an option is correct or not.\nWe write our own practice exam content based on the official SAA-C03 Exam Guide and on our own AWS exam experience. If you are looking for exam dumps for the SAA-C03 exam, please look somewhere else because this course is definitely NOT for you.\n\n\nWhat are the new exam topics that I should expect on the SAA-C03 exam?\nTo view the new SAA-C03 exam topics that you should prepare for, you have to check the official Exam Guide and look at its Appendix section. It contains an enumerated list of the related AWS services that are included in the exam. Moreover, it even includes a list of non-related AWS services that won’t show up in your actual AWS exam.\nIn Analytics, prepare to see Amazon Athena, AWS Data Exchange, AWS Data Pipeline, Amazon EMR, AWS Glue, Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lake Formation, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service), Amazon QuickSight and Amazon Redshift. For Application Integration, the SAA-C03 exam covers Amazon AppFlow, AWS AppSync, Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events), Amazon MQ, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), and AWS Step Functions.\nThe new exam also includes a lot of Machine Learning topics, such as Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Forecast, Amazon Fraud Detector, Amazon Kendra, Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Textract, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Translate, and many more.",

These are great mock test. I completed course on google to read initial content then took 4 of these mocks. Best part of these mocks is their explained answers. they really help to clear your concepts which led to clearing exam in first attempt - Gurpreet K\n\n\n5 STARS\nI highly recommend it; it was a great experience for me. The practice exams were really helpful. Some of the questions were very similar to what I had studied, so I was able to mark and answer them directly. It was really motivating. And, I found the actual exam to be much easier in comparison - Temel K\n\n\n5 STARS\nJust took and passed the exam on first take with high score! This practice test helps a lot and the questions here are very informative which gives you an overall knowledge on Google Cloud and prepare you very well for the exam. Just a piece of advice that you need to focus on the explanation at the bottom of each question when you review the questionnaire after the take the practice test. Because it will give you a better insight on every process and terminology about the GCP. Good luck to all the examiners and I hope you passed it too - Ferreolo L\n\n\n5 STARS\nThis training was very helpful in helping me prepare for the Digital Leader exam. I especially liked the details answer review for all options for each question - Tamara B\n\n\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION + SOLUTION EXPLANATION\nYour company, \"SensorWorld,\" is launching an app called \"GlobalSensorNet,\" designed to collect vast amounts of data from millions of sensors located worldwide. The app requires a database capable of providing high-speed, global data storage for a large volume of unstructured data. Which Google Cloud product should SensorWorld choose?\n\n\nA. Firestore\nB. Cloud Data Fusion\nC. Cloud SQL\nD. Cloud Bigtable\n\n\n\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because Firestore is a NoSQL document database that excels at managing and syncing data for mobile, web, and server development. While it can handle unstructured data and provides high availability and scalability, it is not primarily designed for the high-speed, global data storage needed for large volumes of data from millions of sensors. Firestore is more suitable for applications requiring real-time updates and data synchronization across various devices, but it may not handle the scale and throughput required for SensorWorld's needs.\n\n\nB is incorrect because Cloud Data Fusion is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data integration service rather than a database solution. It is designed to help organizations build and manage data pipelines, integrating data from various sources into a unified view. While it can facilitate the processing and movement of data, it does not offer the direct high-speed, global storage capabilities necessary for storing vast amounts of unstructured sensor data. SensorWorld needs a database solution rather than a data integration tool.\n\n\nC is incorrect because Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. It is designed for structured data with predefined schemas and supports SQL queries. Although Cloud SQL is highly reliable and scalable, it is not optimized for handling large volumes of unstructured data or providing the global, high-speed data storage required by the GlobalSensorNet app. The nature of sensor data, which can be highly variable and unstructured, makes Cloud SQL less suitable for this use case.\n\n\nD is correct because Cloud Bigtable is a fully managed NoSQL database service designed for large analytical and operational workloads. It is optimized for high throughput and low latency, making it ideal for storing and managing vast amounts of unstructured data from millions of sensors worldwide. Cloud Bigtable is highly scalable and provides the performance required for real-time data processing, which aligns perfectly with the needs of SensorWorld's GlobalSensorNet app. Its ability to handle large volumes of data efficiently and provide global accessibility makes it the best choice for this scenario.\n\n\n\n\n**See you inside the course and hope to see you too build the core certification knowledge!",

What set expert level engineers apart from average engineers is Troubleshooting methodology and efficiency. Troubleshooting has to be systematic and logical, and not by random trial and error attempts.\nIn this course, I will demonstrate troubleshooting of Cisco devices in multiple labs.Topics in this course include routing, switching, BGP, IPv6, IP services, MPLS and Security. You can use this course to learn how to troubleshoot Cisco devices in real production and to help you to prepare for the CCNP TSHOOT exam and the Troubleshooting sections of the CCIE lab exams. If you are already have CCNA level knowledge and/or experience, or you are about to complete your CCNA studies, then you can use this course as a start for learning advanced troubleshooting.\nThis course uses multiple explaining ways in addition to videos. At the beginning of each section there is an article for summarized troubleshooting steps that is available for download as a PDF. And for each lab, initial configuration will be available for download in order for students to practice the labs and challenge themselves if they can solve the tickets before watching the videos or even after. After each section, there will be a practice test for the student to check what he has learned. Some tickets have multiple possible solutions. Therefore, restrictions have been set so that there should be only one valid solution.\nLet us start the course together and begin the troubleshooting journey. Happy troubleshooting!\n\n\nVery Important: How to use this course\nBased on students' feedback, you can view this course by going directly to the section you are interested in. However, it is recommended that you at least skim quickly over the other preceding sections.\nExamples:\nYou can go to the routing section directly if you are interested in that topic and feel that you are already good at troubleshooting switching, or skim quickly over the switching section as a review\nYou can go to the BGP, IPv6, or IP Serives sections directly if you are interested in one of those topics and feel that you are already good at troubleshooting routing, or skim quickly over the routing section as a review",

Its core components include the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for data storage and the MapReduce programming model for data processing. Hadoop's ecosystem comprises various tools and frameworks designed to enhance its capabilities. Notable components include Apache Pig for data scripting, Apache Hive for data warehousing, Apache HBase for NoSQL database functionality, and Apache Spark for faster, in-memory data processing. These tools collectively form a robust ecosystem that enables organizations to tackle big data challenges efficiently, making Hadoop a cornerstone in the world of data analytics and processing.\n\n\nNoSQL: NoSQL, short for \"not only SQL,\" represents a family of database management systems designed to handle large and unstructured data. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases offer flexibility, scalability, and agility. They are particularly well-suited for applications involving social media, e-commerce, and real-time analytics. Prominent NoSQL databases include Hbase for columnar storage used extensively in Hadoop Ecosystem.\n\n\nSpark: Apache Spark is an open-source, lightning-fast data processing framework designed for big data analytics. It offers in-memory processing, which significantly accelerates data analysis and machine learning tasks. Spark supports various programming languages, including Java, Scala, and Python, making it accessible to a wide range of developers.  With its ability to process both batch and streaming data, Spark has become a preferred choice for organizations seeking high-performance data analytics and machine learning capabilities, outpacing traditional MapReduce-based solutions for many use cases.",

Browse IT careers for professionals, navigate certifications and discover jobs in areas that interest you, and open doors to opportunity and success.\nWhat is the CompTIA A+ certification?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification can be considered an entry-level certificate for IT professionals. Getting a CompTIA A+ certificate can lead to a successful IT career. CompTIA created this certificate for people seeking employment as a help desk, support, service center, or networking technician. The CompTIA A+ certification exam covers PC and laptop hardware, software installation, the configuration of computer and mobile operating systems, basic networking, troubleshooting, and security skills. Many enterprises require a CompTIA A+ certificate for their entry-level information technology jobs. Passing the CompTIA A+ certification exam can also serve as a springboard toward other technology certificates and career advancements.\nDo I need CompTIA A+ for Network+?\nGetting the CompTIA A+ certification is not a requirement to get a Network+ certification. Each certification covers a separate area of computer technology. The A+ certification will test your knowledge of PC hardware, mobile device hardware, operating systems, security, cloud computing, and troubleshooting hardware and network connectivity. It consists of two tests. You can acquire the Network+ plus certification by passing one test. This test validates a student's knowledge of wired and wireless networks and their understanding of topics like unified communications and virtualization. While having both the CompTIA A+ certification and the Network+ certification will give an IT technician more opportunities when looking for a job, neither certification is a prerequisite for the other.\nWhy Should I Get CompTIA A+ Certified?\nCompTIA A+ will either help you get your start in IT or help you get promoted in your current job. It is the industry standard for establishing a career in IT and is the preferred qualifying credential for technical support and IT operational roles.\nIT pros with CompTIA A+ have jobs like IT support specialist, IT field service technician, desktop support analyst, and help desk tier 2 support. And, companies like Intel, Dell, Ricoh, Nissan, Blue Cross, and Blue Shield, and HP all look for CompTIA A+ certification when hiring.\nHow hard is the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe difficulty of the test will depend in large part on your interest and experience in the subject. If you are taking the CompTIA A+ exam because you have already been building and fixing computers for a while and have a working knowledge of operating systems, especially Windows, you should have no problem passing the test. The exam consists of two tests. Each has 90 questions, which consist of multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. For each test, you get an hour and a half.\nHow many questions are on the CompTIA A+ exam and what is a passing score?\nThe CompTIA A+ exam consists of two tests of 90 questions each. The problems include multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop questions, and performance-based questions. The first exam covers hardware, networking technology, mobile devices, cloud computing, virtualization, and networking troubleshooting. The second exam tests the knowledge of software troubleshooting, installing operating systems, configuring operating systems, and security. The passing score for the first exam, 220-1001, is 675 out of a scale of 100-900. For the second exam, 220-1002, a passing score is 700 out of a scale of 100-900. This means that to pass the first test, you need to answer at least 69 out of 90 questions correctly. Whereas for the second test, you need to have 70 correct out of 90.\nIs CompTIA A+ worth it?\nMany entry-level IT jobs require A+ certification. It proves to the business you are applying to that you have basic IT knowledge. They want to know that you can do the work and don't need basic training. If you have no experience in the industry, having a CompTIA A+ certificate can get you an entry-level job. After that, you can specialize, add other certifications, and advance in your career. The CompTIA A+ certificate has been the first step in a successful career for many IT professionals.\nWhat's next after the CompTIA A+?\nFor many IT professionals, the CompTIA A+ is the first of many certifications earned over the course of their careers. Since the A+ certification is fairly general, you may choose to move into an IT specialization, like networking, cybersecurity, or cloud computing. CompTIA offers more advanced certifications in these fields, as do many other reputable organizations. Take a look at this IT certification roadmap to inspire your next career goal.\nWhat are the objectives of the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe test objectives are to ensure that an aspiring IT professional has the basic knowledge for an entry-level information technology job. CompTIA A+ applicants should be able to assemble components based on customer requirements. The exam tests applicants on their ability to install, configure and maintain PCs, mobile devices, and software. They should know the basics of networking and security forensics. CompTIA A+ applicants should have basic troubleshooting skills to diagnose, resolve, and document common hardware and software issues. They should know how to provide essential customer support. They should also understand the basics of scripting, virtualization, desktop imaging, and deployment.\nWhat jobs can I get with CompTIA A+?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification is the industry standard for a career in IT and is the preferred credential for technical support and IT operational roles. One job a person with an A+ certificate may choose is IT support specialist. An IT support specialist is responsible for installing and configuring computer hardware and software, monitoring and maintaining computer networks, and providing technical support across a company. Another role someone with A+ certification may choose is help desk technician. A help desk technician diagnoses and supports hardware and software issues across a company. Other job titles that require A+ certification include service desk analyst, technical support specialist, field service technician, network engineer, data support technician, desktop support administrator, help desk technician, and system support specialist.\nWhich should you choose CompTIA A+ or CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)?\nCompTIA offers two separate entry-level certifications, the CompTIA A+, and the CompTIA IT Fundamentals, or ITF+. They’re slightly different. The CompTIA A+ is billed as a certification that will test you on the knowledge needed to land an entry-level IT job. The ITF+, on the other hand, is designed for students and professionals who want to see if IT is a right career fit for them. The ITF+ exam is also used by non-IT professionals who want a broad introduction to the field. If you’re still on the fence about whether you’d like a job in IT, getting the ITF+ can be a good way to test the waters. If you know you want to commit to IT work and are ready to gain job-ready skills, the A+ certification is probably a better path.\nHow long will it take to get CompTIA A+ certified?\nThe length of time it takes to get a CompTIA A+ certification depends on your current experience level and whether you take any courses to prepare for the exam.

Good examples to put into practice.\nAndrew says: A well-organized, compact course in Power Automate aimed at the Microsoft Applied Skills - Power Automate credential. ... Phillip Burton, has put together a well-structured course that aligns well with the requirements for this credential. ... The course consisted of six small projects, each one composed of a unique aspect of the Power Automate ecosystem. The material was concise, clear, and well-organized. No time is wasted throughout the course and ancilliary materials are provided and well put together. I took (and passed) the Applied Skills exam immediately after completion of this course. ... Highly recommended!\nMichael says: Clear and concise, straight to the point no fluff or waffle would recommend.\n\n\nMicrosoft Power Automate allows you to create flows to automate your business processes. You can record information, send emails and ask for approval based on a schedule, or when the need arises\nIn this 2 hour course we’ll cover the skills that you need for the APL-7002 Microsoft Applied Skills credential for Power Automate.\nThe tasks that you need to perform to get this skill are:\nCreate triggers. This activates the flow, and there are three main triggers – automated, instant and scheduled.\nCreate and configure actions for notifications. Actions are what happens during the flow. You can read and write data, and send emails and mobile notifications.\nImplement conditional logic. We’ll look at the Switch action, which compares two values together, and the Condition action, which is more versatile.\nCreate and configure approvals. This allows someone to look at the information generated in the flow, and approve or reject the request.\nConfigure owners and sharing. We’ll look at the difference between owners and run-only users.\nWe’ll go through several practical examples, so you can see how you can create your own flows\nBy the end of the course, you'll be much more confident about using Power Automate and perhaps even take the official Microsoft assessment. That would look great on your CV or resume.",

Since Oracle released Java SE 21 Developer exam, I highly recommend my students to take 1Z0-830, rather than 1Z0-830. The preparation is almost identical, but you'll get 30 minutes more on your exam and you'll be certified in latest LTS technology.\n\n\nIf you are a candidate for the OCA of Foundations exam, you should only watch the lessons which are marked with [OCA], and if you are aspiring to get the OCP certificate, you should watch all lessons.\nAfter you complete the course, you should practice and test your knowledge and problem solving skills with mock exams. My personal recommendation is to use Enthuware, but there are plenty of other resources out there as well.\n\n\nThis course will cover following topics:\n\n\nBuilding Blocks of Java program [OCA]\nOperators [OCA]\nFlow Control [OCA]\nStrings [OCA]\nArrays [OCA]\nDate and Time [OCA]\nMethods [OCA]\nClass Design [OCA]\nAbstract Classes & Interfaces [OCA]\nLambdas & Functional Programming [OCA]\nCollections [OCA]\nExceptions [OCA]\nMath APIs [OCP]\nBeyond Classes [OCP]\nStreams [OCP]\nLocalization [OCP]\nModules [OCP]\nConcurrency [OCP]\nI/O [OCP]\nJDBC [OCP]\nGet Certified for Java SE 21\n\n\nAll presentation materials are available for download as PDF files!\n\n\nI strongly encourage you to try out all the examples given in the course, and also to play around with the code to further explore the possibilities coding in Java. You can do this on your local computer by downloading JDK 8 (for OCA candidates) or JDK 17 or JDK 21 (for OCP candidates) from Oracle or OpenJDK and using your favorite IDE. I recommend IntelliJ, but Eclipse or NetBeans will do the job as well.\nEven quicker option is to use online compilers. My favorites are JDoodle and OneCompiler. This is the fastest way to try out small pieces of code.\nMy name is Luka Popov and I’ll be your instructor for this course. I am fully certified Java Developer (Oracle Certified Associate: Java SE 8 Programmer, Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 17 Developer), with PhD in theoretical physics. I have 10+ years of teaching experience on university level, and 5+ years as a professional software developer.

The Calculation Group clarified this relatively new feature for me, so I will use it in the future. I'm taking my DP-600 exam soon. This course has filled in my knowledge of Fabric. I've even activated my Fabric 60 Day Trial because of this course, so I can actually go through the steps of creating items and manipulating data first-hand. The corse was presented in clear and logical manner.\"\nSaurabh says: \"This course is great. Phillip has explained the concepts in details and hands on activities, practice activities and in depth explanation of advanced DAX functions, SQL, PySpark and KQL makes this course stand out. I am going to attempt DP 600 in next four days. Thank you Phillip, I learned new things in each video. Keep bringing such great courses. I love your such in depth hands on courses.\"\nJerry says: \"Hands down, this is one of the best courses for DP-600 available on Udemy. I’ve purchased several other courses, but none compare to this one. It’s clear, concise, and focused, with no unnecessary content. I’ve received my certification, thanks to this excellent course. Highly recommend!\"\n\n\nIt comes in four parts:\nPart 1 - Power BI knowledge you will have gained if you have already studied for the PL-300 exam,\nPart 2 - additional Power BI knowledge (not part of the PL-300 exam),\nPart 3 - Fabric lakehouses and data warehouses using SQL, and\nPart 4 - eventhouses using KQL.\nPart 1 of this course is for you if you have not studied for Microsoft's PL-300 exam. If you have, then please join me in Section 1, and then skip to Part 2 (Section 9). In Part 1, we'll look at:\nInstalling and creating a report in Power BI Desktop and uploading it to Power BI Service,\nCreating calculated columns and measures using DAX, and\nOther PL-300 exam topics needed for the DP-600 exam.\nIn Part 2 of this course, we'll start with Power BI. We'll look at:\nDeveloping our design of semantic models, including calculation groups/items and field parameters.\nExpanding our DAX knowledge, with DAX variables and windowing functions.\nUsing external apps, such as Tableau Editor 2 and DAX Studio,\nImplementing many-to-many relationships, implementing dynamic strings, and using the Optimize menu.\nThe analytics development lifecycle, focusing on version control and deployment solutions,\nOther Analytics topics, such as creating aggregation tables and using the XMLA endpoint.\nIn Part 3 of this course, we'll query and manipulate data in Fabric lakehouses and data warehouses using SQL.\nAfter a brief look around Fabric, we'll start by ingesting data by using data pipelines and dataflows.\nWe'll then create a lakehouse and Data Warehouse and use the SQL Analytics Endpoint to manipulate the data in SQL. We'll learn the 6 principle clauses in the SQL Select statement: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY.\nIn Part 4 of this course, we'll look at the Eventhouses and KQL:\nWe'll create an eventhouse, see sample KQL queries, and how you can convert SQL queries to KQL.\nWe'll select, filter and aggregate data using KQL.\nWe'll expand our KQL queries using string, number, datetime and timespan functions.\nFinally, we'll transform data using KQL, merging and joining data, and identify and resolve duplicate and missing data.\nNo prior knowledge is assumed. We will start from the beginning for all languages and items, although any prior knowledge of DAX, SQL or KQL is useful.\nOnce you have completed the course, you will have a good knowledge of maintaining a data analytics solution, preparing data, and implementing and managing semantic models. And with some practice, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification DP-600 - wouldn't the \"Microsoft Certified: Fabric Analytics Engineer Associate\" certification look good on your CV or resume?\nI hope to see you in the course - why not have a look at what you could learn?",

And that is the reason that this LABS course was renamed to reflect that.\nThe course not only gets the student prepared for the new CCENT simulations, but gives the student more practice labs than what is covered in the certification exam.\nThis course is over 10+ hours long and it is a complete Hands-On lab course.\nDISCLAIMER:\nPlease note that the simulators/emulators used in this course are not part of the course. It is the students responsibility to have these to practice with. The Cisco Packet Tracer and/or VIRAL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab) are Cisco proprietary software and can only be obtained through Cisco. It is up to each student to obtain the simulator/emulator of their choice to study along with this course.\nIn this course we will cover all the labs required to prepare you to practice and make sure you are prepared to tackle the simulation part of the CCENT certification exam.\nBe aware that the for Cisco's new CCENT exam, the practice of simulations is extremely important and crucial to pass the certification. Therefore, this course will be prepared the student to be able to configure routers and switches by the time they complete this course.\nThis course is designed for the student to follow along with me as I explain the labs and the configurations.\nMy “Cisco CCNA for the 200-120 & now CCENT Labs\" course is the gateway your success!\nThis course will enable you to overcome the barriers of the simulation part of the exam and give you the confidence needed to pass.\nRemember that Cisco's new CCENT (100-105) certification exam is timed!\nThis course will make sure you can breeze through the configurations and simulations so you can have time to spare for other parts of the exam.\nAlso, please keep in mind, that when taking your cert, more than likely, you will have one or more simulations that have several parts to it...meaning, one question can be comprised of 2 or more parts, and all parts MUST be answered in order for you to get credit for that question.\nNot answering one or more parts to any question will result in failing that question!!!\nWe definitely can't have that!\nThe difference between passing and failing may be just 1 point!\nThis is precisely why it is extremely important that you look at each question carefully and answer ALL parts of that question. Doing this will guarantee your success...and that's precisely why I am here...to make sure you have the tools to succeed!\nAs with all my courses, I prepare them carefully and specifically to ensure that you can pass Cisco's new CCENT (100-105) certification exam and join the IT and/or Networking professions with this most important cert.\nWelcome to the CLUB!\n~ Laz ;)",

Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions.

The questions in these practice tests do not show up in the real certification exam. The questions in these practice tests cover a wide range of GCP services that are relevant for the certification. You can use these questions to identify gaps in your knowledge and be better prepared for your certification exam.\n\n\nEvery question has a detailed explanation of why an option is correct and why the other options are wrong. Here is an example:\n\n\nQ. Your company has several business-critical applications running on its on-premises data centre, which is already at full capacity, and you need to expand to Google Cloud Platform to handle traffic bursts. You want to virtual machine instances in both on-premises data centre and Google Cloud Compute Engine to communicate via their internal IP addresses. What should you do?\nA. Create a new GCP project and a new VPC and make this a shared VPC with the on-premises network. Allow applications in the data centre to scale to Google Cloud on the shared VPC.\nB. Create a new GCP project and a new VPC and enable VPC peering between the new VPC and networks in the data centre.\nC. Add bastion hosts in GCP as well as on-premises network and set up a proxy tunnel between the bastion hosts in GCP and the bastion hosts in the on-premises network. Allow applications in the data centre to scale to Google Cloud through the proxy tunnel.\nD. Create a new VPC in GCP with a non-overlapping IP range and configure Cloud VPN between the on-premises network and GCP. Allow applications in the data centre to scale to Google Cloud through the VPN tunnel.\n\n\nCreate a new GCP project and a new VPC and make this a shared VPC with the on-premises network. Allow applications in the data centre to scale to Google Cloud on the shared VPC. is not right.\nShared VPC allows an organization to connect resources from multiple projects to a common Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network so that they can communicate with each other securely and efficiently using internal IPs from that network. When you use Shared VPC, you designate a project as a host project and attach one or more other service projects to it. This in no way helps us connect to our on-premises network.\nRef: https: //cloud. google. com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc\n\n\nCreate a new GCP project and a new VPC and enable VPC peering between the new VPC and networks in the data centre. is not right.\nGoogle Cloud VPC Network Peering allows internal IP address connectivity across two Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks regardless of whether they belong to the same project or the same organization. VPC Network Peering enables you to connect VPC networks so that workloads in different VPC networks can communicate internally. Traffic stays within Google's network and doesn't traverse the public internet. This doesn't help us connect to our on-premises network.\nRef: https: //cloud. google. com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering\n\n\nAdd bastion hosts in GCP as well as on-premises network and set up a proxy tunnel between the bastion hosts in GCP and the bastion hosts in the on-premises network. Allow applications in the data centre to scale to Google Cloud through the proxy tunnel. is not right.\nBastion hosts provide an external facing point of entry into a network containing private network instances. Bastion hosts are primarily for end users so they can connect to an instance that does not have an external IP address through a bastion host.\nRef: https: //cloud. google. com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-advanced\n\n\nCreate a new VPC in GCP with a non-overlapping IP range and configure Cloud VPN between the on-premises network and GCP. Allow applications in the data centre to scale to Google Cloud through the VPN tunnel. is the right answer.\nCloud VPN securely connects your on-premises network to your Google Cloud (GCP) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network through an IPsec VPN connection.\nRef: https: //cloud. google. com/vpn/docs/concepts/overview",

This is THE practice exams course to give you the winning edge.\nThese practice exams have been co-authored by Stephane Maarek and Abhishek Singh who bring their collective experience of passing 20 AWS Certifications to the table.\nThe tone and tenor of the questions mimic the real exam. Along with the detailed description and “exam alert” provided within the explanations, we have also extensively referenced AWS documentation to get you up to speed on all domain areas being tested for the SCS-C02 exam.\n\n\nWe want you to think of this course as the final pit-stop so that you can cross the winning line with absolute confidence and get AWS Certified! Trust our process, you are in good hands.\nAll questions have been written from scratch! And more questions are being added over time!\n\n\nQuality speaks for itself\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nA mid-sized company recently deployed Amazon GuardDuty to monitor their AWS environment for potential security threats. The security team noticed a high number of RDP brute force attacks originating from an Amazon EC2 instance and decided to take action to prevent any issues. The company's security engineer was tasked with implementing an automated solution that could block the suspicious instance until the issue could be investigated and remediated.\nWhich of the following solutions should the security engineer implement?\n\n\nHave Security Hub ingest GuardDuty findings and send events to Kinesis Data Streams via EventBridge. Configure Kinesis Data Analytics to process the data stream and block traffic to/from the suspicious instance by updating the security group so that it has no inbound and outbound rules\nHave Security Hub ingest GuardDuty findings and send events to EventBridge that triggers a Lambda function to block traffic to/from the suspicious instance by updating the WAF web ACL\nHave Security Hub ingest GuardDuty findings and send events to EventBridge that triggers a Lambda function to block traffic to/from the suspicious instance by updating the network ACL rules\nHave Security Hub ingest GuardDuty findings and send events to Kinesis Data Streams via EventBridge. Configure a Lambda function to process the data stream and block traffic to/from the suspicious instance by updating the security group so that it has no inbound and outbound rules\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 4.\nExplanation:\nHave Security Hub ingest GuardDuty findings and send events to Kinesis Data Streams via EventBridge. Configure a Lambda function to process the data stream and block traffic to/from the suspicious instance by updating the security group so that it has no inbound and outbound rules files\nAWS Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in AWS and helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices.\nSecurity Hub collects security data from across AWS accounts, services (such as GuardDuty), and supported third-party partner products and helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security issues.\n\n\nHow Security Hub works:\nReference Image\nvia - Reference Link\n\n\nLeveraging Amazon EventBridge's integration with Security Hub, you can automate your AWS services to respond automatically to system events such as application availability issues or resource changes. Events from AWS services are delivered to EventBridge in near-real time and on a guaranteed basis. You can write simple rules to indicate which events you are interested in and what automated actions to take when an event matches a rule. The actions that can be automatically triggered include the following:\nInvoking an AWS Lambda function\nInvoking the Amazon EC2 run command\nRelaying the event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams\nActivating an AWS Step Functions state machine\nNotifying an Amazon SNS topic or an Amazon SQS queue\nSending a finding to a third-party ticketing, chat, SIEM, or incident response and management tool\n\n\nFor the given use case, you can process the Security Hub events in Kinesis Data Streams by using a Lambda function that monitors any UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/RDPBruteForce finding from GuardDuty that is relayed via Security Hub. This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment was involved in a brute force attack aimed at obtaining passwords to RDP services on Windows-based systems. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources. When the Lambda function sees a matching finding, it can block traffic to/from the suspicious instance by updating the security group so that it has no inbound and outbound rules.\n\n\nIncorrect options:\nHave Security Hub ingest GuardDuty findings and send events to EventBridge that triggers a Lambda function to block traffic to/from the suspicious instance by updating the WAF web ACL - WAF web ACL can only be applied to the following resource types: CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AWS AppSync GraphQL API and Amazon Cognito user pool. You can use AWS WAF to control how your protected resources respond to HTTP(S) web requests. The given use case is about RDP brute force attacks originating from an EC2 instance, so using WAF web ACL is not relevant, as it cannot monitor traffic originating from an EC2 instance.\n\n\nHave Security Hub ingest GuardDuty findings and send events to EventBridge that triggers a Lambda function to block traffic to/from the suspicious instance by updating the network ACL rules - Using Network ACL rules would impact all instances in a subnet. It will not isolate the traffic only for the suspicious instance. Hence this option is incorrect.\n\n\nHave Security Hub ingest GuardDuty findings and send events to Kinesis Data Streams via EventBridge. Configure Kinesis Data Analytics to process the data stream and block traffic to/from the suspicious instance by updating the security group so that it has no inbound and outbound rules - Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics can be used to transform and analyze streaming data in real-time with Apache Flink. Apache Flink is an open-source framework and engine for processing data streams. Kinesis Data Analytics reduces the complexity of building, managing, and integrating Apache Flink applications with other AWS services. This option has been added as a distractor as Kinesis Data Analytics cannot be used to update the security groups for an instance.\n\n\nwith reference links\n\n\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

These set of questions are completely different from the practice exam questions set 1.\n\n\nIn this course, we fully prepare you for what it is like to take the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification exam. These 6 full-length practice exams with 90 questions (including simulation-style questions or PBQs as CompTIA calls them) are timed for 90 minutes to help you pace yourself for the real exam. We have carefully hand-crafted each question to put you to the test and prepare you to pass the certification exam with confidence.\n\n\nYou won't be hoping you are ready, you will know you are ready to sit for and pass the exam. After practicing these tests and scoring a 90% or higher on them, you will be ready to PASS on the first attempt and avoid costly re-schedule fees, saving you time and money.\n\n\nYou will receive your total final score, along with feedback on each and every question, telling you exactly why each answer is correct, and which domain (and objective) you need to study more in order to pinpoint the areas in which you need to improve and perform some additional study.\n\n\nWe cover all five domains of the SY0-701 exam, including:\n1.0 General Security Concepts (12%)\n2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations (22%)\n3.0 Security Architecture (18%)\n4.0 Security Operations (28%)\n5.0 Security Program Management and Oversight (20%)\n\n\nOur CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) practice exams provide you with realistic test questions and provide you with interactive, question-level feedback.\n\n\nWe have some of the highest-rated CompTIA training courses on the Udemy platform and we invite you to visit my instructor profile to learn more about me, the certifications that I hold, and read the reviews of my courses. This course is consistently updated to ensure it stays current and up-to-date with the latest release of the CompTIA Security+ exam, and also provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked!\n\n\nWhat others are saying about my CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701): Practice Exams with Simulations course:\n\n\nThese questions are unique and well-conducted to prepare for security+ with relevant information. I am using multiple resources and this is definitely one to have. (Valdrin, 5 stars)\n\n\nI passed and these practice tests were a very important tool in my success. The details: the questions in these practice tests require very careful reading. For me, that was key as the actual exam's questions were more concise, so I felt well-prepared. To use these practice exams effectively (at least for me), I recommend taking the first one, determine what areas are the weak and emphasize your study in those areas for a number of days. Then take the next test and see what progress - or lack of - and then the study again. Repeat this until you complete all six. Then start the process again. If you have hit your study targets consistently, you should be able to get to 90% and above on the next or subsequent round of sample exams. I found that I was easily getting above 90% on my last week of studying before my exam. I did find the simulated questions to be inadequate, however. You may need to find an additional source for performance-based questions to supplement what you are learning here with the multiple choice questions. Don't overlook the PBQs! They were a challenge on the exam but I prepared well outside of Dion's tests and I think that's what allowed me to pass (honestly, who knows; there isn't any detailed feedback when the results are displayed and I don't know how much the PBQs are weighted in the total point calculation). Good luck! (Edward Valizan, 5 stars)\n\n\nAnother quality piece from Jason Dion. Honestly, if you want to pass any CompTIA exams, just buy Jason's practice exams. I have just bought the CySA+ practice exams, I am sure I will pass for the first time. Edit: I see a lot of people are complaining that it is not like the real exam questions and it does not cover all the topics. Of course you use other training materials too. I have read the Chaplle-Seidl book by Sybex. I have done all the online tests included with the book. I had the official CompTIA notes as well. I have watched a full video course from a wrong source it was so boring and dry, it was just a waste of my time. All in all, to me these tests covered all the topics I did not cover from the other materials, they are difficult but similarly worded than the exam, so your brain is trained for the real exam. I did not have time to go thorugh them 3 times so I have never done 90% on any of them, still passed the Sec+ exam easy. Anyways if you want to go down that route and want the real exam questions; exam dumps are readily available for free after some googling. Unfortunately, I don't see the point of that.  (Gabe Laszlo, 5 stars)\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will earn 6 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",

The ICND2 exam has been retired by Cisco, I recommend you take my CCNA 200-301 course instead - it covers the current CCNA exam.\n\n\nThis course offers an easy to understand, structured approach to shortcut your path to mastering Cisco networking to the ICND2 level and beyond.\nIn this course, you will:\nDevelop a deep understanding of Cisco’s features and functions\nWalk through complete and easy to understand explanations of each technology area covered in the exam\nFollow simple step by step instructions to build your own fully featured lab on your laptop for free\nGain hands on configuration and troubleshooting experience through comprehensive lab exercises\nLearn how networking really works through real world examples throughout the course\nGain demonstrable knowledge and practical experience to supercharge your networking career\nSupercharge Your Learning with Hands-on Practice\nThis course is chock full of activities.

You’ll also hone your hands-on skills to succeed as a network engineer in the real world. I’m a professional instructor who has been entrusted by Cisco since 2007 to develop and deliver training courses for their own engineers and partners. I’ve also designed multiple training courses for the largest service providers in the Asia Pacific region such as IBM, Verizon, and the Australian National Broadband Network. I’ve spent years distilling my decade’s worth of networking experience from the field into mentoring and supporting other systems engineers, and I’m passionate about passing my knowledge of Cisco networks onto others.\nAs a student in this course, you’ll get lifetime access to the course materials and answers to every question you ask in the Q&A board. I love interacting with my students: anything you want to know, please ask. The course also comes with an unconditional risk-free 30 day money-back guarantee–that's my personal promise of your success.\nValue\nIf you take a comparable course at a training centre it will cost you thousands of dollars, and when it’s over you can’t experience the tutorials again or ask the instructor any more questions. When you take my course you can learn anytime you want in the comfort of your own home, and I’m always here for you whenever you need any help.\nNot sure about the best way to pay for this course? Ask your manager at work if they’ll expense it. They won’t have to pay the large fees of traditional classroom learning or have to cover your absence for a week. They get huge value from this investment in your future.\nI’m excited to share all of my knowledge with you.\nJoin me on this journey to turbocharging your career!",

      "description": "The TDD Masterclass by Petros Efthymiou.\nLearn State-of-the-art Android development by building a real production app.\nAre you following dozens of forums and articles and buying courses in order to move your development skills and career to the next level?\nI am, too, but more often than not, after completing them, I realize that there is still a HUGE amount of work left to be done to connect all the pieces together and make them work on a real application. I found that even though a course was providing comprehensive knowledge on coroutines, it didn't mean that I knew how to integrate them with Retrofit, Live data, or Hilt. And because another course was extensive on Test Driven Development after completing it, I didn't know how to write an application with TDD using the latest Android tech stack.\nAfter buying courses, reading articles & forums, and a couple of months of hands-on practice, I have finally learned how to combine Android 11 best development practices in an Android application.\nI created this course to make the process easier for you! You are going to learn how to combine\nKotlin\nCoroutines\nLive Data\nKotlin Flow\nRetrofit\nHilt\nJetpack Navigation\nMVVM\nAnd complete a real Android application purely on Outside-In Test Driven Development\nYou are going to learn how to write not flaky espresso tests in a real scenario with delays and HTTP calls, without using Thread.sleep(). After all we wouldn't be doing TDD without efficient & effective Espresso UI tests!\nWhy Me?\nEven though I am new to Udemy, I am not new to the industry. I have been working as an Android engineer from junior to lead positions in ambitious startups & large multinational companies for about 8 years. Being a good engineer, though, doesn't automatically mean that you are a good Instructor as well.\nIn the past 5 years I have also discovered my passion for education and worked as a Software Instructor in several colleges and companies, including New York College, Hellenic American Union my current position is a Mobile Trainer in a Multinational company called Backbase, where I am training\nThe internal RnD engineers\nThe internal professional services engineers\nExternal third-party integrators\nIn my lifetime, I have trained thousands of developers in classrooms, web conferences, and video courses.\nWhy is it important?\nAs we advance to more senior engineering levels, we realize that how we do things is equally important to get them done. The industry has started to realize that a serious software engineering company can no longer base its products on purely architectural and engineering practices.\nI often say that there are 3 stages in the advancement of an engineer\nIn the first stage, he/she is a programmer. He is learning how to make things work, e.g., how to add buttons in an Android application and handle its click. But is not aware of the importance of doing things well. He or she cannot realize that a purely structured system is certain to backfire in the long run, and while everything initially seemed to be going well, \"suddenly,\" it is impossible to work with this system anymore. New features are hard to add, and bugs very often slip to production code\nIn the second stage, having realized the past mistakes, the professional starts practicing and learning good engineering patterns. He or she starts exploring things like :\nSOLID Principles\nDesign patterns\nClean architecture\nSeparation of concerns\nLow coupling, High cohesion\nUnit Testing\nand if is passionate and dedicated enough, manages to reach a more senior level, and is able to develop systems that can be successful not only in the short but also in the long run\nThe final stage is the Mastery. This stage is an ongoing process and doesn't ever end. After the engineer has a good understanding of the above practices, he realizes there is a huge room for improvement. He learns how to apply them and, most importantly, when they are not required, and simpler-junior level approaches are more beneficial for the specific project/situation. In other words, it is a constant effort to learn how to never\nUnder-Engineer\nOr Over-Engineer.\nHe or she also comes in touch with more advanced practises like Test Driven Development which takes quite a lot of effort to get a grasp and master it.\nIn this course, I will do my best to advance you on this path. I will offer you what I have learned on my journey, and I am also very open to learning from you. I am always available on the forums to support and discuss topics that you might have a different point of view, and this way, we can help each other on our endless road to Software Mastery.",

Most of the time students skip this book because of less time for preparation.\n20  days of training hardly make you ready for the exam it's your extra effort that helps you to get certified. Our SAP Certified Development  Associate has gone through multiple websites providing practice test questions when they were preparing for exam C_TAW12_750.  While solving questions they found that answers given to questions were wrong and weren't according to the latest SAP Netweaver 7.50. For example,  parameters supported by the Functional Method are returning, importing,  exporting, changing, and exceptions but given answers are returning,  importing, and exceptions. For versions lesser than SAP Netweaver 7.4  correct answers were returning, importing, and exceptions since exporting and changing parameters were not supported, but for SAP Netweaver 7.50  correct answers were returning, importing, exporting, changing, and exceptions. So we decided to create the most reliable practice test according to the latest SAP Netweaver 7.50.\nWe assure you will clear the exam if you go through all the questions in this preparation test.  Join the course and boost your chances of getting certified.

In this training you will learn all important elements in SolarWinds and You will be able to practice it in lab.\nThis is the Best course available in the market that will make you be confident in deploying the tool and monitoring all your infrastructure (Network , Servers , Applications)\nSolarWinds is an IT Operations Management Solution that proactively monitors the network for performance, storage, bandwidth, configuration changes, compliance, and security. It is 100% web based and supports a wide range of vendors and technologies. It's easy-to-use and works out-of-the-box.\nNetwork Performance Monitoring Monitor network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, etc., for health and performance via SNMP and CLI protocols.\nNetwork Traffic Management Monitor and analyze bandwidth using Netflow, sFlow, jFlow, IP FIX and more.

Provides monitoring support for popular applications and their underlying infrastructure components from a single monitoring console\n\n\nHow Can I Monitor My Network?\nThe first step in getting started with your network monitoring is to identify which devices need to be monitored. You’ll also want to decide on what performance metrics you’ll be measuring.\n*** if you have any questions or need help you can contact me over my LinkedIn ***\nHere are some baseline metrics you’ll want to monitor:\nBandwidth usage: You’ll want your network to be sending as much data as it can without being overloaded. Your network monitoring tool can identify how much bandwidth is typically used versus how much is currently being used.\nThroughput: This measures the percentage of data packets that are actually being sent.\nLatency: This is the time it takes between requesting data and receiving that data. Performance issues can be almost too small to recognize, so it’s important to have a monitoring tool in place.\nPacket loss: This is the number of data packets that are lost during data transmissions.\nRetransmission: This is a measure of how often data packets are lost and need to be retransmitted to complete a request for data.\nNetwork availability/Uptime: This lets you know if your network is currently available. Your network monitoring tools can alert you when the network goes down, and how often.\nConnectivity: You’ll want to make sure your network connection is operating at top performance at all times.\n3 Benefits of Network Monitoring\nContinuous monitoring of your network helps you to troubleshoot not just hard failures but slowdowns as well. Metrics such as throughput, latency, packet reordering, and jitters can be used to measure your network's health.\nTroubleshooting issues early ensures business continuity and fewer or no downtimes, including network monitoring benefits like:\n1. Identifying Issues Anywhere in the Network\nNetwork monitoring and assessment is a way to quickly locate a problem in the network. Monitoring your network's performance can show you the cause and source of a network problem, where and when it occurred. It can also tell you who needs to fix it. When you actively monitor your network, you can detect any performance changes that could be problematic to users before they occur.\n2. Better Use of IT Resources with Network Monitoring\nIT teams are feeling more burnt out as a result of the pandemic. With 72% of IT professionals having taken on new responsibilities since the outset of the pandemic, a network outage could be a productivity killer. For example, an under-resourced IT manager would be required to divert attention from one business critical project to another with little notice or preparation.\nThe tools in network monitoring systems reduce manual work for IT teams. This gives back valuable time to an IT team to instead allocate to more critical projects.\n3. Providing Historical and Baseline Data with Network Monitoring\nWith the availability of baseline data, network monitoring tools can continually and automatically compare data. In case of performance degradation, an alert is sent to you, and you can immediately solve the problem. Historical data gives you a comparison point to determine optimal network performance or identify poor performance. It enables you to troubleshoot network problems of past events.\n\n\nPS: Check the Free Preview videos to know more about the course and to be sure you can get accustomed to my accent\n\n\nSolarwinds Orion Training Course includes:\n8 hours of practical and condensed knowledge\nImmediate access to the entire collection of videos and files\nQ&A support\nDownloadable installation Media\n✅ Valuable links and resources\nFAQ:\nQ: Can I download Solarwinds training files?\nYes.

I regrouped and bought Dave's study material, including the practice exams. I learned so much more material that wasn't covered on Lynda through Dave's videos. I took the exam three weeks after studying Dave's tutorials and passed the exam with a 795.\nFrom Christie\nDave,\nThanks for the great course. I easily passed the Excel Expert exam a couple weeks ago thanks to the materials covered in your course. The lectures were easy to understand and all of the content from your course very relevant in preparing for the exam.\nCheers.\nChristie\nFrom Aicha\nI just passed the test today with 769. Just can't be happier. The course is really well structured and helpful especially the exercises at the end of each objective. Thanks Dave , You did a great Job.\nFrom Branislav\nVery specific and targeted topics. I believe it a must for all who attempt the exam.\nFrom Taylor\nI can't post it here but I will show my badge earned in the Facebook group. I've been studying for roughly a month, with basic data entry experience, and a BCIS course I took in highschool. Needless to say I wasn't very well versed in excel to begin with, and now I'm an Excel Expert. I'm always skeptical about what I buy and strive to recommend as little as possible to friends and family through fear of worth. But this course here is incredible and I can't thank Dave enough for the time and effort he put into it. I'm a bit of a talker to, and Dave was able to get back to me with answers regarding questions I had about the Exam in a very timely manner. Regards, Taylor",

Thousands of organizations, from all sizes and shapes, are moving to the cloud, and being able to work with it is one of the most important skills for every developer, architect, or IT admin.\nAnd being a certified Azure Solutions Architect is a great way to let the world know you're an expert in Azure.\nAnd this course does just that.\nIf you'll take this course, you'll be prepared to be a Certified Azure Architect, the most prestigious Azure certification.\nThis course is a bundle of 4 best seller courses, which together teach you everything you need in order to become an Azure expert and a certified Azure Solutions Architect.\nThe bundle contains the following topics:\n- Microsoft Azure From Zero to Hero\n- Building Microservices in Azure using Azure Container Apps\n- Azure Case Studies\n- Preparing for The Exams\nWe start from the very basics - what is the cloud and what it's good for - and go to the most advanced concepts such as Azure Policy, Cost management, and lots more.\nHere is a partial list of what we'll talk about in this course:\n- What is the cloud\n- Azure vs other clouds\n- The Azure portal\n- Azure Compute - Virtual Machines, App Services, AKS, Azure Functions and more\n- Azure Networking - VNets, Subnets, NSG, Application Gateway and more\n- Data in Azure - Azure SQL, CosmosDB, Azure MySQL, Storage Account and more\n- Messaging in Azure - Event Grid, Queues, Service Bus, Event Hubs\n- Azure Active Directory (also known as Azure AD)\n- Logging and Monitoring in Azure\n- Securing systems in Azure\n- Cost Management\n- Disaster Recovery (DR)\n- Container Apps\nAnd lots and lots more...\nNow, to make sure that this course is the best Azure course out there, I've decided to make it a little bit different.\nInstead of going through the various features of Azure, talking about each one and perhaps even doing a demo - this course takes a different approach.\nWe're going to build, together, a full blown modern cloud system on Azure.\nTogether, we're going to build the readit website, a fictional bookstore that's built in Azure.\nWe're going to begin with the very basics - take a code and put it on a virtual machine in the cloud.\nAnd then we're going to add more compute elements, add networking, databases, messaging, monitoring, security, and even DR! (Take a look at the video preview - you can see there the architecture diagram of the system at the beginning, and how it looks like when we're done with it. Worth watching...)\nAnd when we're done - you'll be able to say that you've built a complete system in Azure!\nThis is something you can show future employers and clients, and explain them how the system is designed, and what are the reasons it's built like this.\nNow, don't worry about the code. Everything it going to be provided to you.\nThe system is built using .NET Core and nodeJS, but you don't have to be familiar with these languages, you just better have some development knowledge.\nThere is no other course like this!\nThis is the only Azure course that takes you step-by-step towards a complete, full blown system in the cloud. At the end of it - you'll be able to pass the certification exams and become a Certified Azure Solutions Architect.\n\n\nBut that's not all...\nPassing the exams is not easy, and you have to be prepared for that. And to help you with doing that, this bundle contains a whole section dedicated to the preparations for the exams.\nWe'll learn how the exams look, what are their question types, how long are the exams, how to prepare your room, how to register to the exams and more.\nAnd right after that you'll find TWO practice tests, simulating the real world exams, with original questions that cover the same topics covered in the exams. If you'll pass these practice tests successfully - you'll be in a great position to pass the real exams and become a Certified Azure Solutions Architect.\n\n\nThis course takes you from the absolute basics of Azure to the most advanced topics, known only to few. Completing this course will give you all the knowledge required for designing modern, robust, secure and reliable cloud systems, and also prepare you for the certification.\nNo other course covers this topic in such a comprehensive and thorough way. I've put all my 20+ years of experience with hundreds of clients in this course, and I'm sure you will greatly benefit from it.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWhat do my students have to say about my Azure courses?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\"This is the best Azure course I have encountered on Udemy or anywhere.

      "description": "Welcome to course Professional Diploma in Software Testing & Quality Assurance by MTF Institute\n\n\nCourse provided by MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\nMTF is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business & professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business & Administration, Science & Technology, Banking & Finance.\nMTF R&D center focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things.\nMTF is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nMTF is present in 208 countries and has been chosen by more than 380,000 students.\n\n\nCourse Author:\nHi! My name is Liza.\nI have for 5+ years of experience on QA, It-companies using closed and open source product.\nPromoted from Junior tester to Chief of QA.\nI tested many systems: Web-app, API (MQ and Kafka), Backend. Now I work with Big Data.\n\n\nFor the past five years, I've immersed myself in the nuanced field of software testing. My journey has spanned an array of testing disciplines, from the precision of functional and non-functional testing to the dynamic worlds of web and mobile applications, as well as the complexities of system integration and Big Data testing.\nAs I navigated through these varied territories, I came to understand that the cornerstone of effective testing lies in a solid grasp of its fundamental theories. Mastery of these principles empowers a tester to execute their tasks with both efficiency and finesse.\nIn recent times, the market has been flooded with an array of quick-fix testing courses. Far from feeling threatened by the influx of novices these courses produce, I find myself scrolling past their ads, unimpressed and slightly disenchanted.\nThis led me to a realization: I yearn to offer something different. I aim to craft a course that stands out for being accurate, transparent, and genuinely beneficial. It's not about merely \"passing the exam\" but \"preparing for the exam\" in a way that respects the ever-evolving nature of technology, while still anchored in the timeless principles of testing theory. This is the essence of ISTQB, the international testing certification that offers a comprehensive exploration into the testing domain, laying a robust foundation for a professional career.\nThe course I've developed aligns perfectly with the official ISTQB glossary, presenting a fresh and effective approach to mastering testing fundamentals. We'll delve deeply into every critical aspect of testing, from the basic concepts and principles to the more intricate techniques and methods. More than just theoretical knowledge, this course is designed to equip you with practical skills that can be immediately applied to your professional life, enriching your work and enhancing your contributions to the field of software testing.\n\n\nSoftware Testing & Quality Assurance (QA)\nThese two concepts are deeply intertwined, working together to ensure software products meet the highest standards.\n\n\nSoftware Testing: The process of meticulously evaluating a software product to uncover defects or errors. It's like a rigorous inspection where testers put the software through its paces to see if it behaves as expected, finding any potential issues before they cause problems for users.\nQuality Assurance (QA): A broader, proactive approach aimed at preventing defects from occurring in the first place. QA focuses on establishing processes and standards across the entire software development lifecycle to ensure that the end product meets a predefined level of quality.\n\n\nMain Focus Areas\n\n\nSoftware Testing:\nFunctionality: Does the software do what it's supposed to?\nPerformance: How fast and efficiently does it work?\nUsability: Is it easy to learn and use?\nCompatibility: Does it work across different devices, browsers, and operating systems?\nSecurity: Is it protected from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks?\n\n\nQuality Assurance:\nQuality planning: Defining the quality standards for a project.\nProcess Definition: Outlining the steps for development, testing, and release to ensure quality is baked-in from the start.\nAudits: Regularly reviewing processes and outcomes to ensure quality standards are being met.\n\n\nWhy Are Software Testing & QA Important?\nCost Reduction: Finding problems early is far cheaper than fixing them after release.\nCustomer Satisfaction: High-quality software leads to happy, loyal users.\nReputation: A reputation for reliable, well-tested products improves brand image and competitiveness.\nRisk Mitigation: Thorough testing and QA minimizes the risk of costly failures or security breaches.\n\n\nImportance for Companies and IT Experts\nCompanies: Investing in testing and QA demonstrates a commitment to quality, resulting in increased customer trust, better products, and competitive advantage.\nIT Experts: Strong testing and QA skills make IT professionals more valuable and in-demand.\n\n\nCareer Development in Software Testing & QA\nA career in this field offers numerous benefits and opportunities:\nGrowth Potential: The demand for quality software means these roles are plentiful and in high need.\nDiverse Paths: Specialize in areas like automation testing, performance testing, security testing, etc.\nTransferable Skills: Problem-solving, detail-orientation, and communication skills translate well to other IT domains.\nGood Compensation: Skilled QA and testing professionals are well-compensated.\n\n\nHow to Get Started\nLearn the Fundamentals: Study testing methodologies, types of testing and QA concepts.\nGain Practical Skills: Get hands-on with testing tools (e.g., Selenium). Practice on real-world projects or contribute to open-source initiatives.",

      "description": "Becoming Java certified is a great way to help improve your career options with more job opportunities and more pay.\nThat's because Oracle's Java certification program, unlike many other certifications out there, has real value in the industry.  One of the main reasons is that it's an official Oracle certification, but second, the exam is quite difficult to pass.\nEmployers see programmers who are Java certified as more valuable than programmers who are not certified.   So it's totally worth getting Java certified to take advantage of this.\nThis course has been designed to pass on the exact knowledge you need to pass Oracle's 1Z0-819 exam.\nSo what exam does this course cover?\nThis course focuses on the Java SE 11, 1Z0-819 exam, from Oracle.  It's Part 2 of a 2-course series. It's highly recommended that you complete Part 1 of my 1Z0-819 exam course first, before completing this one.\nOracle helpfully publishes the complete list of topics that questions in the exam come from.  I've taken extreme care to ensure that a full 100% of the material you need to know, in order to pass the exam is covered in either this course or Part 1.\nI won't waste your time on any Java features that are not going to come up as a question on the exam.\nWhy Get Certified in Java 11, aren't there newer versions available?\nJava 11 is designated as the LTS or Long Term Support version of Java - it's going to be supported by Oracle and JDK vendors until at least 2026, unlike Java 9, Java 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, etc all of which are no longer supported by Oracle.\nLarge companies have large codebases, and it takes them a long time to upgrade that code to new versions of Java - for years Java 8 was the main version used by companies, and with the release of Java 11, and Oracle's commitment to supporting it for many years as well as them designating it as the long term support version, this means that the majority of the industry will be moving, or already have moved to Java 11.  Particularly now that Java 8 support is ending soon.\nOracle does not have a certification program for Java 9, 10, 12, or Java 13, etc.  This is by design. Because Java 11 is Oracle's long term supported version of Java.  For this reason, Java 11 is the version of Java you need to become certified in. And this course will help you achieve that.\nWhat's the difference between this course and your Part 1 1Z0-819 exam course?\nFirstly, the courses have completely different content, there is pretty much no overlap of content in the two courses.  Think of Part 1 as the \"Core Java\" concepts, and this course, the \"Part 2\" as the \"Advanced\" content.  Both courses are targeted for the 1Z0-819 exam and help you to pass it.\nWhy are there two courses for the 1Z0-819 exam?\nIn October 2020, Oracle decided to move from their old exams, the 1Z0-815 and 1Z0-816 to a single exam, the 1Z0-819.\nThe thing is, the 1Z0-819 exam, still targets the exact same topics that were in the old 1Z0-815 and 1Z0-816 exams, minus a few topics that have removed.\nPreviously you needed to pass both exams to get Java certified.  Now, you only need to pass the 1Z0-819 exam.  So that's a bonus for you.\nMy \"Part 1\" course originally targeted the 1Z0-815 exam, and this course was originally going to target the 1Z0-816 exam.  What I've done now is updated and renamed both courses, and ensured they are both targeting the material you need to pass the new 1Z0-819.\nHopefully, that makes sense as to why you need to take two courses.\nDo I really need to take a \"Java exam course\" to pass the exam?\nBeing completely upfront, it is possible to pass the exam without studying a specific exam course like this one.  But it's not easy.  Keep in mind that the exam does not just test your knowledge of Java, but actively tries to trip you up by asking questions that sometimes use obscure, rarely used syntax that you may never have come across before.   The sorts of things that most Java courses or textbooks will never teach you.\nThis course shows you all the standard Java stuff you need to know, as well as this more obscure stuff to ensure you really are ready to pass the exam.\nWho is this course suitable for?\nIf you have been through at least some of my Java Masterclass on Udemy, or another Java course and/or have some professional programming experience in Java or another programming language then this course is for you.    But note, that it's a prerequisite that you have taken my 1Z0-819 Part 1 course on Udemy before attempting this one.\nThis course is definitely NOT for beginner programmers.  If you are a beginner, you will struggle with this course.  In that case, grab my Java Masterclass and go through all or a significant amount of that course, and then my 1Z0-819 Part 1 course, before attempting this course.\nYou don't teach Java in this course?\nThat's right, I don't teach you Java as such.  The course assumes you know Java, and are looking for the knowledge to pass the exam.  It's a subtle but important distinction.\nAnd remember, the course only focuses on topics that may come up as a question in the 1Z0-819 exam.\nYes, you will learn a ton of new things by going through this course.  But I do assume you know Java, and won't waste your time by having you watch me type in code.\nRather, I paste in a code snippet, explain its purpose, and execute it.  This is the best way to pass on the required knowledge to me.  As an aside, the\nIt's designed to give you the exact information and skills you need to pass Oracle's Java 11 1Z0-819 exam.\nIf you already have Java 7 or Java 8 certification and want to upgrade your skills to Java 11, this is for you.\nThe great thing about the course is that it's relatively short (at least compared to my almost 80 hour Java Masterclass), so it's great if you need to cram before taking the exam.\nWhat this course is not.\nThis course is not a  \"rebadged\" Java 8 Certification course - the 1Z0-819, Java 11 certification is a lot different from the 1Z0-808 (Java 8) exam (for starters it covers many features not included in Java 8, a few of which are listed above).\nIf you only have Java 8 experience it's going to be pretty hard for you to pass the Java 11 exam.  You need to be up to speed with Java 11 features (as well as the older stuff) and that's what you will learn in this course.\nI created this course, from scratch, in Java 11 to give you the tools you need to pass Oracle's 1Z0-819 exam (formally the 1Z0-815 and 1Z0-816 exams).\nWho Am I?\nMy name is Tim Buchalka, a professional software developer with close to 40 years of experience, starting out with Java way back in the 1990s.  I am the creator of the biggest and most comprehensive Java course on Udemy, the Java Masterclass which has been a best seller for many years and has close to 500,000 students and literally tens of thousands of glowing reviews.\nI'd like to think I know a thing or two about Java!\nYou can be assured that the quality of the course is second to none and that the information contained in it will help you pass the 1Z0-819 exam.\nReady to get started?\nClick on the enroll button and get started on your road to Java certification, better job opportunities, and more pay!",

The questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam questions does.\n* Updated for the 2024 CISSP curriculum *\n\n\nWhat our other students are saying about our \"CISSP practice questions #4\" Course:\nI passed the CISSP with the ISC Book and Thor's lectures and practice questions. Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of each test, you will get an explanation for each question, explaining why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions per test (40 total)\nAsset Security – 13 questions per test (26 total)\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions per test (30 total)\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions per test (30 total)\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions per test (32 total)\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions per test (28 total)\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions per test (40 total)\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions per test (24 total)\n\n\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it, this is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right, and answering from an IT Security managers point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nMany students do 3,000 – 5,000 CISSP certification practice questions, when I did my CISSP certification I was around the 3,500 mark.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.  I would suggest 80%+ of right answers consistently on all CISSP domains using multiple practice tests before booking the exam.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nThis course includes ALL of these:\n2 full 125 easy/mid CISSP practice tests.\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days, no questions asked, money back guarantee.\nBonus materials: 10 bonus questions.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

      "description": "Preparing for AWS Certified Advanced Networking Specialty ANS-C01? This is THE practice exam course to give you the winning edge.\nThese practice exams have been co-authored by Stephane Maarek and Abhishek Singh who bring their collective experience of passing 20 AWS Certifications to the table.\nThe tone and tenor of the questions mimic the real exam. Along with the detailed description and “exam alert” provided within the explanations, we have also extensively referenced AWS documentation to get you up to speed on all domain areas being tested for the ANS-C01 exam.\n\n\nWe want you to think of this course as the final pit-stop so that you can cross the winning line with absolute confidence and get AWS Certified! Trust our process, you are in good hands.\nAll questions have been written from scratch! And more questions are being added over time!\n\n\n=======\nQuality speaks for itself...\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nAn e-commerce company has its technology infrastructure deployed in hybrid mode with applications running in a single AWS Region as well as its on-premises data center. The company has a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection from the data center to AWS that is 70% utilized. The company wants to deploy a new flagship application on AWS that will connect with existing applications running on-premises. The application SLA requires a minimum of 99.9% network uptime between the on-premises data center and the AWS Cloud. The company has an AWS Enterprise Support plan.\n\n\nWhich of the following options would you recommend as the MOST cost-effective solution to address this requirement?\nPurchase another 10 Gbps Direct Connect hosted connection through an AWS Direct Connect partner in a different Direct Connect location that terminates in the associated AWS Region. Set up a new virtual interface (VIF) to the existing VPC and use BGP for load balancing\nPurchase another 10 Gbps Direct Connect dedicated connection from AWS in the existing Direct Connect location that terminates in the associated AWS Region. Set up a new virtual interface (VIF) to the existing VPC and use BGP for load balancing\nPurchase two new Direct Connect hosted connections of 5 Gbps each through an AWS Direct Connect partner. Provision two virtual interfaces (VIFs) to the existing VPC on both Direct Connect connections and use BGP for load balancing. Terminate the existing 10 Gbps Direct Connect connection\nPurchase another 10 Gbps Direct Connect dedicated connection from AWS in a different Direct Connect location that terminates in the associated AWS Region. Set up a new virtual interface (VIF) to the existing VPC and use BGP for load balancing\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 4.\nCorrect option:\n\n\n**Purchase another 10 Gbps Direct Connect dedicated connection from AWS in a different Direct Connect location that terminates in the associated AWS Region. Set up a new virtual interface (VIF) to the existing VPC and use BGP for load balancing**\n\n\nAWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you create a private connection between AWS and your data center. AWS Direct Connect is compatible with all AWS services accessible over the internet, and is available in speeds starting at 50 Mbps and scaling up to 100 Gbps.\n\n\nThere are two types of Direct Connect connections:\n\n\nDedicated Connection: A physical Ethernet connection associated with a single customer. Customers can request a dedicated connection through the AWS Direct Connect console, the CLI, or the API.\n\n\nHosted Connection: A physical Ethernet connection that an AWS Direct Connect Partner provisions on behalf of a customer. Customers request a hosted connection by contacting a partner in the AWS Direct Connect Partner Program, which provisions the connection.\n\n\nYou can use local preference BGP community tags to achieve load balancing and route preference for incoming traffic to your network. For each prefix that you advertise over a BGP session, you can apply a community tag to indicate the priority of the associated path for returning traffic.\n\n\nThe following local preference BGP community tags are supported:\n7224:7100—Low preference\n7224:7200—Medium preference\n7224:7300—High preference\nLocal preference BGP community tags are mutually exclusive.\n\n\nA Virtual Interface (VIF) is necessary to access AWS services, and can be either public, private or transit, like so:\n\n\nPrivate virtual interface: A private virtual interface should be used to access an Amazon VPC using private IP addresses.\n\n\nPublic virtual interface: A public virtual interface can access all AWS public services using public IP addresses. A public virtual interface enables access to public services, such as Amazon S3.\n\n\nTransit virtual interface: A transit virtual interface should be used to access one or more Amazon VPC Transit Gateways associated with Direct Connect gateways. You can use transit virtual interfaces with 1/2/5/10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connections.\n\n\nExam alert - You should note the allowed VIF types for the various configurations of Direct Connect connections:\n\n\nA Hosted Connection with a capacity of 500 Mbps or less can support one private VIF or one public VIF. A Hosted Connection with a capacity of 1 Gbps or more can support one private, public, or transit VIF. Each Hosted Connection supports a single VIF and you can obtain multiple VIFs by configuring multiple hosted connections.\n\n\nHosted VIFs can connect to public resources or an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) in the same way as standard VIFs. However, the account that owns the VIF is different from the connection owner. Bandwidth is shared across all VIFs on the parent connection. A hosted VIF can support one private VIF or one public VIF.\n\n\nA Dedicated Connection can support up to 50 public/private VIFs and 1 transit VIF.\n\n\n“Uptime Target” means a percentage of Maximum Uptime in a monthly billing cycle applicable to your Included Resource, based upon meeting the Minimum Configuration Requirements. To ensure an uptime target of 99.9% as mandated in the given use case, the included resources should use virtual interfaces on Dedicated Connections at a minimum of 2 Direct Connect locations, and at least one of those Direct Connect locations uses the Associated AWS Region in which your workload is located.\n\n\nIncorrect options:\n**Purchase another 10 Gbps Direct Connect hosted connection through an AWS Direct Connect partner in a different Direct Connect location that terminates in the associated AWS Region. Set up a new virtual interface (VIF) to the existing VPC and use BGP for load balancing**\n\n\n**Purchase two new Direct Connect hosted connections of 5 Gbps each through an AWS Direct Connect partner. Provision two virtual interfaces (VIFs) to the existing VPC on both Direct Connect connections and use BGP for load balancing. Terminate the existing 10 Gbps Direct Connect connection**\n\n\nAs mentioned in the explanation above, to guarantee an SLA of 99.9%, you must use dedicated Direct Connect connections and NOT hosted connections. So both these options are incorrect.\n\n\n**Purchase another 10 Gbps Direct Connect dedicated connection from AWS in the existing Direct Connect location that terminates in the associated AWS Region. Set up a new virtual interface (VIF) to the existing VPC and use BGP for load balancing** - To guarantee an SLA of 99.9%, you must use dedicated Direct Connect connections at a minimum of 2 Direct Connect locations rather than a single Direct Connect location. So this option is incorrect.\n\n\nReferences:\n< reference links included >\n=======\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

Of course, the course covers the current LPI exam version 5.0. Should LPI ever release version 5.5 or 6.0, this course will be adapted promptly. Promised!\n\n\nIn order to be able to take this course and accordingly to receive the perfect exam preparation, you do NOT need to have previous knowledge of Linux. Of course, it will be easier for you if you already have experience with Linux, but even if you have never dealt with Linux before, the course will pick you up at the very beginning.\n\n\nFirst we create the prerequisites to be able to install different Linux distributions and of course we also install two Linux systems, namely Ubuntu Linux and Fedora Linux.\n\n\nBefore we begin with the topics that are relevant for the exam, you will receive an introduction to the Linux console, so that it will be much easier for you to get started with the topics that LPI provides.\n\n\nIn this course I will demonstrate every command that is mentioned in the exam catalog so that you can see with your own eyes what it does, how it works and of course that you can do everything on your own computer.\nIf you carry out the corresponding commands yourself and not just read in a book or watch me carry out the commands, you will be able to learn much better, more intensively and faster.\nTo make things even easier for you, I have created four vocabulary books for you with commands and their meanings and with paths and files and their meanings. This will make learning even easier for you.\n\n\nTo be VERY safe, you simply work through the workbooks, which give you almost 60 practical tasks that you have to carry out. This should consolidate your knowledge even further and the exams will be child's play for you.\n\n\nAt the end of each major topic, you can go through a small quiz with 180 multiple choice questions like those asked in the exams.\n\n\nAs you can see, with this course you really have everything you need to pass the two exams and soon be able to call yourself Linux administrator.\n\n\nI am looking forward to see you in the class right away.",

All these keep information in databases and most databases are housed in the AWS Cloud.\n\n\nAlthough this course is designed with Database Administrators (DBAs) in mind, it is helpful for anyone who deals with any aspect of databases in AWS. This exam covers everything from the AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) to NoSQL databases (DynamoDB) to the AWS Database Migration Tool.

By the end of the course you will be taught each concept and also tested as there are quizzes after each section and a practice test modeled after the real exam. Applying the concepts in a case study will really hammer home the concepts… It’s much easier to remember something you’ve done than something you’ve just passively watched someone else do!\n\n\nUse Tableau to Analyze and Visualize Sales Data To Develop Actionable Insights\n\n\nVisualizing current and historical sales data can result in huge insights that aren’t\nreadily apparent in the day to day grind. The right visualizations help quickly identify trends and\noutliers (positive or negative), which help to adjust course for more profitable sales & marketing\nas well as a more efficient and informed supply chain.\n\n\nContents and Overview\n\n\nThroughout this course we will work through a sample consulting engagement where the client wants us to conduct a data discovery on their sales data. They need help planning for the upcoming year both in their marketing department and also their supply chain. We will use their raw sales data to come up with insights for both teams.\n\n\nThis project will focus our approach to Tableau forcing us to learn the basics while solving a real world business problem. My hope is that you’ll feel like you’re learning a new problem solving tool not just a series of functions in a software interface. The course structure is modeled after the Tableau Certification Exam Guide and broken down into the following sections:\n\n\nIntroduction\nConnecting To & Preparing Data\nExploring & Analyzing Data\nUnderstanding Tableau Concepts\nConclusion",

They are based on our own exam experience and intense research on the most important topics and the most helpful resources to help you pass the exam.\nACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD - with inputs from the instructors and exam feedback from our students, our Q&A board gives you the opportunity to know which topics recently appeared on the exam and better understand the AWS services and concepts covered in the test.\nVERY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTORS - our friendly team of AWS experts is able to address all your issues and questions within 3-5 business days.\nCONTAINS A TEST REPORT - to track your progress and show you which Knowledge Areas you need improvement.\nMOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\nCLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has a reference link that can validate the answer but you can also post to the QA section so we can discuss any issues.\nPrepared by AWS Certified Database professionals who actually passed the AWS Machine Learning Specialty exam! (Please see our LinkedIn profile to view our AWS Certificates)\nSome people are using brain dumps for the AWS MLS-C01 exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge, but these can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.\nPlease also note that these AWS practice tests are not exam dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the AWS certification exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty practice tests are meant to do.\nThese AWS Machine Learning Specialty practice exams are designed to focus on important exam domains such as Modeling and Exploratory Data Analysis, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic was carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official AWS MLS exam guide.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your Machine Learning Specialty exam. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty practice exams have a passing score of 75% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 85% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these Machine Learning practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment on which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!",

The exam tests your knowledge and skills related to network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security fundamentals, and automation and programmability. Once you earn your CCNA, you can use it to get a job in the information technology (IT) or networking fields. For example, you could work as a Cloud Engineer, Network Administrator, Systems Administrator, or IT Manager. You can also take additional specialized exams to land a more specialized role. If you complete the CCNA Routing and Switching Certification, for example, you are eligible for positions like a Network Analyst or Network Engineer.\n\n\nHow can I pass the CCNA with self study?\nMany people pass the CCNA exam through self-study using the latest learning materials supplemented with practical instruction. The exam covers a broad range of basic and modern networking concepts along with real-world Cisco network configuration scenarios. It's important to both understand the concepts and practice applying them. Simulated configuration exercises, practice labs, and sample test questions are especially helpful in preparing for the CCNA exam. Udemy courses can help you master the networking concepts and skills needed. You can also gain hands-on Cisco CCNA configuration and troubleshooting experience through practice labs.\n\n\nWhat are the topics covered in the Cisco CCNA exam?\nThe CCNA exam tests your knowledge and skills in networking fundamentals such as routing and switching, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security basics, and automation and programmability. Among the topics covered are how to build simple LANs, how to use a patch panel, troubleshooting routers and switches, IP addressing and subnetting, IPv6 routing, address allocation using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), access control lists (ACLs), basic WAN technologies such as VPN and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), external authentication methods, quality of service (QoS), IP services such as Network Address Translation (NAT). For many years, the CCNA certification involved multiple exams for individual tracks like CCNA Voice and CCNA Data Center. In 2020, Cisco combined all the tracks into one comprehensive CCNA exam based on the latest networking technologies, software development skills, and IT job roles, including network administrator and network engineer.\n\n\nWhat are the recommended prerequisites for the CCNA exam?\nAlthough there are no formal prerequisites for CCNA certification, most professionals in the field would recommend a thorough understanding of the CCNA topics before taking the exam. A lot of CCNA candidates have one or more years of experience implementing Cisco solutions along with a grasp of basic IP addressing and network concepts.\n\n\nIs CCNA required for a CCNP?\nNo, the CCNA is no longer required before you can attain a CCNP or higher-level Cisco certification. However, you need a certain level of competency and knowledge that builds upon skills attained at the CCNA level before you should attempt the CCNP certification. To achieve any of the Cisco professional-level certifications, you must pass two exams. You can earn a CCNP certification in one or more of the following specialties: enterprise (including routing, switching, and wireless networking), collaboration, security, data center, and service provider. Cisco also offers professional-level certifications in Cisco Certified DevNet Professional, which proves your skills in developing and maintaining applications built on Cisco networks, and Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional, which proves your skills in incident response, cloud security, and other active defense security roles.\n\n\nWhat are the other Cisco certificaitions and what do they cover?\nCisco has associate (CCNA), professional (CCNP), and expert (CCIE) certifications. These include the CCNA, Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate (entry security analyst skills), and Cisco Certified DevNet Associate (developing apps on Cisco platforms). CCNP certifications in enterprise (routing, switching, and wireless), collaboration (Cisco apps and services), data center (Cisco infrastructure), security (Cisco security solutions), and service provider (implementing and operating Cisco solutions), along with Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional and Cisco Certified DevNet Professional; CCIE certifications in enterprise infrastructure (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), enterprise wireless (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), data center (building and operating Cisco data center solutions), security (implementing Cisco security solutions), service provider (implementing Cisco service provider solutions); and design expert to prepare you for designing large networks.\n\n\nWhat should I learn before Cisco CCNA?\nBefore the Cisco Certified Network Associate examination, you should know basic networking, security, automation, programming, and IP addressing. The CCNA examination intends to certify that you know to perform basic Network Associate tasks. These include managing, monitoring, and maintaining an organization's network infrastructure. A CCNA will not need to architect, design, or develop an advanced network, but they will need to understand it, modify it, and configure it. CCNAs generally have some entry-level, hands-on experience in information technology. Many CCNAs will have an Associate's or Bachelors in an IT-related field. Alternatively, those seeking Cisco certification can take Udemy courses to learn the basics of networking and information technology.\n\n\nHow do I know if CCNA is right for me?\nA CCNA is generally ideal for those who are pursuing a career in networking or security. Cisco certifications are particularly prized for their rigor and valued by employers across the globe. Entry-level IT professionals who want to expand their career and improve their marketability (or their paygrade) may want to get a Network Associate certification to show their dedication to the field. Alternatively, those who seek to learn more about networking or discover whether networking might be the best path for them may consider taking Cisco certification courses. While alternative certification paths (such as CompTIA's Network+) exist, Cisco generally represents the gold standard in networking and security. Further, Cisco's entry-level certifications lead down a more advanced certification path.\n\n\nWhy do you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: Quality of teaching.\nWhether you just want to take the exam to measure your network knowledge, specialize in networking, are a university student and want to improve yourself, or want to learn as a requirement of your profession.

This course really provides you a perfect kit for the OCA Exam. The explanations are really good. What I really liked was that the instructor is explaining everything in detail so that you will understand what is happening also in the backround. There were also provided tricky examples which you may also see in the exam. No doubt, you can also ask questions and the instructor will revert to you with an explanaition. I recommend this course to anyone who wants to pass the OCA Exam and wants to have a solid base in the java language.\" [Sebastien C]\n\"This is an excellent course covering Java 8 and dipping into Java 11. I did not start as a complete beginner, I have taken several Java courses in college and use Java as an intern on a regular basis. I took this course to reinforce my Java knowledge and increase my ability to quickly read Java programs. It did not disappoint. I have purchased all of Dr. Kennedy's other Udemy courses and currently am waiting for a copy of his book to arrive in the mail. If you are new to Java, need a refresher, or just want to get better at the basics, I highly recommend this course.\" [William M]\n\n\nOverview:\nThis course is a systematic approach to Java Fundamentals and the Oracle Java 8 1Z0-808 (OCA) Certification exam. All of the topics on the syllabus on Oracles website are covered. This course helps you master all the the critical fundamental concepts in Java. It is ideal for students learning Java for the first time (as a lecturer I can certainly appreciate this); professionals wishing to upskill and especially those targeting Java certification.\n\n\nTopics include:\nJava Basics\nWorking with Java Data Types\nControlling Program Flow\nWorking with Methods and Encapsulation\nJava Object Oriented Approach\nException Handling\nArrays\nWorking with Selected classes from the Java API\n2 x OCA Certification Tests - mimics the actual Oracle OCA exam in that each of them have 56 MCQ's. You have 2 hours to complete the test and need 65% to pass (ref: Oracle, April 2024).\n15 x OCA Practice Quizzes\nThe course now has a total of 248 MCQ's overall; each of which is explained with a video solution (where whiteboards and diagrams are used extensively). These MCQ's will help you understand Java at a deeper level and prepare you for the Java 8 OCA (1Z0-808) exam.\nAssignments are included to reinforce the theory\n\n\nAs well as using an IDE to explain concepts, I use a whiteboard wherever I can. I find it an excellent learning tool; particularly around the topics of:\nObjects versus references\nCall-by-Value and it's implications when passing primitives versus references\nString and wrapper-class immutability\nArrays\nInheritance - upcasting, downcasting, ClassCastExceptions (why they occur)\nGarbage collection\n\n\nMy background:\nI am a lecturer since 2002 and I have taught the OCA (and OCP) syllabus since 2013 on behalf of a highly regarded software company. On completion of my training, graduates then face the company's own internal Java Certification exam (similar in style to Oracle's). I have no visibility into the questions they will face. It is a 3 hour long intensive exam. The company are delighted with the pass rate (100% since year 1).\nI love teaching and this course has all my experience in explaining the critical fundamental concepts of Java. In addition, I have a strong attention to detail which lends itself perfectly to the Oracle Java Certification exams.\nNote: This course started out as a Java 11 course (1Z0-819) and as a result many of the multiple choice questions are from the Enthuware Java 11 question bank. However, I have removed the Java 11 specific questions and left only questions relating to Java 8 OCA. I have not removed some questions which trivially use the \"var\" keyword (introduced in Java 10) - I have included a comment on these lines to explain the Java 8 equivalent, so that you can answer the question.",

Employees can use their devices from different locations these days. Moreover, the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) approach is increasing the usage of mobile applications. Changing scenarios and distributed IT environments have made organizations susceptible to cyber threats, thereby fueling the demand for IAM solutions.\nAbout ForgeRock:\nForgeRock is a multinational identity and access management software company headquartered in San Francisco, U.S.A. The company develops commercial open source identity and access management products for internet of things, customer, cloud, mobile, and enterprise environments. Fran Rosch is the CEO of ForgeRock. ForgeRock also has offices in Bristol, London, Grenoble, Vancouver (USA), Oslo, Munich, Paris, Sydney, and Singapore. ForgeRock has raised $140 million in venture funding from Accel Partners, Foundation Capital, Meritech Capital Partners, and KKR.\nWhen Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle in January 2010, Sun’s open source identity and access management software was scheduled for phase out in favor of Oracle’s in-house product. ForgeRock was founded in Norway by a group of ex-Sun employees in February 2010 to fork the code and continue to develop Sun’s software.\nForgeRock provides digital identity management through its primary product, the ForgeRock Identity Platform. The ForgeRock Identity Platform includes\nAccess Management (based on the OpenAM open source project),\nIdentity Management (based on the OpenIDM open source project),\nDirectory Services (based on the OpenDJ open source project), and\nIdentity Gateway (based on the OpenIG open source project).\n\n\n\n\nAbout OpenIDM 6.5.3[latest]\n•OpenIDM is an identity management system written in the Java programming language.\n•The old OpenIDM source code is available under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL). OpenIDM is designed with flexibility in mind, leverages JavaScript as default scripting language to define business rules during provisioning.\n•All capabilities of OpenIDM exposes RESTful interfaces. As an integration layer, OpenIDM leverages the Identity Connectors (adopted by ForgeRock as OpenICF) and has a set of default connectors.\nForgeRock launched the OpenIDM project in October 27, 2010 at GOSCON in Portland following a 6-month internal development process.\n\n\nOpenAM\n•OpenAM is an open-source access management, entitlements and federation server platform.\n•It was sponsored by ForgeRock until 2016. Now it is supported by Open Identity Platform Community.\n•OpenAM originated as OpenSSO, an access management system created by Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle Corporation.\n\n\nOpenDJ\n•OpenDJ is an LDAPv3-compliant directory service, developed for the Java platform, providing a high-performance, highly available, and secure store for the identities managed by your organization.\n•Its easy installation process, combined with the power of the Java platform, makes OpenDJ the simplest and fastest directory to deploy and manage. OpenDJ directory server comes with plenty of tools and also offers REST access to directory data over HTTP.\n•OpenDJ is free to download, evaluate, and use for developing your applications and solutions. You can obtain and modify the source code to build your own version.",

I would recommend this to anyone who wants to not just pass the terraform exam, but also actually understand it. You can't \"fake it\" with this type of work and so if you only want to cram to pass the exam, you'll show up to do the work and struggle... and people will see through you. Take this course, apply yourself, and you will succeed beyond just obtaining the cert. I have taken the other terraform course and it isn't nearly as good. This terraform course is a win. The value provided is well above the $35 cost. Job well done and thank you for your work here.\n\n\nThe Terraform Associate certification is for Cloud Engineers specializing in operations, IT, or development who know the basic concepts and skills associated with open source HashiCorp Terraform. Candidates will be best prepared for this exam if they have professional experience using Terraform in production, but performing the exam objectives in a personal demo environment may also be sufficient. This person understands which enterprise features exist and what can and cannot be done using the open source offering.\nWhy become Terraform Certified ?\nWith the rise of cloud native applications and DevOps, it is essential to learn and understand infrastructure as code and in particular Terraform. Terraform has become the infrastructure as code tool of choice with Fortune100 companies.

I have done countless webinars covering cloud and devsecops topics such as containers, Kubernetes, serverless, devsecops etc..\n\nThis course will prepare you to understand the required topic from theory and from practical Terraform coding as well as real world deployment configurations in a multi-cloud architecture.\n\nEach lecture has a hands on lab to guide step by step with each topic and deepen your understanding as I believe that the best way to understand and master a topic is to learn by doing.\n\nLabs to guide step by step on using Terraform to provision and manage a complex multi cloud infrastructure similar to most deployments in Fortune 500 customers. The Tutorial covers AWS and Google Cloud and I will adding more Labs to cover more providers like Azure at no additional cost.\n\nThe tutorial includes Terraform practice exam and will be updating more tests questions regularly to keep you on your toes till exam day.\nPrepare for the exam by mastering Terraform rather than hoping to get the same questions as previous exams!\nTerraform version: Terraform 0.13 and 0.12\nAssessment Type: Multiple choice, Multiple Answer questions and True&False\nQuestions: 50 for each practice test\nDuration: 1 hour\nThe practice tests mimic the conditions of the real exam with 50 questions for a duration of 60 minutes.",
