My course currently contains 7.5 hours of video lectures, which is why Udemy displays this number on the course page and certificate of completion.\nI designed the course this way because I truly value your time. Instead of filling the videos with repetitive wording to make them artificially longer, I made the content concise and to the point. This way, you stay in control of your time — if you want to repeat or review something, you can always pause or go back to the video as needed.\nWhy does PMI recognize it as 35 PDUs?\nPMI does not count only the video playback time when considering Professional Development Units (PDUs). Instead, PMI looks at the total learning effort involved in completing the course, which includes:\nWatching all lectures\nCompleting chapter quizzes and knowledge checks\nTaking the full-length practice exam in “exam mode”\nRepeating practice simulations and reviewing explanations\nStudying additional reference material provided\nWhen all these activities are combined, the learning effort is equivalent to 35 contact hours, which meets PMI’s requirement for exam eligibility.\nWhy two types of certificates?\nThe Udemy completion certificate is automatically generated by Udemy and only reflects the course’s video duration (7.5 hours).\nThe separate certificate issued directly by me (melhout@mohamedelhout.com) confirms 35 PDUs / 35 contact hours, as designed for PMI eligibility. This certificate takes into account the entire course structure, not just lecture length.",

You may be a teacher or lecturer or perhaps a business person having to conduct all of your work online using Skype or Zoom or similar.\nYou may be the top expert in your subject area but if your listeners cannot understand you or hear you clearly they will never know how brilliant you are and you will not get the recognition you deserve.\nSound brilliant and confident on camera even if you feel uncomfortable and awkward at the thought of it.\n'Very quick and simple course with lots of great advice on how to speak well for video, podcasts, public speaking, and more.' Nicholas\n'Really useful information about presenting a course. I was worried about my voice on video but feel a lot more confident now. Good teacher. Thank you'  Maria\nDon't be intimidated by the camera.\nUsing your voice for online lectures whether it be Udemy or one of the other platforms is a skill anyone can learn.  This course does NOT cover any technical aspects of recording a video - I know very little about microphones, recording software etc. If you want advice about these technical matters this course is NOT for you. There are plenty of other places you can learn that from.\nThis course, will however help you to train your voice to sound interesting on camera. You will learn how to make the important facts stand out, how to sound confident and clear. You may not like the sound of your own voice but with this course you will learn how to love it. You will sound and look confident on screen.\nThis is a relatively short course because your time is valuable and you have lectures and presentations to prepare. I can do it in this short space of time because I've been teaching since 1994 and I know what you need to know!\nAs well as teaching you to be technically correct - saying ends of words, opening your mouth wide enough for the sound to get out and speaking slowly enough for your listener to take in what you have said, I will also show you how to sound interesting. If you don't sound excited about your course and topic how can you expect your pupils to be interested?\nI will demonstrate to you that you probably speak much too quickly and much quicker than you realise. There will be opportunites during the course for you to practise what I am explaining and I will demonstrate every point during the course. Towards the end of the course I have included lectures on how to read from your notes and still look very professional, not every lecture in every instance has to be from memory, sometimes in life we need to read our notes.\nI will explain how to breathe to speak and how to sit and stand to enable your voice to sound better.\nImprove your videos today, enrol now and sound like the expert you know you are.\nIncludes my 56 page ebook ' How to overcome speaking anxiety'",

Working with him has been an excellent experience. In the time since I have invested into his Get Funded program back in March 2020, (just 1 year ago as of this writing), I have started my own grant writing and nonprofit consultant business, and I have been hired as an inhouse grant writer for a Manhattan based nonprofit. I love that Rodney is always willing to provide advice and insight as I continue on my nonprofit journey.\"\n- Camille Ricks, Grant Specialist\n\n\n******************\n\n\n\"Rodney is energetic, seasoned and comprehensive in his approach to grant seeking. He understands that it is not simply a matter of writing a proposal, but advocates for strong research and relationship building as a complement to ensuring the best possible fit and chances for success. I have attended a few workshops on grant seeking, and none hold a candle to the combination of business and practical approaches to this industry. He is engaging and unusually informative in leading these workshops, and his background in business and marketing a huge pluses. I highly recommend Rodney as a consultant and presenter.\"\n- Lori Call, Development Consultant\n\n\n******************\n\n\nRodney is a grant genius!

Developed and written using the Procurement and Supply cycle** as it’s focus, it is at the same level as the second year of an undergraduate degree course.\n\nIt’s suitable for those in operational roles or those managing or supervising the procurement and supply function who want to develop their career and work towards MCIPS Chartered Procurement and Supply Professional.\n\nYou will learn about making procurement and supply happen within an organisation, and you will be equipped with an essential range of knowledge and tools that you can apply immediately in your workplace. Learn how to apply practical, theoretical and technical knowledge, gain a clear understanding of procurement and supply and develop the ability to address complex, non-routine problems.\n\nThe practice test contains carefully crafted questions and answers based on the content of the study guide - these are not passed questions from real CIPS exams as these are no longer issued by CIPS and would be an infringement of copyright. It serves as a revision.\n\nWho this course is for:\n\nLearners who are taking the CIPS Exams for L5M6 Category Management\nLearners who wish to pass the CIPS exams.\nLearners who want to gain confidence in passing the exams\nAnyone who wants to know more about procurement\nOn completion of this module, learners will be able to evaluate approaches that can be adopted to develop category management of both direct and indirect organisational expenditure and plan for the associated strategic processes.\n\nCategory management involves applying the end-to-end procurement process to a specific range of goods or services. This involves pre-award processes such as category analysis and demand management, sourcing and contract negotiation, and the post-award processes such as performance management. It is essential that those involved in managing procurement and supply activity can evaluate approaches to develop category management and are able to create process plans which ensure category management success. This module is designed for those who have responsibility for category management as it focuses on the differing approaches for category management using the tools and techniques which are available to assist with the creation of the associated processes for direct or indirect expenditure.",

      "description": "Every day, week, month or year, someone is quietly banking a huge sum of money for doing something that many others are not involved in online. While the online IM crowd goes one way, these souls do nothing remotely connected to internet marketing or any other regular online activity. Yet, they do much less work and make far, far more money than many online entrepreneurs.\nOn this page, I’ll show you what I do and how you can join me by doing the same thing systematically and consistently, getting away from the normal online grind. It means leaving behind everything you are probably used to doing online and getting ready to immerse yourself in a totally different world; a world you may never have considered looking into before.\nThe Contract Commander Method is Responsible For Creating Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars For Each Contract Manager\nA handful of contract managers in-the-know have been collecting upwards of $250,000 each and every year by doing very little in comparison to other online ventures.\nYet, you don’t hear much about these people because what they do is not as sexy as being called an Internet Marketer or Online Entrepreneur. But the money they make far exceeds most other online ventures without the hassles and frustration that usually comes along with any online endeavor.\nI too am a contract manager and I am currently living a lifestyle many would give their right arm for. You will notice that I have not posted pictures of fast cars or mansions because I don’t believe in selling that way. However, the money in this business can easily buy those things many times over, if you are so inclined.\nBeing a contract manager allows me to work whenever I want and it doesn’t even take up 2 hours of my day. This is the reason why it’s so enjoyable. I wouldn’t even classify it as work, because you’re doing things you would normally do anyway.\nHere’s what I do…\nI wake up in the morning and check a list that updates itself. Then I contact people on that list via Email, Skype or WhatsApp. I don’t usually call them because that would interfere with my relaxed lifestyle.\nAfter they respond, I arrange a hook-up between them and someone else.\nDoes that sound exhausting?\nDoes that sound like something that’s complicated?\nDoes that sound like something that would frustrate you?\nDoes that sound like tedious work?\nNo, it’s none of these things. It’s really simple work and it provides me with a great deal of free time. This is the reason I was able to create this Contract Commander course. My free time allows me to indulge in other activities. In fact, I've just started to dabble in the financial markets with the money that I have made.\nContinue to do whatever you are doing now\nYou can run this business in your spare time while you continue to do whatever you are doing now. That is good enough to start making a decent income as a part-time venture. When you gain traction, you can transition to making money this way exclusively, with no headaches or targets to meet.\nYou really don't have to be a genius or even have any special skills. If you can send an email or type a text, you are already qualified to become a contract manager.\nAs a Contract Manager, You’ll Bank \"Large Amounts\" For Less Work\nThat’s right. This business defies the axiom of getting-out what you put-in. As a contract manager, you’ll work smarter rather than harder. Making $10,000 takes the same amount of effort as it does to make $250,000. So keep your efforts consistent and you will see a steady stream come your way.\nThis lifestyle is truly headache free. There is no need to talk with anyone (unless you want to) and you can take things at your own pace.\nUsually there are no deadlines to race for because work runs along at a relaxing pace. In fact, sometimes it’s so relaxed, you’ll spend most of your day surfing the net or finding more opportunities to multiply your profits.\nReally? An average of twenty grand plus per month living and working this way? Absolutely!\n\n\nAre you still working online the old way?\nIf you’re currently working online, are you sick of hearing about SEO or forum posting or paid advertising etc?\nBy now, I’m sure you’re tired of doing the same old thing or hearing about the latest way of marketing, which you don’t know will work or not until you have spent some money.\nDay in, day out, we are bombarded with the usual standard ways of making money which work well for the person selling it, but hardly work for the people who tries to replicate that success.\nHave you been scouring through forums and blogs looking for the next big money making idea? I know what that feels like because I’ve been there. The problem is, opportunities like that don’t work forever. They are closed and plugged once it becomes saturated. So latecomers to the party always end up getting burnt.\nAlmost inevitably, over 90% of online money making ideas eventually require some sort of tedious painstaking work (like advertising or posting or blogging or shelling out capital to make it work).\nWell right now, you have the chance to get away from all the stuff you have been exposed to and take your efforts in a totally new direction. No more of the usual CPA, Youtube, Forum Posting, PPC, Promoting and so on… No more boring work for little-to-no-gains. No more wondering if your effort will end up making you money at the end of it. No more painstaking and disappointing attempts at making money.\nAre you really going to focus your efforts on a loophole which could be plugged at any time and then see your efforts wasted? I’ve been there and done that. I’ve had enough of that and I want to urge everyone who reads this letter to get away from that mentality and mindset.\nIt’s time to move in a totally different direction and join the few who are making super large sums without even a whiff of internet marketing.\nYou don’t need any equipment or paid tools to make this work. It’s naturally available for anyone who wants to extract money out of the system. Absolutely anyone can learn from what I teach in this course, and start making money, hand over fist.\n\n\nSo Who is a Contract Manager and What Does He Do?\nA contract manager (you) is someone who makes deals. These deals involve the signing of a contract. Deals are made between two parties (a buyer and supplier). Once the deal is concluded, you will receive a part of the contracted deal amount.\nSo if the contract is for $1m, you would receive roughly ~ $30,000 to $50,000.\nThis is the world of International Trade. It’s a multi trillion-dollar market and people like me are able to extract small chunks of the pie from different places.\nIn this market, there are thousands upon thousands of buyers who want something desperately. These buyers are either too lazy to find a suitable supplier or they don’t want the hassle of talking with multiple suppliers and choosing the right one.\nThis is where a contract manager like me steps in and finds the right supplier for the buyer’s requirements.\nI take full advantage of a buyer's laziness or inability!\nRemember the list I check every morning? This is a list of buyers wanting large quantities of a particular product. I simply contact some of those buyers and find out the details of what they want. After I have that information (in a document), I inform them that I will be in touch again after I have found them a suitable supplier.\nNext, I contact a number of suppliers for that particular product from another database which I have access to. I ask each of those suppliers if they can meet my buyer’s requirements. If they can, I would arrange for the supplier to speak directly with my buyer and conclude the deal.\nOf course, before I hand the buyer over, I would negotiate a fee for my service. No supplier ever refuses to pay the contract management fee. Usually, this is a significant fee which makes this entire business worthwhile!\nAll-in all, it’s a very simple process but there are many things to learn and take care off. Usually, you’d have to pay a fee to contact the list of buyers but my system works around that until you are making a decent income.\nIt only takes between 1-3 deals a year to be making $250,000 annually. With some contracts, you’ll make less and with others you’ll make more. Remember, it takes the same amount of effort to make $10k or $500k.\nIt’s quite possible for you to strike your first deal in your first 2 weeks, or if you take things slow, it may take 2-3 months before the system pays you for your effort. At the end of the day, you’ll realize you are doing a super relaxing business and you will make at least quarter mill by the end of the year.\nThis is an Evergreen business. As long as there are buyers and suppliers, the business will thrive and you will continue to extract huge profits from the market often.\nIt's Worked Very Well For Me, But Will It Really Work For You?\nLet's face it. Almost every course you buy online has worked well for the author who created it, but when it comes down to implementing it yourself, it just doesn't work. I should know, it's happened to me countless times.\nSo then how is this course different?\nFirst of all, there are hundreds of contract managers around the globe doing what I am doing, quietly. The good ones are making far more than me. This shows that even with a small amount of aptitude, you can make large sums.\nYou don't need any special ability or sales negotiation skills or even the ability to talk properly. There are so many deal makers out there who are in the worst of locations and can hardly communicate effectively, but they are contracting deal after deal, making thousands upon thousands of dollars for themselves.\nEven though you may have never strung two people together, this is so easy, it's difficult to fail 100% of the time. You just need to succeed once with one deal, and that should take care of you and your family for the entire year!\nSo this course has no element which would put it in the same category as the countless other courses which may or may not work for the buyer. As a contract manager, there's no such thing where I would have an advantage over you if we were both starting at the same level.\nIn module 6, I go through the whole process from scratch to completion, and all you have to do is follow along and copy exactly what I shown.\nSo, once again, please don't put this course in the same class as the other 100 courses released this month showing some form of internet marketing.\nThere's no way this business can slow down. Deals are endless!\nAs long as you continue to manage contractual deals, you will eventually build a database of reliable buyers and suppliers. This database will be your asset. This database will be worth a whole lot of money and this is the asset which you need to keep safe and close to your chest.\nEarning $250,000 from international trade is not hard at all. In fact, it’s quite easy when armed with the understanding of common practices. Generally, you won’t be dealing with small buyers. Most of your buyers will be from factories or industrial units and they always buy large quantities of materials.\nMost of their purchases will be measured in metric tons and these materials are shipped to them in containers via ocean freight.\nSo even if you were to make a few dollars per kilogram or ton, you would walk away with a tidy sum at the end of the deal.\nAfter that supply is complete, the buyer will require more materials. Guess who gets to profit from the additional supply? Yes, YOU!\nThis means, you will continue to receive a recurring income from having a repeat buyer who continues to order the materials from the supplier you sourced for him.\nCan you think of a better way to make truck-loads of money by sitting and working from home? Back in the 80’s it would have been much harder to get involved in international trade. But with technological advancements, a common man like me can immerse himself in this endeavor and pull profits again and again.\nAlthough this business seems like brokering, it’s slightly different in the way it works. Many brokers are not able to arrange deals because of their work flow and the way they have been educated. A contract manager goes about his routine in a different manner to brokers. This is why professional contract managers make at least $250,000 plus every year, while brokers are lucky to make any deals at all.\nA contract manager’s job carries with it a certain prestige which makes buyers and suppliers take him seriously. The direct and serious approach makes things flow easily and results in negotiating more money than a broker would be able to ask for.\n\n\nContract Management Will Pour Money Into Your Bank Account\nI’m extracting money from the procedure I have detailed in the course and I have spilled all my knowledge explaining and showing you how you can do the same as me.\nI’ve been doing this for a long time and I am confident that my methods will make you rich enough to stop doing whatever you are doing now and move to doing this full time.\nThe business of international trade is still quite traditional, but it is filled to the brim with money. My job as a contract manager is to siphon just some of that maybe once or twice a month. Doing this even once or twice a year is enough for a very very comfortable lifestyle.\nYou should be making one or two deals every month but let’s say you’re a complete failure and you manage to secure just one deal after an entire year, do you realize that this deal will be enough to cover your annual salary and far more?\nIn the course, I explain how one deal can quite often be a source of income for years to come. This business is certainly not child's play. It’s a real, down-to-earth, physical business but without any overheads.\nMany of the buyers I speak with are people who own, or work for large industrial businesses. These businesses quite often require raw materials or certain food items.\nAnd because raw materials and food items are perishable items, they come back and order more. Every time they do that, I would earn a cut of the sale value, netting thousands or even hundreds-of-thousands of dollars.\nAs I write this letter, I am working on a deal for a particular food item with a buyer from Israel. After speaking with this buyer, he has agreed to pay me $75,000 from his own pocket, every month, if he agrees to buy the product through my recommended supplier. I don’t even need the buyer’s money but I’m certainly not going to turn down an extra $75k per month if the buyer is offering it from his side. A contract manager’s income is usually made from the supplier side. Everything else is just a bonus.\nWith any deal you make, you don’t need to make large sums per item. You can make just as much money (and even more) by keeping the profit lower but selling more of the item every so often. Volume orders for perishable items work best and produce a helluva lotta money.\nSo without doing any additional work, your initial effort for arranging the contract will result in a residual income for a year or more.\nOne Time Deal - Reap Royalties For Months or Years\nI have been managing contracts for a long time now and I know what works and what doesn’t. I have made good money from this business and I’m confident it will continue to provide me with an income for as long as I live. With $250k per year, I don’t need to worry about delving into any other money making scheme online. I can feel good and relax by simply arranging a few deals every year.\nThe international trade market is huge and there’s enough money to go around even if thousands of contract managers got-in on the game. Don’t worry about saturation or seasons or countries. This business is truly evergreen for a switched-on deal maker.\nMy Contract Commander course teaches you the exact methods and strategies I use to secure deals. Securing contracts the way I do, may net you a minimum of $250k by next year (no promises).\nI must admit, it’s not as glamorous as being an Internet Marketer, but this work is far more enjoyable and yet you still work online without doing any manual labor.\nI will disclose my tips, tricks and techniques and show you how to succeed at running this business efficiently and profitably, and more importantly, how to avoid wasting time with poor pursuits. Learn what will give you an advantage over other contract managers.\nYou’ll learn how to set the whole thing up, what tools you will need (don’t worry, these tools are free), where and how to contact almost unlimited buyers and suppliers, obtaining your contract management fees and how to do all of this without spending a penny on advertising or expensive memberships.\nI have even provided letter templates and documentation which you will need as you conduct your business transactions.\nIn short, you’ll learn how to run your own highly profitable contract management business, entirely online without having to visit anyone.\n\n\nBut if you’ve been trying to make money online for any length of time, you’ll probably expect me to teach you a particular way to build a list and recommend an autoresponder etc… No! I don’t do any of that. I don’t teach any of the usual stuff you are already tired of hearing and which 1001 other people are doing at the same time. Like I said before, this is totally different and none of the usual online methods apply to this business.\nThis is a business which has been hidden from mainstream view and not many online entrepreneurs are involved in extracting profits from this gazillion dollar industry.\nAs a contract manager, you can choose to deal in just one product or a variety of different products. There is no limit to the types of products you can manage but I do provide some guidelines on the types of products to avoid. Choosing the wrong product will result in wasted weeks of effort, when this can easily be avoided.\nIf you think there aren’t enough products to settle with, just take a look at some of these products and categories being traded and exported today.\nUsed Cooking Oil\nAluminium Alloy\nMobile Handsets\nCharcoal\nParboiled Rice\nChemical Sprays\nCorn Oil\nPrunes\nIC45 Sugar\nWalnuts\nTomato Paste\nCopper Wire\nTV Screens\nShoes\nHeavy Machinery\nGame Consoles\nSolar Panels\nSpecific Vehicles\nCoffee Beans\nSilicone Materials\nIron Ore\nCoal From Mine\nScrap Metal\nSealing Lubes\nCatering Parts\nSeeds\nGloves\nCar Ball Bearings\nCrude Rapeseed\nLeather Jackets\nProcessing Machine\nFlexitanks\nThis is just the beginning. As you can see, there is absolutely no shortage of products you can deal in. The list of profitable products goes on and on and on...\nAt the moment, I deal in just a handful of products and this is more than enough to provide me with a very comfortable lifestyle.\nYou can choose to deal in several products like I do or just one product, which is perfectly fine and can also result in hundreds of thousands of dollars every year.\nThere are literally thousands of opportunities here. The marketplace is brimming with buyers and suppliers. Check any trade portal or B2B tradeboard and you will find thousands of suppliers ready to sell you anything. It would take you a year or more to cover 10% of them, and there’s more being added all the time.\nI’ll teach you to select the right supplier for the right buyer and how to negotiate the deal according to the buyer’s requirements.\nIf you try to do it without any direction, it would take you weeks to cover any decent ground.\nAfter that, you still may not end up with the perfect supplier for your buyer.\nThe information I will be disclosing to you is worth $9000+. Please don't take this course if you plan to do nothing with it. I need action takers to take the buyers and arrange for suppliers to supply them. I need you to use my information and use it to turn yourself into another success story.\nTrading on the international market is not a “here-today, gone-tomorrow” type of business. It’s here to stay and it’s always profitable. You can’t lose by the changing of seasons. How many IM related flash products do you know which are still working after 10 years? It’s very difficult to stay on top of Google’s ever-changing algorithms, and even then, your results are not guaranteed. Don’t get bogged down with all the frustrations of internet marketing and the introductions of network marketing or MLM. Turn around and go in a totally different direction with far more profits!\nThe information I teach you in Contract Commander will still be relevant in 30 years time. It’s something you can build and then hand over to your offspring to continue when you get old. It doesn’t matter if you move countries or have no money. You can continue to run this business in all situations and locations. I mean, you really can’t see the world of international trade suddenly stopping. That’s just illogical.\nOver time, I have become quite good as a contract manager and now buyers and suppliers alike come to me, asking me to source or supply a product for them.\nOnce you have built your reputation, you won’t need to work half as hard as you did at the early stages. Things will flow smoother. Your service will be in demand and you won’t have to search for suppliers or buyers at that stage.\nSoon, Buyers Will Flock to You For Contracts\nManaging contracts is a fascinating business. There aren’t too many people in it and it’s almost unimaginable to think it could become saturated. Even if you live on a mountain, you can still conduct this business as long as you have an internet connection and a computer.\nYou won’t need to handle or even see the products you deal in. Yet, you can make as much money as you want by choosing how and when to work (and I don’t even think of it as work).\nBeing a contract manager is quite relaxing. Wake up in the morning, turn your laptop on, brew your tea or coffee and sit down to check messages from your buyers or suppliers. Send a few emails and maybe text a couple of people. If needed, spend 20-30 minutes looking for new buyers and communicate with them instantly.\nAll this without the pressure of having to rank somewhere or the expense of advertising your services.\nDuring your workflow, you will always have deals progressing at different stages. While one is closing, a couple of them are half-way through and yet many of them are at their initial stages.\nIt works like a funnel. All deals don’t always work out, but those that do are sufficient to provide you with a super income that may last you a year or more.\nWhat's Inside Contract Commander?\nOnce you have made your payment, you will be guided to the dashboard in the members area where you will be able to access one thing and one thing only.\nI have deliberately kept this course streamlined to a degree where you get to learn with minimal fuss. Think of it as a no-frills course. I don't have any PDF transcripts or audio files which serve to duplicate the content and make it look obviously valuable (although it's much more). No, I have kept is targeted to a degree on purpose.\nContract Commander is a series of seven modules containing 16 instructional videos. Each video walks you through the logical sequence of finding and completing profitable contracts. Each module contains intricacies which you need to learn from before moving on to the next. Subsequent modules build upon previous instruction.\nI have also prepared documents which I use regularly and have provided them in the members area for you to hit the ground running.\nThere are far too many points of interest (within the 7 modules) to list here, but rest assured, it’s highly educational and it’s structured in a very easy-to-digest format. The videos are easy to understand and I have dispensed with all the information you don’t need to know which would have resulted in fluff and a waste of time.\n\n\nI have shared almost everything I know in these videos. I know that if I drop you with a laptop and an internet connection on an island, you will almost certainly make it work, providing you follow my instructions.\nBut I don’t know if you will follow my instructions. I don’t know if you are lazy or committed. I don’t know what type of mindset you have. I don’t know if you can even communicate in English properly with buyers and suppliers. There are many variables which could hinder you from following my instructions properly.\nSome people pay thousands to learn a skill or a trade, but never really put the effort in to become good at it. I don’t know what kind of commitment you will provide in implementing my methods daily. It all depends on how bad you want this and how badly you want to join the quiet group of contract managers who are raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nEarning large sums from this business is not a pie-in-the-sky dream. It’s a definite reality and it could be yours too. If only your turned away from trying the usual stuff online and instead focused your efforts on international trade, you’d see the amazing fruits of your labor too.\n\n\nSeven Day Money Back Guarantee\nAccess the video instruction now. If at any time within the next seven days you believe this business is not for you, simply shoot me an email and I will refund your purchase price back to you. This is my iron-clad money back guarantee!\nEducational Expense\nHow Much Should You Pay?\nI have shot the course showing the latest techniques and methods which I use to extract substantial profits from the international trade market. After studying and learning what I do (and how I do it), I would expect you to squeeze at least an average of $20,000 every month (again, no promises) from the marketplace into your own pocket.\nOf course, I can’t guarantee anything because I don’t know how closely you will follow my method. But it’s difficult to see anyone fail with my strategies after learning from my videos, especially with my help alongside your efforts.\nI’m not selling an ebook or a standard IM course here. This is totally different. These instructional videos will change the way you work forever. I am not selling a cheap PLR product here. I believe in this course and I fully expect you to make a minimum of 20-30 times the amount you will pay to inherit this business with my methods and secrets. Surely you don’t expect me to part with my business secrets for a mere $17, do you?\nIn fact, I didn’t even have to create this course, but I decided to do it because of the sheer amount of space available in this business for thousands of contract managers. As long as I can help others while making extra money at the same time, I’m game.\nMany people sell cheap ebooks to make a wad of cash from the sale of those books rather than the information they are imparting to others. That’s not me. I do make money from the business I have chosen and I am offering to teach you the exact methods that I use.\nI’ll be sharing with you my knowledge and my real-world experience. In fact, I’ll walk you through a live case study from zero to the end result. I leave nothing out.\nSo please don’t think that I will give this away for a cheap price.\nMy price may be high for some, but this will also eliminate the casual and curious buyers and the ones who suffer from shiny object syndrome.\nI prefer to deal with serious buyers only who are committed to thinking big and living big. I don’t want this information in the hands of tyre-kickers or serial refunders.\nI know my price will automatically disqualify a number of people but this is the way I prefer to have it.\nConsidering what I am offering and the income extracted from this business, I am selling my secrets for a fraction of its correct value - $997. It’s a fair and low-ball price for a super profitable course in my opinion. I believe it’s worth a minimum of $9000. Once you make your first deal, you'll understand why this course is severely undervalued.\n\n\nHere are some of the things you get with my Contract Commander course...\nAccess my video instruction in the members area\nLearn to live quietly and make thousands upon thousands of dollars without gimmicks or advertising\nMove away from the online herd and join me doing what no one else is doing\nLearn to strike deals with relative ease\nLearn to negotiate with buyers and suppliers\nFind out how brokers can help you\nUnderstand the technicalities of documentation, terms and payments\nWalk through a complete deal with me from scratch to completion and see the result\nSee how I locate and communicate with buyers within minutes\nLearn the art of choosing the right supplier for your buyer\nDiscover much much more...\n\n\nARE YOU STILL THINKING ABOUT GETTING BACK TO THE USUAL FRUSTRATING GRIND OR DO YOU WANT TO STEER YOURSELF IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION NOW?\nAs more and more people buy my course, I will be increasing the price to keep the number low.\nSo if you’re on the fence, decide soon, because I do intend to increase the price periodically in order to provide a better service. It doesn’t matter where you live or what your previous experience has been, everyone starts at their own pace and learns in different ways.\nIf you’re already ready to switch your online career, find the Buy button on this page and get started. Maybe you will be the next person to sit in one corner of the net banking thousands upon thousands of dollars ever so quietly.\nI know you will thoroughly enjoy this course and I know I will be thrilled to help you make money in the same way that I do.\nKeeping it real and down to earth!\nAmin Sadak",

      "description": "Hands-On Transcription Practice Created by an Experienced Transcriptionist Herself:\nThis is Course A in the Hands-On Transcription Practice Series, featuring practice work in the following genres:\nLegal\nEducation\nMarket Research Interviews\nA Keynote Speaker\nA Freelance Writer\nAs an experienced at-home transcriptionist for over 20 years, I have a very good handle on what is required to be an excellent transcriptionist, and be successful at it. I have taught hundreds in my successful Udemy course, “Step-by-Step Transcription from Home - Start A New Career,” and now am very excited to provide a series of courses devoted solely to transcription practice, with hours of hands-on transcription work for you!\nImmerse Yourself in the Work of a Transcriptionist:\nThe series enables those learning transcription (or coming back into the field) to practice with over two hours of audio per course (25 individual files in each), in several genres - and with the added benefit of a finished typed document to compare against your work for every audio. Each course stands on its own, offering video introductions to each set of work, companion audio files to type, work specifications documents for each “client,” as well as completed work documents, for your comparison, for each audio.\nSimply put, these hours of hands-on transcription practice, producing completed documents in many subjects and genres, will add to your confidence and experience when you do look for work. (I would have loved something like this when I started out!)\nHave You Taken Other Transcriptionist Courses?\nAre You Coming Back Into Transcription?\nIf you have taken a course in becoming a transcriptionist, such as my own (“Step-by-Step Transcription from Home - Start A New Career”), or others, you will find this practice to be a really useful addition to your transcriptionist education, allowing you to further the transcription practice you have started - completing many typed files, increasing your skills as a transcriptionist, while getting better with your equipment, as well.\nIf you have not trained in transcription at all, you may still get benefit from the course in working through the files. Please note, however, that there will not be information on software and equipment needed, etc. to be a transcriptionist. These courses are solely focused on practicing by completing transcription work itself. With that said, and as someone who had minimal training when I began, you may well be able to work through these. However, you can also sign up for a transcription course, and this series as well. Whatever works for you!\nIf you were a transcriptionist in the past, these courses will be a wonderful way to get “back in the groove” of transcription, practicing at your own pace!\nWhat You Will Complete in This Series - Course A:\nAs noted above, this course in the series features practice work in the following genres:\nLegal\nEducation\nMarket Research Interviews\nA Keynote Speaker\nA Freelance Writer\nFor each genre there is an introductory video, noting the work practice type, and some pointers on completing the work type. You will then receive 5 audios and a work specification sheet to download, noting any formatting or “client” requests. You will also receive 5 completed documents for download, to compare your finished work against. In doing this, you will be proofreading your documents, getting used to this part of transcription work, as well.\nIn total, in this course you will receive 25 audio files (over 2 hours of audio), and when complete will have created 25 typed documents.\nLike A Transcriptionist Simulator:\nWith this course you can immerse yourself in the work of a transcriptionist, working on 25 files of varying types and subjects.\nYou will be working with varying genres of work, including general transcription, as listed above for this specific course in the series. If you conducted a search for \" audio transcription \" here on Udemy, this course would meet your needs, as well, as you will be receiving 25 audios to transcribe.\nWhen This Course is Complete:\nYou will have successfully typed 25 documents covering 5 genres of audio work. You will have greatly added to your skills as a transcriptionist, including learning to proofread, enabling you to apply for work with even more confidence.\nDo You Want More Practice?\nIf you want more practice you have some options. If you like, you can go through this course’s practice files again, honing and perfecting your skills. However, if you would like even more files to work on, you can pick up another course in the series - which will add 25 more audios in 5 genres to your practice workload.\nThe choice is yours!\nAre you ready to get started practicing with transcription work? I look forward to seeing you in the class!",

      "description": "Welcome to CIPS L6M5 practice exams. This module is Strategic Programme Leadership.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is this course?\nThis course contains practice questions to help you prepare for your CIPS exam. The questions and format have been carefully designed to mimic the real CIPS exam as closely as possible.\nAfter you have completed a practice test, your test is instantly graded and you are given a score, which will provide you with an indication of whether you will pass the real exam. For each question asked, I provide a complete commentary detailing why the correct answer is correct. I also reference which Learning Outcome the question comes from and the page number in the Study Guide for you to refer back to. The commentary also includes details on whether the topic is a common theme in the exam (i.e. there's likely to be lots of questions on this subject) as well as some links to additional reading on difficult topics. No other practice papers provide you with this level of detail. My aim is to not only to help you get the question right, but to help you understand why it is right.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of using this course\n· All Learning Outcomes and question types are covered. These are the only practice questions on Udemy where you’ll find the THREE types of question that come up at Level 6; multiple choice, ‘drag and drop’ and the scenario. It’s important to practice all types.\n· The course has been meticulously designed by an experienced teacher to build your confidence, practice your technique and highlight areas where you are strong and weak before the exam, so that you can work on this and pass first time.\n· I'm also a native English speaker so my questions are all grammatically correct and my explanations are easy to understand\n· Each practice paper consists of 48 questions and is 1h 30mins long. This is the exact number of questions and exact time you have in the real exam. One of the main challenges students face is maintaining concentration for 48 questions straight- so these practice tests will help develop your technique as well as your knowledge (i.e. not spending too long on one question, not losing focus). No other practice papers are set up this way.\n· Some CIPS exam questions are not covered in the Study Guide. Where possible, I have included known exam topics that aren't in the Study Guide - so you shouldn't get caught out in the exam.\n\n\n\n\nReviews and Results\nStudents who take this course report excellent exam results, higher levels of confidence and being able to pass their exams with less hours of study. My courses have been selected as part of 'Udemy for Business'. This means they're within the top 3% of courses on Udemy, based on quality. Please check out the review section for more:\n“The material gives you great practice technique for an exam. I have passed my module.” - Curtis",

      "description": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is ALL about IDENTIFYING, EVALUATING and REMOVING any RISKS in your business associated with the way it gathers and uses the personal information of individuals.\nThe power of this course lies in the unique structured and staged approach it takes doing just this. This  consists of:\nIdentifying ALL risks that exist in the way that you gather or use personal information.\nEvaluating these risks and developing viable actions to remove them.\nRemoving all of these risks by implementing these actions while, at the same time, creating an audit trail showing what you did and updating relevant business processes to prevent recurrence of these risks.\nThis course is unique in its blend of the theoretical and the practical.\nOn the theoretical side, it explains – in plain, non-legalese – all of the major elements and terms of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that you will need to understand in order to enable you to have confidence that the 5-step approach of the course will lead you safely to GDPR Compliance.\nOn the practical side, the course starts off by explaining how to establish whether or not GDPR applies to your business. If it does apply, the course then provides you with a highly pragmatic and proven 5-step process to achieve GDPR Compliance.

If you have benefitted from the information, please consider making a donation. If you're part of the 98% that can't make a donation, please massively forward the website and this course to your network ... it makes a difference.\nSouthern California water is supplied from three main sources, the aqueducts, groundwater, and desalination.  The groundwater resource is comprised of \"runoff\" from the mountains, as well as aqueduct water that is \"artificially recharged\" into the groundwater system in spreading basins, constructed within the river channels and overflow banks.  Desalination is used to treat waste water into freshwater, which is then put into the groundwater system to form \"seawater barriers,\" raising fresh groundwater levels in a \"groundwater mound\" that inhibits \"saltwater encroachment\" from the ocean.  All of the deliveries of water and its management requires energy.  Desalination of seawater has become energetically competitive with aqueduct pumping energy, enough to be cost competitive.  As a result, ocean desalination is becoming an increasing supplier of southern California's potable water needs.\n\n\nPart I:  Ions\nPart II: Dissolved Solids and Biological Considerations\nPart III:  Possible Chemical and Radiological Contaminants\nPart IV:  Energy in Water?  A Comparison of Water Sources\nPart V:  Orange County Groundwater Management\nPart VI:  Desalination and Seawater Barriers\nPart VII:  An Overview of the Aqueducts\nPart VIII:  The Los Angeles Aqueduct\nPart IX:  The California and Colorado River Aqueducts and Delivery to Orange County",

      "description": "Win More Grants by Becoming GRANT READY is an essential grant planning preparation course. It provides a discussion of all the documents and organizational preparations you need to have in place to successfully apply for grant funding, impress grant makers, run a smooth grant management system, and always, always include the latest data, statistics, descriptions, outcomes, and other information that supports your need and justifies your solution. To be considered for any funding, your NPO HAS to be GRANT READY. This course is perfect for any grant writer. And not only is it ideal as an aid to teaching your NPO or clients how to become GRANT READY, but as a consultant you most definitely can bill for your time spent training and preparing your clients to become GRANT READY.\nWhile updating my Grant Readiness checklist, I surveyed grant writers and consultants from across the USA, requesting their descriptions of being GRANT READY. The outcome became this course: a good, solid picture of what grant makers tend to ask about, and information needed to provide those answers.\nThis is a short course, less than an hour, but you'll spend considerable time assembling the list of required information, developing a system of delegating and following up with those assigned to maintain data or submit information.\nSo, plan to do some work, then watch your NPO soar. This course will help you improve your grant presentations and applications, your understanding of your mission, vision, and potential to achieve them. Once you complete the assignments, you'll see your programs and projects in a clearer light. You'll know more about how your services dovetail with others both similar and complimentary.\n\nYou'll spend less time trying to find needed details. Grant application processes such as writing and reviewing, obtaining the specific budget information needed, assembling required attachments, and submitting well before deadlines will just go more smoothly. Wouldn't THAT be nice?\nThe course is divided into two basic parts.\nThe first six lectures describe why GRANT READINESS is important, and what a GRANT READY NPO looks like.\nThe last four lectures review the contents of the checklists and why those items matter.\nLecture 11 wraps up with a summary, assignments to build your own GRANT READINESS checklist, and a simple system for managing these records.\nYou'll download a seven-page checklist of needed items, broken down into five categories. The checklist can be used as is, or edited to fit your or your clients' needs. This checklist is suitable for most categories of charitable giving, but if something is missing, just add it. And if you share it with me I'll add it and add your name and company to the credits.",

Mastering its functionality is not only recommended, it is required.\n\"Microsoft Excel For Business Professionals\" is not your average Excel course. What sets this course apart is its business centric focus. Frankly- if you are looking for complex macros or building information databases- this course is not for you.\nThis course is specifically tailored for those working in some form of business capacity. If you want to develop Excel skills applicable to any trade/business, instantly boost your resume, and outperform your peers, then this course is for you.\nMy name is Calvin and I am the instructor for this course. I have been fortunate to be employed by arguably the largest professional services firm in the world with high profile clients such as Disney, Edison International, Nike, Dreamworks, and Fox- many of which I have had the opportunity to work directly with.\nWhile these high profile clients may seem glamorous, I am down in the trenches- preparing and reviewing workpaper after workpaper, spreadsheet after spreadsheet. Naturally throughout my experience, I have seen a common thread of Excel tips, tricks, and best practices that companies across the board use. Mastering these skills is an important addition to any business professional's arsenal of skills. Through step by step guides, downloadable spreadsheet, and project based examples, this course will impart this knowledge to you.\nBy taking this course you will be able to:\nAnalyze and Manipulate Data\nExecute beginner and Intermediate Excel Functions\nPerform Business Centric Excel Formulas\nSave Time and Effort in Your Work\nPrepare Standardized/Properly Referenced Workpapers\n... Become a Better Business Professional!\nSo what are you waiting for? With Udemy's 30 day money back guarantee, you have nothing to lose!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat Business Excel Really Means:\nI've received a lot of questions on what Excel for Business really means. Using Microsoft Excel in a business setting can be boiled down to three broad categories:\nData Manipulation\nHow do you take large data sets and extract the information you need? Furthermore, how do you take the information you need and forecast results? Using Excel in a business setting is about taking raw data and transforming it meaningful information. Many of these functions and calculations are already baked into the Excel software.\nEfficiency\nWhen you're working with thousands of transactions and billions of dollars, Excel can perform calculations in seconds which otherwise would take hours manually. Using Excel correctly can not only save you countless number of hours, but also, can save your company countless number of dollars.\nModel Building\nThere are three keys in building a strong model- flexibility, results, and clarity. Flexibility means that a user can change any inputs and the model will automatically calculate a new result. Whether it's forecasts or estimates, inputs are always changing. Building a model that can accommodate that is the foundation to any good model. Secondly, you must learn to present information in a clear, concise, and visually appealing manner. If someone can't understand, it won't matter how good your model is. Lastly, you must build a model that not only applies the correct logic, but can you give information that solves problems.",

AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines. This can include problem-solving, learning, reasoning, understanding language, and even visual perception. AI systems don’t “think” like humans but are designed to mimic human capabilities through data processing. For instance, when you use Google Maps for directions, it uses AI to analyze traffic data and recommend the best route.\nHow does AI differ from regular computer programs? Traditional programs follow a set of pre-written instructions to perform tasks, meaning they can’t adapt or change based on new data. AI, on the other hand, can learn from the information it's given and adapt its behavior. For example, a basic calculator performs the same function every time, while AI like Netflix’s recommendation engine changes based on what you’ve watched and what similar users enjoy.\nWhat are some everyday examples of AI? AI is deeply integrated into our daily lives, often in ways we don’t notice. Some examples include:\nSearch engines like Google, which use AI to provide relevant results.\nSpam filters in email accounts, which learn over time to detect unwanted messages.\nVoice assistants like Siri or Alexa, which understand and respond to spoken commands.\nStreaming platforms like Netflix or Spotify, which suggest movies or music based on past behavior.\nWhat is Generative AI? Generative AI refers to algorithms that can create new content based on patterns they’ve learned from existing data. Unlike AI that only analyzes data, Generative AI can produce new text, images, music, and even code. For example, when you ask ChatGPT to write a poem, it’s generating new text based on its understanding of language from all the text it has been trained on.\nHow is Generative AI different from other types of AI? Most AI is designed for analysis or decision-making, like predicting whether an email is spam or not. Generative AI is different because it creates something new. For example, if you give it a sentence, it can continue the sentence, or if you describe a scene, it can generate an image. It’s more creative in nature, which is why it’s used for tasks like writing, designing, or composing music.\nWhat does \"generating\" mean in the context of Generative AI? In Generative AI, \"generating\" means producing new content that wasn’t there before. The AI doesn’t just repeat or copy existing data—it uses what it’s learned to create original outputs. For example, if you ask a Generative AI to generate a painting of a sunset, it won’t pull an image from the internet but will create a new image based on its understanding of how sunsets typically look.\nHow does Generative AI work in simple terms? Generative AI works by learning patterns from large amounts of data. It doesn’t understand things the way humans do, but it can mimic human creativity by recognizing how pieces of data (words, pixels, sounds) are typically structured. It’s like learning how to write by reading many books—it doesn’t understand the meaning of the words but knows how they fit together.",

      "description": "Subtitulos en ESPAÑOL disponibles\nWhen was the last time that you obtain profits from the casino roulette at least for three of four consecutive times?\nLong time ago, I used to bet randomly, I used to put the money on the table, cross my finger and wait to win. Of course, most of the time I failed. Then I started to buy books, videos and tutorials, but nothing changed. Finally, I studied the mathematics of the roulette and I learned a lot useful things. I also studied some basic but important aspects of psychology of gambling to understand how casinos manipulate people in order to get their money easily. Now I apply all that knowledge and my profits have been considerable incremented.\nThe main problem I had, was that I always wanted to recover my money after losing a bet. I was betting, and betting over and over again instead of going home and return other day. The secret of a successful bet at roulette is stop betting randomly. By calculating the probabilities of the roulette numbers, the uncertainty of a bet is considerable decreased and at the same time profits are incremented. If you are not able to compute the probabilities of the roulette in each spin, you are doomed to fail over and over again.\nOriginally, I developed an app for me. That app computes automatically all the probabilities of the roulette, increases the probabilities to win, helps to design a bet strategy, and it is completely customizable. All the calculations are based on the probability theory, in the same way that professionals obtain profits. This app comes free with the course.\nWith this app I could recover all the money I have lost in the casino. It really worked for me; it can work for anyone. The trick is to stay at the casino the less time you can. You win, you leave the casino. For each extra minute you stay in the casino, the probabilities of lose your profits could be considerable increased. Specially if you don't have enough self-control.\nThis course can be taken by any person. No specific math knowledge is require. All you need is internet connection and a web browser. I will teach you how to compute all the probabilities in a roulette. This helps you to easily take decisions during a betting session. With this course and the app you will know about repeated numbers, delay in specific kind of numbers and the probabilities for last roulette numbers. You will be able to see everything in a graphic which presents the behavior of the roulette.\nThis is not a miracle course. No one can predict the future or know which would be the next roulette number. However, computing the probabilities clearly increases the chances of winning. By computing probabilities you can't lose, can you? Yes, you can! Anything can happen in the real world. The course main purpose is to increment the chances to obtain profits, not to magical predict numbers.\nI'm sure there are a lot of courses that promise 100% of number predictions. To obtain profits the most important thing is to correctly manage your money when you are betting. With this course sometimes you may lose other you may win, but the balance will have positive profits.\nThe course provides all the tools needed to compute probabilities in roulette, betting systems, betting strategies, monitoring numbers and complete information about the roulette. With all this you can pick up the more suitable winner numbers.\nIf anyway you are going to bet, it would be better to do it with acknowledge and advantage. If roulette  data is analyzed, the success is guaranteed.\nThink twice, bet once, win a lot of money.\nP.S. Roulette betting is easier with this course, you can monitor the roulette behavior, know all the probabilities, and customize your bets. Enroll now and increase your profits.",

This qualification will prepare intermediate level learners looking to specialise in procurement and supply and to progress onto the CIPS Level 4 Diploma in Procurement and Supply.\n\nProcurement and supply is to operate in a varied range of environments. As well as the public and private sectors, those responsible for the procurement and supply function may find themselves working with those in not-for-profit organisations. This module is designed for those who are involved in the procurement and supply function, who must recognise the wider environment in which they work and the impacts that different types of organisations can have on successfully meeting with overall organisational needs. They must know the importance of the external environment and also identify the procedures that regulate procurement and supply\n\nThe practice test contains carefully crafted questions and answers based on the content of the study guide - these are not passed questions from real CIPS exams as these are no longer issued by CIPS and would be an infringement of copyright. It serves as a revision.\n\nWho this course is for:\nLearners who are taking the CIPS Exams for L3M2 - Ethical Procurement and Supply\nLearners who wish to pass the CIPS exams.\nLearners who want to gain confidence in passing the exams\nAnyone who wants to know more about procurement\nOn completion of this module, learners will be able to identify the significance of ethics for procurement and supply and define each stage of the sourcing process, explaining how operational performance can be measured and improved in support of added value operations.",

On the commercial side — during that same time period — I booked national Welch's and Dr. Scholl's ads.\nLook me up on IMDb to see my success.\nLearn the principles I put into practice to go from sporadic auditions and rare bookings (1 co-star in 2013, zero in 2012) to booking with regularity and making fans of casting directors so they keep calling me in for auditions.\nNow casting directors will keep seeing me, again and again, until I get a role on the show they're casting!\nThese tools and tricks work for any role in the on-camera world (TV, film, commercials, industrials, sketch, even print ads). Instill casting directors with confidence so they'll call you in for whatever they're casting.\nYou can't learn this stuff in class.\nIt's taken me 15 years to learn these techniques, one by one, each moving me one step closer to booking regular TV work. I've accumulated everything you need to know and it's all in this course.\n_________________\nI'm proof that this course works.\nWith this course, you will easily identify the areas of your acting career that are holding you back. Most actors neglect one or more of their vital materials, either out of laziness or because they believe their talent alone will take them to the top.\nStop concerning yourself with things that are outside your control as an actor — whether you book the role, how much your agent submits you, whether your co-star role will turn into a recurring role, etc etc etc.\nLet me help you identify what's in your control, and help you eliminate red flags that keep casting directors from calling you in.\n_________________\nActors, if you ask just about anyone, are OVERPAID.\nBe thankful for that.\nThe minimum salary for a series regular on a Screen Actors Guild television show is $5,000 per episode. You shoot 22 episodes. That's $110,000. Factoring in residuals, this amount could be DOUBLED, and you've still got 6 months out of the year to shoot a movie or a couple commercials or write that screenplay. And did I mention that's the minimum salary? It goes up from there!\nCommercial work pays notoriously high rates — anywhere between $5,000 and $60,000 PER AD depending on the distribution (and that's usually for one day of work).\nWith the staggering number of TV shows in production, there's never been a better time — in HISTORY — to be a working TV actor.\nLearn how to BOOK YOUR WAY UP THE LADDER, from co-stars (the smallest SAG-AFTRA speaking roles) on up. Get some co-stars, you'll start getting auditions for guest starts (multiple scenes and an emotional arc) and recurring roles.\nThen, and only then, will you be even considered for series regular work.\nLet me show you how to get on this path — getting into casting offices, auditioning with confidence, and BOOKING ROLES.\nSEE HOW I'M GETTING...\n...speaking roles on major shows and networks — 8 since the beginning of 2014!\n...regular auditions for recurring roles and series regulars.\n...thousands of dollars per year in residuals from TV work.\n...the chance to work with amazing directors who remember my work and think of me for future projects.\n...the ability to live the dream as a working actor, making a living off my TV, commercial and film work.\n_________________\nWhat this course is NOT:\nI can't teach you acting craft (not over the internet, anyway). If you're a serious actor, you should always be sharpening your skills and working on material and getting your mouth around some text.\nGet acting. That's all you.\nI'll show you how the easy things, squarely in your control — headshots, resume, demo… your materials — are what'll get you in the room.\nThen I'll show you how to make such an impression in the room that casting directors will keep calling you back, again and again, until you book.\n_________________\nWhether you're new to acting, auditioning occasionally, or getting out but not booking regularly, these practical tools will ensure that you're covering all your bases and not standing in your own way (which an embarrassingly high number of actors are guilty of).\nGet out of your own way! I'll show you how.\nRemember, I've booked 8 SAG-AFTRA roles on network and cable TV IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE. I'm CURRENTLY a working actor. Take it from me — I'm out there right now, auditioning, booking, and getting on TV.\nIn addition to the Udemy 30-day guarantee, you have my personal promise that you will take away the skills to PUT YOURSELF ONE DAY CLOSER TO BOOKING TV WORK immediately.\nEvery day you wait to TACKLE your acting career is a day you're missing out on an audition. Click now, buy this course, and start taking control of your acting career TODAY. Let me show you some things I've learned!\nEnroll now!!",

      "description": "Understanding of the implementation of occupational health, safety and environmental legislation in the workplace.\nAt its core, the Act requires employers to maintain a safe work environment, free from risks to health or safety, as far as reasonably practicable.\nHealth & Safety is a shared responsibility. Employers and employees must work together to identify dangers and find solutions. Regular workplace inspections, often carried out by health and safety representatives, play a vital role in ensuring compliance.\nFar too many people think complying with the OHS Act is enough. But that’s not the full picture. The Act is just the foundation—a starting point for Health & Safety in South Africa.\nDuring this course, we’ll uncover the key objectives of the Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) Act and introduce you to the five key components of South Africa’s Health & Safety legislative framework.\nYes, you heard that right—there’s much more to Health & Safety legislation in South Africa than just the OHS Act. Understanding this broader framework is essential for full compliance and avoiding surprises like “new rules” you didn’t know about.\nIf this sounds overwhelming, don’t worry! We’re in this together, and by the end of this course, you’ll have a clearer, more confident understanding of what South African Health & Safety legislation really entails.",

Maybe you saw a movie or TV show which featured a genius card counter, maybe you heard about the MIT team or any other college teams who feature the best and brightest sticking it to the house.\nYou may even want to be them.\nBut to you, like me, card counting may have seemed out of reach. So many of us are not mathematical geniuses or even mathematically inclined. We may not have stacks of thousands per hand we'd be willing to lose or have a team of players to help us spot the good tables.\nWhat I'm about to say may seem hard to believe, but you need NONE of the above to learn to count cards and make money.\nI started out myself as an ADD arts major, better with words than with numbers and that's an understatement (I could barely count down the register at the gas station where I worked!) I was absolutely shocked at how easy it was to learn this lucrative skill and since then I've played all over the US for big bucks and even trained and managed a team of my own. I finally decided it was time to take these advantage player skills I was teaching people 1-on-1 and share them with the world.\nThis course will take you from being just another chump gambler, to beating casinos at their own game! I will admit, this isn't for everyone. Not everyone can handle practicing for a few minutes per day to build these skills, not everyone can handle the pressure of putting money out on the table even with an edge, and not everyone can maintain calm, cool, and collected while taking their big paydays. Like I said, counting cards isn't for everyone, but EVERYONE can learn, and with this course you'll get the fast-track to success that I've developed over several years of research and experience to build my own blackjack career.",

It also involves understanding the link between key relationships and success. Among other things, that includes building your support team and managing negative people. Finally, you have to set your sights on long-term success, which will involve understanding sacrifice, resilience, and knowing how to adjust and adapt.\n\n\nIn this course, I’ll teach you the basics that always provide the essential foundation of success. It’s not just about defining success and writing a plan. We’ll dive deeper and talk about the habits that support your success daily. I’ll be frank when I share the importance of changing how you interact with certain negative people who harm your productivity.\n\n\nStudents will learn:\n\n\nWhat it means to define success as a goal\nHow to shape a mindset to help you win\nThe steps you take to plan for success\nIdentifying and building success habits\nAssembling a support team\nHow to protect your productivity\nManaging negative people\nBuilding staying power through resilience\n\n\nPlease note: I am a world-class leadership and success expert who wants to get you moving forward quickly. Success is knowing the small number of things that, if done correctly, really drive your growth. That’s why there is no wasted time or excess hours included in any of my courses. I strictly focus on the essentials and how to act on them immediately.\n\n\nMy courses are different for a few very specific reasons. I hold a world-class Ph.D. in Organizational Behavior. I am a former award-winning professor who taught MBA students for over a decade. My clients include Google, IBM, ExxonMobil, Kraft Heinz, and hundreds more. I’ve delivered several TEDx talks and have created many online courses enjoyed by millions of learners at the world’s top companies and universities. I combine elite expertise, with a professional speaker’s ability to communicate, and a highly practical approach that makes learning actionable.\n\n\nSpeaking of action, I always include a few useful activities to make the learning come to life. This course contains three (addressing how to plan to win, how to establish success habits, and how to correct and adapt when needed). When you start to apply what we’ll talk about – that’s when learning sticks.\n\n\nWhen you take this course I will expand your knowledge, help you feel more motivated, and make you ready to move yourself and your career forward.",

      "description": "From a young age, we are taught to think in a linear fashion. We are taught to measure time by the 24-hour cycle and by the passage of the various months. If time is linear, then why are the financial markets so volatile. Why do the markets unexpectedly soar higher or plunge lower? Is there another way of measuring time?\nIn fact, linear measures of time do not apply to the markets. What the vast majority of traders and investors do not know is there is an overwhelming correlation between the ever-changing configurations of orbiting planets and price movements on financial markets. Is this purely a scientific connection? Or, are powerful money managers in financial centers like London and New York moving prices of equities and commodity futures in accordance with astrological cycles? Whatever the case may be, traders and investors ought to be aware of the connection between astrology and the markets.\nThe connection between astrology and the markets is not a new one. In the early 1900s, successful traders like W.D. Gann, J.P. Morgan, and the mysterious Louise McWhirter recognized this connection. They used their knowledge of astrology to profit from the markets at key astrological occurrences. Knowledge of the connection between astrology and the markets was swept aside starting in the 1940s. Academic thinkers introduced concepts like the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Before long, people were told that investing was passive and for the long term.\nThis UDEMY Course aims to revive the knowledge of the astrology-financial market connection.\nThis Course introduces the student to the basic concepts of astrology. This curriculum then goes on to show by practical examples how astrology can be used as a tool to help people make trading and investing decisions on the financial markets.\nCompletion of this Course will most certainly assist the student in taking their trading and investing to a much deeper level.",

This includes things like understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, solving problems, and even learning from experience.\nIn simple terms, AI enables software like ChatGPT to understand your questions, provide helpful answers, and even assist with writing, summarizing, translating, and more—just like a human assistant would, but faster and available 24/7.\nQ: What is Generative AI?\nA:\nGenerative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content—like text, images, music, or code—based on the information it’s been trained on. Unlike traditional AI, which mainly analyzes data or makes predictions, generative AI produces original results.\nFor example, tools like ChatGPT can write emails, summarize articles, or brainstorm ideas. Other generative AI tools can create images, videos, or even music. It’s called \"generative\" because it generates something new—often with human-like creativity and language fluency.\nQ: What is ChatGPT?\nA:\nChatGPT is an advanced AI chatbot developed by OpenAI that can understand and generate human-like text. You can ask it questions, give it instructions, or start a conversation—and it will respond in a natural and helpful way.\nPeople use ChatGPT for a wide range of tasks, such as writing emails, summarizing content, brainstorming ideas, translating languages, generating code, and more. It’s designed to be easy to use, even if you have no technical background—just type in a prompt, and it responds instantly.\nQ: Why is learning ChatGPT important?\nA:\nLearning how to use ChatGPT is important because it can save you time, boost your productivity, and help you work smarter in both your personal and professional life. As AI becomes more integrated into everyday tools and workplaces, those who know how to use it effectively will have a clear advantage.\nWith ChatGPT, you can:\nWrite faster and more clearly\nSummarize long content in seconds\nBrainstorm ideas and solve problems creatively\nAutomate repetitive tasks\nGet instant help with writing, research, coding, and more\nWhether you're a student, professional, entrepreneur, or just curious, learning ChatGPT gives you a powerful skill that’s useful right now—and increasingly essential for the future.",

When i became a taxi driver in 2016, i noticed that there was not a single book, a manual or training that would teach drivers how to run a business. I had to teach myself to be a successful livery driver so i could hire others and let them do my job at a scale while i would be a manager of the entire system. 3 years later, made my first million dollars by having other drivers work for me, i had launched a multi State company and joined the Medicaid Transportation Program, which boosted by income by 20.\nTil this date, there is still no manual, no training and no tutorials that would teach transportation drivers how to run and scale their business, which made me launch this course.\nWithin 7 days, my students are able to learn the other side of the business of driving. They can register their LLC or corporation in 1 (one) day, get the hidden deals on acquiring a vehicle with no money down, no credit, reference or income checks, register a company and begin operating their business within a week. They can build, manage and advertise their online business and be making more money within 7 days.\nAt the end of this class, a student will have watched us register a company live during class and get a DOS id, build a live website and add a live booking engine to it, then advertise that website to the world.\nGood luck to all.",

      "description": "This highly focused course will will help you to make good choices in terms of which funders you are targeting. It will cover the common parts of a grant application and give you an easy to follow framework and formula for what should be included in them.\nMost importantly, it will teach you how to get the funding panel on your side from the outset.\nA unique aspect of this course is you will learn about how to write a effective grant from an instructor (Professor James Smith) who actually Chairs a number of funding panels and who is actually responsible for making grant funding decisions\nYour instructor, Professor James Smith, PhD, is an established and popular instructor on the Udemy platform. Feedback that he has received from Udemy students includes;\n\"Very easy to understand and the instructor spoke slowly enough that I could let the information sink in\" - KW\n\"Very informative and thorough. Getting ready to take the next course. The assignments with the instructor's example following were very helpful\" - KR\n\"Very helpful information from a well-qualified Professor. Concisely presented in a format that facilitates easy notetaking\" -  BDP\nThis course is ideal for you if;\nYou want to learn how to write successful grants and are at the first step in your grant writing journey\nYou are an academic or Lecturer or Assistant Professor who wants to secure grant funding but are just starting out\nYou are grant writing for a 501.C3, a non-profit or a small/medium sized enterprise\nYou want to learn about what a grant funder and decision panel is looking for in different grant sections, and how to construct a grant that aligns to this\nIn this course you will develop an understanding of how to approach and write a successful grant application. It will also cover how to tailor your grant application to a specific funder in order to increase your chances of success. Most importantly, we will cover how to approach the different sections of a grant application because I recognise that starting a grant application can be difficult, and having to complete all of the different sections of a grant application can be quite intimidating at first.\nHow will we do this? This course is split into three modules, with each module containing an individual assignment for you to complete.\nModule 1\nThe first module is called making good choices and it’s really about the research that you undertake and the decisions that you make before you even put pen to paper, or fingers to keyboard in terms of deciding which funder you will actually target. We will learn about understanding the strategic priorities of funders. And we’ll talk about why choosing the right funder is one of the most important choices you can make since it will play a significant role in the outcome of your application – if you pick the wrong funder or the wrong funding stream, then your chances of success will not be very high.\nIn this module you will also learn how to use real world data to not only shape your choices of what you will be applying for, but also how the funder will view your application. Finally this module will also cover generating and measuring impact.\nModule 2\nIn module 2, We will actually deal with the process of writing the foundations of a grant and I will teach you how to tackle each individual component of a grant application. I will use a generic set of headings that you will find in most grant applications.\nWe will look at the abstract or summary section as it’s sometimes called, which is actually one of the shortest, but also the most visible or heavily scrutinised parts of a grant application.\nWe will then move on to the background or introduction section which is typically where a literature review is presented that gives the background or the rationale for the work that you are proposing to do if the money was awarded. We will also specifically cover the aims section which is another critically important section of your grant application.\nWe will talk about the methods or approach section of a grant, which is actually meant to describe how the work will actually be performed, and I’ll then take you through the process of setting SMART objectives. These are objectives which are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-Limited.\nFinally we will talk about how to pull together and present an effective team with clearly defined roles in your application, so that the funder will be able to tell who exactly is doing what piece of work and what they will be bringing to the project.\nModule 3\nIn module 3, we are going to talk about how to get the funding panel and the reviewers on your side. These are the people who make the decision in terms of whether your grant actually gets funded and so it’s really important that you tailor your grant application so that you are speaking to these people directly. Now getting the funding panel on your side can be accomplished in a number of ways and we are going to talk about some of the most effective ways to do this.\nYou will learn about how to write a lay summary which is sometimes called the plain English summary, and why it can be so important to your application. We will also talk about word limits and how to use them effectively. Finally we will talk about the type of language that you use to communicate with the funder, and when and where it is appropriate to use technical or scientific language in your application, when it is important to use emotional language, and where some of the pitfalls can occur when using overly complicated language.",

Without buy-in, the same decisions will be made as have always been made and the organisation will stick to business as usual.\nUnfortunately most employee engagement fails miserably. This is because it is created by Sustainability professionals without any consideration of the interests of key audiences, and simply passes them by.\nThis course introduces the unique, battle-proven concept of Green Jujitsu. In the same way a jujitsu master adjusts their techniques to exploit the strengths of their opponent, in Green Jujitsu we find the overlap between the interests of our audience and Sustainability and start our engagement there.\nDuring the course we will cover how to identify the existing culture in the organisation and how to use that culture to engage colleagues from the front-line to the boardroom. You will get a workbook to help you apply the thinking to your own organisation at each step, reinforcing the learning and compiling an action plan for you to take away and use.\nIf you are serious about making Sustainability happen in your organisation (or a client's) then you must take this course.",

I had a choice: I could either continue to charge standard hourly rates and work full-time hours or I could specialize in an in-demand skill and make more money than I ever imagined.\nChoosing a high-paying skill changed my business. Today, I offer my clients specialty skills like conference curation and event production.

Finish your Udemy course and Contact us to get your Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Certificate!\n\n\nWhy Membership Sites Are Perfect For Passive Income?\n\nIf you’re interested in making money online, then it’s probably because you like the idea of having more freedom to live and work wherever and however you want. The benefits of working online are many and varied and extend into every aspect of your life.\nBut in order for you to make the very most from this way of working, you also need to make sure you choose the perfect business model. Working online on its own does not necessarily equate to an ideal lifestyle; rather the benefits come when you work online in the right way. And let me tell you: creating a membership site is definitely the right way.\nWorking online is easy. If you are in a job that’s fairly flexible, then you should be able to ask your employer if you can work from home and simply log into the company’s network whenever you start working. And sure, this will bring some benefits: you’ll be able to stay in bed longer and stop commuting and you’ll have the luxury of being able to drink tea, listen to music and generally create a comfortable environment.\n\n\nBut you’re still ultimately a slave to your job. You’re still trading ‘time for hours’ and you’ll still need to be available for the hours between 9am-5pm.\n\n\nYou’ll probably also need to be near the phone and you’ll be expected to output a certain amount of work every day. That means you probably can’t leave the house and work outdoors in case you lose your internet connection. And it means you can decide to stop working for the day and visit a friend instead. Worst of all, you can still be ‘told off’ by your boss – reprimanded like a child!\n\n\nThe same goes for creating your own online business. If you’re a web designer for example, then you have the freedom to decide when you work on projects. But you probably still have deadlines and to all extents and purposes, your clients are your bosses. If you fail to complete\nThis is why so many people find the idea of blogging desirable. All you have to do is to create and manage a website that you hopefully find fascinating and really enjoy writing about. You’ll get to experience a lot of the satisfaction that comes from running your own business. And you get passive income, meaning that you’ll earn money while you sleep. But even this isn’t perfect. Because one day, you might earn $200 and the next day you might earn $10.\nIt only takes a change to Google’s search algorithm and you can lose all of your progress. What’s more, is that it takes actually a huge amount of time to build up the amount of traffic that you need to make a big profit from a blog. This is especially true if you are planning to use pay-per-click advertising but it’s equally the case if you are selling your own product.\nThink about it: how often do you click ads on other websites? This is why it typically takes 1K visitors for you to generate just one or two clicks and the same goes for sales of products. It’s a huge amount of work before you start earning anything and there’s no guarantee it will ever get to the point where it can provide a livable salary.\n\n\nEnter: Recurring, Passive Income\nThis is where membership site come in and offer an incredibly appealing alternative. Essentially, a membership website is a site that users pay to subscribe to. This normally works by first enticing the reader with some free content and showing them the kind of entertainment/information/value that you’re capable of providing. Once they’re hooked, you then make sure they know that they need to subscribe in order to gain access to your very best content and to get frequently updated.\n\n\nSo what’s so different about this? Well for starters, it means that you can much more easily convert visitors to paying customers seeing as they’re not having to put down a large amount of money and seeing as they know what they’re getting right away.\n\n\nMore importantly, though, it means that the money is recurring and much more predictable. Unlike a regular blog that can very much fluctuate, having subscribers means you probably have some kind of agreement or standing order set up. This means that you can practically guarantee that you’ll be able to earn a set amount of money each week, month or quarter.\n\n\nAnd that very quickly starts to add up…\nSo say you currently have people subscribing for $5 membership a month. If your content is good, then you could realistically convince one in every 1-10,000 people to sign up. But it’s very possible the very first person who visits might sign up! There’s an element of luck but as soon as you get that first membership you’re in business – and $5 membership a month quickly adds up to $60 a year.\n\n\nEventually, you can work whenever you like and add as much content as you like (we’ll look at how later on) and still know for sure that you’ll be able to earn X amount of money per month and per year. This is very much living the dream – all the freedom of passive incomes but with all the security of a well-paid job!\nCan people unsubscribe? Sure they can! But the likelihood of everyone unsubscribing all at once is incredibly slim and in most cases you’ll have more new visitors signing up than old visitors leaving.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nThis course is going to explain in great detail exactly how you go about creating your own membership website.\nWe’ll see how to build a membership website, how to make sure that people want to subscribe, how to implement a recurring fee and how to thrive in this market space.\nWhat we’ll also see is that there are multiple membership business models that can work online when you know how.\nWe’ll look at a selection so that you can decide on the perfect type of membership site/content for you.\nUltimately, we’re going to give you the tools to take the subjects that you love and then turn them into a stable source of income that will pay out even while you’re sleeping.\nSpecifically, you will learn:\n How to create a membership website or blog\n How to turn your site into a membership site\n How to make content that will make people want to subscribe\n How to promote your membership  site\n How to price your membership site\n How to add extra monetization to your offering\n How to create a membership app\n How to create membership video\n The importance of building a community\n How to use quizzes and other forms of media\n What you can learn from the best membership sites\n The strategies and tools you can learn to succeed even beyond those…\n And much more!\nKindly note that this is a 100% informational guide, there are no “On-Screen how to steps”.",

It is designed for people who edit written material, either on a freelance or full-time basis. I have worked as a copy editor for more than twenty years and have completed nearly 200 book-length projects. In the process, I’ve made a lot of mistakes, tried a lot of tools, and developed a workflow that is effective, and I’d like to pass along to you some of what I’ve learned. Note, however, that the course does NOT teach you how to become a copy editor or provide information about the mechanics of editing. Instead, this course focuses on how to use available tools to do your job more effectively. While I usually work on a Mac, I’ve done my best throughout to describe comparable software on both Mac and Windows platforms. In some cases, the tools are only available on one platform, as is the case, for instance, with some of the Word add-ons, which are only available for PC. The course is divided into five units. The first looks at tips and tricks for improving your workflow in Microsoft Word. The second emphasizes strategies for improving the quality and efficiency of your editing, highlighting some software packages and other tools. The third focuses on time tracking, creating focus, and increasing productivity. The fourth identifies various tools for working with files. And the final unit looks at a variety of online resources that are available and some tricks for accessing them more quickly. Thanks for joining me; I look forward to working with you in the coming days!",

As someone who has dabbled in many areas for side income and passive income, I can safely say that Course Selling is easily one of the most profitable side incomes that I have.\nMore importantly its almost entirely about front loading. As long as you have the discipline to sit down one weekend and produce a course, it is most likely going to benefit you in the long run.\nNow making a course to sell isn't easy, and so I'm going to share with you the exact blueprint that I have used in order to sell many of my courses so well. And how I am able to make 8 different courses so far, even though I have another full time job whilst also having other side incomes that I manage.\nNow many instructors have been struggling to make consistent profits and whilst I am certainly no celebrity instructor, I have however been successful enough to help you make consistent profits from your courses.\nMy sales have increase tremendously since I started and I have felt that maybe its time I tried to help others achieve the same results that I have.\nOnce you start making your own courses and making revenue from it, its a highly rewarding experience that is very likely to keep you hooked. So hesitate no more, Enroll and I'll see you inside the course.\nthe initial free price will increase shortly, and i'll slowly be increasing the price\nyou have unlimited lifetime access at no extra costs, ever\nall future additional lectures, bonuses, etc in this course are always free\nthere's an unconditional, never any questions asked full 30 day money-back-in-full guarantee\nmy help is always available to you if you get stuck or have a question - my support is legendary in Udemy",

      "description": "Once you decide to start working as a Virtual Assistant, you face your real big challenge: Finding your first client(s).\nThis course will help you explore your ideal client, discover their challenges, where they \"hang out\" online, and how you can land your dream clients through a variety of tried and true methods.\n\n\n*This course is comprised of some videos with my face, some presentation slides, downloadable resources, external articles (to showcase real-world examples of some of the content), and written content.*\n\n\nModule 1: Define your ideal client.\nIn this module, you'll create a client avatar and brainstorm your dream client's demographic and psychographic traits. This will help you understand who may make a great longterm client; one you love working with and one who loves working with you.\nWe'll also explore where your dream clients hang out online and (once we find them) how to extrapolate their challenges. Understanding their unique challenges will help you tailor your pitch.\n\n\nModule 2: Define your SOPs\nIn this module, we'll write out your \"SOPs,\" or Standard Operating Procedures. It's a great opportunity to shape how you want to run your business, when and how often you work, how often you get paid, etc. It's also a crucial step to take before you can pitch clients.\nRelatedly, we'll also take some time to explore your \"why.\" Exploring your purpose, your passion, or your reason for working as a VA is a great way to use it as a lens for finding future clients. If they don't align with your \"why,\" they might not be a great fit for you.\n\n\nModule 3: Rehearsing your elevator pitch.\nNow that you know who you want to target, what challenges they face, and how they align with your vision of your business, we can use your brainstorm pieces to put together your elevator pitch.\nWe'll cover a pitch formula to help, and from there, you'll craft the perfect pitch. We'll also practice pitch delivery! Because you could be the most capable VA in town, but if you don't have your pitch down, you risk losing the sale.\n\n\nModule 4: The clients\nIt's time to get you some clients! In the last module, we'll discuss 4 methods for putting your pitch to good use. Learn the best ways to pitch, the best way to ask for referrals, and how to turn those recommendations into real clients (and more income).\n\n\nBONUS FEATURE\nI've included a BONUS 15-minute \"mini course\" that will help you craft the perfect LinkedIn headline. Having a great headline that's SEO rich will help you attract your dream clients on the platform. Having this in place after you've perfected your pitch is a great way to land clients on a new platform.\n\n\nABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR:\nHi! I'm Erin Booth, and I help experienced Virtual Assistants, like you, find your niche and grow your business.\nWith over a decade of experience doing high-end travel, social media marketing, calendar management, qualitative research, conference curation and event production, I feel like I've done it all.\nNow, as your Virtual Assistant Mentor, I get to share all of my best tips and tools with you.\nJoin over 22,000 happy students on Udemy!\n\n\nSee you in the course!",

You don't even need to watch the match, just collect your profit!\n\nThis course features four sections that cover everything you need to know to become successful with online betting using arbitrage and make easy money:\nThe first section will cover the basic concepts you need to get acquainted with surebets.\nThe second section will introduce the different types of bets and teach you how to calculate the bets you should make to guarantee the profit.

It will cover the advanced techniques of how a professional grant writer approaches different sections of a grant application, including project management and risk mitigation. Importantly it gives you best practice and the advantages/disadvantages of different approaches.\nMost importantly, it will teach you how to address the most challenging elements of crafting your funding proposal and techniques to ensure it is highly competitive, and aligns to the criteria that your application will be judged against.\nA unique aspect of this course is you will learn about how to write an effective grant application from an instructor (Professor James Smith) who actually Chairs a number of funding panels and who is actually responsible for making grant funding decisions\nYour instructor, Professor James Smith, PhD, is an established and popular instructor on the Udemy platform. Feedback that he has received from Udemy students includes;\n\"Very easy to understand and the instructor spoke slowly enough that I could let the information sink in\" - KW\n\"Very informative and thorough. Getting ready to take the next course. The assignments with the instructor's example following were very helpful\" - KR\n\"Very helpful information from a well-qualified Professor. Concisely presented in a format that facilitates easy notetaking\" -  BDP\nThis course is ideal for you if;\nYou want to learn how to write successful grants using advanced techniques to enhance success\nYou are an academic or Lecturer or Assistant Professor who wants to secure grant funding\nYou are grant writing for a 501.C3, a non-profit or a small/medium sized enterprise\nYou want to craft a grant proposal that is difficult for the funder to reject\nYou are undertaking fundraising and want to target your effort effectively and professionally\nIn this course you will develop an advanced understanding of how to approach and write a professional grant application. It will also cover how to communicate advanced project management techniques to the funding panel. Most importantly, we will cover how to approach the most challenging questions that you are asked to address in a grant application.  It will also cover critical targets and opportunities you can take advantage of for getting your grant over the line and funded such as resubmissions, letters of support and risk mitigation.\nHow will we do this? This course is split into three modules, with each module containing an individual assignment for you to complete.\nModule 1\nThe first module is called Advanced Project Management and it covers how the decisions you make at the application stage can influence how the funder views your project and ultimately how the project is run.  The funder will assess your application against a number of criteria including feasibility, and this section covers areas including timelines, mapping deliverables and grant objectives, writing a dissemination and communications plan, as well as establishing an independent advisory board (IAB) and evaluating progress of the project.\nThese are all areas where the funder will be assessing how you will approach managing your grant, and will be seeking to understand whether you are capable of effectively running a project to conclusion.  Be reassured that this module is targeted towards ensuring the funder gives you an excellent review in this respect.\nModule 2\nIn module 2, we will actually deal with how to address some of the most difficult questions and assessment criteria that you will face during the grant application process.  These include;\n- Is your proposal competitive?\n- Is your proposal novel?\n- Are you the best person to receive funding?\n- How will you support the development of your team?\n- Is it critical that this project is funded?\nYou will note that these questions align directly to the criteria that you are being assessed against, so having a full understanding of how to approach them is extremely important.  You will learn how to approach answering these questions in the same manner as a Grant Writing Professional, and your proposal will demonstrate a full consideration of all of these.  The outcome is that your proposal will be elevated from \"good\" to \"outstanding\" in the eyes of the funding panel\nModule 3\nIn module 3, called \"The Secret Sauce For Getting Your Grant Funded\", we cover the the lesser known elements of grant writing, how you can effectively describe the beneficiaries of your grant proposal, how to approach a \"reject & resubmission\" decision, as well as identifying project risks & mitigation strategies and why you should obtain appropriate letters of support.\n\n\nIn summary, this course contains accessible and comprehensive classes which will train you in many of the techniques that professional grant writers use when crafting grant applications.",

      "description": "Volunteer Retention is perhaps the most important element of any volunteer program. However, it is often overlooked and almost always underinvested in. For volunteers to stay with your organisation over time, or to keep returning to your organisation over their lifetime, they need to feel appreciated and useful, they need to feel like they are having an impact and making a difference.\nIn many organisations volunteers are the quiet, behind the curtain machine that keeps everything going. This often means that employees, CEOs, service users and even volunteers themselves don't know or appreciate how much they are doing, how much time they spend doing it, why their time is valuable and what impact they are having.\nWhen your volunteer retention addresses all of these things you will power up your volunteer force and create an appreciative environment where they are seen and valued and where everyone knows exactly how important they are; and this will result in an enthusiastic volunteer force that always advocates for and chooses your organisation.\n\n\nIn this course on Volunteer Retention we will consider:\nWhy retention should play a major role in your volunteer program\nWhat elements you need to include to build and effective volunteer retention system\nHow to make retention simple and easy\nAnd when and where to implement retention to make sure your volunteers are happy, satisfied in their roles and will stay with your organisation for a long time.",

Actually, this course is a continuation of our first course, the workover introduction course, so it is advanced in comparison to the first one. I created this course to show what I have experienced in the fields supervising different types of jobs.\nThis course is great if you want to keep up to speed with the other workers who have already started working in the field prior to you joining.\nThe oil and gas industry has an enormous impact on all aspects of daily life. A workover is any operation done on, within, or through the wellbore after the initial completion. Although proper drilling, cementing, and completion practices minimize the need, virtually every well will need several workovers during its lifetime to satisfactorily fulfill its purpose.\nThis course looks at the workover operations that are done because the well is not performing up to expectations. In addition, it sheds the lights on the equipment used while performing the workover operations. Main concepts of this course will be delivered through lectures, and readings. After every lesson, learners will take short quizzes to test their newly acquired knowledge. After completing this course, you are supposed to have a good knowledge about several Workover operations.\nPlease if you have any feedback regarding the course, do not hesitate to leave your comment in the review sections.",

I was a college professor, but at 47 years of age, I opted for voluntary retirement, and became a full time trader. I do teach trading to those genuinely interested. My students asked me, how can I pick the correct stocks for trading. So, in order to teach that to them, I have created this course.\nIn this course, I will give you a step by step account of creating your stock screener. Using this, you can create a screener in Google sheets, which fetches the data from Google Finance, and converts it in the required format, in order to short list the stocks, which are likely to go up or down within the day. In short, this becomes your automatic advisory, and there is no recurring cost to it. Also, there is no human sentiment, making it a great screener.\nFor creation of this screener, even if you just know how to use a computer and a mouse, it is enough. Everything else is given in a pictural form for easy understanding. So, no knowledge of coding etc. required. Creating this screener should not take more than a few minutes, and after that you have a life-long tool at your service, free of any additional charges.\nThe data is received automatically from Google and incorporated in this screener. You do not have to keep refreshing it regularly. Moreover, once created, you can use your mobile phone for tracking the prices on this screener. There is no necessity to log in to your computer every time. Isn’t that a great feature?\nSo, what are you waiting for? Just join the course and open the doors of a fantastic career for you, which you can pursue from anywhere, without going to your office, working under someone else.",

An understanding of the insuring agreements and some of the terms and conditions in a policy.\nThis course includes a downloadable Buyer's Guide, including a Buyer's worksheet, which can be used when meeting with an EPLI insurance specialist to review your policy or buy a new one.\nInsurance is an integral part of every organization's management toolbox.

      "description": "Linear regression is one of the most widely used models in the data industry—but also one of the most misunderstood when it comes to Causal Inference.\nToo often, its coefficients are wrongly interpreted as causal effects. Traditional assumptions like exogeneity are often emphasized, yet their true meaning is rarely understood. Many can recite the classic OLS assumptions under which coefficients are \"unbiased,\" but struggle to articulate what they are actually unbiased for.\nAnd this isn’t surprising. Educational sources on Linear Regression are extremely vague, ambiguous and often even contradictory when it comes to Causal Inference.\nIn this 2-part course series, we fill that gap using a fresh and modern approach. You’ll learn exactly how and when Linear Regression coefficients reflect causal effects.\nThis first part starts by discussing the foundational concepts from Causal Inference that you’ll need to understand to follow the remainder of the course.\nIn the second module, we’ll go deep into the mechanics of Linear Regression, with an emphasis on how Linear Regression coefficients are computed using Ordinary Least Squares.\nIn module 3, we introduce Linear Structural Causal models, where you’ll learn that the parameters in these equations are the ones we are actually interested in when estimating causal effects using Linear Regression. We then discuss the exact conditions under which Linear Regression coefficients succeed in recovering these true causal parameters\nFinally, in module 4, we explore how well-designed Robustness Tests and Sensitivity Analysis can help you build trust in your causal analysis results and better defend your conclusions.\nAlong the way, we’ll clarify some of the most common misconceptions about the causal interpretation of Linear Regression coefficients.\nEverything in this course is based on high-quality sources in Causal Inference, including the work of leading researchers like Angrist & Pischke, Carlos Cinelli, Chad Hazlett, and Judea Pearl.\nBut beyond its strong theoretical foundation, this course is built for real-world application. To reinforce your understanding, we’ll work through numerous coding examples, and each module includes a coding exercise to help you practice with the discussed techniques.\nThis course is for anyone with a basic understanding of Probability Theory, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. Familiarity with programming is helpful, as coding examples and exercises will be in Python.\nSo, if you want to stand out and truly understand how to use Linear Regression for Causal Inference correctly, this course is for you!",

From debt collectors to private investigators to judgment holders and more, learn the tricks of the trade to conduct a bank locate investigation. A few years ago I didn't know much in regards to conducting bank locates. I called in a bunch of favors and was met with silence. I learned that many professionals were subbing out the bank locate work and didn't actually know how to perform the investigation themselves. Through hours of reading and over a thousand dollars in trial and error, I finally was able to develop a successful system. I'm going to save you that time and money and condense it all into a 3 hour course for $199, less than the cost of most bank locates.\n\nThis course will combine on screen tutorials with several lectures to teach you how to conduct a bank locate investigation. We're going to talk about traditional and non-tradition methods to find where someone banks. Learn to search Facebook efficiently for this information and take a deep dive into publicly available bankruptcy reports to see not just the banking information, but data points that you may not have thought to check out. You'll be shown how to search a credit report for banking information and how to validate that information. Learn how to conduct a non GLB violation call to local banks to determine if an individual banks with them.\n\nThis course is currently accredited for PI's in the state of Oklahoma and Tennessee for 3 CE hours.\n\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.",

      "description": "This is a densely packed, short course with 59 minutes of narrated video animation spanning 8 lectures, introducing you to tendering in the public sector, full of information, guidance and tips on how tenders work and what to do when preparing your tender bids.\nThe tendering process in the UK public sector can be a bureaucratic minefield with each public sector body (local council, NHS trust, university etc) having its own set of rules and procedures. However, there are some general, governing principles that apply to all competitive tenders.\nCompetition can be fierce as public bodies spend a lot of money outsourcing contracts to businesses, and everyone wants a piece of the pie. Many larger organisations have bid writing teams to compete for these contracts. However, tender writing is an art. It is a skill and it can be learned! You don't need a bid writing team to win a tender. Don’t be intimidated by the bureaucracy and process because in the end it all comes down to knowing your business and knowing what your buyer wants.\nThis course will cover the basics. It will introduce you to key concepts like:\nwhat is a tender\nopen (1 stage) vs restricted (2 stage tendering procedures)\nselection questionnaires (SQs)\nOJEU thresholds\nthe general structure of most tenders\nhow are tenders evaluated\nscoring mechanisms used in tenders\nwhat quality questions will be asked and how to approach them\nhow does the pricing work in tendering\nYou will get lifetime access to the course, all of it's content and resources.\nThis course comes with a 30 day money back guarantee! If you are not satisfied in any way, you'll get your money back.\nAre there any course requirements or prerequisites?\nAccess to a computer with an internet connection\nComputer literacy\nProficiency in English\nWho this course is for:\nBeginners who have never bid for tenders before\nBid writers, managers or business owners who have struggled to break into the public sector market\nExperienced bid writers who want to check their understanding of the UK Public Sector procurement process\nPeople looking to work in public sector procurement",

      "description": "This is the second DISC Certification Course out of three that we have on Udemy. While the course can standalone - it is meant to be completed after taking our DISC Coaching Certification - Level 1 Course.\n\n\nWe believe this course might be our most valuable because it really helps you as the coach understand - \"Now what?\".  If you are coaching someone or running a workshop and you assess them they may ask \"Now what?\". How can you practically use the tool? We have found that this course answers that.\n\n\nThis course dives into DISC Sub-factors and 3rd party feedback. They are critical for a coach's knowledge base due to the following reasons:\n\n\nEnhanced Understanding of Behavior: DISC is widely used in executive and life coaching to assess behavioral tendencies. However most DISC assessments do not cover DISC Sub-factors at all. This is one of the richest coaching areas in terms of impact and profitability. Conversations about DISC Sub-factors set professional coaches apart. This knowledge is a bankable asset! By delving into the 12 DISC Sub-factors, coaches gain a deeper understanding of their clients' unique behavioral preferences and tendencies, strengths, weakness, motivators and challenges, and areas for development. They are coached to DIAL UP or DIAL DOWN (modulate) their factors enabling coaching at the granular level whereby targeted suggestions, interventions and practices are implemented.\nContextual Awareness: Incorporating 3rd party inputs from colleagues and coworkers, friends, and/or family adds an external perspective that, without DISCflex, would never be possible. The goal of coaching is to see change – this mechanism provides verification that the coaching engagement is having the desired effects from an irrefutable fully-validated data-driven analytical standpoint. These inputs provide valuable context and insights into the client's professional environment, work dynamics, and interpersonal relationships. This information helps coaches gain a broader understanding of their clients' challenges, strengths, and areas of improvement within their specific organizational context.\n\n\nPlease note - if you complete both DISC Coaching Certification Level 1 and Level 2 with us - you will earn 50% off purchasing any of our DISCflex assessments in the future. Go to our DISCflex website to learn more. We also have partnership levels bundling assessments, our DISCflex AI Assistant Tool, and further discounts as our goal is to help you succeed. We can help you if you are new to DISC and have never assessed a team or run a workshop. We can also support you if you are a veteran who is looking to build upon taking their practice to the next level.\n\n\n*PS - if you have not taken an online DISCflex assessment as part of your Level 1 Certification we will provide you with our DISCflex Business Behaviors Assessment and Report ($80 USD Value).",

        "Even thought you might not have taken Level 1 Certification yet, this course can stand alone. If you are familiar with DISC models, this is HIGHLY VALUABLE because it covers Sub-Factors and 3rd Party Inputs which are typically not taught other than through DISC Certifications."

Most entrepreneurs focus on money too quickly. But startups must focus on growth, which is why identifying the most important growth and engagement metrics is the most important part of starting an innovative new company.\nWhen you are working on a true innovation, many aspects of your product business are unknown. That's why it's an innovation. If it was a common business that has been done many times before, your KPIs would be known. But since your startup is building something new, you have to identify the right things to focus on in order to grow the most vital parts of your startup.\nHOW THIS COURSE WILL HELP YOU PERFECT YOUR INNOVATION OR TECHNOLOGY\nAny technology from something simple like a hammer to something complicated like spaceships or computers undergo a series of improvements over time until they get to a desired level of use and quality. No innovation is ideal on its first version so the goal of startup entrepreneurs is to create enough iterations of improvement quickly in order to perfect their product.\nThe strategy of this course is to show you how to choose the right things to improve so every one of your improvement iterations makes an impact and helps you grow your startup. The way to choose which features of your startup or innovation to improve is to look at use data, analytics, and identify the right KPIs in order to improve the aspects of your startup that are most vital.\nThe flip side of this is that if you choose the wrong features to improve, it won't make an impact and your innovation or startup won't grow. This course will help you succeed by using time-proven, best strategies to help you grow your startup and improve your product or innovation.\nTHE COURSE IS CONStANtLY UPDATED\nI keep thinking about how to make this course on growing start-ups better and better. Usually, every few months, I make an update to the course, and improve some part of it. You can expect that to continue moving forward. If you come back to this course every year, you can expect to see a number of improvements.\nALL TOOLS SHOWN IN THE COURSE ARE FREE\nAll the tools in the course like Google Analytics are free and standard tools used by startups. You won't have to pay for any additional tools or software after you enroll.\nRESPONSIVE AND CARING INSTRUCTOR: WORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT\nIf you have questions about any part of your startup, I am here to help! I answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours. Many students tell me that other instructors don't respond. Well, I do because:\n1) I care about my students.\n2) I feel a responsibility to make sure that students get their money's worth from the course.\nBONUSES INCLUDED\n* Lots of extra freebies, downloadable worksheets, and exercises to make the course more interactive and helpful to your startup\n* Personal invitation to my Facebook community after you complete the course\n* My list of 50 business-success skills when you complete the course\nInvest in yourself and your innovation!

But what exactly is it, and how does it work? This post dives into the world of AI, answering some of your most frequently asked questions.\n1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nAI is a broad term encompassing the intelligence displayed by machines, particularly computer systems. It's about creating intelligent agents that can perceive their environment, learn from data, and take actions to achieve specific goals. There are different types of AI, but most commonly we see:\nNarrow AI (Weak AI): This type excels at performing specific tasks, like playing chess or recognizing faces.\nGeneral AI (Strong AI): This hypothetical AI would possess human-level intelligence and be able to perform any intellectual task a human can.\n2. What is Generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of AI that focuses on creating new data, like text, images, or even code. It uses complex algorithms, often inspired by how the human brain works, to analyze existing data and then generate entirely new pieces of content that follow the same patterns.\nFor example, generative AI can be used to create realistic-looking images of people who don't actually exist, or to write different creative text formats, like poems or scripts.\n3. What are LLMs (Large Language Models)?\nLLMs are a type of AI model trained on massive amounts of text data. This allows them to process information and respond to questions in a way that simulates human conversation. I, for instance, am a large language model!\nLLMs are used in a variety of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and machine translation. They're constantly evolving, becoming better at understanding and responding to complex queries.\n4. What is ChatGPT and Google Gemini.\nChatGPT and Gemini are both large language models, but we're developed by different companies. ChatGPT is from OpenAI, while Gemini is a product of Google AI. They share many capabilities, like generating text, translating languages, and writing different kinds of creative content. However, they may have different strengths and weaknesses, as they are trained on different datasets and have unique underlying algorithms.",

      "description": "The Elliott Wave Principle has been used by major Institutional Traders from Paul Tudor Jones, who predicted the 1987 Stock Market crash, to George Soros, to Marty Schwartz and more recently Ramki a former analyst with Chase Manhattan now JPM.\nElliott Wave was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott who catalogued 75 years of stock market behaviour. This form of analysis plays a major role in behavioural finance today and most professional traders are required to have some knowledge on this subject. Not only will it save you a lot of losses but you will become aware when to stay out of the market and when to get in. In other words you graduate from a pig into a sheep dog, keeping the herd in line.\nI have been a professional trader for a little over a decade, I have worked with both Hedgefunds and Institutional financiers. I successfully used Elliott Wave in 2014 to predict the drop of the Australian Dollar versus the US Dollar to 68c from its highs of 81c, at the time this was almost impossible to imagine, as I also predicted the Pounds decline to 1.52 that same year from 1.7100. See the 2014 video Elliott Wave has brought me a lot of trading success and those of my clients, a great compliment to any trading idea for established traders not yet reaping the potential gains in the multi asset arena. New beginners will do well to start from here.\nThe course has been designed to be simple intuitive and easy for everyone to grasp. There are real practical working methods which also show you how you can position in relation to managing risk. If there is any other content you would like us to include, I am happy to keep updating lectures. I expect on completion you will be a very capable multi-asset trader with good risk and application concepts when trading Elliott Wave in global markets.\nWhat you will learn -\n- Learn a Macro approach to trading.\n- Learn to analyze the like path of money flow based on the market cycle\n- Know when a market is over-valued or about to be marked up\n- See the big picture that aids your smaller picture\nRemember to check the resource section for your updated Discord link if you have questions, we are always happy to support new traders.",

Or that refactoring them is going to be very difficult? Azure App Service comes to your rescue! Azure App Service is one of the easiest ways to deploy apps to the Cloud. It provides powerful capabilities such as built-in development operations, continuous integration with Visual Studio Online and GitHub, staging and production support, and automatic patching for Azure developers to quickly create web applications. It also enables integration with on-premises or other cloud systems.\nThis comprehensive 2-in-1 course is concise and appropriate to use Azure building blocks to deploy your Node .js microservice-based apps to the cloud. Initially, you’ll build a sample Node .js application for Azure Cloud. You’ll also understand Azure services such as Azure Web Apps, Azure Container Services, and Cosmos DB and highlight specifics used by Node .js applications. Moving further, you’ll explore the flexibility of Azure App Service to configure and scale up your Node .js Web App. You’ll also perform necessary tests on your refactored Node .js app and deploy it to Azure. Finally, you'll set up and secure a cloud MySQL database for your web app to manage and schedule your server tasks in the background with Azure!\nBy the end of the course, you’ll build and launch a Node .js application using Web Apps, CosmosDB, and Container Services.

Completion of the activities in the course will therefore provide evidence of suitable training.\nIf you are thinking of buying a catering business such as a pub or restaurant this course will also be of great value as it shows the steps you must take to become legally compliant. It will help you achieve an EHO rating of Five (a PASS in Scotland) and therefore help develop the reputation of your business.\n\nThrough a series of lectures, videos, quizzes and activities you will build your knowledge and expertise in food safety.\nThe core philosophies of this the course were to make it relevant, engaging and memorable and to ensure it will make a difference in the workplace.\nThe course has many tips and ideas for best practice and is uniquely structured to follow the food production process from start to finish.\nEach stage of the production process focuses on a particular subject; for example under 'delivery' near the start, we examine contamination.",

A four-time career changer, Nicolle has worn many hats: study abroad advisor, luxury travel writer, global career coach, author, public speaker/trainer, and now Generative AI Product Designer.\nWhen Nicolle started learning about AI in 2018, she had no technical background. She sat through hours of technical YouTube videos trying to make sense of engineering concepts. Eventually, she landed a role as a chatbot designer, combining her love of language with her curiosity about AI. As she continued building AI products, she noticed the lack of training to teach non-technical teams about AI.\nFrustrated by boring, overly technical AI courses, Nicolle created Boring AI (plot twist: it's not boring) to make AI literacy accessible for non-techies like her past self.\nWhy are there so many donuts?\nAI branding and visuals are dominated by the same colors and themes: dark blue and neon blue colors, robots and code for visuals. That's boring. So Nicolle took a different approach for her AI branding: bright colors and donuts, which is the opposite of how AI is portrayed normally. All of Nicolle's courses include pictures of donuts and references to donuts when demo'ing concepts. A side effect of taking Nicolle's courses is that many students are hungry for donuts afterwards.\nRecent feedback:\n\"Informative and highly motivating.\"\n\"I thought AI was just marketing hype. Now I know all the ways I can use it. Thank you!\"\n\"Very insightful session. Hopefully you'll offer similar sessions in the near future.\"\nReady to embrace your curiosity?\nInvesting in your AI literacy isn't just about keeping up – it's about getting ahead.

I was worried I would struggle to understand the content. I love that I can see what you are doing, this is a great way to learn.\" -Shirley Y\nUnlocking the Potential of ChatGPT with Prompt Engineering\nPrompt engineering involves crafting precise instructions, questions, or input prompts that guide ChatGPT's responses in the desired direction. It's the key to ensuring that the AI understands your intentions and produces relevant outputs, making your interactions more efficient and impactful.\nSome Of What You'll Learn\nWhat exactly is Prompt Engineering.\nPersona Prompts\nQuestion Refinement Pattern\nCognitive Verifier Pattern\nAudience Persona Pattern\nFlipped Interaction Pattern\nTask-Action-Object (TAO) Template\nDescription-Attribute-Object Template\nQuestion Answer Template\nDesign Template\nWriter Template\nTranslation Prompts\nHow To Template\nStep X Step Prompts\nSummarize Template\nChain Of Thought Prompts\nReAct Method\nZero Shot Prompting\nFew Shot Prompting\nMulti-Model Prompting.\nPrompts for Text-To-Image like Midjourney and Dall-E\nPrompt Engineering For Everyday Workers Use\nPrompt Engineer As A Career\nAction Steps To Take\nPlus, Much More.\nElevate Your ChatGPT And Other AI Models Like Google Bard Interactions Today!\nWhether you're a novice or an experienced AI enthusiast, the course will empower you to create more meaningful and impactful conversations with AI than ever before. Enroll now and be at the forefront of AI innovation!\nJust click the button to enroll and I look forward to seeing you in your first lesson!\n-Steve Ballinger\nUdemy Instructor\n\n\nI asked ChatGPT:\nPrompt: \"Explain in a friendly manner to a business professional why learning how to write good prompts is the key to getting the most out of ChatGPT.\" Here is the result.\nImagine ChatGPT as your super-smart, AI-powered genie – it's ready to grant your wishes, but it needs clear instructions. And that's where your skill in crafting prompts comes in! Writing good prompts is like giving your genie a crystal-clear map to find the treasure of precise, helpful, and spot-on responses.\nSee, ChatGPT is this genius AI that's been trained on tons of text. It's got knowledge on tap, but it's not a mind-reader (yet!). When you give it a prompt, your words guide it on what to focus on. So, if your prompt is vague or unclear, you might end up with responses that leave you scratching your head.\nBut fear not! Learning to write stellar prompts is like being a master communicator. You want to be specific, give context, and maybe even throw in a few hints. Imagine you're explaining your idea to a friend who's really interested but doesn't know all the background info. That's the kind of clarity ChatGPT craves!\nHere's the golden nugget: Good prompts lead to goldmine responses. Want accurate answers? Nail that prompt. Craving creative ideas? Craft a prompt that tickles ChatGPT's imagination. Dreaming of coherent conversations? Yep, you guessed it – an awesome prompt is your ticket!\nThink of it as a dance between you and your AI partner. You take the lead with a well-crafted prompt, and ChatGPT waltzes in with a response that wows. It's like teamwork to create magic!\nSo, if you're looking to make the most of ChatGPT's wizardry, honing your prompt-writing skills is your secret sauce. It's like giving your genie the best map to navigate the vast universe of information. Get ready to see ChatGPT conjure up brilliance based on your prompts – your AI adventure awaits!\n\n\nI asked ChatGPT:\nPrompt: \"What is ChatGPT. Explain in a friendly manner to a business professional.\" Here is the answer.\nHey there, business pro! Let's dive into ChatGPT in a way that makes sense for your world. Imagine having a super-smart virtual assistant for all your language-related tasks – that's where ChatGPT comes in!\nChatGPT is an advanced AI language model developed by some really brainy folks. It's like having an AI team member who's excellent at understanding and generating human-like text. You can use it for a bunch of things, from drafting emails and writing reports to brainstorming ideas and even helping with customer interactions.\nThink of it as your AI language sidekick. You can provide it with prompts – that's the stuff you want to talk about or ask – and it responds with text that sounds natural and professional. It's like having a skilled writer on call whenever you need it.\nHere's the scoop on how ChatGPT works: It has learned from loads of text from the internet, books, and other sources. This means it's soaked up a massive amount of language patterns and knowledge. When you give it a prompt, it uses this knowledge to generate responses that are relevant and coherent.\nKeep in mind, though, that ChatGPT isn't flawless. Sometimes its responses might need a bit of tweaking to match your specific tone or context. But hey, it's a real time-saver! Imagine having a tool that can draft ideas, answer questions, and help you communicate effectively, all without needing a coffee break.\nIn the business world, ChatGPT can be a handy assistant for crafting emails, generating content, or even fine-tuning your company's chatbot responses. It's like a language wizard that can help you work smarter and faster.\nSo, whether you're crunching numbers, closing deals, or building strategies, having ChatGPT in your toolbox can make your language tasks a breeze. Just type in your prompts, and watch the words flow!",

They only do in the case of Video Courses. But the great news here is, we have empowered our paid students to have a certificate once they qualify by 80% in the exams. It is a manual process in which learners are requested to submit evidence of qualification and apply for the certificate. The certificates are issued at the end of a month.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn energy management system offers a clear, uniform framework to manage energy performance. From assessing energy baseline to improving energy performance, from energy audits to energy review, an energy management system (EnMS) approach helps the business achieve their objectives and reduce costs.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy you need this exam?\nSuppose you are a professional working in the energy sector or want to work in an energy sector to manage various energy utilities in a company. Then you need to assess your knowledge of ISO 50001:2018, which is the latest international energy management system standard.\nIf you plan to do a lead auditor course of ISO 50001:2018, this practice exam will help you self-assess your knowledge of ISO 50001. This exam is not exactly in the same format as of ISO 50001 Lead Auditor exam; however, it gives you a good idea to go on with that. Because the official exam of ISO 50001:2018 is a written exam with different audit case studies. This practice exam is based on MCQs with audit case studies as well.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExam Composition\nEnergy management systems are generally denoted as EnMS, i.e., ISO 50001.\nThe exam will assess you on the following:\n- The concept of the energy management system (EnMS)\n- Internal and external issues of EnMS\n- Energy Performance Indicators (EnPIs)\n- Significant Energy Uses (SEUs)\n- Energy Baseline (EBs)\n- Auditing methodology for an EnMS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFood for Thought\nIf you think you are an expert in ISO 50001 EnMS after taking courses on ISO 50001:2018...\nYou need to hold on!\nJoin this exam and self-assess yourself!\nTake the Practice Exam...\nBe Familiar with the EnMS knowledge that you hold...\nMaybe you need to learn and learn...\nOr you can prove your knowledge and expertise by completing this exam.\nBoth ways, you are in a win-win situation.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: ISO 50001:2018 standard is a copyrighted document of ISO. We will not be sharing any copyright standards. Please purchase it from the ISO store.\nGood news: We will be adding more content, for example, case studies, to practice tests in the future. If you feel that you lack the knowledge, you can re-take EnMS courses.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSelf-Learning Process by examining your answers with explanation: At the end of the EnMS assessment exam, we will provide you with a result sheet that includes correct answers and the reason or explanation for the answer. So this exam is itself a learning process. You can improve your learning by assessing your answers against the explanation provided.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOne Month Money Back Guarantee: Don't forget One Month 100% Money Back Guarantee without inquiry. This means you have unconditionally no risk when registering for this Exam.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAsk Questions & Report Complaints: You can use a discussion forum on the right side of this course to discuss specific queries and report problems you face about the course content.",

Some may consider it as an alternative to a visit to a psychologist or to seek out for help from a consultant. But coaching is different. It’s rather a person who shows you that deep inside yourself you know already what you have to do & they help you in finding that next initial step with their specific techniques.\n\n\nAnd while all of this sounds awesome, you probably already know that as your intention is to make this profession YOUR profession.\n\n\nThis foundational course on coaching is targeted at people who want to make things right. Especially, set the foundations right when it comes to starting their coaching business.\n\n\nDoes that sound like you? - Good!\n\n\nNo more 10 hours of internet research on how to get started.\nNo more looking back at the last 3 months to solely understand that you are basically where you got started.\n\n\nThis course will equip you with the foundations of a coaching practice from which point you may exactly know how to proceed.\n\n\nWhat you won’t find in this foundational course on coaching is:\n\n\nAny Instagram/Google/Facebook Ads professional advice on how you can target all the right clients you want.\nThe right messaging strategy on all the social media platforms to close clients via chat.\nHear me talking here about the one & only funnel tactics that will catalyst your business to the next stage.\nThe exact posts you have to make on social media to attract all the clients you desire.\n…\n\n\nEveryone claims to know exactly all the answers to your questions, but if you dig deeper, the reality shows that they have a tendency on what will potentially bring which result. While all of these promises you may hear at multiple occasions have a certain validity to them, it’s probably not the best place to start.\n\n\nStarting how you can optimize a specific process within your organization before you set the foundations to these processes is just nuts. Therefore, this foundational course takes you back to step one - to the foundations you have to be clear on prior to jumping right into the battlefield.",

      "description": "Hands-On Transcription Practice Created by an Experienced Transcriptionist Herself:\nThis is Course C in the Hands-On Transcription Practice Series, featuring practice work in the following genres:\nHealthcare ( Medical )\nMarket Research Interviews\nA Keynote Speaker\nA Podcaster\nA Freelance Writer\nAs an experienced at-home transcriptionist for over 20 years, I have a very good handle on what is required to be an excellent transcriptionist, and be successful at it. I have taught hundreds in my successful Udemy course, “Step-by-Step Transcription from Home - Start A New Career,” and now am very excited to provide a series of courses devoted solely to transcription practice, with hours of hands-on transcription work for you!\nImmerse Yourself in the Work of a Transcriptionist:\nThe series enables those learning transcription (or coming back into the field) to practice with over two hours of audio per course (25 individual files in each), in several genres - and with the added benefit of a finished typed document to compare against your work for every audio. Each course stands on its own, offering video introductions to each set of work, companion audio files to type, work specifications documents for each “client,” as well as completed work documents, for your comparison, for each audio. In doing this, you will be proofreading your documents, getting used to this part of transcription work, as well.\nSimply put, these hours of hands-on transcription practice, producing completed documents in many subjects and genres, will add to your confidence and experience when you do look for work. (I would have loved something like this when I started out!)\nHave You Taken Other Transcriptionist Courses?\nAre You Coming Back Into Transcription?\nIf you have taken a course in becoming a transcriptionist, such as my own (“Step-by-Step Transcription from Home - Start A New Career”), or others, you will find this practice to be a really useful addition to your transcriptionist education, allowing you to further the transcription practice you have started - completing many typed files, increasing your skills as a transcriptionist, while getting better with your equipment, as well.\nIf you have not trained in transcription at all, you may still get benefit from the course in working through the files. Please note, however, that there will not be information on software and equipment needed, etc. to be a transcriptionist. These courses are solely focused on practicing by completing transcription work itself. With that said, and as someone who had minimal training when I began, you may well be able to work through these. However, you can also sign up for a transcription course, and this series as well. Whatever works for you!\nIf you were a transcriptionist in the past, these courses will be a wonderful way to get “back in the groove” of transcription, practicing at your own pace!\nWhat You Will Complete in This Series - Course C:\nAs noted above, this course in the series features practice work in the following genres:\nHealthcare ( Medical )\nMarket Research Interviews\nA Keynote Speaker\nA Podcaster\nA Freelance Writer\nFor each genre there is an introductory video, noting the work practice type, and some pointers on completing the work type. You will then receive 5 audios and a work specification sheet to download, noting any formatting or “client” requests. You will also receive 5 completed documents for download, to compare your finished work against.\nIn total, in this course you will receive 25 audio files (over 2 hours of audio), and when complete will have created 25 typed documents.\nLike A Transcriptionist Simulator:\nWith this course you can immerse yourself in the work of a transcriptionist, working on 25 files of varying types and subjects.\nYou will be working with varying genres of work, including general transcription, as listed above for this specific course in the series. If you conducted a search for \" audio transcription \" here on Udemy, this course would meet your needs, as well, as you will be receiving 25 audios to transcribe.\nWhen This Course is Complete:\nYou will have successfully typed 25 documents covering 5 genres of audio work. You will have greatly added to your skills as a transcriptionist, including learning to proofread, enabling you to apply for work with even more confidence.\nDo You Want More Practice?\nIf you want more practice you have some options. If you like, you can go through this course’s practice files again, honing and perfecting your skills. However, if you would like even more files to work on, you can pick up another course in the series - which will add 25 more audios in 5 genres to your practice workload.\nThe choice is yours!\nAre you ready to get started practicing with transcription work? I look forward to seeing you in the class!",

      "description": "Hands-On Transcription Practice Created by an Experienced Transcriptionist Herself:\nThis is Course B in the Hands-On Transcription Practice Series, featuring practice work in the following genres:\nLegal\nHealthcare ( Medical )\nEducation\nMarket Research Interviews\nA Podcaster\nAs an experienced at-home transcriptionist for over 20 years, I have a very good handle on what is required to be an excellent transcriptionist, and be successful at it. I have taught hundreds in my successful Udemy course, “Step-by-Step Transcription from Home - Start A New Career,” and now am very excited to provide a series of courses devoted solely to transcription practice, with hours of hands-on transcription work for you!\nImmerse Yourself in the Work of a Transcriptionist:\nThe series enables those learning transcription (or coming back into the field) to practice with over two hours of audio per course (25 individual files in each), in several genres - and with the added benefit of a finished typed document to compare against your work for every audio. Each course stands on its own, offering video introductions to each set of work, companion audio files to type, work specifications documents for each “client,” as well as completed work documents, for your comparison, for each audio.\nSimply put, these hours of hands-on transcription practice, producing completed documents in many subjects and genres, will add to your confidence and experience when you do look for work. (I would have loved something like this when I started out!)\nHave You Taken Other Transcriptionist Courses?\nAre You Coming Back Into Transcription?\nIf you have taken a course in becoming a transcriptionist, such as my own (“Step-by-Step Transcription from Home - Start A New Career”), or others, you will find this practice to be a really useful addition to your transcriptionist education, allowing you to further the transcription practice you have started - completing many typed files, increasing your skills as a transcriptionist, while getting better with your equipment, as well.\nIf you have not trained in transcription at all, you may still get benefit from the course in working through the files. Please note, however, that there will not be information on software and equipment needed, etc. to be a transcriptionist. These courses are solely focused on practicing by completing transcription work itself. With that said, and as someone who had minimal training when I began, you may well be able to work through these. However, you can also sign up for a transcription course, and this series as well. Whatever works for you!\nIf you were a transcriptionist in the past, these courses will be a wonderful way to get “back in the groove” of transcription, practicing at your own pace!\nWhat You Will Complete in This Series - Course B:\nAs noted above, this course in the series features practice work in the following genres:\nLegal\nHealthcare ( Medical )\nEducation\nMarket Research Interviews\nA Podcaster\nFor each genre there is an introductory video, noting the work practice type, and some pointers on completing the work type. You will then receive 5 audios and a work specification sheet to download, noting any formatting or “client” requests. You will also receive 5 completed documents for download, to compare your finished work against. In doing this, you will be proofreading your documents, getting used to this part of transcription work, as well.\nIn total, in this course you will receive 25 audio files (over 2 hours of audio), and when complete will have created 25 typed documents.\nLike A Transcriptionist Simulator:\nWith this course you can immerse yourself in the work of a transcriptionist, working on 25 files of varying types and subjects.\nYou will be working with varying genres of work, including general transcription, as listed above for this specific course in the series. If you conducted a search for \" audio transcription \" here on Udemy, this course would meet your needs, as well, as you will be receiving 25 audios to transcribe.\nWhen This Course is Complete:\nYou will have successfully typed 25 documents covering 5 genres of audio work. You will have greatly added to your skills as a transcriptionist, including learning to proofread, enabling you to apply for work with even more confidence.\nDo You Want More Practice?\nIf you want more practice you have some options. If you like, you can go through this course’s practice files again, honing and perfecting your skills. However, if you would like even more files to work on, you can pick up another course in the series - which will add 25 more audios in 5 genres to your practice workload.\nThe choice is yours!\nAre you ready to get started practicing with transcription work? I look forward to seeing you in the class!",

All Learning Outcomes and sub-Learning Outcomes are covered in this series of practice tests, which are written by Ian Tait BA(Hons) MBA DipPS MCIPS (Chartered), a former Chief Examiner to The Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, and a lecturer with over 30 years' experience of teaching CIPS subjects.\n\n\nAbout Ethical and Responsible Sourcing: Procurement is an area of business which is particularly vulnerable to unscrupulous practices. As procurement professionals we deal with the supply market on a daily basis, and this exposes us to risk of ethical temptation - some dishonest potential suppliers will try to win business from our employing organisation on the basis of offering us personal gains (ie bribery) in return for supply contracts. This problem is not restricted to any one geographical marketplace, or any one sector. Corruption is bad for business and bad for economies. This CIPS courses discusses these matters in detail, assisting procurement professionals to understand the issues and how to combat wrongdoing.\nProcurement professionals are also in an ideal position to spot and discourage undesirable practices in the supply chain. Exploitation of workers, corruption, modern slavery, fraud, theft, etc can all be found in supply chains and we can actively through our professionalism deter some of these wrongs.\n\n\nDo you know the advantages of using competition when procuring?\nDo you know what 'ratio analysis' is?\nWhat constitutes a conflict of interest? And what do you do if you find one?\nWhat is the 'triple bottom line'?\nCan you distinguish 'selection' from 'award' according to CIPS?\nDo you know your primary data from your secondary data?\n\n\nYou can contact Ian via this Udemy course or via Ian's LinkedIn profile page (search 'J Ian Tait' on LinkedIn)",

      "description": "The decades starting with the 1990s witnessed the proliferation of a new kind of sector among the various agencies and governmental departments engaged in public service. This sector was the Non-Profit or the Non-Governmental Organizations or the NGO, that mushroomed all over the world to fill the gap between the governmental agencies and the public.\nThe rise of the NGO’s coincided with the awareness among governmental and multilateral bodies like the United Nations that the problems of the 21st century were too complex and too diverse for the government to handle them alone. Hence, there was a need for an intermediary, which would be focused on a specific aspect of the gamut of issues and hence would be able to concentrate its energies solely on the issue rather than being general like the government.\nThe point here is that the NGO’s comprise of experts in particular fields and hence, they can devote their expertise and energies to solve the intractable problems, which the government cannot because of the red tape as well as the fact that many government officials are administrators first, and experts next. This was the reason for the NGO’s attaining a prominent place in the pantheon of agencies that were tasked with solving the problems of the world.\nThe intention behind the creation of the NGOs was that in places where the government was either doing a bad job of service delivery or the government could not reach for whatever reason, the NGOs could step in and act as the medium between the official sector or the governmental sector and the people.\nThe term Non-Governmental Organizations was coined to describe these entities.\nFurther, the fact that the increasing complexity and multiplicity of problems that confronted the world meant there was a need for a quasi-official entity to step in and help both government and society.",

      "description": "I can't teach you the craft of acting online. These skills you can only get in a top acting school or on set working with directors.\nBUT:\nI can teach you how to Make Money Acting ! (and then you can afford to go to an expensive acting school)\n\nIt is all about booking work.\nIt is great to be an actor, but it is better to be a working and paid actor. So let’s start with some name dropping to get the doubts out of the way:\nWatch our Adriana Arjona on Netflix’s ‘Narcos’,\nJuan Pablo Raba on ‘Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D’\nNaida Torres on ‘American Odysee’ or ‘Sleepy Hollow’.\nThose are real students in 2016 (and there are 100's more with success stories) who started their careers with me and now I want to do the same with you.\nHow can I be so sure?\nBecause I’ve been directing and coaching actors and top stars for decades.\nI worked for legendary movie icon Woody Allen, and spent hours a day watching all his brilliant moves. I’ve worked alongside some of the most successful directors in the industry. I’ve trained hosts on E! Entertainment Television, and countless other TV shows. Most importantly, I’ve observed the exact things producers and casting directors are looking for, things most actors don’t even realize. Few acting coaches are aware that these exclusive techniques exist,\nHi, I am Ralph Kinnard, and not only am I an actor. I’m also an acting coach with 17 years of experience running a world famous acting center with 100’s of students. And I’m a successful director who has worked with industry giants.\nIn fact, I recently directed a film starring the legendary Burt Reynolds.\nI’m not telling you this to brag. I want to help you, and I’m in a unique position to share experiences from both sides of the director’s chair, and give you my exact playbook to become a well-paid actor in constant demand.\n__________________________\nAn audition is like a sprint. It takes weeks of conditioning to project the image of a consummate professional, cool, relaxed, and in total control.\nThat's why I created the RESET AUDIO SESSIONS you will get with this course and is used by ALL ACTORS WHO ARE BOOKING JOBS.\nWe use exercises from Neuro-linguistic Programming (just like the NBA, NASA and the Air Force) - to get you to the top of your acting game under difficult situationsfor any role in the on-camera acting world (TV, film, commercials, industrials, sketch, even print ads).\n_________________________________\nYou can't learn this stuff from other actors.\nHere is why: Successful actors have SOLVED the Casting Problem for THEM. Each actor is different, so only the insight from a Director who looks at ALL ACTORS and coaches them will work for you.\nYou can learn this stuff from Casting Directors.\n\nHere is why: Most Casting Directors don't go to acting schools and don't learn acting techniques. (IF I wouldn't have graduated from  the Lee Strasberg Institute in NYC, honestly I wouldn't know the method existed or how to use it.)\n\nIt's taken me 20 years to learn these techniques and it is not just acting. It is about marketing, selling your image, promoting yourself and turning yourself into a million dollar acting product BEFORE you go to the FIRST Casting.\n_______________________________\nThere are an incredible amount of acting jobs available all over the USA.\nWHY?\nBecause of tax incentives and location benefits we'll shoot movies everywhere.\nHeard of Amazon and Netflix?\nWe are talking 100 million dollars per show and actors are getting a huge slice of the pie.\n\nThe minimum salary for a series regular on a Screen Actors Guild television show is $5,000 per episode and that is just ONE DAY!\nDo you want to book Commercials?\nCommercials pay between $5,000 and $60,000 PER AD  (and that's usually for one day of work). If they have to fly you somewhere they pay extra for that day..\n________________________________\nWhat this course is NOT:\nI can't teach you the craft of acting online. These skills you can only get in a top acting school or on set working with directors.\nBUT:\nIt makes more sense to FIRST start learning about the acting business and book your first gigs for a couple of reasons:\nYou need to make sure you love acting and are excited about it.\nMost acting gigs don't require more then your natural talent.\nYou will be able to pay for your acting training with your acting work!\nIn addition to the Udemy 30-day guarantee, you have my personal promise that you will use my tools starting today, will get you closer to become a high paid movie actor and even use some of the tools in real life. (the whole world is a stage, right?)\nIf you are passionate about acting, then waiting will just waste your time.\n\nLet me show you all the things I've learned and help you succeed\nThanks for signing up and see you on the inside\nRalph Kinnard",

      "description": "Welcome to Strategic Cost Management course for Procurement and Supply Chain specialists!\n\n\nIn this course we will look into procurement’s role in the company and some prejudges about Procurement, Purchasing and Supply Chain specialists. You will understand that our role in the company is really important, and the bets way to prove it is to look into the leverage effect of Procurement. Savings on Procurement are directly contributing to a company’s Profit. One Dollar saved = One Dollar earned!\n\n\nWe will learn about the pressure for price reduction and some low price illusions that can happen in your practice. Constant cost development is not just a wish from the purchaser. It is a business routine in a modern world.\n\n\nAnd then we will learn about preparation to price negotiations, different approaches to pricing depending on the type of supplier. We will talk about the following questions to your suppliers:\n-Do you have any frame agreements? Commitments? For how long?\n-How easy is for you to find alternative supplier?\n-How easy is for supplier to find alternative customer?\n-Is there any special competence/knowledge/patent/know-how existing at this supplier?\n-Does supplier have the specific equipment dedicated only for your products/services? Are there any major undepreciated investments for such equipment at supplier?..\n\n\nImportant part of the course is cost analysis of the products. You will learn making cost modelling for the specific product at the specific supplier. And then using the cost based pricing for Strategic Cost Management.  We will also look into the economy of scale (when your supply volumes increase): administrative economies, financial savings and economical use of by-products...\n\n\nWe will finish the course with long term contracts and frame agreements, that help to avoid the bad surprises in business. There are a lot of variables in business with your suppliers: forecasts, raw material prices, exchange rates, efficiency, technical development and innovation and many more... The only constant thing is change:)\nThis course will help you to stay calm, work effectively and proactively with cost on the strategic level!\n\n\nThis course was prepared based on my own experience and the best practices I have used by myself. Also this course contains some theoretical knowledge and practical tools that are used by the world class companies and supply chain managers.\nThe material is easy to follow and understand, well-structured and presented in a simple and straightforward way. And what is very important – you can start using the tools and the logic of Strategic Cost Management already after finishing the course.\nI am proud of the materials collected in this course. And I am sure that you will bring your Procurement and Supply Chain work to a completely new level!\n\n\nHave a look into the preview lessons. If you like them - just go for the course. You will not regret it!\n\n\nP.S. As a bonus - I have decided to share my e-books on Procurement. Some useful and fun read for you, some motivation and inspiration.\nEnjoy your course and leave me a comment after you complete the course :)\n\n\nRobert",

      "description": "If you are wondering if you should take this masterclass on grant writing, just consider the top-six reasons that funders give for rejecting grant proposals.\nMisalignment with Funder Priorities. Proposals fail because the project doesn't align closely with the funder’s mission, strategy, or desired impact, even if the proposal is well-written.\nLack of Compelling Evidence. Successful proposals must demonstrate need, impact and effectiveness using data, case studies and evaluation plans. Many nonprofits don’t know how to gather this evidence, or they present it poorly.\nWeak Statement of Need or Solution. A vague or poorly defined problem, or a solution that seems unrealistic, unfocused or unsustainable, quickly disqualifies your proposal.\nBudget Issues. When your budget doesn’t align with your narrative, when it lacks detail, when it seems padded or unrealistic, you sink an otherwise great proposal.\nNumber five: Poor Writing and Organization. Funders read dozens, even hundreds, of grant proposals. If your proposal is hard to follow, lacks clarity, or is riddled with jargon or typos, funders will set aside and refuse to fund your project.\nFailure to Follow Instructions: Missing required documents, ignoring word limits, or using the wrong format, results in automatic rejection, regardless of how well your proposal is written.\nThese six reasons are the bad news. But the good news is that you can learn to write grant proposals that get funded.\nAlan Sharpe's Grant Writing Masterclass is the masterclass for aspiring grant writers. It’s your step-by-step guide to crafting grant proposals that stand out, speak to funders, and secure the support your nonprofit needs to grow.\nThe course is based on my book of the same name. Whether you’re a complete beginner or a fundraiser who wants to sharpen your skills, this course teaches you how to plan, write and tailor every section of a grant proposal with confidence.\nBased on over 40 years of real-world experience, this masterclass walks you through the entire grant-writing process, from understanding the grantmaking ecosystem to writing the proposal to submitting it successfully.\nI’m your instructor, Alan Sharpe. I have written dozens of successful grant proposals over the past 40 years. I’ve worked for five non-profits as an in-house fundraiser and I’ve spoken internationally as a fundraising consultant. I’ve written multiple books and handbooks on fundraising, and I’m passionate about helping non-profits tell their stories and secure the funding they need to change the world.\nCourse Structure\nI’ve structured this masterclass into clear, practical sections that mirror the grant-writing process. Over the space of almost six hours, I cover everything you need to know to write successful grant proposals. I introduce you to key concepts, define terms, describe common mistakes to avoid, and teach you dozens of best practices.\nIntroduction to Grant Writing\nLearn the fundamentals—how grants work, who gives them, and why writing winning proposals is essential for nonprofit survival and growth.\nWriting the Organization Description\nPosition your nonprofit as credible and capable. Craft a clear, funder-focused description that showcases your mission, programs, expertise, and capacity to deliver results.\nCrafting the Statement of Need\nMake your case by clearly defining the problem you aim to solve. Learn how to use data and human stories to demonstrate urgency and align with funder priorities.\nWriting the Project Description\nTranslate your ideas into action. Describe your project plan, target outcomes, and expected impact—backed by timelines, strategies, and facts.\nEstablishing Goals & Objectives\nSet SMART goals that reflect both your mission and the funder’s intent. You’ll learn to write measurable, achievable objectives that clarify what success looks like.\nWriting the Evaluation Plan\nShow funders how you’ll track progress, measure results, and use data to improve. Learn how to create a logic model and evaluation strategy funders trust.\nWriting the Sustainability Plan\nProve your project has staying power. Discover how to assure funders that their investment will deliver long-term impact beyond the grant period.\nCrafting the Budget\nBuild a transparent, funder-friendly budget—complete with direct and indirect costs, a clear narrative, and matching gift/in-kind strategies.\nThroughout this masterclass, I use dozens of examples from a wide variety of non-profit organizations. Health charities. Arts organizations. Environmental non-profits. International NGOs. Charities that work with seniors, charities that work with at-risk youth, charities that work with women of color experiencing domestic abuse in the southside of Chicago. In other words, this masterclass is based on real-world non-profits writing grant proposals to meet real-world needs. It’s comprehensive, practical, and, above all, helpful.\nBy the end of this masterclass, you’ll be able to write a compelling, funder-aligned proposal that avoids the top-six blunders, increases your odds of success, and helps your non-profit make a greater impact.\nIf you’re ready to stop fumbling and start winning grants, enroll now.",

It serves as a revision.\n\nWho this course is for:\nLearners who are taking the CIPS Exams for L2M5 - Inventory, Logistics and Expediting\nLearners who wish to pass the CIPS exams.\nLearners who want to gain confidence in passing the exams\nAnyone who wants to know more about procurement\nOn completion of this module, learners will be able to identify the key role that inventory has to play and define the principles and processes associated with effective logistics control, explaining how effective expediting can be achieved in procurement and supply.",

      "description": "Welcome to Strategic Grant Planning & Management, the Stress Free Way.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS COURSE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND GRANT READINESS SECTIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN ANOTHER OF MY COURSES, THAT INCLUDES ALL THREE SECTIONS.\nThis unique course is based on a system I used and adapted for my employers and clients since 1989. It is unique in that it gives you proprietary grant management tools to:\nwin grants\nreceive grant awards\ntrack every aspect of the proposal preparation and submission process\norganize and keep current every piece of data that you might need to use in any proposal\nplan funding for several years in advance\nchoose\nthe right funder\nfor the right program\nat the right time, and\nin the right sequence\nreport outcomes and show the funders that you were a good steward of their money\nFOR EXAMPLE: If you've ever applied to Funder A for program expenses only to find out, too late, that Funder A was the ONLY ONE who would fund your construction or administration costs, while Funder B would gladly have funded your program expenses, you can appreciate how important it is to plan carefully, especially when future funding will be affected.\nIf you've ever wished you had a way to choose...\nwhich funder\nfor which program\nin which sequence\nand when\nTHIS IS THE COURSE FOR YOU!\nThis Strategic Planning course was developed for and adapted to many different types of NPOs over 25 years. You won't find this system anywhere else.\n\nAs a grant writer, nonprofit, or consultant, you will find this course gives you a complete solution for developing a system of grants management and strategic planning. It includes a sequence of data management and tracking forms, three funder-selection calculators, and a system to tie them all together into stress-free, grant planning and management system. You'll be so organized that you and your teammates will actually be able to take your lunch breaks. And, never again will you have to spend frantic hours in crisis-mode, trying to get your proposal submitted by the deadline.\n**********\nIf you've ever run into delays getting data, budget, signatures, reviews or approvals with a fast approaching deadline...\nStress-Free Strategic Grant Planning and Readiness will provide you a truly stress-free planning and management system, including:\nthe forms and a database, to manage your entire grant funding system\nfunding opportunity calculators that you will use to weigh the fit between your programs' goals and each funder's goals and to help you choose the right funder, for the right program, at the right time, and in the right sequence.\nThis is especially valuable for organizations that have a large number of grant applications and multiple projects going on at any given time.\nHow to IMPLEMENT this proven proposal-writing management process\nWHO belongs on your proposal-writing and management teams\nWhat to include in your proposal writing and management POLICIES & PROCEDURES\nHow to manage each phase of your PROPOSAL-MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nHow to establish CRITERIA for choosing your funding sources\nHow to AVOID SUBMITTING MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS for the same RFP\nHow to DECIDE WHICH RFP to apply for, for each program or project\nHow to DETERMINE WHEN to apply for each grant you have identified\nHow the tools in the Strategic Planning Toolkit (included) are used to create a system that flows SMOOTHLY AND STRESS-FREE\nAnd to wrap all of this together, the grant management system provides sample (editable) written procedures for smooth-flowing processes from the moment you begin to choose a funder to the moment you submit the proposal to the funder.\nThe system ensures that your grant applications will be error free, thoroughly reviewed, checked for accuracy and completeness and submitted error free and with essentially no stress or last minute crises (conditions most likely to cause errors.)\nI've successfully implemented this system in small and large organizations. It's flexible enough to accommodate the many unique aspects of different nonprofits' management practices.\nYou'll learn how to use the strategic planning and management tools. These tools provide storage for your most current data, to grab and insert in your proposals and budgets. They also provide the tracking records needed to keep your proposal moving through the writing, review, editing, and submission stages. In addition you'll have three different methods of evaluating your programs to match RFAs and identify the best fits.\nFunding, as you know, is not just the result of submitting a qualifying proposal, but of developing relationships and credibility.\nWhen your organization is able to show a funder that you've covered all the essentials and are operating at the highest standards, you improve your credibility in the eyes of funders. Relationships, on the other hand, you'll have to build yourself. Begin with this system.\nWith this system, you can organize your nonprofit in ways that will make your competition wonder what you've got that they don't have.\nNot a bad spot to be in.",

      "description": "Did you know that the US Government is the largest buyer in the world spending $410 billion dollars in government contracting each year?\nThis course Government Contracting for Everyone aims to teach you the basic knowledge of government contracting or B2G sales. B2G is business to government and unlike Business-to-Consumer or Business-to-Business sales, starting a B2G company can be complicated, and finding the most current and relevant information you need can be frustrating. And that is why I created this course.\nWhether you are a current small business owner, recent graduate or startup entrepreneur exploring new opportunities, this course is designed to make government contracting and its convoluted regulations fun and easy to understand for everyone.\nThis course is broken down into 5 different sections or modules, 28 lessons, in chronological order from the first step of forming your business to the last step winning and successfully performing your first government contract.\nAfter each section will be a short quiz to help you remember the key take-aways. Also as a bonus for Udemy only, I added a bonus video at the end of the course to go over some of the most common B2G mistakes I came across since consulting small businesses.\nI hope you enjoy this course.",

      "description": "The healthcare world is shifting rapidly toward value-based care (VBHC)—a model that rewards improved outcomes, patient satisfaction, and sustainability rather than just the volume of services delivered. But while many leaders and clinicians now understand what VBHC is, far fewer know how to operationalize quality improvement in a way that truly creates value for patients.\n\n\nThis course bridges that gap. Building on our introductory course to VBHC, The 3 Keys to Improving Quality in Value-Based Care reveals how to move from theory to action using a practical and memorable framework: the Healthcare Quality Pyramid. At the top of the pyramid is what matters most—the patient—and each level provides clear, actionable strategies to elevate outcomes while managing costs.\n\n\nYou’ll learn how to:\nApply proven improvement paradigms that focus attention where it counts.\nEngage patients meaningfully in their own care journeys.\nMap processes to identify bottlenecks and opportunities for redesign.\nMeasure progress with quality metrics that drive accountability and change.\nBuild a repeatable system for sustained success.\n\n\nThe course also includes expert interviews, supplemental resources, and real-world examples to help you apply these tools immediately. Whether you are a clinician, healthcare executive, policymaker, or innovator, this course will equip you with a step-by-step blueprint to make quality improvement concrete, scalable, and transformative.\n\n\nJoin us as we uncover the 3 keys that unlock better outcomes for patients—and higher value for the entire healthcare system.",

Six to twelve individuals are selected and either one or two moderators are selected. Focus Group is an important tool for Marketing Research. So, it can be said that if there was no Marketing Research being conducted, then there was really no need for conducting focus groups too.\nMarketing Research is the function that links consumer, customer and public to marketer through information gathered through tools such as focus groups. Marketing Research is systematic problem analysis, model building and fact finding for the purpose of important decision making and control in the marketing of goods and services.\nInformation gathered through tools such as focus groups is used to identify and define marketing opportunities and problems, generate, refine and evaluate marketing actions; monitor marketing performance; improve understanding of marketing as a process. Marketing Research is sometimes defined as the application of scientific method in the solution of marketing problems. Marketing Research plays a very significant role in identifying the needs of customers and meeting them in best possible way. The main task of Marketing Research is systematic gathering and analysis of information.\nFocus Group is Qualitative Research and is generally undertaken to develop an initial understanding of the problem. It is non-statistical in nature. It uses an inductive method, that is, data relevant to some topics are collected and grouped into appropriate meaningful categories. The explanations are emerged from the data itself. It is used in exploratory research design and descriptive research also. When there is uncertainty or when the problem is not clearly defined, we deploy exploratory research and use qualitative studies for it.",

It is commonly measured by the growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period. Economic growth is often driven by factors such as increased investment, technological advancements, improvements in productivity, and expansion of the labor force. Sustained economic growth is generally seen as a positive indicator of an economy's health and potential for prosperity.\nEconomic Development: While economic growth focuses on the increase in the quantity of goods and services produced, economic development encompasses a broader set of goals related to improving the standard of living and quality of life for people within a society. It involves not only the growth of the economy but also considerations such as reducing poverty, improving healthcare and education, ensuring social equity, protecting the environment, and promoting political stability. Economic development aims to create an environment where individuals have access to opportunities for personal and collective advancement, leading to long-term improvements in well-being.\nPolicies and strategies aimed at fostering economic growth may not always lead to equitable economic development. For instance, rapid economic growth driven solely by resource extraction or industries with poor labor standards may exacerbate income inequality and environmental degradation, undermining long-term development goals. Therefore, achieving sustainable and inclusive economic development often requires a holistic approach that considers social, environmental, and political factors alongside economic indicators. Governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders play crucial roles in formulating and implementing policies that balance economic growth with broader development objectives.",

Many channels make great videos, earn and grow without ever filming a thing themselves.\n\n\nWith YouTubes Fairuse policy you are able to take footage from other videos, movies, stock footage and create videos using these (but only in certain ways... we'll explain all.. be careful and respectful, it has to be Fair Use!). Also, this is not copyright law, that is something else... I'll explain in the course.\n\n\nI'll show you how to get these video clips, what the fair use policy means (you have to add to content, like a movie review channel would using movie clips so you don't get a copyright strike from YouTube); how to download these videos from online; get copyright free music, stock footage, edit these, sound effect and so much more!\n\n\nIf you're not sure what types of videos you want to make, what niche of genre; that's OK too! I have 10 examples of youtube niches that don't use their own recorded video footage and are successful and with the practice exercise in this course i'll show you exactly how to find out what you should be making videos about and how to do this.\n\n\n** I must emphasize, please familiarize yourself with the YouTube fairuse policy! Yes you can use footage from other video but you must add to it, commentate or change it substantially and be adding (very important, not just using the content) to the content (think like a movie review channel showing clips); do not just copy big chunks of video.  Link to the fairuse policy in the first lecture description or search \"YouTube Fairuse Policy\" on Google. There is a whole lecture on this later in the course. As a rule please use original footage only or stock footage legally purchased and you have rights; but the fairuse policy does exist (different to copyright as explained later). If you are using other footage, adhere to the fairuse properly, add to it, discuss it... try not to if possible.\n\n\nCovered in this course:\nWhat's YouTube Fair use\nIdeas about what to make a channel/videos about\nHow to find the niche YOU should make about\nHow to find and download videos step-by-step\nHow to find music to use (free and paid)\nHow to get sound effects (free)\nFinding people to edit/create these for you\nEditing advice\nThumbnails (where to create these)\nHow youTube works\nHow to grow (making and upload schedule calendar)\nStep-by-step uploading to youtube",

Each type is discussed in context, with scenarios that illustrate their applications and the consequences of bond claims.

We learnt and grew in career by experimenting with our own methods and knowledge. But all of us know that had there been someone who would have taken time to teach us correct things at right time, we could have learnt things in time and could have saved lots of time.\nThe course here exactly fills this gap. This is course designed to give all the methodology & tools to the all those who are wanting to get into maintenance as career or those who are already there but do not know how to take the system further. This course dives deep into actually implementable system of maintenance work.\nAs maintenance engineers, supervisors & managers, we all face everyday challenge on right material not being available, if material is there then there is lack of time, if both of it are there then right skill person is not there. We all acknowledge this but we are so engrossed into daily work that we feel suffocated as we don't see any light at the end of the tunnel.\nThis course helps you to understand, develop and streamline the maintenance management system in your company. This would teach you how to optimize material to be stocked and what to do with to other, thus saving the costs for the company and still get the maintenance done. You will learn how to save the costs on material by being structured in your approach.\nHere you will come to know about how to prioritize work, schedule the work based on the data & daily work management. The structured approach with some flexibility will reduce your stress levels to great extent.\nThis course will teach you how to develop the relevant skills in ourselves first and then in the technicians,  in a more structured manner. The course also gives the detailed methodology to evaluate skill development progress. This would avoid conflicts with team and work will get done RIGHT FIRST TIME.\nThis will also cover the structured problem solving techniques,  Safety and Environment.",

Now (2021) it is applied to Sanitize and Sterilize with videos from a dental clinic. However, you decide to implement this improvement process - you must follow the 7 steps outlined in this course.\nJoin George Trachilis - experienced with 5S for 25 years - as he shares how his consulting firm was first created to consult on 5S and grew to be one of Canada's Hottest Growth companies. He shares PowerPoints, audit checklists, posters, and most importantly his knowledge of how to do 5S in the most efficient way possible.  One of his students, Perry Thompson, shares the 5S process for the construction industry. This course has examples from a steel mill, metal processing plant, dental clinic, and fabrication shop.\n\nOriginally, Henry Ford came up with the CANDO system;  Cleanliness, Arrangement, Neatness, Discipline, and Ongoing Improvement. However, it was further developed by the Japanese using words that started with the letter \"S\".\nKeys and Tips to Implement the 5S Methodology\nSEIRI (Sort) is about organizing and eliminating unnecessary items from your workplace\nSEITON (Set in order) means setting in order the necessary items so that they are easy to find and use by everyone.\nSEISO (Shine) - When shine is done right, you are using the inspection process to identify and eliminate problems. Keeping it clean is only part of the process. Preventing cleaning from happening is very powerful\nSEIKETSU (Standardize) is about standardizing the first 3S's, and in this course, we share how to standardize workflow as well.\nSHITSUKE (Sustain) is about the communication and commitment from management. It emphasizes employee ownership.\nPlease note we DO NOT share Japanese terms in this course.  However, we have created a comic book character called MUDAMAN! This is an invisible villain that keeps us on a path of wasting our time (wasting our lives). See how to eliminate Mudaman by using 5S.\n\n\nConnect any time at GeorgeTrachilis dot com",

      "description": "Welcome to the Course!\nStarting a nonprofit organization is a major decision that requires an investment of time and resources. This course was written to help small nonprofits position their organization for funding by preparing a 2-page grant proposal that you can use multiple times.\n\n\nAbout this Course\n“How to Write a 2-Page Grant Proposal” is a product of more than 25 years of experience in the nonprofit sector and over 10 years successfully writing grants. This course highlights what nonprofit leaders can do at a very basic level, to write a compelling letter that potential funders will want to read. Many nonprofit founders are not grant-writers or technical writers for that matter. Instead, I find nonprofit founders to be people with \"Big-Amazing-Hearts\" for balancing societal norms. I’ve written this course to help those of you who are wanting to apply for grants using a letter of inquiry, but unsure how. This is my small way of saying “thank you” for all that you do (or plan to do) to make our world better! ?\n\n\nThis course seeks to equip nonprofit founders and leaders, and anyone else with an interest in funding a nonprofit public charity, with strategies and techniques to do just that – using a letter of inquiry. At the conclusion of this course, it is my sincere hope that you feel inspired to apply for grants and lead the organization that you’ve always dreamed that you would one day lead. You have everything it takes to succeed. This course is just your reminder!\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nThis course is for U.S. nonprofit Founders, Executive Directors, Board Members, Staff of Nonprofits, Volunteers of Nonprofits, Funders, and others with an interest in U.S. nonprofit funding. This material would be helpful for nonprofit organizations located outside of the U.S. However, it would not be helpful for a person exclusively looking for guidance for a for-profit business.",

      "description": "There's a lot of buzz these days about User Journey Maps, Customer Journey Maps, Buyer Journeys, and Employee Journeys.  But there's very little about how to make a *great* journey map, meaning a map that results in tangible impacts to the the business or the product.\nThis course is based on interviews with over 60 journey mappers. Whether you are brand new to journey mapping or frustrated with the lackluster impact of your previous maps, this course has insights to set you up for success..\n\nYou'll learn 4 principles for maps with impact, plus best practices for each:\n\nPrinciple #1: Journey Maps need to be Focused: A high impact journey map has a clear reason for existing: clear objectives, audience, etc. When people don't take the time to get focused, it shows. You need to be clear and aligned on what you are mapping, why you are mapping it, how it will be used, etc.\n\nPrinciple #2: Maps need to be based in Data: A map with impact is based on solid understanding of people's process, needs, pain points, etc. Use insights from existing & journey-focused qualitative interviews, quant surveys, & data analytics to inform your map.\n\nPrinciple #3: Maps need to be Customized: Map illustrations need to be tailored based on their objective, their audience, etc. A micro-interaction or map for a design sprint will be very different than a map intended to inform roadmapping or strategic decision\n\nPrinciple #4: Maps need to be well Integrated: So often maps land with a thud and fall short of their full impact because they are delivered (\"thrown over the fence\") and then abandoned. It's very important to help your team/client learn how to use the map and how to integrate it into their existing processes.\n\nAnd one more underlying principle that underlies all of the others: Maps need to be collaboratively created: What's a main differentiator for maps with impact? Collaboration. The involvement of diverse team members throughout the entire process - from planning, through research, early mapping, and launch.",

      "description": "ISO 14001:2015 is the international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system (EMS). It provides a framework that an organization can follow, rather than establishing environmental performance requirements. Part of the ISO 14000 family of standards on environmental management, ISO 14001:2015 is a voluntary standard that organizations can certify to. Integrating it with other management systems standards can further assist in accomplishing organizational goals. ISO 14001:2015 should be used by any organization that wishes to set up, improve, or maintains an environmental management system to conform to its established environmental policy and requirements. The requirements of the standard can be incorporated into any environmental management system, the extent to which is determined by several factors including the organization’s industry, environmental policy, products and service offerings, and location. This standard is relevant to all organizations, regardless of size, location, sector, or industry.\nBy the end of the course the participant should be able to;\n· Identify the objectives and benefits of an EMS and the requirements of the standard\n· Learn how to assess an organization’s current state with regards to an EMS\n· Be familiar with performing a gap analysis to meet EMS standards Plan,\n· Developing and implementing an EMS appropriate to your organization\n· Identify environmental aspects and impacts relevant to your organization with the emphasis on improvement\nAn Environmental Management System (EMS) includes an organization's operations with the environment and the use of effective strategies and practices designed to eliminate negative consequences while increasing productivity. ISO 14001:2015 is intended for use by an organization aiming to manage its environmental responsibilities methodically.\nA strong Environmental Management System enables an organization to improve environmental performance, reduce unnecessary costs, and increase productivity. It is of utmost importance that when implementing Environmental Management System in an organization, it should be tailored to follow the standards of ISO 14001:2015 while meeting the needs of the organization.\nThis course will discuss topics revolving around ISO 14001:2015 and the the PDCA approach, aspect and impact analysis, operation controls, and internal auditing.",

This course is for anyone that wants to have a better understanding of the PACER system and how to utilize it for access to federal criminal records, civil case filings, bankruptcies and more.\n\nIf you're in the investigation field and are not current adept at using PACER, you're hurting your business. This court is for anyone though. Maybe you're seeking the truth beyond what's in the news or you're a paralegal or debt collector. Anyone can take this course and anyone can use PACER.\n\nThis comprehensive course covers -\n- Sign up with PACER\n- Setup PACER\n- Account administration\n- Perform case and party searches\n- Civil, criminal, bankruptcy case examinations (at least 2 in depth examinations in each section)\n- Tips for success\nI’ve also included a bonus section that will include several different states and examples of how to do state and county searches.\nPACER is completely free if you run up less than $30 worth of fees in a quarter. It’s a little more for people like me that use it quite frequently, but not much more.\n\nWhat I value most with my students is open and honest feedback. If there is something not covered in the course or something that deserves a better explanation, please don't hesitate to reach out. I want to make sure everyone is satisfied with the knowledge here and feels comfortable with the knowledge gained. If you don't, please contact me so I can perhaps adjust the course or add another video to make it more complete.",

The course is based on the most recent update of the standard  (the 2015 version) and will highlight the key differences between this  and the previous (2004) version - critical knowledge for any  environmental professional!\nThe course will start by taking you through understanding what  ISO14001 is and a brief history of its development and relationship to  other standards. We will talk about why you should consider implementing  ISO14001 and the costs and benefits of doing so. Next, we look at what  the individual clauses of the standard are in brief while focusing in on  three key clauses (Leadership, Environmental Aspects and Continuous  Improvement) for a more in depth understanding. Finally we will discuss  required documentation in an ISO14001 management system and how your  organisation can become certified to the ISO14001:2015 standard  including key things to look for when appointing your certifying body.\nDownloadable templates and examples are provided throughout the  course to support you. These can be adapted to suit your organisation in  developing your own ISO14001:2015 compliant management system.\nPlease note, this course was originally developed for a different format to Udemy's platform. As a result, quizzes which are mentioned throughout have been combined into a single final quiz.\n***This course is no longer being updated or managed as of February 2021.

      "description": "Use the sum of 10 fundraising strategies to raise more money and sooner!\n\n\nWHY HAVING 10 FUNDRAISING STRATEGIES IS SO EFFECTIVE\n\n\nWhen you focus on just one fundraising strategy, it might not work, take too long, or raise less money than you need.\n\n\nInstead of putting all your eggs in one basket with one fundraising strategy, combine funds from 10 different fundraising strategies like getting some money from a business loan, maybe a personal loan, grants, crowdfunding, other donations, and then transitioning to many of the creative ways to raise money that I'll show you in this course.\n\n\nWhen you raise a little bit of money from multiple sources, it's much easier to get to your ultimate fundraising goal.\n\n\nIncludes my 200-page business plan book, which is used by a number of universities.\n\n\nUNDERSTAND THE A-Z OF THE FUNDRAISING PROCESS\n\n\nIf you are in the process of raising money for your business or wondering how to begin the fundraising process, this course will give you insights and the pros and cons for different fundraising strategies. That will help you maximize your chances of success in each!\n\n\nWE'LL START BY EXPLORING THE OPTION OF A BUSINESS LOAN TO FUN A SMALL BUSINESS\n\n\nMany people opt for business loans as their first option to raise money for their small business or a start-up. Loans feel like they might be a relatively easy option because banks and investors are more willing to offer loans than direct investments.\n\n\nSmall business loans turn out to be difficult to get because most bank have a requirement similar to this:\n\n\nYour business must be operational for at least six months.\nYou must generate at least a few thousand dollars in revenue.\nIf you don't qualify for these common small business loan requirements, you still have a few options. You can go to local banks which sometimes have more lenient policies or you can explore the option of a personal loan to fund your small business.\n\n\nRISK ASSOCIATED WITH SMALL BUSINESS LOANS OR PERSONAL LOANS\n\n\nThe challenge with getting a small business loan is that you have to pay it back. If your business does not succeed, you'll have an enormous amount of debt, which is a big thing to consider.\n\n\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF LOANDS FROM SBA SMALL BUSINESS LOANS TO INTERNATIONAL MICROLOANS\n\n\nYou'll also learn about many different options for getting a small business loan to fund your company. I'll explain what SBA loans are. These are Small Business Assistance loans backed by the US government to help small businesses.\nYou will also learn how to use online lending companies like Lendio or Kiva to either get a small business loan or a business line or credit.\n\n\nGETTING DONATIONS TO FUND YOUR BUSINESS VIA CROWDFUNDING\n\n\nCrowdfunding can be a great option if you have an idea that gets people excited, inspired, and motivated. If so, you can use crowdfunding websites like GoFundMe or Kickstarter to raise money for your business. But keep in mind that those are marketplaces. That means that you can go viral and promoted on those websites, and have many people find your project to give you donations. But if your project doesn't get discovered on those websites, you'll have to do most of your own promotion, which can be difficult.\n\n\nRAISING MONEY FROM GRANTS\n\n\nThere are many small business grants that are available, and I'll show you how to find them. The challenge with business grants is that it's time consuming to do grant writing and fill out the entire grant application. Plus, it can take a long time to get a reply after you submit your grant application.\n\n\nCREATIVE FUNDRAISING STRATEGIES\n\n\nIf getting a small business loan, a personal loan, grant, or crowdfunding isn't an option for you, I'll also show you a number of creative and lesser-known techniques to raise money.\n\n\nCALCULATE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU NEED TO RAISE\n\n\nBefore starting any process of raising money, you must understand how much money you need to raise.  Usually the amount of money you aim to raise should get you closer to your next business milestone.\nThat milestone can be profitability, customer growth to reach a certain number of clients, or a number of other things.\nThis course will show you how to do the math to understand your fundraising needs so you can be more sophisticated when you try to raise money.\n\n\nFOR WHOM THIS COURSE IS IDEAL\n\n\nThis course is ideal for people who have a business idea or an early-stage business, and need funding to get started or move forward.\n\n\nHOW THIS FUNDRAISING COURSE WILL WORK\n\n\n1) Learn how to calculate how much money you need.\n2) Use a combination of over 10 ways to raise that money.\n3) Learn to pitch investors.\n\n\nWILL THESE STRATEGIES WORK FOR YOU?\n\n\nNot all the fundraising strategies in this course will work for everyone. But since this course gives you a wide range of strategies to raise money, some of them will definitely work.\nPlus, by combining multiple fundraising strategies, you should be able to reach the sum your situation requires.\n\n\nLATEST COURSE UPDATE:\n\n\nFundraising websites that help you raise funds for your business\nExtra resources for finding potential grants\nMore unusual ways to raise funds for your business\nMost lectures updated to have improved audio and video quality\n\n\nWHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE THIS COURSE\n\n\nDon't focus on just one fundraising strategy like investors, loans or crowdfunding. Give yourself greater potential with a broad view of all the possible ways to raise money.\nWhen you understand all your fundraising options, you will be more likely to choose the most effective strategies and implement them better and with more confidence.\n\n\nINSTRUCTOR BACKGROUND\n\n\nI've been an entrepreneur for 20+ years, coached 1,000+ entrepreneurs in person, taught 850,000+ students, impacted millions of entrepreneurs worldwide, some of whom created 6 and 7-figure businesses, and I would love to help you.\nI understand how difficult, confusing and stressful it might be for you to go through a fundraising process and start a business with no money and no support.\n\n\nSHORTEN YOUR STRUGGLE\n\n\nA long time ago, I went through the same challenges of starting a business and raising money. I understand how stressful and challenging things are for you.\nI made this course to help you to get through this challenging process in the easiest possible way, and to shorten the struggle.\n\n\nSTARTUP AND NONPROFIT FUNDRAISING USING ONLINE AND OFFLINE STRATEGIES\n\n\nSince this course has a variety of unique fundraising strategies, any type of organization can use at least some of the strategies. Whether you are working on a technology startup or a nonprofit, you can use the fundraising strategies in this course to help you.\n\n\nBONUSES INCLUDED\n\n\nLots of extra freebies, downloadable worksheets, and exercises to make the course more interactive and valuable\nPersonal invitation to my Facebook community after you complete the course\nMy list of 50 business-success skills after you complete the course\nBe automatically entered to get chosen for my student of the month status and have your business featured\nRESPONSIVE AND CARING INSTRUCTOR: WORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT\n\n\nIf you have questions, know that I am here to help! I answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours.
