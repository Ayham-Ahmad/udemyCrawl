By the end of this course you will have made a beautiful 3D modern house. The first section of this course will be focused on modeling our modern house. Over the next couple sections we will be adding materials, textures, modeling and lighting to our scene. I will then show you how to render your image and post process it.\nThere are a couple bonus videos as well! The first 2 are: How to Create a Clay Version of your Render and how to use the Workbench Engine! After that we jump into the real-time render engine Eevee and learn setup our scene using this engine in Blender!\nLearning Blender can be very hard when you first start that's why I built this course for all levels beginner to advanced. I will be showing you step by step on what to do and why we do it. From the basics of modeling to advanced techniques like creating grass with particle systems.\nI have also included 3 bonus sections in this course. The first one is creating a realistic tree in Blender. We will go through how to create an organic looking tree, apply textures and use particle systems to create the branches.\nThe second bonus section is about creating a modern bed! We will learn all about the cloth simulation and how to easily create pillows using it! After that we learn about creating a procedural fabric material!\nFinally the last tutorial I will show you how to create a modern couch in Blender. First thing we will do is model and sculpt it. This will add some creases to make it more realistic. Then, of course, the materials and rendering.\nI will be giving away 15 professionally made models and 5 high resolution textures. You are free to use these models for other scenes but you are not allowed to sell or upload them. By enrolling in this course you agree those conditions.\nWhat you’ll learn\nCreate their own architectural renders using Blender\nTexture and make realistic materials for their own scenes.\nWork comfortably in Blender\nAre there any class requirements or prerequisites?\nStudents need to have Blender installed on their computer.\nIt is recommended that you have a computer mouse.\nPrior knowledge about Blender will be useful but not required.\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone who wants to learn about Blender, 3d, architectural rendering, or photorealism.\nWe will be using the following programs in this course.\nPrograms Used in this Class:\nBlender 3D\nI hope you are excited to jump into this course!

But somewhere along the way, between deadlines, doubt, and rules, we stop listening to it. This course is an invitation to remember.\nI-Genius is not about mastering a tool. It’s about shifting how you see the world—and how you see yourself as a creator. It’s about learning to trust your instincts, play with ideas, and transform what’s inside you into something that speaks to the outside world.\nLed by architect, designer, and educator Moshe Katz, this course combines intuitive sketching, storytelling, and hands-on exercises with the power of artificial intelligence. You’ll learn how to generate visionary ideas and use Artificial Intelligence (AI) not as a replacement, but as a partner in your process—one that supports and expands your imagination.\nFrom abstract words to sketches, from shapes to AI-generated visuals, from object design to emotional storytelling—you’ll learn to bring ideas to life that feel deeply yours. You’ll build concepts rooted in memory, feeling, and intention—and turn them into images, objects, or experiences that surprise even you.\nWhether you’re designing a sculpture, a building, a pastry, or something entirely new, this course will show you that you don’t need to follow a trend to be original. You just need to follow your curiosity.\nAnd in a time when AI is everywhere, this course gives you the most powerful creative advantage: the ability to stay human, while designing what hasn’t been imagined yet.\nI invite all students to ask questions or submit their work here, and I will be happy to provide inspirational feedback and engage one-on-one with each of you to help you bring it one step further and uncover your hidden potential.",

      "description": "How do you design and capture the spirit of the place? In a world driven by speed, surface, and distraction, we are starved for depth. As cities expand and buildings multiply, what’s often missing is the soul, spaces that heal, inspire, and connect us to something greater. Futuristic and Visionary Architecture is a call to return to the essential.\nLed by visionary architect Moshe Katz, this course invites you to reimagine architecture not as a container of life but as a living being that breathes, remembers, and reveals. You’ll learn to see space as sacred, materials as carriers of memory, and light as more than illumination but as meaning.\nThrough a blend of philosophy, design exploration, and visual poetics, Katz guides you to work not only with function and form but with stillness, intuition, ritual, and the unseen. From Japanese shrines and silent thresholds to the curves of a dome or the emptiness of a void, you’ll explore how architecture can elevate the everyday experience into a spiritual act.\nThis is not just a course in design. It’s a futuristic transformation of how we think, feel, and build. Whether you’re an architect, artist, student, or seeker, this course gives you tools to create with more presence, more poetry, and purpose.\nNow, more than ever, the world needs spaces that remind us of who we are and what we belong to. This course is a starting point for the new approach to architecture that will make you a visionary and transform your projects into something completely new.\nI invite all students to ask questions or submit their work here, and I will be happy to provide inspirational feedback and engage one-on-one with each of you to help you bring it one step further and uncover your hidden potential.",

      "description": "In this class, you’ll learn how improve your presentations with the help of photoshop. This class is great for anyone, whether you’re a homeowner looking to freshen up a space or an interior design looking to practice your skills.\nEven if you prefer to draw your visuals by hand, Photoshop can still be useful. For instance, if you’ve created and rendered your own perspective drawings without using CAD software, you can use Photoshop to accentuate and enhance your visuals. You can add lighting effects to give an idea of depth, tone and shade.\nThese skills can be applied to different disciplines within a design context, from garden designs to retail concepts.\nUsing the same tools and techniques, you can render planting plans, garden plans, and even store fronts and product displays.\nThese steps are ordered in such a way as to get you creating the best images in the fastest time possible. If you were looking to do this professionally or churn out really high end images, I would shuffle some of these steps around and put a higher priority on 3D model texture and render settings.\nThe barrier to entry for Photoshop is much less than that of render software. You can iterate and experiment at a much faster rate which is crucial to successful viz. With rendering software, it is too easy to get sucked into the endless search for perfect render settings and waiting hours for images to kick out.",

      "description": "THE PROBLEM\nOften times than not, A lot of beginners have always wanted to learn AutoCAD someway somehow, A lot of people can also use the basic skills of AUTOCAD but can't apply it to real world drawings. The use of AutoCAD is not restricted to drawing lines alone and that is the challenge this course has come to solve. Step up from your comfort of knowing only how to use AutoCAD LINES and COPY commands. This is the only course you need as a beginner to be able to take up drawing projects on your own. Intermediate users can also benefit from this course as it will give you an insight on how you can bring all the tools you have learnt into a real world drawing.\n\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nThe main aim of learning AutoCAD is in its application and as beginners to this course you will not only be able to use the basic tools of AutoCAD comfortably, also you will be able to prepare full construction drawings for clients and even make money from it.\nTHE SKILLS\n1. Drawing of FLOOR PLANS\nIn this section you will learn how to draw basic and complex floor plans, you will also be able to dimension it thoroughly, also we will add various blocks like furniture's, gadgets, toilet fittings, cars into the drawing to make it more detailed. We will go through floor plans for a bungalow building and that of a storey building with two floors.\n2. Drawing of ROOF PLANS\nAfter completing the floor plans we will move to the roof plan and in this section we will learn how to generate both a basic roof plan and a complex one. This is an exciting section for all.\n3. Drawing of ELEVATIONS\nIn this section, we will generate the elevations of each building we are working on making i.e. four in total per drawing. we will learn how to draw the elevations of roofs using the wooden fascia board style and the modern concrete fascia style, we will also beatify our elevations.\n4. Drawing of SECTIONS\nWe will learn how to section the buildings along the x and y directions including the roof. This will then lead us to components of a roof truss of which a lecture has been dedicated too. This will also cover how we can section our staircases and foundations.\n5. Drawing and Planning of STAIRCASE\nAs a designer, it is up to you to plan each and every aspect of a building including the staircase and that is where this section comes in handy. you will be exposed to the various components of a staircase and how they interact with all other building components. This is a very handy tool for everyone. So if you have always being intimidated by staircases this section will help kill you fear.\n6. Plotting of SURVEY PLANS\nUsually before any construction the land to build upon must be available and the land surveyors will go to the site to see the extent of the land that is available for use. This is usually shown on a survey plan or a lot plan. This piece of document is what is handed over to the designer (architect or engineer) as the case maybe and it is your duty to come up with a building that will suit the available land space. We will learn how to plot this piece of drawing in AUTOCAD and in turn use it to develop our site plan/landscaping\n7. PRINTING\nA usual neglect of most random tutorials online, this is the final section where we are going to learn how we can put all our drawings together in sheets and title block and go for printing. I urge you on getting to this section to endeavor to print your work on paper because some errors are better visualized on paper than on the screen.\n***WHAT YOU GET***\nA Full section dedicated to all beginners starting from an introduction to the UI of AUTOCAD\nComprehensive 118 Video Lectures (15hrs in Total)\nAccess to all drawing files and blocks for students use\nQuizzes and lots more\nActive Q&A support\nAll the knowledge to draw for people and make money or take up jobs as a Designer\nAccess to future updates\nWork on real life drawings that will make your own projects easier\nRemember\nTO BE MORE IS TO KNOW MORE, AND TO KNOW MORE IS TO DRAW MORE\nWhy wait? Every day is a missed opportunity.\nClick the “Buy Now” button and become a part of this comprehensive training.",

And as someone involved in Construction work whether it be as a Civil Engineer, Site Engineer, Project manager, and so on you must know how to read these drawings. And learning how to Draw them as well is essential for Structural Detailers and Designers, Design Engineers, and Architects.\nIn this course, you will learn to read and draw Structural drawings in AutoCAD.\n\n\nAfter Completing this course you will be able to:\nRead Structural drawings\nDo Structural Drawings using AutoCAD\nBy the end of this course you will be able to Read and DO:\n\n\nBeam Detailings\nColumn Detailings\nFoundation Detailings\nSlab Detailing\nStair Detailing\nColumn Schedule\nFoundation Schedule\nNaming Grade Beams\nNaming Floor Beams\nNaming Columns\nNaming Foundations\nGeneral Notes\n\n\nYou will also be able to read interpret, understand and edit General Notes in Structural Drawing Sheets. General Notes are very important but yet not too many people know how to read or interpret these essential and helpful documents. I will go through a Standard General Note explaining it and discussing the meanings and use of this note to help you understand General Notes in Structural Drawings.\n\n\nThis course will not only help you to read and draw the structural drawings but will also help you to understand how actually the reinforcement is placed at the site. It will thus, help you prepare the bar bending schedules, give cutting length to the workers, and also prepare running and the final bills. Not only this, if you are a structural designer and want to learn the detailing of structural members, it will also help you to understand the concept of detailing and prepare the detailed drawings after you do the structural analysis and Design.\n\n\nPractice Drawings:\n\n\nThe Practice Drawings are of a Real Project so you will be able to understand the real work as well but since this is a course for learning and for client disclosure the calculations used in this course are solely for learning purposes.\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\nThere are no prerequisites for those who want to learn how to read and interpret Structural Drawings.\nFor those who want to learn Structural Detailing in AutoCAD, the prerequisite is The Complete AutoCAD Course which you will find on my Instructor page or a Basic Knowledge of AutoCAD Software equivalent to the syllabus of The Complete AutoCAD Course.",

      "description": "Welcome to Exterior Design & Landscape Architecture with Generative AI course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to create beautiful exterior and landscape designs using advanced AI technologies. This course will give you a whole new perspective about the future of architecture and you will be fascinated by how far artificial intelligence has advanced in the past few years to the point where you can generate aesthetic designs with only a single click. This technology will enable architects and designers to explore innovative concepts, streamline workflows, and produce high quality designs for their clients. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of generative AI, such as getting to know AI applications in exterior design and landscape architecture, you will learn about AI limitations, and you will also get to see the showcase of exterior designs projects generated by AI. Then, in the next section, we will start the project, the project will be consisted of six main sections, in the first section, you will learn how to create high quality exterior designs for houses and buildings using AI tools like AI Two, Visualize AI, Visoid, Home Design AI, and Spacely AI. In the second section, you will learn how to create stunning landscape design using AI tools like MNL AI and Prome AI. In the third section, you will convert architectural sketches to attractive designs using Render AI, the process will be relatively straightforward, all you need to do is to upload your hand drawn sketch, then AI will automatically transform that into realistic design. Meanwhile, in the fourth section, you will learn how to remodel building design and transfer style, so you can use AI to redesign existing buildings and even more exciting you can apply style from building that you like to another building. In the fifth section, you will convert 2D design to 3D design using Architect Render. This tool is very useful especially for architects and designers who have limited knowledge in 3D softwares like AutoCAD and Revit. Last but not least, in the sixth section, you will learn how to create residential floor plans using Maket AI. These tools will enable you to to generate detailed floor plans quickly and efficiently, incorporating various room layouts, dimensions, and functional spaces.\nFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we utilize generative AI for exterior design and landscape architecture? Well there are many reasons why and let me answer it from the perspective of an architect, generative AI offers unprecedented opportunities to quickly produce numerous designs, optimize spatial arrangements for functionality and aesthetics, and even simulate environmental impacts such as sunlight and wind patterns. These tools not only enhance creativity and innovation in design but also streamline the iterative process, allowing architects to focus more on conceptualization and less on repetitive tasks. In essence, generative AI stands to revolutionize how architects transform design inspiration into user centric products, accelerating the designing process and ensuring more precise execution.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn about AI applications in exterior design and landscape architecture\nLearn how to design modern house using Prome AI\nLearn how to remodel house exterior with Visualize AI\nLearn how to design office building AI Home Renders\nLearn how to generate design concepts for apartment building and shopping center with Spacely AI\nLearn how to redesign house exterior with AI TWO\nLearn how to design townhouse with Visoid\nLearn how to convert sketch to architectural design with Re Render AI\nLearn how to convert 2D architectural design to 3D model\nLearn how to generate 3D exterior design with Skybox AI\nLearn how to design backyard and city park with MNL AI\nLearn how to do style transfer for landscape using Spatia Studio\nLearn how to do landscaping with ReImagine Home\nLearn how to create residential floor plan design with Maket AI\nLearn how to create architectural masterplan with Archi Vinci\nLearn how to do exterior design style transfer using MNL AI",

They wanted to understand the very basics of lighting design. Their this request was always in my mind and i wanted to do something about this.\nAnd I decided to create such a course which covered the very basics of lightings design. And once the basics are covered in the course, we  implement them in practical projects within that course.\nSo here on the same lines i have created this one all course or Complete training in Dialux.\nA brief over view of what you will learn in this course is as follows,\n\n\nYou will start by learning about lighting standards, what they are, who makes them and how to use them.\n\n\nThen we will learn in details about lighting design parameters.\nYou will learn about light sources, CCT, CRI, reflectors, diffusers, louvers and lens.\n\n\nYou will then learn what are lighting design target values, and how they define whether a lighting design project is a pass or fail.\n\n\nAfter gathering all these basics of lighting design, we will move to the practical part of the course.\n\n\nWhere we will implement all the knowledge we have gathered into 3 projects.\n\n\nFirst we will do lighting design of a residential flat.\n\n\nThen we will do lighting design of a big office floor\n\n\nand in the last we will do the lighting design of a retail floor/convenience store.\n\n\nSo as you can see from the overview , there is lot of useful knowledge,  waiting to be learned in this course.\n\n\nSo without any further delay, lets get started with the course.",

      "description": "Increasing demands for urban spaces pushed the environment to grow vertical and compact. High-rise mixed-use development offers solutions to both problems by maximizing the number of people that can live and work on a scarce, fixed amount of available land. The traditional front-lawn houses are cut away and rearranged into skyscrapers, losing their greenness and their “neighborhood”. So, the necessity of mixed- use developments integrating plants and bio-climatic design principles has come up.\nThis COURSE explores the design issues and goals in high-rise mixed-use development. The designing and planning of high-rise mixed-use development involve consideration of all prevailing conditions and is usually guided by the local byelaws. The various functional needs, efficiency, economy, energy conservation, aesthetics, technology, fire and life safety solution, vertical transportation, human comforts, operation and maintenance practices, provision of future growth are some of the main factors to be incorporated in the design.\nThis COURSE has been emphasized on integration of plants into skyscrapers and applying bioclimatic design principles which play a vital role for the energy conservation by the building as well as improving the living quality into these vertical cities. Throughout this study, we establish the necessity of planting to incorporate into skyscrapers, for the wellbeing of our economy, society and the environment.\nBecause of their height and their large occupant populations, high-rises require the careful provision of life-safety systems. Fire-prevention standards should be strict, and provisions for adequate means of egress in case of fire, power failure, or other accident should be provided. Although originally designed for commercial purposes, many high-rises are now planned for multiple uses. The combination of office, residential, retail, and hotel space is common. Rest of the details about the concept, structures, services and other firefighting norms, we will check out in this course. Once again welcome you all to the course on a guide to high rise building design. Thank you.",

These principles are a set of guidelines to creating visually attractive gardens and mastering these principles is one of the essential skills of a becoming garden designer.\n\n\nAt the start this course I set out four aims.\n\n\nFirst of all, I’ll clarify the meaning of each garden design principle and draw parallels with their use in other areas of art and design. These principles are part of the language that garden designers and landscape architects use, and each has a specific meaning which is important to understand for anyone who has an interest in garden design.\n\n\nSecondly, I’ll explain why these principles are important in creating inspiring and beautiful gardens and this will be illustrated by examples of how the principles have been used by famous garden designers.\n\n\nThirdly, I’ll demonstrate how to use these principles in your own garden designs and how I have used them in my own designs.\n\n\nAnd the final aim is to show how design principles can be used to assess the design quality of gardens of any size or style. This will be illustrated by showing how the eight principles contribute to the visual attractiveness of nine separate gardens.\n\n\nSo by the end of this course you will have learnt the meaning of each design principles and their importance in the design of gardens, know how to apply them in your own designs, and understand how they can be used to assess the design quality of other gardens.\n\n\nThe presentation of this course includes more than 100 slides comprising photos, sketches, illustrations, plans and diagrams, together with notes and bullet points summarising the main points of the commentary. And throughout the course are a number of tasks and exercises to help you understand and apply the principles of design, together with quizzes at regular intervals to test your knowledge of what has already taught.\n\n\nPlease have a look at the contents of this course and check that it covers the subjects you are interested in. For example, this course does not cover subjects such as planting design, gardening techniques, construction detailing, building and client contracts or starting your own design practice.\n\n\nYou can take this course either on its own or as part of ‘The Complete Garden Design Course’ series of courses which will give you a thorough grounding in the art of garden design. After completing this series of courses, you will have learnt all the skills you will need to confidently undertake your own garden design projects.",
      "target_audience": [
        "This course has been written for anyone who wants to understand how original and beautiful gardens are designed. You may be someone who wants to know how to design your own garden, or someone who is interested in starting a career in garden design, or a student studying garden design. Or you may be working as a gardener, a garden contractor, a garden designer or a landscape architect."

What i realized is that you only need to know approximately 80 to 100 commands to model any geometry that your architecture journey will put before you.\nIn this course i will cover 130 commands which will give you a solid toolbox to generate the simple but also the more advanced massing.\nAt the end of each chapter, you will see a workflow consolidation course. This is where you will gradually enrich your shortcut skills and efficiency in using the software. This is an important step that will help you save a lot of time in your modeling.\nSince Rhino rendering isn't the best. I added a course using a free software that is way more appropriate for designers. With a minimum amount of effort, you can get out amazing images and save a lot of time on designing instead of setting up lighting, texture, people etc...\nFinally you will learn how to get the most out of your 3D model for diagrams by playing with the Rhino Display Mode. Texture Mapping, adding shadows, play with line-weight etc..\nWe will also see how to slice your model and generate Layout with annotations.\nA 100% of what you see in the presentation video is extracted from the course.\nThis course is appropriate for all levels, even for absolute beginner.\nI will be using Rhino 8 for PC. Mac users, and or PC users with lower Rhino versions can still follow the class as more than 90% of the commands will be the same. However, for the rendering software i am presenting in Chapter 9, Mac users will not be able to use it as it is not compatible.",

You need to learn just the essentials without those turnings and turnings, and in a new method? Then, this unique tutorial is what you demand.\nClear, concise, and with illustrations, it will change your thinking about AutoCAD.\nWith a special course dedicated to Architects and related specialization students, all the technical wording needed with a very easy and simple language to assimilate for all levels, without the boring stuff of others’.\nGrip your copy now and become an Expert today!\nMy big e-Book of PRACTICING AutoCAD is designed to meet the needs of a wide range of computer users working with the world’s most popular Computer-Aided Design software.\nThe latest releases of the AutoCAD program provide an extraordinarily rich environment, with some elements that everyone uses, as well as features that may be essential to some users but of no interest to others.\nTherefore, while you read this e-book from beginning to end, all of you may not need to read every chapter. The table of contents will guide you to the subjects you’re looking for.\n· Beginners. Even if you have only a little familiarity with computer language and its basic terminology, this book will start you working with AutoCAD. You will find step-by-step instructions for all the operations involved in getting started and in basic drafting, along with clear explanations of essential concepts and commands. You will need to start with the very beginning of this e-book, the first Section: Learning AutoCAD Basics — Introduction, which covers the basics.\n\n\n· Intermediate Users. You already know how to do routine tasks in AutoCAD. You are comfortable with AutoCAD and day-to-day basic drafting. You also know that there is always more to learn about working more efficiently, and you want to get up to speed on the new AutoCAD features. You may also want to start creating 3D models. If so, Chapter Six should be your target for Creating 3D Architectural Models.\n\n\n· Power and Advanced Users. It might be ridiculous pretending to cover advanced AutoCAD topics in this e-book. Programmers and Administrators' experts won’t find what there’re looking for unless some minimal and simple features. However, Section Seven: Learning AutoCAD Rendering provides some advanced features.\n\n\nFinally, this tutorial is for people using AutoCAD in any environment. Either, if you are in a small office or a home-office user, i.e. working with a stand-alone computer or a simple peer-to-peer network with no administrators or CAD Managers to rely on.\nIf that is your case, you might find plenty of useful information about customizing AutoCAD for New Users Working in Companies and learn how to automate some tasks.\nOr you may be working with a larger company and simply want to gain a deeper understanding of advanced features in AutoCAD.",

It is a widely used software in the world, in particular by architects, landscapers but also for the presentation of events, the design of 3D objects. SketchUp models are made up of lines and faces. A non parametric 3D modeling software. In SketchUp, you are not limited to creating walls, slabs, roofs ... You draw edges which, when they touch at the ends in a closed outline and when they are located in the same plane, create automatically one side.\n\n\nAdvantages of Sketchup\n- SketchUp is simple fast and intuitive software compared to other 3D modeling software.\n- You can already make simple models after only a few hours of learning.\n- SketchUp makes it possible to produce models made up of few faces.\n- Due to its non parametric modeling principle, SketchUp is suitable for a large number of uses.\n- It has a large collection of free components with the 3D Warehouse.\n- There are a large number of plugins, many of which are free like Twilight rendering to create realistic renderings.\n\n\nTraining course\nIn this training you will learn Sketchup Pro from the start. Through a step by step learning process, you will be able, at the end of the training, to work entirely on Sketchup by yourself to succeed in your projects. After getting started with a good basics with the workspace, you will learn the design tools with concrete examples. Then, we can switch to learning components, materials, the creation of scenes and much more. A general project will be discussed at the end of the training, with the creation of a basic house, step by step, allowing to see all the elements of the course.",

Through explanatory texts, images and videos, we will be in constant communication over the Internet, solving and analyzing all necessary problems. Let's build the best possible boat together.\n\n\nWishing you to be one of the best in the world in this field.\n\n\nBest Regards\n\n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR ISO 12215 SCANTLNG COURSE\n\n\nThe regulations for boat scantling and the recommended practices for small boats differ significantly from one another, which limits the general acceptance of scantling for these boats worldwide. This is the reason that led to the preparation of ISO 12215 standards.\nClassification Society Regulations, in general, were not intended for application to boats less than 24 meters long. Although most of them have gradually incorporated rules for yachts and special boats, the limitation for length still persists.\nISO standards for small boats have filled that gap, that territory where there were no specific guidelines or unique criteria. A large number of ISO standards have been published for small boats that practically cover all aspects of their design. Currently, small boats are not only understood as recreational boats but also as commercial recreational boats or working boats, ranging from 2 meters to 24 meters in length.\nRecreational boating has experienced extraordinary growth in the last 15 or 20 years, which has created the need to regulate it, thinking mainly about its safety. One of the most neglected aspects in the design of small boats, which greatly affects their safety, has been the calculation of their structures.\nThat guide, regarding the calculation of scantlings, is ISO 12215.\nISO 12215 provides instructions for determining the various stresses on the hull of boats, their appendages and rigging (in the case of sailboats), and the criteria that make them acceptable.\nIt is not easy to find good structure engineers in the naval industry. Still, since ships must be built, we will have to resort to two possible solutions:\n\n\n1-Specializing in structure calculation by acquiring in-depth theoretical knowledge, allowing us to understand and handle finite element analysis methods, the boundary element method, etc.\n2-With good basic knowledge, use the regulations that Classification Societies or ISO Standards put at our disposal.\n\n\nThe first solution, in addition to very deep technical knowledge, requires handling modeling programs for the preparation of very accurate 3D models. If the model is not good enough, the results will not be valid.\n\n\nThe second solution is the one most designers must resort to. And it is for these professionals that this course focused on ISO Standards has been designed. The reality is that it is not easy to assimilate the procedures followed by them since they do not usually give too many explanations. The initial objective will be to explain how these calculations are carried out, the procedures to follow according to the cases, and the applicable formulas, ensuring their correctness and accuracy. But the ultimate goal will be to analyze the results obtained with sufficient criteria to be able to adopt the best possible solution, which is always various.\nTherefore, the course explains ISO 12215-5, helps to analyze the results obtained with it, and explains why some solutions are more suitable than others. In the end, like SCT software programs can be used to perform the manual work, simple mathematical operations that are not difficult but exhausting. (The designer must be able to use his time to design, think, create, while the mechanical, non-creative work must be done by the machine. This software allows us to do quick calculations, explore different solutions and optimize our structure.)\nAll of this is what can be expected from a course on boat framing in a first appreciation. But \"scantling a boat\" involves something more:\nDesigning the structure, that is, specifying the elements that it will have, their location on the hull, their connections between them.\nThese elements must guarantee:\ncontinuity (no sudden changes in geometry - heights and widths)\nalignment (all members should be aligned and following each other)\ncapability (able to withstand applied loads)\nDialoguing with the builder to design the structure that suits him best.\nProviding all the necessary information, plans, lists, calculations, etc., to obtain the approval of the regulatory agency.\nDetailed information to be able to make the construction plans of the boat from it.\nThe student of this course, regardless of their initial technical qualification, will be able to carry out all the related work once it is completed:\nWith the assurance that their structure complies with the SOR (Statement of Requirements) of the boat in the best possible way.\nObtaining very precise information about weights and centers of gravity, which will allow for more accurate naval architecture calculations.\nEnabling the preparation of construction plans.\n\n\nWe wish you pleasant learning.\n\n\nBest Regards",

All the processes will be the same and if I use a component from the UK library that isn’t available in your library, I will always suggest one for you.\nAs with BIM, you work solely on one single project, so I have constructed this course in the same way.\nIf you do not have previous experience with Revit or any CAD-based software, don’t worry. I will start off from the beginning building you up to be more than capable of creating your own Revit models.\nThe course will start off by giving a brief introduction to the fundamentals of a building, what BIM is, and then moving onto the basics of Revit; from the terminology that Revit uses to the tools and interface.\nWe will then begin to build on our project, introducing a new tool and feature as we progress.\nAdding in the datum elements, such as the levels and grids.\nStructural components, such as the Structural and Architectural columns\nMajor and Minor Components like the; walls, windows, doors, floors, stairs, ceilings, curtain walls, and roofs.\nWe will then take it to the next level and learn how to create 2D details, how to tag the components, create schedules & legends, creating render images and video walkthroughs.\nFinally, we will set up our sheets and send it to print.\nAlongside the videos, I have supplied you with course notes to follow along with as well as some files to work with.\nAs a recap, I have added a quiz to every section. This won’t affect your final certificate but will refresh what you have just learned.\nOnce you complete the course, why not test out your new skills by taking the final exam, consisting of 40 questions!\n\n\nFinally, I continually update this course to keep it up to date with the new releases as well as add new videos.\nI look forward to seeing you in class!",

In other words, NZEBs have zero dependency on fossil fuels.\nIn terms of specific metrics, there are several ways to define an NZEB such as Site-NZEB, source-NZEB, Cost-NZEB and Emissions-NZEB. A project may choose to define their NZEB based on the goals set by the team. Meeting NZEB goals is a key strategy for the building sector to mitigate its impacts on climate change and global warming.\nThis course will give you an in-depth understanding of the different definitions of NZEBs and the different steps involved in achieving NZEB goals. Detailed examples of NZEBs from the world over will further reinforce your understanding of the concept. Finally, you’ll understand the different roadmaps that governments and international bodies are laying out to promote NZEBs.\nThe comprehensive course content is organized in six modules engaging you in a learning experience that’s fun and insightful at the same time.

The ArchiMate Specification provides instruments to enable Enterprise Architects to describe, analyze, and visualize the relationships among business domains in an unambiguous way.\nJust as an architectural drawing in classical building architecture describes the various aspects of the construction and use of a building, the ArchiMate Specification defines a common language for describing the construction and operation of business processes, organizational structures, information flows, IT systems, and technical infrastructure. This insight helps stakeholders to design, assess, and communicate the consequences of decisions and changes within and between these business domains.\nArchiMate Cookbook - authored by Eero Hosiaisluoma - covers ArchiMate patterns and examples, those of which can be used as recipes and inspiration sources when modelling concepts and solutions related to the development work of an organization. This document introduces the most useful diagram types and related ArchiMate-elements. This subset of ArchiMate-elements is grouped into the layers of ArchiMate Framework.\nI'll go through the Cookbook and demo every detail view's modeling using Archi - an Open-Source ArchiMate Modeling Tool, enjoy!\nNote: the source code are available in both Github and Gitee repository.",

With my other Revit and Robot courses you will have a complete view of BIM. Remember that BIM is not a program, it is a working method based on new technologies. Nobody tells you that and therefore you might think that to know BIM you only need to know how to model in Revit. But this is false, and that's why many do not get the expected results despite spending thousands of dollars on training and software.\nWith this course you will learn to use BIM throughout the life cycle of the project, at the same time that you will be able to work in practical and guided exercises on the programs.\n#AulaGEO\nThe AulaGeo team worked hard on this course.

I am teaching you how to navigate a programming tool called Dynamo to solve any problem you may encounter. you are not buying knowledge from me, that an Ai can provide, instead you are acquiring a Dynamo problem solving mindset from me.\n\n\nIn this Dynamo course, you'll gain the tools you need to navigate any dynamo problem you may encounter.\nParticularly one thing will stand out in the Fundamentals section: it  will be list management (these will be seen throughout the course too)\nList Management is an ESSENTIAL skill that many teachers overlook and expect you to just know it. if you can manage a complex list in Dynamo you can perform just about any operation you can imagine, WE DIG DEEP INTO LIST MANAGEMENT AND LIST LACING AND COMPLEX LISTS throughout the course.\n\n\nIn this course you will understand the logic behind parametric facades, as we will be doing the same thing in two different methods in Dynamo Revit.

      "description": "In this course we’ll develop a clear and easy to follow workflow to bring hand drawn architectural sketches from the drafting table and onto the computer. The methodology involves the development of a targeted range of skills in AutoCad and Photoshop.\nWe begin with a brief discussion about the nature of architectural drawing and note the important distinction to be made between ‘presentation’ and ‘production/working’ modes. In this course we focus exclusively on presentation drawings: we’re interested in acquiring skills to express design ideas.\nBeginning with AutoCad we learn the surprisingly limited number of skills required to draw plans, sections and elevations (in metric as well as imperial) to generate the linework necessary for transition to Photoshop for rendering.\nOnce in Photoshop, we focus on the ‘layer’’ function with specific reference to its usefulness in rendering architectural drawings.\nSkills in both AutoCad and Photoshop are developed through reference to a specific architectural project – a small pottery studio of an appropriately manageable size.\nAt the end of this course we’ll have generated a professional type presentation sheet (in this instance it happens to be a metric A1 but it could just as easily be a 24 x 36) with fully rendered plans, sections and elevations of the pottery studio arranged and labelled using standard architectural conventions.\nThe course is designed for absolute beginners. It might be particularly suitable for\nstudents starting out in architecture school\npeople considering architecture as their career\narchitects of a certain generation who missed the initial transition from the drafting table to computer\nAll the files used during the making of this course (dwg, png, jpg, etc.) are fully available and downloadable for use.\nAbsolutely no previous experience in CAD or image manipulation is required but you will need access to working versions of both AutoCad and Photoshop.",

It provides a comprehensive and structured approach to guiding Revit designers through key project phases, including Schematic Design, Design Development, and Construction Documentation. These stages are essential to the architectural design process, and the course ensures that participants understand how to efficiently manage and navigate through them using Revit’s tools and features.\nOne of the key highlights of the course is the provision of a BIM Execution Plan (BEP) template. This valuable resource serves as a reference to ensure that all stakeholders involved in a project are aligned with the same objectives, protocols, and expectations. In addition to the BEP, participants will be guided through the process of creating and managing record documents, which are vital for the project closeout phase. These documents ensure that accurate and up-to-date information is maintained for future use and reference, making them crucial for the long-term success of any project.\nTo complement the theoretical aspects of the course, participants will also have access to a series of step-by-step training videos. These tutorials demonstrate how to set up a Revit model from scratch, covering everything from initial project setup to advanced features. The videos provide practical examples and hands-on exercises to reinforce the learning experience, ensuring that participants can confidently apply their knowledge to real-world projects.\nThroughout the course, a strong emphasis is placed on efficiency and best practices. Participants will learn how to leverage Revit’s powerful tools to streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and reduce errors. By the end of the course, consultants will have gained the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively manage BIM workflows across all project phases, positioning them as valuable assets within any architectural project team.",

      "description": "Vastu Shastra are the original instructions on how to create the space in the Universe and learn us how to harmonize with the higher principles of the Universe, our Earth and our body. In the space created in this way, one feels happy and harmonized.  Vastu Shastra is a part of the ancient Vedas (knowledge leading to God) which were not created by man.Vedas are the perfect manual for life directly from the creator.\nThis class is divided into 3 main sections, where we try to explain in simplicity:\nEnergetic laws - what types of energies enter our home (property), how do they affect the dwellers and how to work with them.\nGeometric laws deal with the exact proportions and scale of a building (property), their derivation from the universal scale, as well as the practical calculations of the exact dimensions of a house (property). This section also addresses energetic lines, meridians of buildings, marma points of the building and how to respect them when creating space.\nInformative laws deal with individual segments of a building (property), its functional division based on the cardinal points, vedic astrology as well as other criteria with the influence over the quality of housing.\nThe title of this class \"Vastu Shastra\" - the older sister of Feng Shui\" should be taken with a pinch of salt.\nFeng Shui is 2000 years old, but Vastu Shastra is as old as the whole Universe. Feng Shui as many other disciplines  is created for the age of Kali yuga, where we are supposed to suffer, be in chaos, not understand well. Kali Yuga is the age when we all are doomed to be dumb. And all the tools, different religions, philosophies, everything we are involved in on this planet is only meant to lead us astray. On the other hand, the ancient Vedas are crystal clear manual directly from the source to give us the guidance in these hard times. Nevertheless, Vedas, Vastu, Ayurveda, Astrology (Jyotish) can only alleviate our suffering on this planet, but not solve the biggest problem..... Guess what it is.",

In order for you to get the most out of this course, it includes solved examples to apply what you have learnt and quizzes so you can check your level of understanding after each chapter.\nWe will start by introducing you to the very basic concepts of energy efficiency, regardless of the subject that you may have studied (or not) in the university. All you need is an interest in energy-efficient construction.\nThis course has been designed to be concise and compact. It is the author's opinion that lectures do not have to be endless and cumbersome, but rather instill an interest and an \"energy efficiency\" mentality to the student. External resources are extensively recommended throughout the course, so that the student can actively do her/his personal research.\nYours respectfully,\nGeorge Xanthoulis\nCivil Engineering Consultant | Udemy Instructor",

After completing the course you can report your credit towards LEED credential maintenance.\nUsing daylight in buildings is a key strategy for passive design. Efficient daylighting schemes help achieve comfort by offering optimum illumination, excellent color-rendering; avoiding glare and excessive brightness ratios which has a positive impact on occupant health and well being.\nThis course will discuss strategies that are necessary to be implemented during conceptual design to integrate the right elements for daylighting. These are simple yet very important elements that need to be decided at the very beginning to steer the design in the right direction. For example, carefully orienting the building for solar access, and controlling the quality and quantity of light as it enters inside a space.\nSince most of the light that enters buildings is through windows and skylights, comprehending the set of strategies for effective fenestration design would make one’s job easier at the early design stage. These thumb-rules do not require many calculations but it does impact the overall building form, volume and space planning. This course also enumerates many interesting projects that showcase the successful integration of daylight for enhancing the character of a space.\nThe entire lecture is structured in 7 modules with highly visual and engaging content.  At the end of the course, you will walk away with knowledge that you can apply in your work.",

Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the work of John Holland in the early 1970s, and particularly his book Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems (1975). His work originated with studies of cellular automata, conducted by Holland and his students at the University of Michigan. Holland introduced a formalized framework for predicting the quality of the next generation, known as Holland's Schema Theorem. Research in GAs remained largely theoretical until the mid-1980s, when The First International Conference on Genetic Algorithms was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n\nThese will be the topics that we will see during this project:\n\n\nCreate a tower from a polygon and assign glass material for rapid prototyping rendering.\nCreate a responsive façade and assign materials to these façades.\nWe will generate an attractor and several point attractors in response to this responsive facade.\nExplanation of the genetic and evolutionary algorithms using Galapagos and Biomorpher\nWe will incorporate the sunshine of a specific place using Ladybug\nWe will incorporate the annual solar incidence and by specific dates using Ladybug\nWe will see in greater detail the application of genetic and evolutionary algorithms, taking into account the annual solar incidence to see the response of this facade and review the characteristics that can be modified and maximized using artificial intelligence.",

      "description": "Technical drawing is the rational, problem solving part of architecture drawing and is the corner stone for developing a strong, capable and precise problem solving mind and a logical, concrete results-based approach in architecture.\nDon’t believe me?\nHow many times did you have a hard time understanding how a volume looks in three dimensions? How many times did you struggle to problem solve functional aspects of your designs? How many times did you struggle to make you ideas take shape on paper?\nCome on, let’s be honest: do you think these things happen because of accident or ‘bad luck’ or there’s a underlying lack in skill set? Look, it is not your fault that you do not know these things – this is why you are reading this, because you want to get better and unleash your true potential on that drawing board!\nIn this course you will learn:\nHow to draw basic axonometrics and simple shapes such as even triangles and ellipses in multiple coordinate systems.\nUnderstand and represent all the basic, standard volumes in triple projection and axonometric and the logic behind their shading and cast shadows.\nHow to correctly construct shadows for all your axonometrics and three dimensional drawings.\nDraw a cube perfectly ballanced on its spatial diagonal in triple projectio nand axonometric.\nDevelop spatial vision with efficient spatial vision-building exercises.\nDraw complex primitives with their specific sections for a cone and octhedron.\nA detailed introduction to descriptive geometry.\nEssential drawing exercises that will 'get you smarter' and 'get your problem solving twice as fast'.\nThe four types of axonometric that you will encounter in 99.99% of all your architecture work from now on.\nThis is how you will change and grow after finishing this course:\nMaster technical drawing in triple projection and various types of axonometric, be able to draw 90% of architecture you come by in your career in two dimensional or three dimensional architecture.\nGet much more proficient in the rational part of design work - unlock your architectural rational problem solving part of your brain.\nBecome much more organised and balanced in your artistic drawings (learning technical drawing will get you insane results in your freehand drawing as well).\nTo sum things up, this is what you will get:\nFull lifetime access to this training and all the future updates.\nOver 20 hours of HD-quality video content.\n90 videos teaching you 9 essential lessons to learn architectural technical drawing.\n18 video crits that show you how your work should look like.\n9 printer-ready PDFs.\n100% satisfaction guarantee, 30-day refund to back everything up\nLook, I want this course to be the best investment you ever made in your professional career. I am most definitely not perfect, but I do believe my courses are the best in the world! But hey, if for any reason the course isn’t what you expected, then feel free to ask me for a 100%, no hassle, no-questions-asked refund for the first 30 days! Fair is fair, you tried the training, it didn’t rise to the level of expectation so you get all your money back (and you can even keep the training, that is fine).\nNote:\nAlthough I present this course as a introduction, is surpasses the the usual standard of what would qualify as ‘difficult’ in terms of architectural drawing (that is fine, you need to aim higher and want to really get good at this!) You might get the feeling of your head hurting or spinning whilst reading this text or going through the exercises. That is fine as well, it is an indicator that the process of neurogenesis got started and you are learning at a very deep level. If you want to take your drawing technique to even higher levels after and become the top 2% of the architecture field, then I recommend after you finish this course you jump to the advanced and mastery trainings!\nOk, all of that being said and done, I look forward to getting you the great results in technical drawing that I am sure you always wanted but could not come by. (and I am sure you can’t wait to get past all the mental blockages and unleash your true technical drawing potential!)\nClick on the ‘Enroll Now’ button and I will see you on the inside!\nMichael N",

This class is great for anyone, whether you’re a homeowner looking to freshen up a space or an interior design looking to practice your skills.\nEven if you prefer to draw your visuals by hand, Photoshop can still be useful. For instance, if you’ve created and rendered your own perspective drawings without using CAD software, you can use Photoshop to accentuate and enhance your visuals. You can add lighting effects to give an idea of depth, tone and shade.\nThese skills can be applied to different disciplines within a design context, from garden designs to retail concepts.\nUsing the same tools and techniques, you can render planting plans, garden plans, and even store fronts and product displays.\nThese steps are ordered in such a way as to get you creating the best images in the fastest time possible. If you were looking to do this professionally or churn out really high end images, I would shuffle some of these steps around and put a higher priority on 3D model texture and render settings.\nThe barrier to entry for Photoshop is much less than that of render software. You can iterate and experiment at a much faster rate which is crucial to successful viz. With rendering software, it is too easy to get sucked into the endless search for perfect render settings and waiting hours for images to kick out.",

      "description": "Learn skill to earn the skill.\n\n\nAutoCAD is a prime product of Autodesk. AutoCAD is the most prominent product used globally for 2D work. AutoCAD applications can be found in different engineering disciplines like Civil, Mechanical, Architecture, Electrical, Electronics, etc. But this AutoCAD course is not designed from AutoCAD Mechanical, Electrical, or Electronics perspective. This AutoCAD course is limited to AutoCAD Civil, and Architectural disciplines only.\n\n\nThis is an AutoCAD 2D course and it doesn't cover AutoCAD 3D. So we'll work in the Drafting & Annotation workspace which is a 2D workspace in AutoCAD. This AutoCAD course will be started with 'Introduction of AutoCAD Interface'. We will try to cover each & every 2D command which later on is going to be used in the project. Once we get the expertise in using AutoCAD 2D commands then we will start working on the project & will create a complete 3 BHK ground+1 story 2D House Plan, along with Front Elevation, Side Elevation & Sectional Elevation in AutoCAD. We'll create a Location Plan, Site Plan, & Column Layout Plan as well. Other than these definitely we'll have more work on the Floor Plan & for every new task separate video tutorial is made. We'll work according to the submission drawing & print the submission drawing as well. Also, we will see how to use external references & how to digitize any plan in AutoCAD.\n\n\nBefore starting the project we'll learn about different design considerations which are necessary to learn before designing any residential building. This is not about AutoCAD so even if you create a drawing by hand on paper or if you are supervising the construction work you must have some knowledge about these design considerations. Don't miss this lecture! This is a short but very important lecture.\n\n\nThis course is not just limited to AutoCAD 2D. We'll also learn about Isometric Drafting & Orthographic Projection in AutoCAD. A separate section is made about Isometric Drafting & Orthographic Projection in AutoCAD.\n\n\nThis AutoCAD 2D course has a total of 95 video tutorials with a total length of more than 18 hours. This AutoCAD 2D course is designed by assuming that you are using AutoCAD for the very first time & don't have any previous knowledge or never worked before in AutoCAD.\n\n\nThis course is designed in AutoCAD 2017 version but it can be easily learned in almost any older or latest version of AutoCAD.\nSome files are attached as resources you can download and use.\n\n\nThis AutoCAD course is divided into the following sections:\n\n\nAutoCAD presets\nDraw Toolbar\nModify Toolbar\nStatus Bar Keys\nText command in AutoCAD\nTable command in AutoCAD\nDimensioning the Drawing File\nMulti Leader Command\nBlock & Group\nObject Properties\nLayer Properties\nAutoCAD Utilities\nIsometric & Orthographic projection\nResidential Building Design\nLocation Plan & Site Plan\nWorking on Floor Plan\nWorking on 2D Elevation\nColumn Layout Plan\nCompass & Title Block\nPrinting AutoCAD Drawing\nExternal References & Digitization of Plan\n\n\nThere are plenty of topics under these sections in separate videos. I will suggest must go through all the videos. Don't skip if you properly want to get the outcome of this course.\n\n\nNote: Please go through all the topic titles before enrolling in this course. Also, I tried to explain the course content in the description as well & have made enough videos available for free preview so that you can decide if you should get this course or not. I recommend joining the course only if you think this course matches your expectations.\n\n\nSo, If You are Fully Satisfied Hit the 'Enroll Now' Button & Enjoy the AutoCAD Training. Happy Learning!",

So first we will learn the Revit basics of how to start a new project, setting up templates, and linking the designed drawings into our live model and creating views and levels, then we will learn how to create 3D models and all the tips, tricks and shortcuts needed to perform the work faster. then we will extract the shop drawings from the coordinated model and we will learn how to create schedules for the structural categories, then we will reflect the site progress on the structural model then we will extract progress monitoring report for all structural elements. then we will use Navisworks to connect the activities schedule and cost with the structural model to have the 4D and 5D simulation. This course is aimed at complete beginners who have never used Revit before and want to increase their career options by learning Revit Structure. The ideal students for this course are the Structural engineers, BIM engineers, BIM drafters.",

(i.e., if the 2D layout in autocad is Metric, Revit should be in Metric as well to avoid any inconsistency which is a good practice to learn at the start if you plan to work as a Modeler/Designer and take part in large projects).\nFrom there, much like any CAD software we will start with a Grid system that will help align the elements or objects on a sequenced columns and rows.\nNext would be defining the Levels, as this helps us view information that floor plans cannot convey.\nWe would also be tackling the Detail Level and Visual Style of our model that will show more clarity for our whether it is in 2D or in 3D.\nLastly, to fit in the 1-Hour Crash Course, the Discipline of Architectural and Structural will be in one Model only instead of being separated as it would be done in real-life.\nAgain, no prior knowledge of any CAD software are needed.",

Learning Archicad can be challenging, especially when you do not have the right resources and guidance. Whether you are a student looking into utilising Archicad to complete your school project or an employee who wants to impress their boss with superb Archicad skills; I will take you through from creating a new project to publishing your drawings.\nWhat You Will Learn\nLearn and master high-demand computer-aided design skills with this comprehensive and in-depth course.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to do the following:\nCreate an Archicad project\nDevelop a comprehensive architectural floor plan\nDocument 2D elevations and building sections\nExtract quantity schedules and reports from the 3D virtual building model\nCreate custom Archicad objects\nPublish your drawings in PDF\nCourse Overview\nARCHICAD® is a Building Information Modelling software developed by Graphisoft. It allows you to develop a virtual building model, that has intelligent construction information linked to it. With different model views, you automatically generate 2D floor plans, elevations, sections, 3D floor plan documents and interactive schedules for quantity take-off and reporting.\nThe course is divided into seven unique sections. A residential house project is used to explain the various concepts and steps that are involved. Therefore, we will be building a project from start to finish.\nThis will cover project creation, a walk-through of the various parts of the user interface, project navigation tips, basic settings, wall modelling, door and window creation and settings, roof modelling, 2D documentation (floor plans, elevations, sections), custom title block creation, layout book settings and publishing to PDF.\nThe following are the main sections as explained above:\nIntroduction\nARCHICAD Navigation Basics\nFloor Plan Creation Basics\nDimensioning\nPublishing Your Drawings\nQuantity Schedules and Reports\nOther Essentials\nMethodology\nI designed this course with the complete beginner in mind. The sections are broken down into step-by-step tutorials taught at a slow pace to make it easy to follow along and understand. With project files and PDF resources for reference, you will be able to work alongside the instructor every step of the way to develop your project from start to finish.",

      "description": "What if architecture could go beyond function and beauty and help us feel better?\nHolistic Architecture and Wellbeing Design is a groundbreaking approach that explores how the spaces we design can become powerful tools for emotional, physical, and spiritual healing. Led by visionary architect Moshe Katz, this course invites you to reimagine architecture as a form of care—a medium that speaks to the soul, relieves stress, fosters connection, and creates calm in a noisy, overwhelming world.\nThis course teaches you how light, sound, movement, color, nature, texture, and technology can be intentionally used as therapeutic design elements. From healing loneliness through design to supporting children’s curiosity and mental well-being, every lesson opens a new perspective on what architecture can do, not just what it should look like.\nYou’ll explore real case studies, reflect on emotional needs in different spaces, and discover how small, thoughtful design decisions can lead to big emotional shifts. You’ll walk away with ideas and a new sense of purpose in your work.\nThis course is for architects, designers, artists, and anyone who believes that space can heal. Learning about Holistic Architecture and Wellbeing Design transforms how you design and elevates your role as a designer. As the demand for wellness-focused environments continues to rise across industries—from education and healthcare to hospitality and urban planning—those who can create spaces that truly support human well-being will stand out.\nThis course gives you a unique, future-forward skill set that blends emotional intelligence with spatial creativity, positioning you as a leader in a growing field. Whether you’re looking to differentiate your portfolio, expand your impact, or simply design with deeper meaning, this course offers a powerful way to shape both your projects and your career with intention.\nI invite all students to ask questions or submit their work here, and I will be happy to provide inspirational feedback and engage one-on-one with each of you to help you bring it one step further and uncover your hidden potential.",

      "description": "This course covers many topics in Generative AI for Research and Development. Generative AI is a revolutionary branch of machine learning that enables machines to create new content, including text, images, music, and even code, based on patterns learned from vast datasets. One of the key components of generative AI is deep learning, particularly neural networks like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer-based models such as OpenAI’s GPT series. These models are trained on extensive datasets and use probabilistic algorithms to generate content that closely resembles human-created work.\nGenerative AI is revolutionizing how content is produced. Writers, designers, and musicians can leverage AI to generate ideas, automate repetitive tasks, or even create complete works of art. AI-powered tools such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Stable Diffusion are being widely adopted for content generation, making creative processes more efficient and accessible.\nGenerative AI continues to evolve, its impact on society will be shaped by how it is regulated and integrated into various industries. While it offers immense opportunities for innovation and efficiency, ethical considerations and responsible AI development must be prioritized. The future of generative AI lies in striking a balance between technological advancement and societal well-being, ensuring that it serves as an augmentation of human creativity rather than a replacement.",

However, starting from basic individual ‘moving elements’ like doors, windows, elevators, etc., technology has helped architects to design buildings that move as a whole or a part. Kinetic elements have more commonly found expression as media and interactive facades. This course covers many interesting examples of facades.\nFurther, integration of kinetics into the façade inorder to modulate daylight, shading and/or ventilation have taken the climate responsive design to the next level. Not only such buildings are interactive, they serve specific functions to enhance occupant comfort with reduced energy use. This course will enumerate interesting projects having climate responsive facades.\nThe dynamic nature of such facades requires that the design process to be iterative assessing numerous design and functional parameters to arrive at a optimized solutions. An example of such a performative design process using a suite of simulation tools is discussed in the last module of the course.\nThe course is structured in 6 modules with two instructors and a moderator. This content is highly visual and engaging. At the end of the course, you can confidently identify what kinetic facades are and the iterative design process that is required to design such facades.",

The Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to operate autonomously, make decisions, and achieve specific objectives. Unlike traditional AI models that follow predefined rules, agentic AI systems exhibit goal-oriented behavior, learning, adapting, and interacting dynamically with their environment. To build such intelligent agents effectively, developers use structured approaches known as agentic AI design patterns. These patterns help create AI systems that are scalable, efficient, and capable of reasoning independently.\nA crucial aspect of agentic AI is learning and adaptation, where agents improve their performance over time. Machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning and continual learning, enable AI to refine its strategies based on past experiences. This pattern is essential in applications like fraud detection, personalized recommendations, and adaptive AI tutors. When multiple AI agents interact, the multi-agent collaboration pattern comes into play. This approach enables multiple intelligent systems to coordinate their actions to achieve a shared objective, commonly seen in swarm robotics, distributed AI, and supply chain automation.\nAgentic AI design patterns provide a structured framework for developing intelligent, autonomous systems. By leveraging goal-driven behavior, hierarchical decision-making, adaptability, and collaboration, AI agents can solve complex problems effectively while ensuring safety and ethical compliance.",

      "description": "What is Earthing or Grounding?\nA safety measure devised to prevent people from getting shocked if the insulation inside electrical devices fails is called Earthing. To answer our initial question, the third pin in the plug is actually the “Earth” or “Ground” connection of the electrical appliance.\nThe Earth, being a good conductor of electricity, acts as a convenient path for the flow of electrons that escape the insulation. Furthermore, the gigantic size of the Earth paves a path for the safe discharge of the electric charge.\nIn technical terms, Electrical Earthing can be defined as the process of transferring the immediate discharge of the electrical energy directly to the Earth with the help of the low-resistance wire. The electrical earthing is carried out by connecting the non-current-carrying part of the equipment or the neutral part of the supply system to the ground.\nAs stated earlier, earthing provides a simple path for the leakage current i.e., the current that escapes from a device if there’s any fault in the insulation. The short circuit current (current that follows the path of least resistance) of the equipment passes to the Earth, which has zero potential, thus protecting the system and equipment from damage.\n\n\nWhy is earthing necessary?\nHuman Safety\nSafety of Electrical Equipment\nProtection of Buildings from Lightning\nTypes of Earthing methods\nPlate earthing\nPipe earthing\nRod earthing\nWater main method\nWhat is a lightning protection system?\nLightning protection systems are used to prevent or lessen lightning strike damage to buildings. They protect the internal electrical components of a building, helping to prevent fires or electrocution. Lightning protection comes in the form of a lightning conductor, usually a metal rod, mounted on a building to protect it from lightning strikes. The system will intercept a strike so if lightning hits the building, the lightning rod will be hit first, causing the strike to be conducted through a wire, and passing through to the ground safely.\nIn a lightning protection system, the lightning rod is a single component of the system. The lightning rod requires a connection to earth to give a building protection. Lightning rods come in many different forms, including hollow, solid, pointed or rounded. All lightning rods are made of conductive materials, such as copper and aluminum.\nBecause of the high energy and current levels associated with lightning a lightning protection system can never guarantee complete safety from the effects of lightning. In a lightning protection system, the current will divide to follow every conductive path to ground but even the divided current can cause damage. These secondary “side-flashes” can still cause a fire, blow apart brick, stone, or concrete, or injure anyone within a building.",

This Vastu knowledge does not explain the was it was written for north hemisphere or south hemisphere. So, question has raised from many vastu consultants and Vastu learning students.\nWhy they questions from south hemisphere countries? Because, 1. North hemisphere has sun travels from east to south to west while in south hemisphere, sun traves from east to north to west. 2. Wind direction in north hemisphere is from northwest while in south hemisphere it is from southeast. 3. In north hemisphere, vastu building aligns with north star while in south hemisphere, building aligns with Polaris star 4. Tectonic plates are moving from many million years. That is why question srise that was Vastu knowledge was written for north or south hemisphere countries.\nAll these answers will be given in this Vastu certificate course for south hemisphere countries. You will learn how five elements of cosmos acts with cosmic plan (Vastu Purusa mandala), how functions orientation and location of Vastu home will change, How selection of slope of the land will change, location of planting trees with direction will change, water bodies location will change, and entrance to land and house will change as well road location will change. Also shape of building will also change for south hemisphere countries.",

      "description": "Note: The main difference in this course compared to others is that we have not confined ourselves to explaining simple techniques. Instead, we have conveyed the subject through challenging projects and specific tricks, which are the result of numerous experiences.\n\n\nDo you think Revit cannot model any form?\nHave you encountered patterns and shapes in your projects but didn't know how to model them in Revit?\nAre you interested in organic and free-form designs and frequently use them in your designs?\nIn this course, we first explain the principles of modeling in Revit and its differences from the project environment. We quickly move on to creating form-based surfaces and learn the basic concepts of modeling in Revit through several examples. Then, we delve into complex forms, and I can say that together we will create any form that you thought might be impossible to model in Revit and practice it.\nNext, we will explore the fascinating topic of parametric modeling. We will model various diverse projects and share numerous tricks with you. To make this course shine, I have also provided examples of openable, closable, and animated forms for you to enjoy.\n\n\nSome of the topics covered in this course include:\nExplanation of MASS and its applications\nModeling techniques in MASS\nExplanation of options, such as 3D Snapping\nDifference between Ref Line and Model Line\nExplanation of Mass in Place\nExplanation of Mass Study (also known as Mass Overlay)\nImporting complex volumes from 3DS Max and Rhino\nExplanation of various patterns and their modeling techniques\nParameterizing patterns and Surfaces\nModeling openable, closable, and animated structures\nIf you are currently a BIM modeler or planning to become one, it is essential not to limit yourself to any form. You should be able to manage any architectural design in the BIM process And in the end, you will be the hero of this training. Please watch this course and feel free to ask me any questions you have while watching it. Additionally, during the learning BIM Process, ask me questions so that I can guide you.",

Vedic Period. The Vedic period or Vedic age (c. 1500 – c. 500 BC), is the period in the history of the northern Indian subcontinent between the end of the urban Indus Valley Civilization and a second urbanization which began in the central Indo-Gangetic Plain c. 600 BC. The Vedic period saw the emergence of a hierarchy of social classes that would remain influential. Vastu defines building of homes or work spaces in synchrony with the natural forces. A Vaastu or Vastu perfect building not only attains complete harmony with natural forces, but also brings in prosperity, good thoughts and sound health to its residents.

You usually learn the fastest if you are going to do a project for yourself and just get started. So the class project is to design your own furniture and I will guide you through the process of making a high quality design.\nFirst we will make a sketch by hand and analyse other similar designs. After that you choose which materials you want to use and we calculate how much you need to buy from the strore.\nThen we will translate your design into a 3D model. I’m gonna give you a quick start course how you can use Sketch Up and how it can help you to create a realistic custom made design and building plan. Which makes building much faster and more precise. And therefore a lot more fun. You encounter fewer mistakes and you will use your time and material super efficiently.\nI will use the example of a pallet chair and I show you how to design and build this with the use of just one pallet.\nThis class is for every creative person who wants to take their design and building skills to a new level.\n\n\nStep 1: Make a moodboard and think about the materials you want to use.\nStep 2: Make at least 1 sketch analysis of a design that resembles what you envision.\nStep 3: Make a final sketch with the right dimensions\nStep 4: Make a list of your materials\nStep 5: Practice using Sketch Up by drawing all the materials from your list and put them in a row from big to small.\nStep 6: Translate your sketch design to a 3d model with your material list in mind and adjust it when necessary.\nStep 7: Finalize your design.\nStep 8: Optimize your design by using your materials list.",

      "description": "In this course “Electrical Drafting | AutoCAD” we have covered the low voltage electrical system, and for the low voltage system, we have designed this course to introduce you, to help you, and to train you in the electrical drafting that will enhance your career and make you a skilled professional design engineer in the field of electrical drafting.\nElectrical drafting is a key role in the Electrical design field. This is a fast-paced program designed to present all major topics related to the design of Electrical Building Services. Learners will learn concept theory of drafting, system design, AutoCAD software, and Electrical services drafting.\nTo make learning easy and interesting, the completed course is divided into three parts:\n1. Basics of the Electrical Drafting\n2. AutoCAD Software\n3. Electrical Services Drafting\nIn the first part we have discussed some basic means of drafting, why the drafting of plans is needed and important and how these drawings are helpful for the world, and also discussed some essential steps that every designer should follow in drafting the plans in AutoCAD or any other software.\nThen in the AutoCAD part, the software will be discussed how to work with AutoCAD, how to make changes in AutoCAD settings, project settings, etc., how to draw figures, how to edit them and modify the existing figures and much more we will explain this part step by step. Then, in the end, you will see the very good command in AutoCAD the Print command, after creating any drawing next you want to share with others or want to print on papers so that you will learn here.\nFinally, in the third part, you will be introduced to the electrical services layouts. Starting with the Electrical Legends where you will learn how to draw electrical symbols in AutoCAD then will move to the Single Line Diagram (SLD) of the low voltage system, this SLD is the heart of the electrical system not only in execution work but it is always important during execution, operation and during maintenance also. After this will come to the lighting layouts, how to draw lighting fixtures layout, how to create normal and power sockets layouts, etc. will be discussed in this topic. Then go for the electrical wiring layouts and in this topic, you will learn how to develop a Lighting Control Wiring layout, conduits layouts, and cable tray layouts. At the final stage, you will be coming for CCTV system layouts, how to draw CCTV legends, where to provide CCTV cameras and where not, how to interconnect them, etc. will be explained in this topic.\nThe uniqueness of this course is that learners will not be explained AutoCAD drawings directly instead first I will talk about that layout means if we have to draw lighting layout so in that topic first, I will explain what is light, types of lighting fixtures, related terms to the lighting designing, etc., then will go for the drafting.\nThis certificate training course introduces the basic range of Electrical Building Services including the topics: Electrical Legends, Lighting Layout, Raw Power Layout, Wiring layouts, Conduit layouts, Cable trays, CCTV Systems, etc. Each topic is presented to demonstrate the “real world” impact of design decisions on resulting system performance.\nThis course has lifetime access, so you can come back and watch the videos anytime, anytime you want.\nI am sure that you will be confident to use the software AutoCAD and draw the electrical plans after you finished this course.\nSo, enroll now and see you in the course…………….",

      "description": "Architectural composition is where the architectural thinking starts getting translated into drawings and future designs. So it is theory and architectural principles expressed into raw creative ideas and then brought to a stable form where you can present them to the world.\nHow many times you got an original idea, but when you put it on paper it ended up looking mediocre and you lost self confidence in your skills because of that? Did you ever notice that your current drawing style somehow misses the mark, like your drawings lack that ‘edge’ of coming across as they are made by an architect? Did you ever wonder how to make all your crazy organic-shaped, blobitecture, ‘zaha hadid’ design ideas end up looking like real buildings?\nWhat you will learn in this course:\nHow to draw all the simple box perspectievs that will give you the fundamental of understanding architectural drawing and how to draw everything in composition.\nCube and prism house as practice for you detailing in freehand sketching and that will set up a solid base for future conceptual work.\nSimple volumes that you will draw in technical drawing and freehand skteches - you will understand their logic and how to use them as builing blocks for your future compositions.\nSimple volumes composition - apply what you learned in the previous lesson in your first proper abstract architectural composition.\nHow to add even more drawing detailing via drawing a real objects composition (this will give you a core feeling about what architectural composition is and how to get it right even when you are using boring day-to-day objects).\nDraw and design your first conceptual composition where you express your abstract self-portrait and get your first introduction to abstract architectural coloring.\nExtend your paradigm of composition to technical drawing and learn how to draw a constructed perspective.\nUse what you previously learned by drawing an abstract composition first in technical drawing (triple projection and axonometric), then draw it in a detailed constructed perspective.\nGet the fundamentals right for abstract composition - your first proper 'weird' composition, expand your creative thinking and architectural graphics.\nHow you will change after finishing this course:\nTranslate your ideas from imagination on to paper and then represent them in stunning hand rendered visuals.\nUpgrade the clarity and expressiveness of your creative ideas, be able to come up with ideas on the spot just by sketching.\nMake any architectural idea look good by applying architectural concepts and theory to it.\nTo sum it up, what you will get with this course:\nFull lifetime access to all the trainings and all future updates.\nOver 20 hours of HD-quality video content.\n90 videos teaching you 9 essential lessons to learn architectural composition.\n18 video crits that show you how your work should look like.\n9 printer-ready PDFs\n100% satisfaction guarantee, 30-day refund to back everything up\nLook, I want this course to be the best investment you ever made in your professional career. I am most definitely not perfect, but I do believe my courses are the best in the world! But hey, if for any reason the course isn’t what you expected, then feel free to ask me for a 100%, no hassle, no-questions-asked refund for the first 30 days! Fair is fair, you tried the training, it didn’t rise to the level of expectation so you get all your money back (and you can even keep the training, that is fine).\nNote: This course is presented as an introduction to architectural composition, but the truth is that it will be very challenging for you, even if you have a lot of experience as an architect. If you are good at the architectural thinking, you will lack in the graphics. If you have previous experience in other graphics media, then you will lack in both and so on… If you want to upgrade everything you ever thought you can produce in architecture and in drawing, then get this course and then progress to the ‘Advanced’ and ‘Mastery’ versions of it!\nI know learning proper architectural composition is an absolute nightmare if you have no direction whatsoever. It comes across as something ‘hit and miss’, and landing a good idea is a matter of good luck, rather than the direct result of a good skill set.\nWe will work together through all the mental and skill set obstacles and you will see, you can make it happen – you can imagine fantastic, elegant architectural compositions and also draw them like a real boss!\nClick on the ‘Add to cart’ button and I will see you on the inside!\nMichael N",

      "description": "Designing high performance, net-zero, green or sustainable buildings involves knowledge, understanding and skills of a wide range of topics from optimising organisation of spaces to passive solar design techniques to computer simulation of occupant thermal comfort. One of these vital topics is airtightness of a buildings envelope.\n\n\nAchieving appropriate airtightness of a building envelope involves addressing issues across all stages of detailed design & specification of the building fabric, services MEP design & specification and testing for client handover. Airtightness is a growing field where an ever increasing number of national building regulations and codes are adopting and tightening their requirements. Airtightness has a direct impact on how much cooling or heating a building needs and as such is a fundamental factor in building performance.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn about the concepts that underpin the understanding airtightness in buildings and how it affects building performance. You will learn all the metrics used internationally to characterise it and how to compute these metrics. You will learn what national building regulations, codes and standards for airtightness are used around the world with country specifics for 19 countries. You will learn how to measure airtightness and be able to differentiate between the three main test measurement methods now in use around the world.\n\n\nWhat you learn in this Part 1 Airtightness course is relevant for all sizes of buildings and all types of construction from timber and bamboo structures to steel framed, brick & block and concrete construction. It is appropriate for a beginner, a student and specialist operating at an advanced level.",

The first step to this is to have clarity on the difference between climate and weather. Learn about different climate variables, global climate zones and the significance of climate responsive design in this course. This is a refresher course on climate fundamentals.\nWe might not be aware that our life revolves around climate. The food we eat, clothes we wear, our culture, the nature around us and our shelters are all influenced by the climate. However, over time, things have changed. Technology has enabled us to be un-responsive to climate. We do not see the same kind of flora and fauna when we travel from one end of the globe to the other. However, our buildings do tend to look similar. Isn’t it ?\nClimate responsive design is integral to building green. This course will equip you with the knowledge and tools that you can use to identify climate responsive design strategies. The concepts covered in the course are best applied during concept design stage; which is crucial to achieve a sustainable outcome.\nThis course is organized in three parts.\nPart 1 is an introduction to the topic. It covers different climate variables, global climate zones and characteristics of each.\nPart 2 will cover free and simple tools that can be used for climate analysis\nPart 3 will cover some advanced tools for climate analysis and application of the concepts covered in the entire course.\nThe course content is designed to bridge theory and practice with practical take-aways from each course.

      "description": "IMPORTANT before enrolling:\nThis course is not intended to replace studying any official vendor material for certification exams, is not endorsed by the certification vendor, and you will not be getting the official certification study material or a voucher as a part of this course.\nWelcome to \"Mastering WELL AP V2: Comprehensive Guide to Healthy Building Standards and Certification.\"\nThis course is meticulously designed to provide a thorough understanding of the WELL Building Standard, focusing on creating healthier, more sustainable, and human-centric built environments.\nWELL Building Standard is a performance-based system for measuring, certifying, and monitoring features of the built environment that impact human health and well-being. Developed by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI), the standard is designed to promote buildings that enhance the health and wellness of their occupants. It is built upon medical research and scientific evidence linking the spaces where people spend their time with their health outcomes, including physical, mental, and emotional well-being.\nIn the introductory phase, we delve into the significance of healthy buildings, exploring how they impact occupant well-being and productivity. We also examine the evolution of building standards, contrasting the WELL standard with LEED, and provide an overview of the WELL Accredited Professional (WELL AP) credential, highlighting its importance and benefits for professionals in the building industry.\nNext, we explore the fundamental concepts of WELL AP V2, including an in-depth look at the seven core WELL concepts: Air, Water, Nourishment, Light, Movement, Thermal Comfort, and Sound. Each lecture within this section provides detailed insights into how these concepts are applied in practice to enhance building performance and occupant health. For instance, we cover air quality and ventilation strategies, water quality and accessibility standards, nourishment guidelines, illumination and its impact on circadian rhythms, and more.\nIn the materials and resources section, we focus on the selection and sourcing of materials, emphasizing health and sustainability. We discuss criteria for choosing materials, mindful sourcing practices, and the role of furniture and furnishings in promoting wellness. Additionally, we explore the principles of biophilia and how incorporating natural elements into design can improve mental and physical well-being.\nWe then move on to strategies for health and well-being in building design. This section provides practical approaches to implementing wellness strategies, including active design principles to encourage movement, techniques for addressing noise and enhancing acoustic comfort, and methods for achieving optimal thermal comfort.\nEvaluation and documentation are critical for achieving WELL certification. This segment covers the WELL certification process in detail, including steps for verifying performance and documenting compliance. We also present case studies of exemplary WELL-certified buildings to illustrate best practices and successful implementations.\nThe course also examines the benefits and returns on investment associated with WELL certification. We explore the economic advantages, such as increased property value and operational savings, as well as the positive impacts on employee health, productivity, and overall sustainability.\nIntegration of WELL AP V2 into building projects is another key focus. We provide guidance on incorporating WELL standards in new construction projects, retrofitting existing buildings for certification, and optimizing interior spaces. Additionally, we discuss the role of WELL APs throughout the construction lifecycle, ensuring that wellness principles are maintained from design through to occupancy.\nFinally, we prepare you for the WELL AP V2 exam with targeted strategies and tips. This comprehensive preparation ensures that you have the knowledge and confidence to achieve your WELL AP credential, positioning you as a leader in the field of healthy building design and construction.\nWELL Building Standard aims to create environments that not only enhance human health but also improve productivity, satisfaction, and overall quality of life.\nJoin me on this journey to mastering WELL AP V2 and make a significant impact on the built environment, fostering health, well-being, and sustainability in every project you undertake.\nThank you",

      "description": "In this online course, you will learn SketchUp Free or also known as SketchUp for Web. You will start from the very basic and then move up gradually to the advanced level. The curriculum is carefully crafted so you will learn SketchUp in the most effective and efficient way. In less than 7 hours, in sha Allah, you will be able to master all the available tools and use them to create a 3D house design from start to finish.\n\n\nWhat you will learn\nThere are so many things you will learn in this online course. There are just too many to explain in this description text. To see the details, you can scroll down to the curriculum section. But, just for a quick summary. This online course consists of 9 chapters, apart from the introduction chapter.\nIn the first chapter, you will learn the interface of SketchUp Free as well as its basic features. You will learn to import 3D models from the 3D warehouse. Then learn how to do navigation, and use different types of \"views\". Next, you'll learn how to use the \"scenes\" feature. And then we will discuss how to change the appearance of the 3D models using \"Styles\". After that, we will discuss various commands related to files. And also learn how to create a \"custom shortcut\".\nIn the second chapter, we will discuss basic 3D modeling techniques. We'll start by learning the line tool. Then discuss the concepts and features of \"inference\" in SketchUp. After that, we will discuss the \"Rectangle\" tool. And then discuss one of the most important tools in SketchUp, called the \"push-pull\" tool. Also in this chapter, we will discuss various object selection techniques. And techniques for deleting objects. Finally, we will cover how to use the \"offset\" tool.\nThe third chapter is a practice chapter. First, we will model a \"planter box\" object. Then create a 3D model of a cabinet. After that, we will try to create a 3d model of a pet house.\nIn the fourth chapter, we will focus on object manipulation and object management techniques available in SketchUp Free. There are many things that we will discuss in this chapter. Some of them are, object transformation, from the basic to advanced techniques. Then, learn how to use \"tags\" to manage 3D objects more easily and quickly. Next, you will learn various duplication techniques. Then learn how to group objects either with the basic \"group\" method or with the more advanced method using \"component\".\nIn the fifth chapter, we will discuss various advanced modeling techniques. You will learn how to use \"Rotated rectangle\". Learn the ins and outs of the \"circle\" tool and the \"polygon\" tool. Then learn the concepts and techniques of smoothing 3D object surfaces. Then, you will learn how to use the \"Freehand\" tool as well as the \"Arc\" tool. And then create 3D text objects. And finally, learn to use the \"follow me\" tool.\nThe sixth chapter is a special chapter for 3D modeling exercises. We will make use of the advanced techniques discussed earlier. We will start by modeling a coffee table. Then learn to model a classic gate. Then learn how to model a \"square pillar\". Next, we will discuss the techniques for creating a double-sided door. Starting by making the door frame, then the door leaf. And finally, we'll create the doorknob. Next, you will learn how to model a book. The last project in chapter six is creating a stair and its railing. You will learn a simple yet effective method for defining the stair steps without doing complex calculations manually.\nThe seventh chapter focuses on discussing measurement and annotation techniques. Here you will learn the \"Tape measure\" tool, and then also the \"protractor\" tool. Next, you will learn different methods for assigning labels such as for dimensions or simply for adding comments. Then, we'll cover how to create cutouts of our 3D model using the \"section plane\". And finally, you will learn how to create \"custom axes\".\nIn chapter eight, you will learn to use materials and textures. In addition to learning to use the materials provided by SketchUp, you will also learn to create your own materials and textures. After that, we will discuss various methods of manipulation for textures that are already attached to 3d object surfaces. We will cover both flat surfaces and also curved surfaces.\nIn the last chapter, or chapter nine. We will create the final project which is a house. We'll start by importing the reference image. Then model the walls. Add windows and doors. Then create the floor, the surrounding area, and also the carport. We will create the roof which will be a double-stacking type. Then make a large canopy that covers the terrace and carport area. Finally, we'll add ornaments for the house facade. In sha Allah, you will be able to create a house 3D model from start to finish if you follow this course from start to finish.\n\n\nSo, don't wait any longer. Join this online course now! and improve your skill in the Architectural field.",

      "description": "Do you know what is meant by clashes?\nAre you aware of the necessity of checking for clashes?\nDo you know how to report the clashes that have occurred in the drawings?\n\nInterferences in construction projects are ongoing challenges, stemming from modeling inconsistencies, project component disparities, and engineering clashes. Unmanaged, these issues can lead to significant costs and resource overruns. Utilizing software like Revit and Navisworks enhances clash detection and resolution. These tools enable users to efficiently identify and address potential clashes.\nThe use of a clash matrix is vital for effective interference management, presenting a consolidated view of possible clashes and facilitating quicker resolution. In a webinar focused on practical solutions for BIM modeling, participants gain insights to improve clash detection and resolution processes, ultimately enhancing project efficiency.\n\n\nHeadlines:\n\nImportance of Clash Management\nTransferring Revit to Navisworks\nStructure of Clash Matrix\nConcept of LOC (Level of Clash/Coordinate)\nCreate Save/Search Sets\nSave Selection and Search Set\nRequirements of Clash Management\nTypes of Clashes\nClash Detective Window\nCreating Animations\nIf you are currently a BIM modeler or planning to become one, it is essential not to limit yourself to any form. You should be able to manage any projects in the BIM process And in the end, you will be the hero of this training.

      "description": "Would you like to create a 3D model of your house? SketchUp is perfect for that!\nThis course will guide you through every process of creating a house from scratch, using only the blueprints that we have available. We will start with creating the exterior, that means creating the floorplan and turning everything into 3D, then we will create the ceiling, the roof, and finally paint the exterior.  After that we will move on to the interior and design the kitchen, stairs and bathrooms all by ourselves. We will also take a look at how to create all sorts of furniture from scratch, and thereby only using the 3D warehouse for a very small number of items.\nDo you think I should I take this course if I'm  going to create a house completely from scratch with no blueprints?\nAbsolutely! That's because it can be really time-consuming to create a 3D model from scratch.  This course will show you the most practical workflow and teach you ways on how you can make the whole process a lot faster.\nWhat if I am a total beginner and know nothing about SketchUp?\nThis course is meant for intermediates and above, so I expect you to have some general knowledge of SketchUp before enrolling, however, if you have never opened up SketchUp before then don't worry, there are a lot of courses out there for you, like SketchUp Make 2017 - from beginner to advanced  a course that I created as well.\nWith Udemy's 30 day 100% money back guarantee there is no reason to hesitate, enroll now and see if you like it.",

It is like you can get this right only if you are good at beast – if you are too technical and not enough of an artist for instance, you will fail with constructed perspective.\nCome on, be honest with yourself…\nHow many times you secretly fantasized about just picking up a pencil and triangles and just designing?\nHow many times did you not feel like a ‘real architect’ because you had no clue about the logic behind understanding what you see.\nHow many times you designs suffered because of you not knowing enough about drawing… or even worse how many times have you imagined things that you could not draw or how many times you were paranoid that ‘what happens if the power goes off and you don’t have your software there to draw your designs’.\nIn this course you will learn:\nLearn how to draw the three essential types of box perspectives and thus understand everything that you see in space.\nHow to sketch a detailed cube and prism house.\nThe essential voplumes (draw them in triple porojection, axonometric and sketch), understand how their shadows logic applies to perspective.\nDraw a constructed perspective, adapt it to the 3 types of box perspective and then draw a detailed cube house.\nLearn how to draw people - upgrade your line drawing and  and give all your constructed perspective scale.\nLearn how to draw trees and shrubs, get your line drawing to the next level, add story to all your drawings.\nDraw and design an elegant cube house in perspective, planar/frontal view and axonometrics (also implies advanced architectural concept ideas and graphics).\nDraw and design a dynamic prism house in perspective, planar/frontal view and axonometric (also upgrade your understanding of architectural visual language and arch graphics).\nLearn one-point perspective and apply it to a simple pavilion - learn how to also draw the pavilion in planar/frontal view, axonometric and freehand perspective sketch.\n\nHow you will change:\nUnderstand the logic behind every image out there, know how to use your perspective skills as a key tool in your design arsenal.\nOutsource your 3d visual abilities from computer software back to the drawing board.\nGet more confident in your design skills, as what you will learn from this course will teach you how to literally draw anything you come across in your architectural career by means of constructed perspective.\nTo sum it up, what you will get with this course:\nFull lifetime access to all the trainings and all future updates.\nOver 20 hours of HD-quality video content.\n90 videos teaching you 9 essential lessons to learn architectural constructed perspective.\n18 video crits that show you how your work should look like.\n9 printer-ready PDFs.\n\n\n100% satisfaction guarantee, 30-day refund to back everything up\nI want this course to be the best investment you ever made in your professional career. I am most definitely not perfect, but I do believe my courses are the best in the world! But hey, if for any reason the course isn’t what you expected, then feel free to ask me for a 100%, no hassle, no-questions-asked refund for the first 30 days! Fair is fair, you tried the training, it didn’t rise to the level of expectation so you get all your money back (and you can even keep the training, that is fine).\nNote: Although an ‘introduction’, this is a very advanced training that will change everything about what you thought architectural drawing is. It will on one hand give you the skills to visually express your ideas, on the other hand it will build up that discipline in your thinking due to understanding constructed perspective.\nThis training isn’t for everybody – most architects I have personally come across live under the delusion that they can somehow skip drawing as an essential skill set in their arsenal as they have an intrinsic talent that spares them from having to learn this.

      "description": "It's time to take your 3d models to the next level with Lumion. There is no faster or easier way to go from a basic model to stunning visualization.\nNo one deserves to be left looking here or there for tutorials, running into endless problems, and feeling demotivated for their career. That's why I have made this course, for you.\nGenerally, when it comes to Architectural Visualization, you will find plenty of guides using different software, but never with Autodesk Maya. Despite it being a leading software for 3D Modeling and Animations, there isn't enough teaching content online for those of us who wish to embark in this field and use our favorite program to do so. As a result, Maya users are often discouraged to pursue a career in Archviz.\nWith this course, I'm aiming to fill in the blanks in the industry, and provide the full workflow of Architectural Visualization using Maya, starting with only a 2D plan of your project. You will learn all the steps, from A to Z, on how to take your plan into Maya, turn it into a reference that you can use to model upon it, then you'll learn how to apply textures and finally take your model into Lumion, where you will produce jaw-dropping photorealistic renders that are guaranteed to move your career to the next level.\nWhile making this course, I made sure to address all the minor details and steps that you should take, leaving no room for frustration on your end. I break down each tool I use, making notes of the shortcuts, and explaining the process in detail along the way. By doing this, I made the course accessible for beginners that are just starting to use Autodesk Maya, while keeping it challenging and interesting for the more intermediate users. For Lumion, no previous experience is needed, as those programs are fairly simple to get started with.\nI believe that a tutor's job truly starts after releasing a course, as that's when students will need help with their own projects, and some might need more thorough explanation of tools and concepts used. As such, I am making it my duty to respond to each one of you, and do my best to assist you in solving any problems that may arise.\nThis course can and will help you get started in this very rewarding and creative field, and kick-start your career as a 3D Artist.",

The ease of the interface and workflow within this software along with the ability to make 3D models from a variety of software programs look fantastic makes Lumion great resource to have.\nWhile almost anyone can pick up Lumion and learn the basics, there are also more advanced techniques that some users aren't even aware of. In Lumion for Architects we approach this software with the expectation that you will learn the basics along with a few tricks that will really take your renders and animations to the next level including the grid technique that allows construction phasing and other animations, time lapse videos and how to use advanced move for technical animations.\nOne of the best parts about this course is that the 3D models are available as part of the course work. You can join Sam step-by-step as you assemble the same museum that you will see in the instructional videos and he even shows you how you can show off your final render with the world.\nWhile this course is designed with an architect in mind, it will be valuable for anyone trying to get the most out of Lumion. As a matter of fact, while Sam owns his own 3D visualization studio, he is an engineer by trade rather than an architect. (If you are an architect, no hard feelings... right?)\nWe look forward to you joining us in Lumion for Architects!",

Instead, we have conveyed the subject through challenging projects and specific tricks, which are the result of numerous experiences.\n\n\nDo you have familiarity with Rhino software's modeling system?\nDo you know how complex forms that you see are modeled?\nAre you aware of the advantages of Rhino software compared to other programs?\nRhino software is widely used by designers, especially architects and industrial designers. It employs the NURBS system for precise curve and surface calculations in computer graphics. Initially applied in the automotive industry, NURBS later expanded to various graphics fields.\nRhino's surface creation is rooted in constructing curves, forming a network that transforms into surfaces. Its popularity stems from its speed, lightweight nature, and adeptness in intricate modeling. The training course aims to distill teaching experience into an accessible format, covering both mastering the software and exploring key plugins.\n\n\nSome of the topics covered in this course include:\nNURBS Modeling System\nLine Drawing and Editing Techniques\nMethods of Objects Replication\nTypes of Surface Creation\nSurface Modeling Tools\nCreating 2D and 3D Patterns\nModeling Executable Structures\nGenerating Diverse Structures\nMeasurement Techniques\nExporting to Other Software\nIf you are currently a BIM modeler or planning to become one, it is essential not to limit yourself to any form. You should be able to manage any architectural design in the BIM process And in the end, you will be the hero of this training.

      ],
      "description": "This course is approved for 1 GBCI CE hour.\nRoof is exposed to intense solar radiation throughout the day which in-turn increases the cooling load of the building and consequently the energy consumption. A cool roof works on the principle of reflecting solar radiation, hence minimizing heat transfer to the interior of the building through the roof. This is a simple and effective strategy to reduce cooling energy consumption. Cool roofs are also known for their benefit towards mitigating urban heat island effect.\nThere are two parts to this course which is organized in two lectures. The first lecture covers the fundamental technical ground on how a cool roof works. Once you are clear on this, you can understand cool roof better. The second lecture explains how exactly a cool roof works and what are its benefits.\nThis course is designed in short modules. At the end of this course, you will be able to explain the working principle of a cool roof and its benefit to the building and surroundings.You will also be familiar with material options and installation method. Further, you will also understand other alternatives that can also reduce heat ingress thereby keeping the building interiors cool.",

To begin with you will learn how to set up your drawing surface and practice the use of all the items of drawing equipment you will need for the rest of the course.\n\n\nThe course continues with lessons on how to use a scale rule and how to draw to scale, and then an introduction to the full range of symbols, line styles, patterns, shadow rendering and annotation techniques you will need to illustrate your garden designs and to develop your individual style of drawing and presentation.\n\n\nNext the course covers how all these techniques are brought together to create professional, presentation-standard drawings of real-life garden designs, and this is followed by demonstrations on different ways of applying colour to garden plans.\n\n\nBecause the best way to develop drawing skills is through practice, this course includes 37 individual drawing exercises for you to complete in your own time. Demonstrations of the exercises are filmed from above a drawing board, and supported by downloads of instructions, templates and base plans\n\n\nThe presentation of this course also comprises more than 70 slides to accompany a commentary on drawing techniques. The slides display images, sketches, photos and illustrations along with bullet points summarising the main points of the commentary. The bullet points are a useful reminder if you need to look back over the main features of the course. The slides also include numerous examples of illustrated plans and drawings which demonstrate the standard of drawing and presentation you will be able to achieve by the end of this course,\n\n\nYou can take this course either on its own or as part of ‘The Complete Garden Design Course’ series of courses which will give you a thorough grounding in the art of garden design. After completing this series of courses, you will have learnt all the skills you will need to confidently undertake your own garden design projects.",

      "description": "You will learn basics of CAPL programming from basics. CAL (Communication Access Language) is a specialized programming language designed for the development and testing of communication systems, primarily in the automotive industry. It is used in Vector tools like CANoe and CANalyzer to simulate, monitor, and test Controller Area Network (CAN) and other bus systems such as LIN, FlexRay, and Ethernet. CAPL enables users to develop scripts that interact with bus messages, providing a versatile environment for testing Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and network behavior.\nCAPL’s syntax is similar to C programming, making it accessible to engineers familiar with C. Its event-driven architecture is a core feature, allowing developers to execute code based on specific triggers like message reception, timers, and hardware events. CAPL supports a range of predefined events, including on start, on timer, and on message, facilitating real-time simulations and testing. This event-driven model enables users to create robust testing scenarios for automotive communication systems.\nCAPL is a powerful, domain-specific language tailored to the automotive sector, enabling engineers to efficiently develop, test, and validate communication networks. Its integration with Vector tools, event-driven nature, and real-time simulation capabilities make it indispensable for ensuring the robustness and reliability of automotive systems. As vehicles become increasingly software-dependent, CAPL’s relevance continues to grow, cementing its role as a cornerstone of automotive communication system development.",

In this course, Moshe Katz takes you deep into the world of creative architectural research—where intuition meets insight, and design becomes personal, poetic, and visionary.\nYou’ll learn how to turn emotions, environments, and even memories into meaningful design concepts. Through a step-by-step approach, you’ll uncover the soul of your projects, discover the DNA of your ideas, and learn how to transform that inner essence into powerful architecture.\nFrom sketching with emotions to researching local culture, from transforming a word into a space to asking wild “what if” questions—this course will show you a new way to think, feel, and create. Whether you're a student stuck on a concept, a professional looking to deepen your process, or simply someone who wants to design with more depth and meaning, this course will open up an entirely new path.\nYou'll begin to see architecture not just as a product, but as a journey—one that mirrors your curiosity, your identity, and your connection to the world. This isn’t about copying references—it’s about uncovering your own language, rooted in who you are and how you see.\nI invite all students to ask questions or submit their work here, and I will be happy to provide inspirational feedback and engage one-on-one with each of you to help you bring it one step further and uncover your hidden potential.",

When we look at these areas, we see the proportions, layouts and items arranged according to many criteria. In this training, how the places that we see around us and have a certain order are drawn,We will see the drafting process while designing a space from scratch, which techniques we should use to capture the same image while drawing. In addition, the process of how we should proceed in the draft and sketch phase, which takes a very important part of the design process.\nWe will watch throughout. In this training;\n- perspective techniques,\n- how to draw places, backgrounds, scenes and professional environments,\n- starting from scratch with spaces in simple form, to very detailed spaces\nthe drawing technique of the environment,\n- how to analyze and easily draw interior and exterior spaces that seem very difficult,\n- such as game scenes, illustrations, animation and background artwork for game design\nmany techniques and perspective rules,\n- how depth is given in a space,\n- What is taken into consideration and how it is transferred to paper in matters such as close and distant relationships,\n- how to go from general to detail in a drawing,\n- how the detail parts of the space should be resolved,\n- you will have learned how to start and continue drawing while drawing places and scenes.\n- In imaginary composition drawings, you will be able to change the position of the horizon line on the paper as you wish.\n- We will be able to adjust the ratio of the ceiling height and the objects we draw into the space in a measured manner.\n- You will have experience in transferring environments with depth and close-up spaces onto paper.\n- Besides the standard two-point perspectives, we will also see three-point perspective angles.\n- How do we capture the proportions of very long and voluminous objects while fitting them onto paper? What is the ratio of the lighting hanging from above with the objects on the floor? We will find answers to questions such as:\n- We will be able to establish the close and distant relationship with the line perspective.\n- After we feel the toning and space effect, we will establish a correct relationship with the line values and catch the distance differences towards the eye. Architects, interior architects, those who want to improve themselves in terms of space drawing, students who are preparing for aptitude exams can attend this training. At the end of this training, space drawing\nYou will have experience in the field and you will reach the level where you can easily draw any place.",

I did not know how to conduct myself properly in the lighting programs, and synchronize properly with the other professionals.\n\n\nI did not know how to use the enormous power of lighting to create a new design experience.\nLearn to sculpt in lighting, and create a new design experience\nMake any project - out of the ordinary,\nI saw amazing lighting designs - and I did not know how to create them.\nOnly when I decided to invest in professional lighting studies – taught by leading experts… it was then that I discovered a new and magical world, which fills me with new and exciting “design energy”. This adds a vitality and liveliness to every project I carry out.\n\n\nStudents testify that thanks to the knowledge they have gained from the course, the whole subject of lighting is opened up to them, lighting design becomes clear, understandable, accessible, and… fun!\nAcquiring this ski ll, will make you stand out among other professionals. Your knowledge of lighting will give you an advantage over other architects and designers, and will brand you - and rightly so - as a high-level expert.\n\n\nClients will prefer to work with an architect/designer who is an expert in lighting, and can give him the best value for his investment!\nYou too can turn lighting design from a burden – to a pleasure of creation, and produce spectacular results, which will also promote your busine$$.",

      "description": "Town Planning: Shaping Sustainable Communities\nTown planning is the strategic process of managing land resources to meet the present and future needs of communities. It encompasses both the regulation of existing and new developments and the formulation of long-term plans that anticipate growth, change, and sustainability. This is a dynamic and evolving process, continually responding to new policies, development proposals, population shifts, and local demands.\nTown planners play a critical role in balancing the often competing interests of landowners, developers, government policies, and the broader community. When done effectively, town planning helps preserve the environment, drives regeneration, supports the creation and maintenance of vibrant communities, and encourages innovation in the development of functional, attractive, and sustainable urban spaces.\nGood town planning honors the best of the past while inspiring creativity for a sustainable future. It integrates infrastructure, housing, environment, and economy into coherent development strategies, ensuring both livability and resilience.\nA Brief History of Town Planning\nThe origins of town planning date back to the third millennium BC, where civilizations such as the Mesopotamians, Minoans, and Egyptians began designing structured communities. The Ancient Greeks, around the 8th century BC, pioneered orthogonal or grid-based city planning. This concept was later expanded by the Romans, who systematically designed cities for both military and civic purposes, introducing structured roads, public squares, and centralized forums—many of which inspired future urban centers.\nDuring the Middle Ages, some European cities retained Roman planning concepts like the 'city centre,' while others expanded more organically with limited formal planning. It wasn’t until the Enlightenment period that renewed interest in systematic urban planning emerged. Influenced by new philosophies and the desire for order and beauty, cities like Paris underwent major transformations—most notably under Baron Haussmann, who introduced wide boulevards and public spaces to ease congestion and improve living conditions.\nThe Industrial Revolution triggered rapid urbanization, often without planning, leading to overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions, particularly for the working class. By the late 19th century, the need for proper planning became evident, prompting the rise of urban theory and reform.\nThe establishment of the Town and Country Planning Association in the UK marked a turning point in the professionalization of urban planning. The Town and Country Planning Act 1947 further formalized the process, providing a foundation for post-war reconstruction and the coordinated planning of towns and cities. This legislation laid the groundwork for today’s planning systems, emphasizing both redevelopment and the regulation of land use.\nLater, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 introduced key reforms, distinguishing between forward planning—strategic, long-term visioning by local authorities—and development control, which oversees current building proposals and ensures alignment with broader community objectives.",

Louis Kahn was born in Kuressaare on the island of Saaremaa, then part of the Russian Empire's Livonian Governorate. At the age of three, he saw coals in the stove and was captivated by the light of the coal. He put the coal in his apron, which caught on fire and burned his face. He carried these scars for the rest of his life. Louis Kahn, original name was Itze-Leib (Leiser-Itze) Schmuilowsky (Schmalowski), In 1906, Louis Kahn’s family emigrated to the United States, as they feared that his father would be recalled into the military during the Russo-Japanese War. He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. on May 15, 1914. His father changed their name to Kahn in 1915.",

But are you learning how to use it? Learning Revit won’t make you an architect. It will however make you better prepared to become an architect. In universities, Revit is often taught as an elective but an increasing number of job listings and internships are asking for it. Savvy architecture students understand that Revit is going to be part of their careers. Learning Revit is no longer an elective.\nThus learning Revit helps us in 3D visualization right from the stage of planning until execution of the project, taking most of your workload at ease with rightful commands which in turn would improve your workflow efficiency.\n\n\nI've divided the entire course into 3 major heads.\n\n\n- Getting Started\n- Modelling\n- Architecture\n\n\nIn this course, I had also shared carefully curated study material for your reference which you get access to for a lifetime.\n\n\nRequirements-\nRevit software.\n(free student version could be downloaded from official Autodesk website with over 1-year validity)\n\n\nHappy Learning...\n\n\nBest Regard,\nLingesh J.Y\n.\nJoin now!!!",

It will allow you to get a glimpse of the content and understand the process of creating stunning digital architectural sketches.\nSketching is thinking. In architecture, every great idea starts with a line—a quick, expressive stroke that captures a vision before it becomes reality. In this course, you’ll learn how to harness the power of digital sketching to transform ideas into compelling visual stories.\nThis isn’t about rigid, technical drafting. It’s about speed, fluidity, and creative freedom—using digital tools to sketch dynamically, refine concepts effortlessly, and communicate architecture in a way that feels natural and intuitive. You’ll explore composition, perspective, light, and depth, mastering techniques that bring your sketches to life. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll gain the confidence to sketch quickly, think visually, and iterate designs with ease.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be able to sketch with confidence, clarity, and expression—whether capturing a spontaneous idea, presenting a project, or refining a design. You’ll work with layers, textures, and color to enhance your storytelling, and you’ll discover how to develop your own sketching style that sets your work apart.\nIf you’re an architect, designer, or creative thinker looking to sketch faster, communicate better, and bring your ideas to life, this course is for you. You don’t need to be an expert—just bring your curiosity, creativity, and willingness to explore. Let’s start sketching.",

Therefore, those firms are \"willingly\" to use less expensive CAD software in order to create CAD drawings as well as 3D objects for visualization purposes. And those CAD software are not meant to do design studies and deliver design variants. Just delivering CAD drawings as output.\nMany have known Rhinoceros as 3d modeling software with strong surface modeling support. With Grasshopper being integrated into Rhino since Rhino version 5 at no additional cost, it pushes Rhino to the next level as Grasshopper opened up the opportunity to have parametric modeling in Rhino, as well as expanding the capability inside Rhino, providing platform for plugins with no boundary. However, since Grasshopper gets no limit in order to expand its features through scripting and programming, many architects and designers feel uncomfortable enough, even before trying Grasshopper themselves. Many don't realize, we could use Grasshopper without programming at all, and unleash our productivity with it.\nThis course will guide you through step-by-step tutorials while also extending many logical explanation in order to have clear and easy to understand objectives and materials, to combine Rhinoceros and Grasshopper in achieving high productivity in architectural design. The example of creating the complete wall of 2D floor plan from a hand sketch in such quick and straight forward process while cutting down repetitions, is a big step to begin, while converting the 2D wall drawing into 3D object with included properties will surely save time for next purposes such as visualization and analysis. All is done without requiring any programming language or scripting inside Grasshopper. Skill that requires months or even years of your knowledge and experience to build, will simply be yours after joining this 45 minutes of short course. It will also save you tons of time forward, by applying it to your projects.",
