It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.\n\n\nFrom web developers to app developers, Git is useful to anyone who writes code or track changes to files. So what’s it all about and why should you start using it?\nWhat is Git?\nGit is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.\nSo regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for you.\n\n\nGit is software that runs locally. Your files and their history are stored on your computer. You can also use online hosts (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) to store a copy of the files and their revision history. Having a centrally located place where you can upload your changes and download changes from others, enable you to collaborate more easily with other developers. Git can automatically merge the changes, so two people can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes without loosing each other’s work!",

Key concepts and the basic workflow are discussed.\nSetup and Configuration provides step-by-step instructions on how to setup Git for Windows and Mac OS X, how to use Git's help command, and how to setup the minimum required configuration to start using Git.\nIn Working with Git Locally, we walk through all the commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable Git for an existing project) all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files. We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally being committed and how to review your repository's history.\nGoing Remote covers publishing the locally created repository (previous section) on GitHub. Starting off by setting up SSH authentication, creating the remote version of our repository, linking the local repository with the remote version on GitHub, and finally sending our changes up to remote repository.\nCourse Features\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.\nScreencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There is a total of 56 minutes of video based training in this course (Presentation + Screencasts, excluding Promo Video).\nFollowing each lecture or group of related lectures in the demo sections of the course are Command Listing lectures that serve as reference and reminder of the commands used in the previous lecture(s). Each Command Listing includes the exact listings used in the previous lectures and a reference guide for newly introduced commands. All commands used in this course are available through the Command Listing lectures.\nThe four Quizzes reinforce the key concepts by testing your newly learned knowledge throughout the course.\nSeveral attachments throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.\nMoving Forward\nStudents can checkout my last lecture on other Git related resources.

Unfortunately the software suitable for these roles often costs tens of thousands of dollars for a license and/or is prohibitively complicated to learn and put into practice. Being opensource and used in many active companies today, OpenFOAM is an excellent way to learn these methods and greatly enhance your ability to solve engineering problems. While structured in a way that makes it highly flexible and ideal for making your own projects, learning OpenFOAM without help can be a daunting prospect.\nThe purpose of this course is to give a simple and straightforward introduction to OpenFOAM covering common bugs and mistakes so that you can easily pass through the steep initial learning curve at your own pace. While the lessons learned here can be applied to any OpenFOAM solver (of which there is a substantial range), the focus is on solid mechanics since the implementation is typically much simpler than more popular applications (high speed flow, etc.). In addition, since solid mechanics is necessary for most engineering disciplines even if it isn't that discipline's primary interest (aerodynamics centres around the interaction between solid objects and fluid flows for example), solid mechanics is an excellent core skill to have and a necessary theoretical precursor to a healthy understanding of fluid dynamics of all forms.\nDisclaimer:\nThis course is not a substitute for a degree in aerospace engineering or specialist consultancy, by purchasing this course you agree that the course instructor is in no way liable for any disputes, claims, losses, injuries, or damage of any kind that might arise out of or relate to the content of this course or any supporting communications between instructor and student.",

      "description": "This Kubernetes Docker Complete Course will help you to understand how to run, deploy and maintain your applications on Kubernetes. If you are into DevOps, then this is a technology you need to learn. Kubernetes has gained a lot of popularity lately and it is a well-aimed skill by companies.\nThe course will show you how to build apps in containers using docker and how to deploy it Kubernetes cluster. On the other hand,this Kubernetes Course will explain you how to set up your Kubernetes cluster on your desktop, or on the cloud using AWS.\nWhat is Kubernetes?\nKubernetes is an open-source container orchestration technology system .Kubernetes is mainly used for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.\nKubernetes was originally designed by Google and then open sourced.And from then to now Kubernetes is maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.\nKubernetes  aims to provide a \"platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.\nKubernetes is a portable as well as extensible platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes  has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. There are widely availablity in Kubernetes services, support, and tools.\nGoogle open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.\nEven though Kubernetes provides a lot of functionality, there are always new scenarios that would benefit from new features. Application-specific workflows can be streamlined to accelerate developer velocity. Ad hoc orchestration that is acceptable initially often requires robust automation at scale. This is why Kubernetes was also designed to serve as a platform for building an ecosystem of components and tools to make it easier to deploy, scale, and manage applications.\nLabels in Kubernetes empower users to organize their resources however they please. Annotations enable users to decorate resources with custom information to facilitate their workflows and provide an easy way for management tools to checkpoint state.\nThe Kubernetes control plane is mainly built upon the same APIs that are available to developers and users. Users can write their own controllers, such as schedulers, with their own APIs that can be targeted by a general-purpose command-line tool.\nThis design has enabled a number of other systems to build the Kubernetes.\nOn the other hand Kubernetes is not a traditional or all-inclusive Platform as a Service( PaaS) system. Since Kubernetes operates at the container level rather than at the hardware level, it provides some generally applicable features common to PaaS offerings, such as deployment, scaling, load balancing, logging, and monitoring. However, Kubernetes is not monolithic, and these default solutions are optional and pluggable. Kubernetes provides the building blocks for building developer platforms but preserves user choice and flexibility where it is important.\nHere are some advantages of Kubernetes\nFirstly Kubernetes does not limit the types of applications supported. Moreover, Kubernetes aims to support an extremely diverse variety of workloads, including stateless and stateful even data-processing workloads. Thatswhy If an application can run in a container, it should run great on Kubernetes.\nKubernetes never  deploy source code and does not build your application. Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment (CI/CD) workflows are determined by organization cultures and preferences as well as technical requirements.\nKubernetes does not provide application-level services, such as middleware (e.g., message buses), data-processing frameworks (for example, Spark), databases like MySQL, caches as built-in services. Such components can run on Kubernetes, and/or can be accessed by applications running on Kubernetes through portable mechanisms, such as the Open Service Broker.\nKubernetes never dictate logging, monitoring, or alerting solutions. It provides some integrations as proof of concept, and mechanisms to collect and export metrics.\nKubernetes does not also provide nor mandate a configuration language/system (e.g., jsonnet). It provides a declarative API that may be targeted by arbitrary forms of declarative specifications.\nKubernetes never provide nor adopt any comprehensive machine configuration, maintenance, management, or self-healing systems.\nThough Kubernetes is not a mere orchestration system. In fact,kubernetes eliminates the need for orchestration. In contrast, Kubernetes is comprised of a set of independent, composable control processes.Kubernetes also drive the current state continuously towards the provided desired state.\nWhat is Kubernetes for ?\nKubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.In short, Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool from Google.\n\n\nHow Does Kubernetes work?\nKubernetes can mainly defines as a set of building blocks.Kubernetes collectively provides mechanisms that deploy, maintain and scale applications. Kubernetes is loosely coupled and extensible to meet different workloads. This extensibility is provided in large part by the Kubernetes API, which is used by internal components as well as extensions and containers that run on Kubernetes\n\n\nThere are some key components which are widely used is Kuberntes are\nPods\nLabels and selectors\nControllers\nServices\n\n\nWhat is the pod in Kubernetes\nA Kubernetes pod is a group of containers. Pods can be deployed together on the same host. If you frequently deploy single containers, you can generally replace the word \"pod\" with \"container\" and accurately understand the concept.\nPods operate at one level higher than individual containers because it's very common to have a group of containers work together to produce an artifact or process a set of work.\nFor example, consider this pair of containers: a caching server and a cache \"warmer\". You could build these two functions into a single container, but now they can each be tailored to the specific task and shared between different projects.\nWhat is labels and selectors in Kubernetes?\nLabels and selectors are the primary grouping mechanism in Kubernetes and determine the components an operation applies to.\nLabels are key-value pairs that are attached to Kubernetes objects, such as Pods. They are intended to be used to specify object attributes which are meaningful and relevant to users, while not directly impacting implying semantics of the core system.\nUnlike names and UIDs, labels in Kubernetes do not provide uniqueness. In general, we expect many objects to carry the same label(s).\nVia a label selector, the client/user can identify a set of objects. The label selector is the core grouping primitive in Kubernetes.\nThe API currently supports two types of selectors: equality-based and set-based. A label selector can be made of multiple requirements which are comma-separated. In the case of multiple requirements, all must be satisfied so the comma separator acts as a logical AND (&&) operator.\n\n\nWhat is Controllers  in Kubernetes?\nA controller is a reconciliation loop that drives actual cluster state toward the desired cluster state. It does this by managing a set of pods. One kind of controller is a replication controller, which handles replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster. It also handles creating replacement pods if the underlying node fails. Other controllers that are part of the core Kubernetes system include a \"DaemonSet Controller\" for running exactly one pod on every machine or some subset of machines and a \"Job Controller\" for running pods that run to completion, as part of a batch job. The set of pods that a controller manages is determined by Kubernetes label selectors that are part of the controller’s definition.\n\n\nWhat is Services in Kubernetes?\nA Kubernetes service is a set of pods which can work together, such as one tier of a multi-tier application. The set of pods that constitute a service are defined by a label selector.Kubernetes provides service discovery and request routing by assigning a stable IP address and DNS name to the service, and load balances traffic in a round-robin manner to network connections of that IP address among the pods matching the selector even as failures cause the pods to move from machine to machine.By default, a service is exposed inside a cluster but a service can also be exposed outside a kubernetes cluster.\n\n\nWhy you should start learning Kubernetes?\nWhen our clients ask us to create a highly available distributed system, we usually recommend Kubernetes, because Kubernetes is really easy to use and even though it has a steep initial learning curve and kubernetes still a lot more simple than other competing orchestration engines.\nKubernetes also works perfectly with Node apps because it's based on Docker.Thatswhy  you can run any kind of application using Kubernetes.\nAs we all know kubernetes is a open source project spun out of Google which  automates the process of deploying and managing multi-container applications at scale. While Kubernetes works mainly with Docker, it can also work with any container system that conforms to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards for container image formats and runtimes.\nAnd because Kubernetes is open source, with relatively few restrictions on how it can be used, it can be used freely by anyone who wants to run containers, most anywhere they want to run them.\nKubernetes introduces new abstractions and concepts, and the learning curve for Kubernetes is high so it is only normal to ask what the long-term payoffs are for using Kubernetes. Here’s a rundown of some of the specific ways running apps inside Kubernetes becomes easier.\nKubernetes manages app health, replication, load balancing, and hardware resource allocation for you. One of the most basic duties Kubernetes takes off your hands is the busywork of keeping an application up, running, and responsive to user demands. Apps that become “unhealthy,” or don’t conform to the definition of health you describe for them, can be automatically healed using kubernetes.\nAnother benefit of Kubernetes is that it maximizes the use of hardware resources including memory, storage I/O, and network bandwidth. Applications can have soft and hard limits set on their resource usage. Many apps that use minimal resources can be packed together on the same hardware; apps that need to stretch out can be placed on systems. And again, rolling out updates across a cluster, or rolling back if updates break, can be automated.\nKubernetes Helm charts ease the deployment of preconfigured applications. Package managers such as Debian Linux’s APT and Python’s Pip save users the trouble of manually installing and configuring an application. This is especially handy when an application has multiple external dependencies.\nHelm is something like a package manager for Kubernetes. Many popular software applications must run as multiple, ganged-together containers in Kubernetes. Helm provides a definition mechanism, a “chart,” that describes how a given piece of software can be run as a group of containers inside Kubernetes.\nKubernetes simplifies management of storage, secrets, and other application-related resources. Containers are meant to be immutable; whatever you put into them isn’t supposed to change. But applications need state so it means they need a reliable way to deal with external storage volumes. That’s made all the more complicated by the way containers live, die, and are reborn across the lifetime of an app.\nKubernetes always allow containers and apps to deal with storage in the same decoupled way as other resources. Many common kinds of storage, from Amazon EBS volumes to plain old NFS shares, can be accessed via Kubernetes storage drivers, called volumes. Normally, volumes are bound to a specific pod, but a volume subtype called a “Persistent Volume” can be used for data which needs to live on independently of any pod in Kubernetes.\nSometimes these containers need to work with “secrets” which is nothing but credentials like API keys or service passwords that you don’t want hardwired in a container or stashed openly on a disk volume. While third-party solutions are available for this, like Docker secrets and HashiCorp Vault,\nIn that case, Kubernetes uses its own mechanism of handling secrets. For instance, Etcd must be configured to use SSL/TLS when sending information including secrets between nodes, rather than in plaintext.\nKubernetes apps can run in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. One of the long-standing dreams of cloud computing is to be able to run any app in any cloud or any mix of clouds public or private.\nKubernetes’s architecture makes use of various concepts and abstractions. Some of these are variations on existing, familiar notions, but others are specific to Kubernetes.\nThe highest-level Kubernetes abstraction, the cluster, refers to the group of machines running Kubernetes (itself a clustered application) and the containers managed by it. A Kubernetes cluster must have a master, the system that commands and controls all the other Kubernetes machines in the cluster. A highly available Kubernetes cluster replicates the master’s facilities across multiple machines. But only one master at a time runs the job scheduler and controller-manager.\nEach cluster contains Kubernetes nodes. This Kubernetes nodes might be physical machines or VMs. Again, the idea is abstraction: whatever the app is running on, Kubernetes handles deployment on that substrate. It is also possible to ensure that certain containers run only on VMs or only on bare metal.\nNodes run pods, the most basic Kubernetes objects that can be created or managed. Each pod represents a single instance of an application or running process in Kubernetes and consists of one or more containers. On the other hand Kubernetes starts, stops, and replicates all containers in a pod as a group. Pods keep the user’s attention on the application, rather than on the containers themselves.\nPods are created and destroyed on nodes as needed to conform to the desired state specified by the user in the pod definition. Kubernetes provides an abstraction called a controller for dealing with the logistics of how pods are spun up, rolled out, and spun down.\nControllers come in a few different flavors depending on the kind of application being managed. For instance, the recently introduced “StatefulSet” controller is used to deal with applications that need persistent state. Another kind of controller, the deployment, is used to scale an app up or down, update an app to a new version, or roll back an app to a known-good version if there’s a problem.\nBecause pods in Kubernetes  live and die as needed, we need a different abstraction for dealing with the application lifecycle. An application is supposed to be a persistent entity, even when the pods running the containers that comprise the application aren’t themselves persistent.\nTo that end, Kubernetes provides an abstraction called a service.\nA service describes how a given group of pods or other Kubernetes objects can be accessed via the network. As the Kubernetes documentation puts it, the pods that constitute the back end of an application might change, but the front end shouldn’t have to know about that or track it. Services make this possible.\nA few more pieces internal to Kubernetes round out the picture. The scheduler parcels out workloads to nodes so that they’re balanced across resources and so that deployments meet the requirements of the application definitions. The controller manager ensures the state of the system—applications, workloads, etc.—matches the desired state defined in Etcd’s configuration settings.\n\n\nHow much does a Kubernetes Engineer can make per annum?\nThe salaries of kubernetes engineers are also very attractive.\nSoftware Engineer- $76K to $152K\nSenior Software Engineer - $103K to $166K\nDevelopment Operations (DevOps) Engineer - $84K to $154K\nSite Reliability Engineer (SRE) - $69K to $164K\nSr. Software Engineer / Developer / Programmer - $92K to $157K\nSoftware Development Engineer - $104K to $118K\nSoftware Architect - $95K to $154K\nCareer Opportunities in Kubernetes and Companies using Kubernetes :\nIn Kubernetes there are no. of jobs worldwide and the companies which are hiring Kubernetes experts some are listed below\nRed Hat\nOracle\nGoogle\nMicrosoft\nSamsung SDS\nIBM\nING\nHuawei\nNaic\nMonjo\nPhilips\nPinterest\nSAP\nSoundcloud\nYahoo\nWink\nSling\nOpenAI\nThe New York Time\nMirantis\nCenturylink\nApprenda\nGitHub\nWeaveworks\nAsana\nBuffer\nCircleCi\nEvernote\nHarvest\nIntel\nInVisionApp\nShopify\nStarbucks\nDigital Ocean\nCapscale\nAdform\nAmadeus\nAncestry\nBox\nBlackRock\nComcast\neBay and many more\n30-day money-back guarantee!\nNow again coming to this course,So this Kubernetes course is ideal for beginners to experts to container technology or those who are new to Kubernetes engineering or who want to enrich their knowledge in Kubernetes much more.\nThis course includes the following chapters:\nCourse Introduction and Overview\nWhat is Kubernetes?\nWhy Kubernetes?\nUp and Running: Basics\nCluster Architecture\nCore Objects and Primitives\nThe introduction lectures that show you the Kubernetes desktop installation are free to preview, so you can already put a glance over it before buying the course!\nSo what are you waiting for?

Then this is the course for you. My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. In addition to being the lead instructor for devCamp I've also been building web applications for over a decade for organizations such as Eventbrite and Quip.\nAfter completing this course you will know how to code with the Vim text editor. But that's not really a big deal. If you just wanted to use a text editor there's no point in learning Vim. Vim is more than a text editor, you can ask professional developers from around the world and they'll tell you that Vim development is a lifestyle. Which is why I don't stop at simply teaching you how to use the editor. After going through the basics I will show you have to use Vim like a professional Ruby developer to automate your entire development workflow. This will include learning:\nHow to process Ruby code so that it renders right inside of the file, this makes it possible to efficiently debug and build Ruby programs without even having to leave the text editor!\nHow to customize the Vim environment like a pro, including how to integrate the file system, multiple view panes, and even how to customize the keyboard shortcuts so that you can focus on your code and not the editor.\nHow to install Vim plugins, such as being able to perform fuzzy file searches and autocomplete.\nThis course is not for beginners, the ideal students for this material are those who have some level of Ruby experience and want to take their skills to the professional level. I won't be teaching much Ruby code throughout these lessons, instead this course will walk through how to setup your development environment to maximize development efficiency.\nIn additions to the lessons, as a student you will be given access to my personal Vim setting file and a Vim cheat sheet that I've spent the past several years creating so that you can use it as a reference as you continue to learn how to use Vim.\nPlease feel free to review the course curriculum and I look forward to going through the material with you on your development journey!",

I will teach you the core components of Kubernetes with various kubernetes specific concepts. Course is up to date uses the latest kubernetes version and all exercises can be done for free and on any operating system. Course will include a quiz at the end of the theory section to test and consolidate your learning.\nTwo practicals focusing on the major architectural concepts within Kubernetes and containerisation will be presented to complement the theory learned. This course was designed to balance theory and practise to deepen your understanding and why we do things the way it’s done and not just show you how it’s done. I want you to understand the reason behind each decision made.\nCourse is split up into sections as below:\nContainerisation and Orchestration - Explore the concept of containers and problems that kubernetes aims to solve.\nMaster and Nodes - Main architecture of Kubernetes, will dig a little deeper into components and commonly used architectures.\nPods - The building block of Kubernetes, will explain the main concept and commonly used example of pods.\nServices - Various options for connecting pods to external traffic.\nDeployments - Concept of replication set and launching of a kubernetes cluster.\nDesired State, Defining Kube Objects - Explore the concept of desired state and how to actually define kubernetes working parts before deploying.\nStateless & Stateful - Main concepts comparing stateless architectures with stateful and why you would want to use one over another.\nStateless Cluster Practical - This is a practical where we will build a stateless application and deploy the cluster.\nStateful Cluster Practical - This is a practical where we will build a stateful application and deploy the cluster.",

      "description": "This course walks through all the core features and concepts of Jira and has been catered for all users (general users, managers and admins). It incorporates and uses some of the latest features released for JIRA on Cloud (standard version).\nPlus bonus Confluence content  - learn how to use Confluence and how to take advantage of it in tandem with JIRA.\nJira is a very comprehensive tool and one of the most popular agile project management tools out there. When used and configured correctly, it will help you work smarter, faster and more efficiently.\n\n\nWHY TAKE THE COURSE:\n\nLearn the most important characteristics of Scrum and Kanban agile methodologies\nCover all the main aspects of Jira including working within an agile team, leading an agile team, and administering the main things that make up Jira\nReal-world examples including\nHow to manage your daily task-list via a daily scrum-based process\nConfigure permissions and projects for internal team members, as well as external members (Eg: consultants, customers etc)\nJIRA allows you to create stories and epics for agile projects - learn how to create another issue type used in agile called Spike and create custom screens, fields and workflows for this new issue type.\nHow to manage multiple teams working on the same projects via multiple agile boards catered to each team\nSupport - I am only a message away from answering any questions you might have\n\n\nSTRUCTURE OF THE COURSE:\nAgile Concepts - Goes into detail with Scrum and Kanban frameworks. By the end of the section, you’ll have a full refresher on these frameworks as I made sure I hit the most important notes when it comes to how they work.\nWorking within an agile team - Get your first look at navigating the Jira user interface and learn how to create issues, work on issues through the agile boards, search for issues, create custom dashboards to see whats happening in Jira and other functions beneficial to any agile team member.\nLeading an agile team - Configuring and managing agile boards, creating and maintaining the backlog as well as starting and ending sprints and creating releases. All these steps stay true to the agile steps described in the prior section.\nJira Administration - Goes over all the main administration sections and each part has an example that you can use to follow along with. By the end of this section, you will understand all the customizable aspects of Jira and be able to cater your own instance to fit your own specific needs.\nTeam-Managed Projects - a section that dives into the versatile team-managed projects in Jira and all its capabilities\nReal-world examples, scenarios and bonus content - This is where I show you how I use Jira to track and forecast my personal day-to-day tasklist, while using a daily scrum-based process, among other examples.\nConfluence - Jira's best friend when it comes to managing content\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nBottom line is that I tried to make this course a comprehensive guide to Jira that anyone would need to either get introduced to JIRA or get fully up to speed with the main concepts and features. I feel the best way of learning something is by example. And so I put in a lot of content explaining the features and concepts with examples and am continuously working on adding more examples and scenarios to share my experience and knowledge in using JIRA within the real world.\nI'll be here to help answer any questions you might have along the way.",

This course gives a really good step-by-step approach, with a good didactic.\" - Andre Aranha\n\"Totally recommend this course; the mentor teaches each and ever aspect of CMake also he answers every query\"—Million Stinger_S\n\"Very knowledgeable instructor! If you're interested in C and/or C++, even as a hobby, you'll need to learn CMake. This course covers everything you need to start and work on both small and large projects. It includes topics like dependency management, testing, and packaging. You can't go wrong with this one.\" - Fellipi Carmo\n\"The course is suitable for beginners and advanced users who want to improve their CMake knowledge.\" - Victor Stoykov\nDescription:\nThis course is all about CMake. CMake is an application that helps you structure C/ C++-based native projects, generate build commands for the target platform, build your application, pack it into an installer, install it, test it, and it will even help you with managing your dependencies.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nHow to use CMake to structure and compile your C/C++ projects\nHow to manage your dependencies\nHow to get your project compiled for the web using Emscripten\nHow to include unit tests and test your application\nHow to customize the build pipeline with your own tools (if you want to do your own custom build steps)\nHow to compile other projects that support CMake and even ones that do not\nHow to install and package your project\nBonus snippets include some advanced setups like documentation using Doxygen\nIn the end, you will have all the knowledge needed to be able to open up a random CMake project and compile it yourself. You will also be able to confidently start and write your own CMake scripts for your projects. This will elevate your programming experience with the low-level C/C++ languages, and it will also simplify a lot of the hard concepts related to those languages.\n\n\nThis course is primarily taught on the Windows OS, but the knowledge gained can easily translate into other operating systems as well.",

We extract your data and load it into your data destination. If you already have an account, setup takes anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours (depending on the complexity of your internal firewalls and integration setups). The first step is to connect a data warehouse. After that, you'll be taken to the Dashboard, where you can add new connectors. Adding a new connector will lead you to the setup page with detailed notes on the screen and verification for the configuration. Once your first connector is created, it will begin syncing immediately and once that is done you can start using that data in your data warehouse. You can add as many connectors as needed to complete your initial setup.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nData engineering Professionals\nUniversity students looking for a career in Data Engineering\nIT developers working on other disciplines trying to move to Data Engineering\nData Engineers/ Data Warehouse Developers currently working on on-premises technologies, or other cloud platforms such as AWS or GCP who want to learn Azure Technologies\nData Architects looking to gain an understanding about cloud based ETL tool\nData Scientists who want to extend their knowledge into data engineering",

      "description": "*****NOW WITH MEGA QUIZ UPDATE!!!!*****\n\n\nContainers:\nContainers are like that smart chef who can feed a whole family with just a bowl full of rice, and that's not an exaggeration at all! Containers are empowering businesses to scale fearlessly and manage their web apps hassle-free. They are the prime reason why micro and small enterprises are migrating to Cloud. All of this has undoubtedly led to an enormous demand for professionals with Containerization skills.\nWhich skills do you need?\nA platform to Create, Run and Ship Containers... like Docker.\nA strong tool to Control/Manage/Orchestrate your containers... like Kubernetes!\nThis course takes you on a wonderful journey of learning Containers using key components of Docker and Kubernetes. All you need is very basic knowledge of Linux fundamentals like files and processes along with a bit of Linux command line.\n\n\nThe Containerization Journey with Docker:\nCalling Docker the most widely used containerization platform would be an understatement. It has literally become synonymous to containers! Following topics covered under this course will solidify the logical base of this statement.\nYou can only love a technology if you know how it works, and that's exactly why you will be learning Docker architecture and how its components work.\nAt first glance, Dockerfile might seem like just another file describing app specifications. That's because it is probably the simplest yet efficient way to perform app building from scratch.\nDocker CLI is intuitive and is inspired by your friendly Linux CLI. So adapting it is a piece of cake!\nDocker images and Containers are the most portable and reliable way to ship your micro-service or web application without worrying about questions like \"will it work on his infrastructure?\"\nOnce you are fairly familiar with containers, Docker Networks and Volumes will open a whole new world of opportunities. Your containerization will become more reliable and will start serving its true purpose.\nDocker compose will combine all of the learning and take it to the next level with inter-dependent multi-container applications.\nOnce you have learned all of this, you will be craving to know what else can you do with containers and how you can take your containerization skills to the next stage!\n\n\nThe Orchestration Journey with Swarm and Kubernetes:\n\"With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility\"\nSimilarly, With Great amount of containers, comes greater amount of orchestration!\nYou want to deploy 4 nodes in your cluster but can only afford to have one SSD node. And you gotta make sure that it only hosts containers which demand SSD explicitly. What to do?\nYou don't want to have idle containers chilling around your nodes and not serving even 10% of their capacity but you also want to make sure that your customers don't hit 404 when traffic is at its peak. On top of that, you don't have time or manpower to keep your number of web-server replicas in-check. What to do?\nYou are a pro-on-premise kubernetes expert but your next project happens to be hosted on a public cloud platform like GCP or Azure. You're not scared but a little push will help you a lot! What to do?\nThis course is a one-stop answer for all of these questions. It covers both Kubernetes and Docker Swarm and makes sure that you are confident and capable to make your call when the time comes!\nEven though a container orchestrator is nothing without containers themselves, kubernetes seems to be the biggest breakthrough in the world of DevOps. This course explains kubernetes from the start. No, I mean LITERALLY from the start (Origin! It,s an interesting story). It covers all of these important topics with examples so that when you finish this course, you can use and appreciate containers as well as we do!\nKubernetes Architecture (Components, States, Nodes, Interactions)\nKubernetes Objects (Pods, Handlers, Workloads, Controllers, Services, Volumes)\nOperations (Sorting, Configuration, Scheduling, Scaling, Deploying, Updating, Restricting)\nApplication Examples (All-time favourite nginx webserver, Custom Landing Page, Stdout Logs, Wordpress blog with MySQL, Apache zookeeper etc.)\nKubernetes as a service (GCP, Azure)\nCase studies (Blackrock, Niantic)\nFor more insight into our teaching style, check out the preview videos and take a look at what some of our students have to say!\n\"Practical, concise, easy to understand introduction to Docker and Kubernetes. This course provided a quick path to get started deploying cloud apps in the real world and manage the clusters. The instructor is engaging, and shows step-by-step how to do common DevOps tasks, and is easy to follow without previous knowledge. This is definitely the best among many Docker/Kubernetes courses which I previewed.\"\n- Colin Skow (Kubernetes and Docker: The Container Masterclass ★ ★ ★ ★ ★)\n\n\n\"Quick information, well laid out!\"\n-  Samantha West (Kubernetes and Docker: The Container Masterclass ★ ★ ★ ★ ★)\n\n\n\"Love the short videos for each topic, Clear instructions. Each topic connects to the next one.\"\n- Ahmad Ali (Docker Essentials - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★  )\n\n\n\"Simply great! Covers every topic I needed. Thank you!\"\n- Piotr Sobczyński (Docker Essentials - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★  )\n\n\n\"Awesome Explanations\"\n- Gaurang (Docker Essentials - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★  )\n\n\nWith that said, see you in the course!\nHappy Learning!",

      "description": "COURSE IN THE NUTSHELL\nConcise and to the point, as I appreciate your time and don't have the luxury to tell you my story\nEasy to understand and tailored for a broad audience, as it only requires a basic knowledge of Python and only.\nThis course is brought to you by the author of \"Beyond the Numbers: The Art and Science of Data Visualization''\nWHAT STUDENTS SAY\n\"This is a great course! Bekzod's instruction is very clear and concise. I went from having zero knowledge of Matplotlib to creating highly customized visualizations within hours. Prerequisites in Python and Pandas are not necessarily needed but understanding the basics in both will maximize your experience in this course. I recommend to open a blank notebook and following along with Bekzod, pausing along the way read the help documentation he references, as well as read any code snippets you may not understand right away. It takes a little longer to finish the course but it's more than worth it. I'm looking forward to additional courses offered by Bekzod.\" - Jeff Dowden\n\n\"You can learn how Matplotlib works from scratch, including Seaborn. The best part of the course is Matplotlib Anatomy. If the lecturer provided materials into one ZIP file, that would be perfect. I enjoyed taking this course very much.\" - Jonsuk P.\n\n\n\"This is one of the most detailed course on matplotlib library available on the internet. After taking this course, finally I can access plot internals and manipulate/customise it in unlimited ways. I think once anyone complete this course, they can learn and implement advanced libraries very easily.\" - Rahul R.\n\n\n\"Outstanding and thorough course. Be sure to take your time with the first section so you have a good understanding of the basics. The course material makes for a very good reference tool after you have completed it.\" - Max L.\n\n\n\"This is the course is the type of course which makes learning super easy. Thanks for making this course it helped me a lot in making my projects more understandable.\" - Vaibhav Dinesh S.\n\n\n\"I learn a lot from the lesson until now. This lesson improves my understanding of OOP. It is so easy, interesting and amazing to use python to visualize data from the perspective of OOP.\" - Haitao Lyu\n\"This course is completely amazing. Direct to the point and use real data not simulation with numpy as usually others did. Great job Bekzod!! \" - Hartanto\n\"'I've used Matplotlib and Seaborn for a number of years. I was reviewing this to see if it was a good introduction for people I work with. The answer, yes. It's a very good introduction that covers some of the critical details necessary to navigate Matplotlib in order to customize plots.\" - Stephen Basco\nTELL ME MORE...\nAfter completing this course you will master Matplotlib on an intuition level and feel comfortable visualizing and customizing Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas charts of any complexities. More specifically, this course is a great resource if you are interested in:\n\nHow Matplotlib Works\nHow to create charts from simple to scientific ones with Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn\nHow to customize charts of any complexities with ease\nTo achieve the objectives, I split this course into the following sections:\n\nMatplotlib Anatomy\nAs the name implies, in this section you will learn how Matplotlib works and how a variety of charts are generated.\nIt gives you a solid understanding and a lot of aha-moments when it comes to creating and / or customizing charts that you haven't dealt with before.\nCreate 2D Charts\nIn this section, you will generate plethora of charts using Matplotlib OOP, and Pandas and mix them together to achieve the maximum efficiency and granular control over graphs.\nAxes Statistical Charts\nHere we will learn how to make statistical charts such as Auto Correlation, Boxplots, Violinplots and KDE plots with Matplotlib OOP and Pandas.\nSeaborn\nSeaborn, a high-level interface to Matplotlib helps make statistical plots with ease and charm. It is a must-know library for data exploration and super easy to learn. And in this section, we will create Regression plots, Count plots, Barplots, Factorplots, Jointplots,  Boxplots, Violin plots and more.\nCourse Summary and Exercises\nThis section has dual purposes.\nFor one, it is a good summary of the course and provides you with exercises to test your knowledge and then provide solutions for comparison.\nSecondly, If you are short-on time, you can start here and then move to other sections if you seek more granular coverage of the topic or when you have more time available.\nTOOLS USED\nJupyter Notebook (IDE)\nMatplotlib 2.x\nSeaborn 0.8.1 or above\nPandas 0.22 or above",

      "description": "Microservices are an architectural style that promotes the development of complex applications as a suite of small services based on business capabilities. This course will help you identify the appropriate service boundaries within the business.\nWe'll start by looking at what microservices are, and their main characteristics. We will develop a basic distributed system using the microservice architecture and tools such as RabbitMQ service bus, to send messages across the separated services, or MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database. Within the course, we will focus on creating the HTTP API to act as a gateway to the whole system and so-called Activities Service, responsible for handling the incoming messages (or actually the commands that will be distributed through the services bus). We'll also implement the Identity Service, which will serve JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate requests incoming to the API. Our application will let the user store information about the activities performed at a given date for a selected category, for example, work, tasks, sport, and so on.\nOnce the request to save the activity is published within the system, the Activities Service will handle the business logic and decide whether the activity is valid, which will eventually result in publishing the event about processing the successful or rejected activity. In the course, you will also learn about commands and events as well as handlers which is one of the most popular design patterns when it comes to creating distributed systems.\nBy the end of the course, your services will be built using ASP.NET Core framework and later on, you will use tools such as Docker and Docker Compose to pack your application into the container and deploy it to the virtual machine running in the cloud.\nThis course uses .NET Core 2.0 while not the latest version available, it provides relevant and informative content for legacy users of .NET Core.\nAbout The Author\nBorn and raised in Kraków, Piotr holds an M.Sc.Eng. degree in Applied Informatics. He has over 7 years' experience as software engineer and architect but is also interested in topics such as DevOps. He is a co-founder of the Noordwind teal organization and is a full stack developer working mainly with C#, .NET, .NET Core, and JavaScript technologies. He's also a big fan of DDD, CQRS, RESTful APIs, and distributed systems using the microservices pattern. Piotr is a well-known member of the Polish .NET community and his mission is to deliver the best content possible in terms of free and open software as well as programming courses. On top of that, he's an active open source contributor, consultant, blogger, public speaker, mentor, lecturer and co-organizer of the .NET Core Tour. In any spare time he enjoys lifting weights, running, and riding a motorcycle.",

        "This video course is for .NET Core developers who want to learn and understand the microservice architecture and implement it in their .NET Core applications. It's ideal for developers who are completely new to microservices or have just a theoretical understanding of this architectural approach and want to gain a practical perspective in order to better manage application complexity."

      "description": "Today, almost every industry is facing disruption and unanticipated competition that requires them to respond to changing business needs in a faster way. Businesses need their IT departments to take a fresh approach and leverage modern tools to provide innovative solutions. Traditional approaches are proving to be too slow to deliver a timely solution. The platforms which are deployment centric with DevOps initiatives are proving to be beneficial.\nOpenShift is an open source, cloud-based platform-as-a-service that combines everything into a single platform and allows you to manage tasks easily. OpenShift combines DevOps, Containers, Microservices, Kubernetes on the Cloud and fits on top of these. OpenShift container platform is built around ‘Docker’, providing application containerization and ‘Kubernetes’, doing container orchestration and management. It supports a vast range of applications and makes the developer’s job of developing and deploying applications easy. It allows you to create, modify, deploy and scale your apps quickly and easily.\nIn the coming years, more and more organizations will spend about 80% of IT budgets on cloud solutions.\nBased on a report by the Information Communications Technology Council (ICTC), Canada will have to fill 182,000 IT professionals by 2019\nThere is already a serious shortage of hireable developers. Simply, there’s a massive opportunity for people like you to equip yourself with the right skillset so that you can:\nJoin talent-hungry large tech companies or start-ups and be at the forefront of global innovation\nLaunch unique businesses or containerised application development services for the next generation\nEnjoy plush paying cool OpenShift projects\nWhatever your choice may be, OpenShift container platform is going to be YOUR KEY to financial success and growth and for the success of the community as a whole!\nOur course \"Hands-On Guide To  OpenShift Container Application Platform\" will provide you with all the information you need to get started with Openshift.\nNow look at these figures:\n4.7% population in the US is unemployed\n14% of the US population is underemployed\nThe rate of unemployment stands at 6.6% in Canada\nA whopping 40% of the young Canadian graduates are overqualified for the jobs they are handling\nTogether we can bring happiness in the lives of these young, unemployed and underemployed population by teaching them the skills that are “in demand” and paying well.\nWe know what you’re thinking… “But don’t these pioneering companies and exciting tech start-ups need a college degree or certifications to even get my foot in the door?” - not quite. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, said during an interview “There’s no need to even have a degree at all, or even high school certificate...if there’s a track record of exceptional ability”....skill trumps credentials.\nThe challenge is - where do you learn these skills? Not everyone has the 7+ years to get a Ph.D. in computer science or the patience to self-teach from scattered sources and dense textbooks, not to forget the bank-busting financial investment!. It is about time that the world gets access to these valuable skills and we need it NOW!\nWhy OpenShift Container Platform\nOver the years containerization has become a very popular technology. However, the excessive growth in this direction is posing a big challenge of managing containerized applications. This challenge can be met with the use of OpenShift. Many technology giants like Barclays, UPS, and Pioneer are using OpenShift. Startups are also trying to make the most of this boom by building containerized applications.\nTherefore, OpenShift container platform is presenting numerous opportunities before businesses. OpenShift combines DevOps, Containers, Microservices, Kubernetes on the Cloud and fits on top of these. Developer’s job of developing and deploying applications becomes easy with OpenShift.\n\n\nWhat Sets Us Apart?\nOpenShift container platform course does not assume any expertise in container application development. We give you step by step instructions and in fact, we hand hold you through all the exercises together with you. So you can follow along and understand exactly how OpenShift and container application deployment comes together and what each step means.\nPractical demo tutorials – Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding of not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we focus on building up your understanding of the inner working of the OpenShift for infinitely better results down the line.\nReal-world knowledge – We work with real start-ups and real projects every day. We know first-hand the problems engineers and architects face on daily basis. All this real-world experience is passed on to you in the courses. Each module comprises of in-depth demos and walk-throughs, meaning you’ll garner enough skill to build your own container application using OpenShift, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.\nStudent support – We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven OpenShift container platform course on the planet. So we are there for our students whenever you need our help. You can contact us and ask any question at any time - you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours.\nGrab your copy today!

The speaker instantly gained my excitement and favor which is exactly what I was hoping would happen. This excellent connection makes it easy for me to follow along.\" — Kendra, Udemy student, Docker Mastery course.\nExtra things that come with this course:\nAccess to the course Slack Chat team, for getting help/advice from me and other students.\nWeekly YouTube Live Q&A's where you can ask me questions live.\nBonus videos I put elsewhere like YouTube and share via Udemy announcements.\nTons of reference links to supplement this content.\nUpdates to content as products change their features on these topics.\nWhat you will learn in this course:\nYou'll start with a quick review about getting set up with Docker, as well as Docker Compose basics. That way we're on the same page for the basics.\nThen you'll jump into Node.js Dockerfile basics, that way you'll have a good Dockerfile foundation for new features we'll add throughout the course.\nYou'll be building on all the different things you learn from each Lecture in the course. Once you have the basics down of Compose, Dockerfile, and Docker Image, then you'll focus on nuances like how Docker and Linux control the Node process and how Docker changes that to make sure you know what options there are for starting up and shutting down Node.js and the right way to do it in different scenarios.\nWe'll cover advanced, newer features around making the Dockerfile the most efficient and flexible as possible using things like BuildKit and Multi-stage.\nThen we'll talk about distributed computing and cloud design to ensure your Node.js apps have 12-factor design in your containers, as well as learning how to migrate old apps into this new way of doing things.\nNext we cover Compose and its awesome features to get really efficient local development and test set-up using the Docker Compose command line and Docker Compose YAML file.\nWith all this knowledge, you'll progress to production concerns and making images production-ready.\nThen we'll jump into deploying those containers and running them in production. Whether you use Docker Engine or orchestration with Kubernetes or Swarm, I've got you covered. In addition, we'll cover HTTP connections and reverse proxies for connection handling and routing with multi-container systems.\nLastly, you'll get a final, big assignment where you'll be building and deploying a large, complex solution, including multiple Node.js containers that are doing different things. You'll build Docker images, Dockerfiles, and compose files, and deploy them to a server to test. You'll need to check whether connections failover properly. You'll basically take everything you've learned and apply it in one big project!\n\"Bret knows, lives, breaths and loves his technology stack. The passion and belief always comes through in all of his courses which is why I will always recommend his work.\" — Steven Hunt, Udemy student, Docker Swarm Mastery course\nWhy should you learn from me?\nI'm A Practitioner.

With almost 5 hours of content, we'll focus on the three main types of users in Confluence. The modules in this course are broken up for each of these types, so no matter which one you are you'll be able to quickly access the things you need.\nIn the second module, we'll look at Confluence from an end user's perspective. What are the key things you'll need to know as someone who's just using Confluence at your company? That's what we'll look at in the second module.\nWhen you're a team leader or manager using Confluence, there's some things you can do to help your team be more effective. So we'll look at some of these things in the third module.\nFinally, as a Confluence administrator there's a lot of ways you can help your company by setting them up for success in Confluence. In the fourth module, we'll look at JIRA from an administrator's perspective.\nNow even though this course is organized for different types of users, I wanted to make it so no matter what type of user you are you'll benefit from watching all of it if you wanted. For example, even if you're only using Confluence as an end user you can find it beneficial to understand how Confluence workflows and processes work so you can \"speak the language\" when you're asking your Confluence administrator for something.",

      "description": "This course is designed to be a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to learning the Git source control specifically designed for Windows users, which means no prior knowledge or experience is required but students will emerge at the end with a very solid understanding and hands-on experience with Git and related source control concepts. Since this course is design for Windows users in mind, we will cover both command line and graphical clients for Git while learning the underlying concepts. If you use other operating systems too, most of the concepts will transfer over without much effort.\nCourse Outline\nCourse Introduction and Overview provides an introduction to this course and the Git source control system and sets the stage for the rest of the course.\nAfter the introduction, this first thing we do is run through the Installation process. If you don’t want to watch installation videos, you can simply follow the installation notes at the end of that section.\nFor those not familiar with the command line or Bash shell environment, I provide a handy Git Bash section for those interested.\nQuick Start a very quick (15 minutes), hands-on introduction to Git. We start off by signing up for GitHub, creating a repository there, the makiing a local copy (clone), local changes (add/commit) and then update GitHub with our changes (push). This is the most common workflow developers will do using Git.\nOnce we have worked through the basic add/commit/push workflow, we can do the same steps, and a few more, using the Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell— really to show how the Git-related command work identically regardless of the shell used.\nTo prepare for the rest of the course, and a more common developer setup, we will install and configure a Text Editor (Atom) to work seamlessly with Git.\nIn Basic Commands, we walk through all the foundational commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable Git for an existing project) all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files. We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally being committed and how to review your repository's history.\nWith a strong foundation in place, we explore ways to make Comparisons in Git, including all the different local states, between commits, and between local and remote repositories.\nWe give great attending to Branching and Merging in Git. We start off with the simple \"happy path\" and learn about \"Fast-Forward\" merges and how to control them. The we walk through common \"automatic\" merges. Then, we cause trouble on purpose so we can step through resolving conflicting merges with our visual merge tool. Finally, we work with branches on the GitHub hosting service.\nWith a solid foundation in place using Git on the command line, we will look at various Git graphical clients starting with the official Git GUI client on Windows. With Git GUI, we cover many of the same commands, but simply using the graphical client instead of the command line.\nAnother way to interact with Git is via the Windows Shell or Windows File Explorer in which we can use the default Git integration provided by Git for Windows and even deeper integration using TortoiseGit.\nCourse Features\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.\nScreencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There is over 6 hours of screencast based video training in order to step through each command or action in sufficient detail.\nAll videos are available in high quality 1080p / Full HD resolution for sharp and clear viewing on modern desktops and tablets although resolution delivery is dependent on student’s device capabilities detected by the Udemy video player.\nSeveral attachments and document lectures throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.\nMoving Forward\nThis course will expand periodically to include more topics, supporting materials and bonus content! Some content may be in direct response to student feedback or discussions -- so get engaged with the course discussions  (Q&A) feature!",

Manual configuration of infrastructure is a full time job that takes away from other valuable activities that is prone to errors and difficulties in reproducing system state. Ansible allows one to create plans for managing infrastructure using an agentless (no outside system required) approach. During this show we will cover what Ansible is, how to set up Ansible, and use Ansible to create reproducible server configurations.\nCourse Format\n•          Binge-worthy TV shows! Watch comprehensive, in-depth episodes that use a talk show-like format to keep you engaged while learning.\n•          You can pick and choose episodes or you can watch as a complete series.\n•          A little humor, anecdotes, and real-world examples.\nOther Courses\nReady to become a DevPro?

As a result, there are times that certain tools, editors, libraries have changed. While syntax or names may change, the foundations remain the same. Though we hope to keep things updated, there may be time before that can occur. I recommend seeing if you can translate between changes and if all fails, ask questions!",

      "description": "The following sentence is annoying, but also true: the best time to learn Git was yesterday. Fortunately, the second best time is today!  Git is an essential tool for work in any code-related field, from data science to game development to machine learning.  This course covers everything you need to know to start using Git and Github in the real-world today!\nThe course's 20+ sections are broken down into four separate units:\nGit Essentials\nNext Level Git\nGithub & Collaboration\nThe Tricky Bits\nWe start off with Git Essentials.  The goal of this unit is to give you all the essential Git tools you need for daily use.  We start off talking about version control software, what it is, why it matters, and the history of Git.  Then we install Git and run through the Unix commands you'll need to work with Git (you can skip this if you're already familiar).  The bulk of this unit is focused on teaching the core Git mechanics like committing and branching and the associated concepts: the working directory, the repository, the staging area, etc.    We cover Git commands including: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log, git branch, and git merge.  We end with a detailed look at branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.\nThen we move on to out Next Level Git unit, where we cover additional commands and Git concepts that are extremely useful, but maybe not as \"core\" as the Git Essentials.  We start with a comprehensive look at the gif diff command and the various comparisons that we can make between commits, branches, the working directory, the staging area, and more!  We pay special attention to reading and parsing the dense output generated by diffs.  Then we shift our focus to stashing with the git stash command, a \"convenience command\" that many users love incorporating into their Git workflow.  Finally, we dive deep into undoing changes and time traveling with Git.  We learn how to revisit earlier work, detach and re-attach HEAD, and discard changes.  We cover git commands that help us undo changes including git checkout, git restore, git reset, and git revert.\nNext up, we change gears to focus on Github & Collaboration.  We start by exploring Github (and similar tools) that host remote repositories and discussing the benefits they provide.  We create our own Github repositories and sync up changes between our remote and local repositories using the git push, git pull, and git fetch commands.  We then focus on commonly used collaboration workflows that students may encounter in the real world: feature branching, pull requests, forking & cloning, and more! We discuss contributing to open source projects and configuring Github repositories for collaboration. We also spend some time learning about useful Github features including Github Gists and Github Pages for free static hosting.\nThe last unit in the course, The Tricky Bits, is really just a collection of useful Git command and advanced topics.  We start by covering one of the \"scarier\" Git commands: rebasing!  We discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of rebasing and compare it to merging.  Then we learn how to clean up our Git history by rewording, editing, dropping, and squashing commits using the interactive rebase command.  Next, we discuss Git tags (lightweight and annotated tags) semantic versioning and tagging workflows.  After that, we move on to a deep dive into the inner workings of Git.  We discuss the files and folders Git uses internally, the role of hashing functions in Git, and the role of Git objects (blobs, trees, etc.). Next, we talk about reference logs and the git reflog command.  Specifically, we learn how we can use reflogs to rescue \"lost\" commits and undo rebases.  Finally, we learn how to write custom and powerful Git aliases!\nThroughout the course, you'll find tons and tons of diagrams and visual references I've created to try and explain Git.  The course also includes exercises I've tested on my in-person students, to give you an opportunity to practice the concepts in the course along the way.  If you are reading this sentence, I congratulate you on making it this far :) I hope you enjoy the course!",

By the end of the course students will have hands-on experience working with Git and Github and will be able to use Version Control on any project.\nCourse Principles\nLearn By Doing -- We believe that the best way to learn is by doing. That is why all of the core videos are designed for you to be able to follow along and reinforce the concepts taught in the video by actually typing along.\n80/20 Rule -- With most technologies it takes 20% of the knowledge about the technology to be able to accomplish 80% of the tasks you need to do with that technology. Therefore it’s important to start by learning that crucial 20% that allows you to get up and running with the technology quickly. We still believe that you should learn the rest as well so we’ve included that material in the Advanced Topics section and continue to add to it.\nI do, We do, You do -- We believe that the best way to learn a new technology is to first observe how it is used, then code along with someone, and finally use the technology yourself. This is why we have our videos along with assignments throughout the course that allow you to solidify what you learned from following along.\nCourse Structure\nThe course is split into two main sections: Core Competencies and Advanced Topics.\nWithin the Core Competencies we first go over using the Terminal for students who have absolutely no experience with the Terminal (this section can easily be skipped by those who already feel comfortable interacting with the Terminal). We teach students how to navigate their folder structure and create files and folders. We then jump straight into Git and teach students how to create repositories and commit changes. We then teach students how to “go back in time” with resetting and reverting before moving on to branching and merging. After teaching the basics of Git we add in Github to show students how to interact with a remote repository and then we go over the proper workflow for collaborating using a remote repository.\nAfter going through the Core Competencies we feel that the student will have a solid foundation to be able to use Git with collaborators on 80% of the tasks they may need to tackle.\nIn the Advanced Topics section we periodically add content on some more advanced aspects of git including Rebasing, Stashing, advanced Merge scenarios, etc. to make sure that students always have a place to learn the advanced concepts that they may not see too often but still need to know.\nSign up for the course and Learn Git Today!",

      "description": "In the past decade, cloud computing has been gaining popularity at a tremendous rate. Some cloud providers are experiencing a growth rate of 50% year over year – which is just astounding. And the reason for this growth is obvious – cloud computing enables ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal effort.\nMicrosoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications.\nThe Azure Resource Manager, provided by Microsoft Azure, is a versatile service that simplifies how you manage your cloud resources. The Azure Resource Manager can help you define, build and maintain your application in a consistent manner. Within the context of Azure Stack, the Azure Resource Manager is the management layer (API) where you connect to for deploying resources.\nWith Azure Resource Manager (ARM) you can deploy, delete, or update all resources for your solution in a single and coordinated operation by using templates. The templates are in the form of JSON format, and these templates can be used for deployment in different environments such as staging, testing, and production. The Resource Manager helps in providing auditing, security, and tagging features to help you manage your resources post-deployment.\nAlthough we have the Azure portal for managing the resources but in cases where you need to maintain and deploy multiple servers, in complex configurations - it might get a cumbersome to handle these deployment and configuration activities via the point and click portal. Moreover remembering every resource category and their respective cost evaluation can become a mammoth task.\nAs companies look forward to automating deployment, scaling, and operations of cloud applications in the Azure cloud (across clusters of hosts), there is a need for providing automated deployment solutions for the cloud infrastructure. With Azure ARM Templates, you can define your infrastructure environment in simple JSON file template. These file templates can be versioned, validated and checked into your source control systems. This is what we call Infrastructure-as-code (IaC).\nDo you know what it takes to design and deploy sophisticated cloud applications and manage your complex infrastructure via the use of ARM templates?\nHow does one go about automating the configuration of the cloud resources in the Azure cloud environment?\nHow to make the deployment process consistent and repeatable?\nHow to scale the infrastructure with a simple push of a button or a simple command?\nThese are some of the fundamental problems Cloud and DevOps engineers struggle with on a daily basis.\nThis course teaches you how to design, deploy, configure and manage your Azure cloud resources with Azure ARM Templates. The course will start with an introduction to the Azure ARM templates and their core features. Then we will dive deeper into designing and deploying our cloud resources with the use of these templates.\nIf you’re serious about building scalable, flexible and robust Azure ARM Templates for deploying your cloud infrastructure, then this course is for you.\nThese DevOps and Cloud Computing skills are in high demand, but there’s no easy way to acquire this knowledge. Rather than rely on hit and trial method, this course will provide you with all the information you need to get started with your Azure cloud projects.\nStartups and technology companies pay big bucks for experience and skills in these technologies. They demand DevOps and cloud engineers to automate the deployment of their cloud resources  -  and in turn, you can demand top dollar for your abilities.\nDo you want the skills and be highly sought after? Do you want your career to touch cloud 9?\nDid you answer, “Absolutely” to that question? If so, then our new training program\n\"Azure Masterclass: Manage your Azure Cloud with ARM Templates\"\nis for you.\n\nWe have been in the software industry for more than two decades. We’ve been part of many prestigious projects and startups. Over this span, we have gained great insight into what makes for flexible, scalable and robust software and IT solutions. We are passionate about sharing all our collective knowledge with YOU!!\n\nIn this course,\n“Azure Masterclass: Manage your Azure Cloud with ARM Templates”,\nyou will get an in-depth look at how to utilize Azure ARM Templates for designing and deploying your Azure cloud resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.\nYou may be a cloud veteran or an enthusiast - if you invest your time and bring an eagerness to learn, we guarantee you real, actionable education at a fraction of the cost you can demand as a cloud engineer or consultant. We are confident your investment will come back to you many-fold in no time.\nSo, if you're ready to make a change and learn how to build some cool ARM Templates in the cloud, click the \"Add to Cart\" button below.\nLook, if you're serious about becoming an expert cloud engineer and generating a significant income for you and your family, it’s time to take action.\n\nImagine getting that promotion which you’ve been promised for the last two presidential terms. Imagine getting chased by recruiters looking for skilled and experienced engineers by companies that are desperately seeking help.\nWe call those good problems to have",

      "description": "Containerization technology are becoming popular day by day just because of its microservices architectures have profoundly changed the way of developing and operating a modern software. It enables IT organizations to become more agile and scalable. Today less than 30 percent of businesses are currently utilizing them, by 2021, more than half will leverage the power of containerization, according to Gartner. This number is likely to spike more than 75 percent by 2022. Due to which it's demand in the market is exponentially grown.\n\n\nDocker and Kubernetes are the market leader in the world of containerization. Docker, make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. And to manage numbers of container, Kubernetes and Openshift like container orchestration tools are used. Kubernetes is little bit complex comparing to Openshift.\nWhat are the benefits of using Openshift over Kubernetes?\nOpenshift has stronger security policies than Kubernetes.\nOpenshift’s web console is easy to access the console, create or change resources through a form and also visualize servers, projects, and cluster roles.\nOpenshift offers seamless integration with CI/CD pipeline building tools like Jenkins.\nEasy node configuration in Openshift\nTemplates, Source to image, Image streams and triggers which makes Openshift more powerful then Kubernetes.\nIn this learning track you'll learn the similarities and difference between Openshift and Kubernetes then create YAML files to create pods, services, replica controller, replica set, deployment and deployment config. Then, scaling up/down of applications, updating and rolling back of applications and much more.\nLectures backed by practical exercises makes it easy to understand without wasting time in doing troubleshooting. This is the only course that provides 90% practical hands on with 10% theory to support the topic.",

What is a rebase, anyway?\nIn this course, students will walk though comparing (diffs), branching, merging and rebasing in Git. At the end of this course, students will have a firm understanding and experience with those paricular aspects of Git. Note: This is not a comprehensive course on Git -- we focus exclusively on comparing, branching, merging, and rebasing.\nRecent Course Updates\nOctober 17: Added Updates and Errata section\nCourse Outline\nCourse Introduction and Overview provides an introduction to this course.\nAfter the introduction, the first thing we do is Git Installation for both Windows and Mac. There are dedicated sections for Windows and Mac -- so students can jump directly to the lectures specifically designed for their system. After the installation process, we will download the example project repository from GitHub (clone) which we will use throughout the course.\nAfter installation and downloading the example project, we explore ways to make Comparisons in Git, including all the different local states, between commits, and between local and remote repositories.\nWe give great attending to Branching and Merging in Git. We start off with the simple \"happy path\" and learn about \"Fast-Forward\" merges and how to control them. The we walk through common \"automatic\" merges. Finally, we cause trouble on purpose so we can step through resolving conflicting merges with our visual merge tool.\nWith a strong foundation in branching and merging, we will then cover a more complex topic, Rebasing. In that section, we cover several rebasing examples, including how to resolve a rebase conflict.\nAll tools have installation and configuration sections to ensure no one is left behind.\nCourse Features\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.\nScreencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There is nearly 2 hours of screencast based video training in order to step through each command or action in sufficient detail.\nSpecial Notes\nThis course is part of the \"Git Going\" series and is included with the Git Complete comprehensive course. If you are already enrolled in that course, do not enroll in this course.\nThis course makes extensive use of the command line. Each command is discussed in detail, so everyone can follow along.",

Within the course a lot of AWS and DevOps tips and trick would be discovered.\n\n\nCOURSE STRUCTURE:\nTeh first one is about how to deploy ES as an AWS service, which is called OpenSearch. Here I will tell you about interesting OpenSearch pitfalls that I discovered during my commercial practice. And believe me - you will not find that information at AWS documentation. You will get a ready terraform module for deploying the Opensearch cluster and we will analyze it step by step together.\nIn the 2d part I will show how to deploy an ES cluster at ECS (Elastic Container Service). And again we will use the terraform modules for that. I will show you why you can't use Fargate in that case and how many problems should be resolved to deploy ES at ECS.\nNext course section is about how to deploy ES at EC2 instances using docker swarm. I will prove to you that it is the easiest and at the same time the most cheap way to deploy ES at almost any cloud for most small and middle companies with a steady growth pattern. You will get ready terraform modules that will allow you to prepare AWS infrastructure and ansible modules for deploying HA ES cluster upon it.\nThe 4th part is devoted to autoscaling possibilities of ES cluster using different deployment approaches. We will talk about what we really can autoscale, when we can use it and what big limitations we have in case of working with ES.\n5th module is devoted to the theory. If you are already familiar with ES cluster conceptions and everything that is related to shards and ES performance - then you can skip it. But if not - that is the place where you have to start from.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nSoftware engineers\nDevOps engineers\nEverybody who likes ElasticSearch/OpenSearch and want to get more knowledge around it",

Many companies have adopted to use continuous integration/delivery/deployment and enjoying great benefits DevOps has to offer. Cloud is one more big thing happening in the recent past. Cloud migration projects are a common sight across organisations these days. IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is an integral part when it comes to provisioning your infrastructure in Cloud.\nI have designed this course in such a way that it blends both DevOps CI/CD and IaC to give you a perfect end to end holistic picture. I have explained each concept step by step using real world projects and examples.  When it comes to DevOps tool chain there are tons of tools. So, I have selected the most mature and widely in-practice(used) tools.\nThis course is delivered in 3 logical stages.\nStage 1 : We will provision our own virtual data centre in AWS using Infrastructure as Code with the help of Terraform. Terraform is the most popular tool when it comes to IaC.\nStage 2 : We will configure the DevOps tool chain. Git for VCS(Version Control), GitHub for SCM (Source Code Management), Maven as build tool, Jenkins as continuous integration tool, Nexus as repository manager, Sonarqube for static code analysis, Ansible for build and configuration management, Apache tomcat and Docker to host our web application.\nStage 3 : We will learn PaC (Pipeline as Code), How to write Jenkinsfile from scratch. We will then create pipeline job(CI/CD) using all the above mentioned DevOps tool chain step by step.\nThe course also has Quiz sections which are a great way to check your learning. In fact, these quiz sections are great way to learn as well.\nThere is always a great demand for the DevOps professionals so learning DevOps will greatly help you in your professional career.\nA little about me : I am Vinay and I have 19+ years of working experience in IT industry across various domains. I am positive that this course will help you to understand IaC and CI/CD (end to end). I will thank you for subscribing and wish you a happy learning.",

At the end of this course, I’ll show you how you can convert a metallic GNR to semiconducting material or vice versa by modeling defects throughout the body of Graphene, as I did myself. I proposed a new method to tune Band Gap size of CNTs and GNRs, a critical electronic property of nanostructures and I published the results in credible journals.\nI ensure you that you’ll be able to the conduct the similar research and project at the end of this course, and the good news is, once I designed this course, I supposed you have no prior knowledge, so everyone with any level and background is welcome to learn how to work with nanostructures.\nThroughout this course, we’ll see what is band-structure? the famous E-K diagram that appears everywhere and you have heard about. You will learn how to interpret band structure and you become familiar with concept of direct and indirect band gap. Next, we proceed and I’ll teach how you can obtain band structure and band gap of any repetitive nanostructure by using Tight Binding method. First I’ll give you the theory of TB and how to fill Hamiltonian matrix and then we step into coding stage. Together we solve examples in Matlab and I’ll show you how to develop a systematic simulator based on TB for any dimension of GNRs and CNTs. You’ll be able to extract band structure and Band Gap, and we’ll do a cool project at the end that gives you ideas of how you implement what you learnt to conduct wonderful valuable research.\nIf it sounds exciting don’t hesitate to enroll right now and I’m looking forward to seeing you in the course.\n\n\nThere is no RISK!\nThis course comes with a full 30-day money-back guarantee, which means that if you are not happy after your purchase, you can get a 100% refund with no question.

      "description": "This course will teach you DevOps concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, with emphasis on Jenkins, Git and Maven build automation.\nDevOps as a software development practice has been around for quite a long time now, but the term has been coined only in the recent past and it is becoming more and more relevant, given that companies ranging from small start ups to behemoths like Amazon Netflix Google are investing billions into it.\n\nDevOps automation experts are in great demand now and is proving to be a very lucrative career move.\nThe course has been designed, keeping this demand in mind so that you get to learn both concepts and at the same time get to work on it, hands on. I am sure, that by the end of this course you will feel very confident in building and deploying a fully automated and functional Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline in Jenkins.\n\nYou will learn DevOps concepts and Jenkins from scratch. You are also taught Maven, that is probably the most popular tool used for build automation.\nHere is a brief of what you would learn:\nDevOps Concepts - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery\nDifferences between DevOps Concepts like CI and CD\nJenkins Terminology along with the UI\nAll about Apache Maven\nJenkins jobs for implementing DevOps Continuous Integration\nJenkins jobs for continuous testing, static code analysis\nJenkins jobs for DevOps Continuous Deployment\nJenkins jobs for DevOps Continuous Delivery\nBuild Pipeline in Jenkins\nJenkins Distributed Builds with Master Slave Architecture\nJenkins Pipeline as Code\nAt appropriate stages you would be given exercises and projects to work on that would help you explore on your own and also refresh your learning.\nThe course goes over the topics step by step - For each topic - DevOps, Jenkins, Maven, Git and Jenkins Pipelines - in sufficient detail and adopts a code/work along method so that students can run the builds in parallel to the instructor.\n\nThe theory has been kept to a minimum and crisp, just enough to get you the context before you start hands on.",

Understanding how to exploit servers, networks, and applications means that you will also be able to better prevent malicious exploitation. From website and network hacking, to pen testing in Python and Metasploit, Udemy has a course for you.\n\nFAQ regarding Ethical Hacking :\n\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network. An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals.\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system. An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement. An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer. They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them. With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles.\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk. For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks. When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing :\n\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched. Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack.\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results.\n\nAt the end of the course you will learn;\n\nWireless Operating Modes: Ad-hoc, Infrastructure, Monitor modes.\nWireless Packet Types\nMAC Frame Structure\nAnalysing Packet Types with Wireshark\nWi-Fi Network Interaction, Authentication MethodsWEP vs WPA/WPA2\nWPA2 4-Way Handshake\nWPA Personal and Enterprise\nWireless Reconnaissance with Bettercap\nWardriving with Kismet, Mapping with Google Earth\nRogue Access Points with Airbase-ng, Wifi Pumpkin 3, Fluxion\nHandshake Snooper and Captive Portal Attack with Fluxion\nEvil Twin Attack\nWEP Cracking with Client and Clientless Networks\nFake Authentication Attack\nDeauthentication Attack with Bettercap\nARP Request Replay Attack\nFragmentation Attack\nChopChop Attack\nCracking WPA/WPA2 with Aircrack-ng, John The Ripper, Cowpatty, Wifite 2\nPasswordlists\nWPA/WPA2 Cracking using GPUs with Hashcat\nKey Reinstallation Attacks (KRACK)\nWPS PIN Attacks and more...\n\nNetwork Security\nethical\nEthical Intelligence\nnmap nessus\nnmap course\nnmap metaspolit\nComplete nmap\nKali linux nmap\nethical hacking\npenetration testing\nbug bounty\nhack\ncyber security\nkali linux\nandroid hacking\nnetwork security\nhacking\nsecurity\nsecurity testing\nnmap\nmetasploit\nmetasploit framework\npenetration testing\noscp\nsecurity testing\nwindows hacking\nexploit\nbug bounty\nbug bounty hunting\nwebsite hacking\nweb hacking\npentest+\npentest plus\nOSINT (Open Source Intelligent )\nsocial engineering\nphishing\nsocial engineering tool kit\nwifi hacking wireless hacking password cracking wireless cracking wifi Wi-Fi Hacking and Wireless Penetration wifi hacking and wireless penetration testing wi-fi hacking muharrem aydin hacking kismet wireless hack wifi password hacking wireless penetration wifi cracking wifi password wps wireless penetration test wpa2 wifi hack recon wifi crack wifi hacking course hashcat wi-fi hacking wifi wifi penetration hack wifi wireless penetration testing wi-fi password penetration testing course offensive resources learn wifi hacking wi-fi hacking and wireless cracking wifi crack wifi evil twin attack\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nIt doesn't need any prior knowledge to learn Ethical Hacking\nThis course starts with very basics.

      "description": "What is Docker?\nDocker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.\nWhy do developers like it?\nWith Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. “Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere - colleagues’ OS X and Windows laptops, QA servers running Ubuntu in the cloud, and production data center VMs running Red Hat.\nDevelopers can get going quickly by starting with one of the 13,000+ apps available on Docker Hub. Docker manages and tracks changes and dependencies, making it easier for sysadmins to understand how the apps that developers build work. And with Docker Hub, developers can automate their build pipeline and share artifacts with collaborators through public or private repositories.\nDocker helps developers build and ship higher-quality applications, faster.\nWhy do sysadmins like it?\nSysadmins use Docker to provide standardized environments for their development, QA, and production teams, reducing “works on my machine” finger-pointing. By “Dockerizing” the app platform and its dependencies, sysadmins abstract away differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure.\nIn addition, standardizing on the Docker Engine as the unit of deployment gives sysadmins flexibility in where workloads run. Whether on-premise bare metal or data center VMs or public clouds, workload deployment is less constrained by infrastructure technology and is instead driven by business priorities and policies. Furthermore, the Docker Engine’s lightweight runtime enables rapid scale-up and scale-down in response to changes in demand.\nDocker helps sysadmins deploy and run any app on any infrastructure, quickly and reliably.",

      "description": "This course is designed to help you gain The Git Mindset. Using mechanisms like storytelling, hands-on-labs and quizzes, you'll gain a deep intuition about Git. To follow this course, you don't need any prior knowledge.\nThe course uses a story to explain not only what Git does, but also how it does those things and why it was designed that way.\nNote: This course is up-to-date and uses the newer commands (switch and restore) introduced in Git 2.23.\nGitting the hang of it - Building intuition about Git\nThis section goes over the story of the smallest team with the simplest workflow - a lone developer named Ana who's working on her software project on her personal machine. Over time, we'll introduce additional requirements like the need to manage historical versions, the need to create backups, the need to collaborate with additional team members etc. Each of these requirements will lead to a change in the version control system and eventually this fictitious version control system (Tig) will have evolved into something very much resembling Git. This section will help you internalize the core concepts of Git with ease.\nGitting our hands dirty! - studying Git basics\nWe'll take a break from learning the core concepts of Git and try using Git ourselves. This entire section is a series of labs where you'll follow along and get hands on experience with Git. You'll find that the previous section has prepared you with enough core concepts that you'll find everything quite straight forward. By the end of this section, you'll know how to craft commits with care and how to study them.\nThe team Gits going again!\nThis section will resume the story of Tig. This time, we'll use storytelling to arrive at the concepts of branching and merging. The story will help you not only understand what branching and merging are, but also how they work and what kinds of problems they help us solve.\nLet's Git back into it - resuming our study of Git\nThis section takes the concepts illustrated through a story in the last section and shows you how they apply to Git. By the end of this section, you'll be comfortable with branching and merging in Git. You'll know how to navigate the history of your project with ease. This will help you greatly with navigating new codebases and in troubleshooting bugs.\nDealing with remotes\nThis section shows you how to manage Git remotes and how to transfer information between them. The concepts covered in this section are essential for effectively managing your repository through source code hosting providers like Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab etc.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you'll truly understand Git and you'll be able to use it like it's second nature.\nThis course comes with a 30-day money back guarantee. No questions asked.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll emojis designed by OpenMoji – the open-source emoji and icon project.

It's such a commonplace tool that it's rarely mentioned on job postings because it's assumed that, no matter what your skill level is, that you KNOW how to use Git and GitHub.\nI've worked with several teams and companies over the years and everything you'll learn in this course is what I tend to use almost every day and certainly every week.\nTo learn how to use Git and GitHub does not take 10, 8 or even 6 hours. The truth is Git is a complicated program, but using Git is easy!\nThere are a number of commands you'll use every day, and a few more commands you'll see once or twice a week. Beyond that, you would be learning advanced Git that you'll never use, ever! Don't get stuck learning tools and commands that you'll never use. By taking this course, you are going to learn all the important aspects of Git and GitHub, and you won't be wasting 6+ hours learning things you'll never use.\nThis course is designed to teach you Git the way the it's used everyday by a developer who uses it every day.\nHere's the rough outline of everything you'll learn in this course:\nHow to use Git on the command line (pro tip: it's more important to learn Git from the command line first than it is to learn how to use a visual tool. Servers don't have visual programs)\nInstalling Git on Windows, Mac and Linux\nHow to configure Git on your computer, and add your SSH key\nCreating, cloning and adding files to a GitHub repository\nManaging files, commits and branches\nHow to merge branches into other branches\nHow to view old files from an older time\nViewing file differences and how to ignore certain file types\nForking repos (repositories)\nHow to work on GitHub by:\nCreating custom branches and tags\nOpening and managing GitHub issues\nOpening and managing pull requests\nHow to undo a little work, and a lot of work\nHow to rebase\nHow to work through merge and rebase conflicts\nAnd much much more!\nPlus we'll work through lots of real life examples together and get you'll get hands on experience with all of this by creating your own repositories, forking my repo, and even safely opening a pull request on my work for some seriously hands on experience (because Git is better learned by doing).\nAs an added bonus, you'll also learn GitHub fundamentals — and everything you learn about Git and GitHub is completely transferable to GitLab and Bit Bucket!\nHow to tell if this course is for you:\nHave you never used Git or GitHub?\nHave you ever wondered how Git works?\nHave you ever gotten stuck using Git?\nHave you ever needed to ask for help when using Git?\nHave you ever ran into a tricky Git conflict?\nHave you ever wondered how to efficiently use GitHub?\nIf you answered yes to any of the questions above, this course is 100% for you.\n—\nAnd if you're still not convinced you'll learn some cool things in this course, feel free to watch the first 20+ videos for free — I've enabled so many free previews in this course because I'm convinced you'll walk away feeling excited and confident about your new Git skills!",

If you here, then most probably nanotechnology and its super exciting potentials has attracted your attention and you want to know more, orrr, you want to actually do more. If you want to be part of future technology and industry, let me tell you that you are not alone. Well, there are some introductory courses, but no one gives you the solution and confidence to start designing your own project and research. You may want to intake official syllabuses or programs, then you have to deal with crazy theories and thousands of sophisticated formulas for years and yet have no clue how to design a system. No one likes it, I know….\nThis course is different. In “Right Vision Academy”, we have designed simple and easy-to-follow procedure to show you how you can use NEGF method to model nanostructures such as Carbon Nnotubes or Graphene Nanoribbons. We suppose you have no prior knowledge about nano-science and we don’t get stuck with quantum theories and formulas. Instead, I’ll show you the steps on how to make your first nanodevice, an AGNR RTD device. We start right away coding with the Matlab, and I’ll teach you the steps you need to build your simulator platform. Together, we’ll develop systematic simulators that allow us to calculate transport properties and current-voltage of GNRs and CNTs with any dimension. Learning by coding is fun, engaging and much more intuitive.\nBy the end of this course, you will have enough confidence and knowledge to start your own project and research. You will be able to develop and adopt NEGF model to nanostructures and design atomic-scale devices and sensors. Devices like ultra-fast diodes like these structure that I designed and published results of my research in credible journals. Or you may want to make ultra-sensitive atomic gas sensors that overcome every typical sensor. The possibilities are endless, but what matters is where and how to start. By taking this course, I promise that your first step in realm of nanotechnology is a success.

Don't miss this opportunity to unlock the full potential of ROS2 and take your robotics career to the next level. Join us today!\nAre you in the right place?\nYou are a ROS user, and you have heard about ROS2 as being the next generation ROS, but,\nare you still unsure what ROS2 is?\nHow does it improve on and differ from ROS1?\nIs it time to migrate to ROS2?\nIs it easy to install ROS2 and get it up and running?\nHow to create a workspace, a package, and write programs with ROS?\nHow to make a robot move in space and control its distance?\nThis course is the right place to address all the questions about ROS2.\nROS2 is the next generation of Robot Operating System (ROS), and the community is migrating to this new framework.\nWhy do you need to take a ROS2 course now?\nROS1 has emerged since 2009 and has been evolving as the de facto standard Ecosystem for developing all kinds of robotics applications, including mobile robots, robotics arms, unmanned aerial systems and drones, self-driving cars, and much more. At ROSCon 2014 conference, the Open Source Robotics Foundations (OSRF) and the ROS community started to discuss and identify some gaps in ROS1, including (1) a single point of failure with the ROS Master Node, (2) nonsupport of multi-robots systems as ROS1 was designed for a single robot usage, (3) and no support of real-time guarantee or quality of service profiles, and thus its reliability was questionable.\nThe ROS community has formed several working groups to design and develop the next-generation version of ROS1, which is currently ROS2. Alpha and Beta versions started to show up from August 2015 until September 2017, and the first official ROS2 release, known as Ardent Apalone, was launched. On December 8th, 2017. Despite the release of ROS2, ROS1 was still being used more actively than ROS2 until 2022, and the main reason is that ROS2 has been under continuous development and did not reach the same level of maturity as ROS1. In fact, the ROS2 developers created the ROS1 Bridge package to be able to communicate between ROS1 and ROS2 when ROS1 is needed from missing functionalities in ROS2.\nHowever, things have changed since 2021, when ROS2 has accomplished most of the missing functionalities, including navigation, transformations, and others. It is expected that ROS2 will completely dominate or at least start to dominate ROS1 in 2023. For this reason, learning about ROS2, even if you are an experienced ROS1 developer, is becoming more and more in need to cope with the future changes and transition from ROS1 and ROS2. As a matter of fact, the latest ROS1 version, ROS Noetic, released in May 2020, has an end of life in May 2025, while ROS2 will continue developing.\nI provide this course to all ROS users with prior knowledge on ROS1 or even those entirely new to the ROS ecosystem to present the features of ROS2 and how it differs and compares with ROS1.\n\n\nCourse Objectives:\nThe objectives of this course are as follows:\nUnveil the secrets of ROS2\nExplain the concepts of ROS2 using a hands-on approach\nClarify the differences between ROS1 and ROS2\nProvide comprehensive coverage of the ROS2 ecosystem\nDemonstrate how to create a ROS2 workspace and packages using C++ and Python\nDiscuss in detail the implementation aspects of ROS2 topics, services, messages, and actions\n\n\nCourse Learning Outcomes\nAt the end of the course, you will be able to:\nInstall ROS2 on Ubuntu\nRecognize the concepts of ROS2 and its ecosystem\nUnderstand the difference between ROS1 and ROS2\nRecognize the features of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) used in ROS2\nCreate ROS2 workspaces and packages\nDevelop programs with ROS2 (C++ and Python)\nExecute applications using ROS2\nPractice ROS2 Computation Graph Concepts using Hands-on with Turtlesim\n\n\nPre-Requisites\nFamiliarity or ROS1 basic concepts\nKnowledge in C++ and/or Python programming languages\nBasic understanding of Linux Ubuntu Operating System\nEnroll now!\nIf you want to be one of the first ROS users to learn ROS2 and be up to date with the next-generation robot operating system framework, which sooner or later, will be fully replacing ROS2, as the ROS developer community is actively pushing towards ROS2, then, do not let time running out and enroll right away in this course to start your ROS2 experience.",

If you are a Udemy Business user, please check with your employer before downloading software.\nCI+CD Workflows? You will learn it.  AWS Deployment? Included.  Kubernetes in Production? Of course!\nThis is the ultimate course to learn how to deploy any web application you can possibly dream up.  Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps.  Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination.\n\n\nDocker from Scratch!\nIn this course you'll learn Docker from absolute fundamentals, beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as \"What is a container?\" and \"How does a container work?\".  From the very first few lectures, we will do a deep dive on the inner workings of containers, so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented.  Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLI commands.  After that, you'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications.\n\n\nCI + CD Pipelines\nOf course, no course on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns.  You will learn how to implement a full CI + CD workflow using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that automatically deploys your code every time you push your latest changes to Github!\n\n\nMulti-Container Deployments on AWS!\nAfter building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container deployments on Amazon Web Services.  You will construct a multi-container application utilizing Node, React, Redis, and Postgres, and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this course is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS).\n\n\nKubernetes!\nFinally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers.  You will learn the right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster - this course doesn't have any of those annoying \"don't do this in production\" comments!  You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider.  You'll even learn how to set up HTTPS on Kubernetes, which is harder than it sounds!\n\n\nHere's what you'll do:\nLearn Docker from scratch, no previous experience required\nBuild your own custom images tailored to your applications\nMaster the Docker CLI to inspect and debug running containers\nUnderstand how Docker works behind the scenes, and what a container is\nBuild a CI + CD pipeline from scratch with Github, Travis CI, and AWS\nAutomatically deploy your code when it is pushed to Github!\nBuild a complex multi-container application from scratch and deploy it to AWS\nUnderstand the purpose and theory of Kubernetes\nDeploy a production-ready Kubernetes Cluster to Google Cloud",

Then came Docker, and the problem was finally solved. This very interesting platform is fun and easy to learn, and gives an entirely new perspective on the world of programming. Plus, it’s another pretty bow to add to your CV.\nYour Complete Docker Crash Course\nLearn what Docker is and how to use it\nFamiliarise yourself with the Linux operating system\nGet to grips with Docker Hub\nCreate your own Wordpress site with Docker\nNo Linux Experience? No Problem!\nThis course has been designed for anyone who wants to learn Docker regardless of their experience level, but if you’re not familiar with Linux (which Docker uses), never fear; we’ve included an extensive - but not overwhelming - overview.\nYou’ll start by taking a look at Docker’s infrastructure and – you’ll be glad to know – how to install it on OSX and Windows. Once that’s done, you’ll learn everything you need to know images and containers, creating an image and running a web server. Then it’s into the nitty gritty of Docker Hub, tag, push and pull images, customising an image, and Docker Commands. You’ll finish off by creating  a fully functional Wordpress website and running it, using Docker as the catalyst to make it happen.\nWith over 25 lectures and 2 hours of content, by the end of this course you’ll know exactly what Docker can do and how do it. Plus, you’ll be posed to use it in scenarios where it will most likely save you plenty of work. Not bad!\nAbout Docker\nBasically, Docker allows you to ‘build, ship and run any app, anywhere’. It automates the deployment of apps inside software containers using various features of the Linux operating system (although it can be used on Mac and Windows). Think of it like a shipyard with a big cargo ship – it packages the various pieces of cargo needed for delivery (i.e software), then gets it onto the ship and off to its destination efficiently, safely and in one neat package.",

You typically use a technology like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to automate software provisioning. Terraform starts from the same principle, infrastructure as code, but focuses on the automation of the infrastructure itself. Your Cloud infrastructure (instances, volumes, networking, IPs) can be described in terraform.\n\nIn this course, you'll learn how to use Terraform to automate your infrastructure. I will first show you the basics of Terraform and then explain how to automate infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. You can open an AWS account for free to do the labs. I also provide many code examples that you can immediately use to automate your own infrastructure.\n\nLast Updates, November 2024:\nComplete revision of Section 3: terraform basics\nUpdated lessons where terraform, or the AWS provider has made changes\nThe course gets regular updates when the AWS provider or terraform makes changes. Some lessons and demos are very old, but if there's no changes to be made, I keep the old recording. Reach out to me if there is a demo that doesn't work: every demo should be working using the demo code on my GitHub repository.\nThis course includes english captions.",

Most developers today will know the object oriented paradigm used in mainstream languages such as Python, Java and C++. This presents a challenge switching to Julia which is more functionally oriented.

      "description": "Welcome to the Salesforce Development With AI course, where we will learn how to be a 10X Salesforce Developer in today's Gen AI Era. We will learn how to use modern tools such as Cursor IDE, which is the first AI Code Editor. We will learn how to make VS Code a much more powerful Code Editor by installing GitHub Copilot, and also we will leverage Agentforce for Developer, which is Salesforce's in-house AI Assistant. we will also work with Salesforce CLI to complete task which generally takes more time.\n\n\nThis course is designed to teach how to be more productive as a Salesforce Developer by utilizing the Salesforce CLI, which helps us work directly with the Salesforce metadata, making changes to the org components really fast compared to making changes from the Salesforce UI. Also, we will learn how to combine the Salesforce CLI with AI capabilities such as Cursor's Composer feature or GitHub Copilot's Edit with Copilot feature to solve a requirement much faster.\n\n\nCursor IDE is the first AI Code Editor, which allows developers to leverage multi-model LLM capabilities to use AI while writing code. Its Composer feature can create new components from scratch and can edit multiple files located in different folders. It can build a new LWC component just by referring to the image file uploaded. Its AI Chat tab allows developers to quickly generate code snippets, help in understanding the existing code in the codebase, and explain new topics right from the IDE. Cursor's Auto-complete feature helps developers while writing code by suggesting the next line of code and code blocks. In this section, we will learn how to convert this generic AI developer to be a Salesforce Developer and, more importantly, to generate code that follows the standards set by your company or you, like following the naming convention while creating new Apex classes and LWCs.\n\n\nJust like Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot is another powerful AI coding assistant that allows developers to leverage multi-model LLM capabilities to use AI while writing code. Its Edit with Copilot feature can create new components from scratch and can edit multiple files located in different folders. Its Copilot Chat tab allows developers to quickly generate code snippets, help in understanding the existing code in the codebase, and explain new topics right from the IDE. Just like Cursor, GitHub Copilot's Auto-complete feature helps developers while writing code by suggesting the next line of code and code blocks. Using the copilot-instructions md file, we will learn how to train this AI Assistant to work as a Salesforce Developer and follow the standards set by your company or you, like following the naming convention while creating new Apex classes and LWCs.\n\n\nAgentforce for Developer is Salesforce's in-house AI Assistant and helps in generating code snippets, including Apex and LWC, using the Dev Assistant feature. Similarly, its Auto-complete feature helps developers while writing code by suggesting the next line of code and code blocks. We will learn about Salesforce's internal LLM models Codegen and xGen-Code to see how they work in the backend.\n\n\nNote:\nYou will get the PPT of each lecture.\nCode related to each lecture.\nNew videos will be added in the coming future, covering more aspects of productivity in Salesforce.",

Learn how to use Brackets and see all the functionality in action. Learn about top extensions and addons. Review of best setup techniques.\nLearn how to use Brackets and how you can easily switch to using Brackets as your code editor.\nI've been a web developer since 2000 and have used a number of code editors. I was originally using Dreamweaver in a number of my courses. I found that there were many students who wanted to have the same editor and setup that I have as they follow along with course content. I switched to several open source editors until I found Brackets. I've been using Brackets on a regular basis and found that I don't open Dreamweaver as much anymore. The best part of Brackets its free, so anyone who wants to use the same editor as I do in my courses can do so without barrier.\nI decided to create this course to illustrate how to get brackets, how to set it up and some of the advanced features available in Brackets. In addition I wanted to list out top extensions to really power up your Brackets application.\nI also cover my XAMPP server setup which allows me to use localhost as my webserver. XAMPP is really straight forward on getting going so most of the course is focused on using Brackets.",

You cannot build a successful application, or run a company without having a system that monitors your systems and applications and reports when something goes wrong. You need instrumentation in order to be successful.\nPrometheus is the leading open-source monitoring system that can collect metrics from all your systems, including Linux servers, Windows Servers, Database Servers and any application you have written. It's inspired on Google's Borgmon, which uses time-series data as a datasource, to then send alerts based on this data.\nThis course will show you how to install and configure Prometheus on a Linux server. This course will use a VM on DigitalOcean, but you can install Prometheus on any modern Linux OS. We'll show you how to make visualizations (graphs) using Grafana. When building these graphs, you'll get to know PromQL, the language to query Prometheus and get meaningful data displayed. You'll also learn how to setup alerts to receive notifications when something goes wrong. Lastly, we have a section on use-cases to showcase you some real world examples.\nYou get a $100 DigitalOcean coupon when you enter a valid payment method to be able to install Prometheus on DigitalOcean.\nWe have both worked in the Tech/Finance industry in San Fransisco, New York City and London. We now run a consultancy business where we help our clients implement their Cloud & DevOps strategy. Using our expertise, we can deliver you this great training with real world examples and guide you when you have questions.\nEnroll in this course now and install, configure and use Prometheus.

It covers the most needed basic, intermediate, and advanced Git concepts that form the foundation of this wonderful source control management system (SCM) so that the student can go up and running within a matter of a few hours. However, this is not to say that this Git course covers things in a hurry. On the contrary, all the foundation Git concepts are explained with utmost care so that the student feels (assuming a newbie or starter) comfortable with the concepts that have been laid down with great consideration and due diligence. The sections devoted to GitHub bear the same hallmark of care & clarity that the sections on Git are marked with.\nThe Git & GitHub course is power-packed with intensive hands-on Lab sessions that cover the basic, elemental, and advanced concepts in great detail. The Labs are the highlights of this course which implements all the concepts that are explained thoroughly and exhaustively in the presentations.\n\n\nCourse Layout\nThe section Introduction and Getting Started covers a great overview of Git that will warm up the student before taking on the concepts layered in the subsequent sections. To spice up things, it briefly covers the history of Git. Next, the fundamental principles that govern Git are explained with well-illustrated diagrams so that students don't face difficulty in facing the Labs that implement those concepts and principles. This section also introduces the Instructor and explains how to go through this Git course so that one gets the best out of it.\nThe section Git Setup and Installation demonstrates the installation process of Git on all three prevalent platforms, namely Windows, Linux, and Mac. Each platform is covered nicely with detailed explanations so that students do not face any difficulty in understanding the Git setup process and one can get up and running without a hitch.\nThe section Setting up a Git Repository explains thoroughly the Git configuration process which forms the basic prerequisites before one goes to the next step of creating Git repositories. Once the prerequisites are taken care of, the subsequent lectures carefully craft it way through explaining the step-by-step process of the Git repository creation process. The Git repository creation process comes in three flavors - creating from scratch with nothing on hand, converting an unversioned code base to a Git repository, and Cloning a Git repository that exists on GitHub.\nIn the Shell Commands section of the Git & GitHub course, you'll gain hands-on experience with essential shell commands like pwd, ls, cd, touch, rm, and more. These commands form the backbone of efficient navigation and file management within the terminal, a crucial skill for any developer working with Git. By mastering these commands, you'll not only streamline your workflow but also enhance your ability to automate tasks and interact seamlessly with your Git repositories. This foundational knowledge empowers you to navigate and manage your projects with confidence and precision.\nThe section Enter GitHub explains this massively popular web-based Git repository with utmost care and precision. It explains the hugely popular and effective GitHub \"fork\" and \"clone\" processes. Before that, there are sections that navigate through GitHub in order to make the student familiar with the GitHub website, its user interface, and the general remote repository management process.\nThe section Committing changes in Git is where the action starts approaching the climax. Here the student will work on the Labs in order to understand the few concepts that form the pillars of Git, namely the \"Git states\". One can understand how an artifact (file, directory, etc.) goes through the Git workflow to reach the climactic point wherein the artifacts are safely placed in the Git database.\nThe section Inspecting what's going on in a Git Repository explains how to peek into the internal workings of Git. In short - what's going on behind the scenes? Git status and log checks are covered in great detail wherein students start appreciating the beauty of Git.\nIn the Ignoring FIles in Git section, you'll learn how to use the .gitignore file to exclude specific files and directories from being tracked by Git. This feature is crucial for keeping your repository clean and efficient, preventing unnecessary files like temporary or sensitive data from cluttering your version history. By mastering this, you ensure that your projects remain organized and secure, enhancing collaboration and productivity in any development environment\nThe section Git Branching Basics covers branching basic concepts. Branching is an advanced concept and an attempt has been made not to burden the student with gory details of this advanced concept.\nThe section Undoing changes in a Git repository covers great details on the mechanisms you can use to undo changes in Git repository in case one changes his mind and wants to revert changes or fix any mess up. Techniques such as resetting, reverting, cleaning, and checkout for a Git repository have been treated with great care and detail.\n\nThe section Pushing into GitHub makes things hotter when the students start learning how to extend one's arms beyond their local repository in a local machine to a remote repository on GitHub. The local-remote interaction and play are fascinating as the lectures in this section unravel the usage if Git and GitHub in a step-by-step manner.\nThe section GitHub via SSH is an advanced one and hence has been kept for the last. Here you will learn how to connect with GitHub via SSH protocol. In the learning process, the student will learn the basics of public key cryptography and its implementation w.r.t GitHub. SSH key generation and using them to connect local Git repository and GitHub forms a stimulating walk in the entire learning path.\nThe section Making Git bash friendlier and productive will empower you to have a Git bash prompt that allows customization in terms of its content, color, and functionality. It makes Git commands and their output highly readable and adds more expressiveness and color to all operations in the Git bash terminal.\nThe section Installing and Configuring default text editor for Git demonstrates how to install a graphical text editor (Sublime Text) and configure it as the default text editor for Git.\nThe section Installing and Configuring Diff and Merge tool for Git repository demonstrates how to install and configure \"p4merge\" as a Git diff and merge tool.\nThe section Git Comparison with Git Diff Tool (p4merge) demonstrates how to perform Git comparisons between various sections of a Git repository using p4merge\n\nThe section Git Branching and Merging Techniques demonstrates advanced techniques for Git Branching and Merging that include - fast-forward merge, no-fast-forward merge, 3-way merge along merge conflict resolution process.\n\nThe section Commit History rewriting in Git demonstrates various techniques for modifying commit history to suit your project needs. You can amend your commits, do a rebase, and so on.\nThe section Git Tagging demonstrates how to use tags to mark production releases with tags and how to manipulate tags for the best outcome\n\nThe section Git Toolset demonstrates the Git tool \"stash\" which is an extremely convenient tool for saving off unfinished work.\n\n\nThe GitHub Features section of the Git & GitHub course delves into powerful tools that enhance your GitHub experience, including GitHub Flavored Markdown, GitHub Wiki, GitHub Gists, GitHub Issues, and GitHub Projects. You'll learn how to leverage Markdown for rich documentation, create and manage wikis for collaborative knowledge sharing, and use Gists for sharing snippets of code. Additionally, this section covers GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and tasks, and GitHub Projects for organizing work and streamlining project management. Mastering these features will significantly boost your productivity and collaboration within GitHub, making you a more efficient and effective developer.\n\n\nIn the GitHub Templates section of the course, you'll learn how to streamline and standardize your workflows by creating repositories from template repositories, setting up issue templates, and designing pull request templates. These features help teams save time, ensure consistency, and improve collaboration by providing predefined structures for common tasks.\n\n\nThe GitHub Pages section of the Git & GitHub course is designed to guide you through the process of creating and deploying a website directly from your GitHub repository. You'll learn how to set up and configure GitHub Pages, customize your site using Jekyll, and publish your content seamlessly. This section empowers you to showcase your projects, portfolios, or documentation online, giving you a powerful tool to enhance your online presence and share your work with the world effortlessly.\nThe \"GitHub Actions\" section of this course introduces the basics of automating workflows in your GitHub repositories.

Do you want to build interactive dashboards, run Spark jobs, and connect with multiple big data sources — all within a single notebook environment? If yes, then this course is designed for you.\n\n\nApache Zeppelin is a modern, web-based notebook that brings data exploration, visualization, analytics, and collaboration together. Unlike traditional notebooks, Zeppelin is built for Big Data. It allows you to seamlessly integrate with Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, MySQL, HDFS, S3, and more, while also supporting multiple interpreters like Scala, Python, SQL, and Shell.\n\n\nIn this hands-on, project-driven course, you will not only master Zeppelin’s core features but also learn how to integrate it into real-world Big Data workflows. Starting with installation and setup (on both Ubuntu and Windows using Docker), you will move step by step into mastering notebooks, interpreters, dynamic visualizations, and Spark integration.\n\n\nYou will then progress to working with external data sources, building ETL pipelines, and connecting Zeppelin with tools like Kafka and Hive. By the end, you’ll put your skills into action with Capstone Projects, including Telecom Customer Churn Prediction and a Real-Time Log Analytics Dashboard powered by Kafka, Spark, MySQL, and Zeppelin visualizations.\n\n\nThis course ensures that you go beyond theory — you will be working with real datasets, writing real code, and building real-world data engineering and analytics solutions.\n\n\nWhat makes this course different?\n\n\nEntirely hands-on with practical examples at every step\nFocused on Big Data integration and real-world use cases\nIncludes multiple capstone projects to give you job-ready skills\nCovers both beginners and intermediate data engineers with progressive learning\nBy the end of this course, you will have mastered how to:\n\n\nInstall and configure Apache Zeppelin on Ubuntu and Windows (via Docker)\nUnderstand Zeppelin’s architecture, features, and benefits\nWork with Notebooks, Paragraphs, Markdown, and Dynamic Forms\nBuild rich data visualizations (tables, bar, pie, line charts, etc.)\nConfigure and connect Zeppelin interpreters (Spark, Python, JDBC, Hive, Shell)\nRun and visualize Apache Spark jobs using Zeppelin (RDDs, DataFrames, SQL)\nConnect to external data sources: HDFS, S3, JDBC, MySQL, Hive\nPerform data cleaning, transformation, and exploration in Spark Scala\nCreate modular ETL pipelines with parameterization and documentation\nIntegrate Zeppelin with Kafka, Hadoop, and MLlib for advanced analytics\nWork on Capstone Projects:\nTelecom Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning in Spark\nReal-Time Log Analytics Dashboard with Kafka, Spark, MySQL, and Zeppelin\nThis course is your complete end-to-end guide to mastering Apache Zeppelin for Big Data visualization, analytics, and real-world data engineering projects.

So, instead of wasting hours going through each line of code to check for bugs, or running a number of different tools to test which code doesn’t work, Jenkins can help you as you write your code.\nContinuous Integration tests every time your code is changed, which means that each line of code you add is automatically tested, the results of which will let you know if the code works or breaks. This is why it is currently extremely popular with developers and programmers, because it saves them a good chunk of their time.\nIf you want to master Continuous Integration but have zero knowledge of what it is, then this course is perfect for you!\nThis course has been designed and built by experts who will help break down Continuous Integration into small and easy to understand segments. We have created this tutorial as a guide to help newbies not only learn what is CI, but also actually understand how to integrate CI in their codes. We assume that you have no prior knowledge of Jenkins and Continuous Integration, but we do assume that you have an idea of how Ubuntu works, as well as basic virtualization concepts.\nThis course uses a hands-on approach and is loaded with examples at every stage to help students actually understand and learn what is going on, rather than simply follow through with the videos and end up lost and confused later on. We also use an example project that the student will build along with the instructor.\nThe course will cover important topics regarding CI and Jenkins such as what is Jenkins and continuous integration, a brief introduction to the Jenkins system, how to install Jenkins and integrate the CI, basic configuration of your Jenkins, and will also build a real-world example by creating and testing a Java application using Maven through Jenkins.\nAt the end of this course, you will have learned exactly what is CI, how it can help you and also how you can save yourself from hours of miserable code checking and debugging.\nSo, what are you waiting for?

Well, look no further.\nEmbark on a journey like never before with Packt’s latest offering, Go: Building Cloud Native Go Applications\n“Cloud native” has been the term du jour for quite some time now. As the world slowly moves towards the cloud, which promises lesser downtime, and more speed and efficiency, websites and applications that take full advantage of the capabilities of the cloud are dominating the world like never before, fast replacing monolithic web applications.\nThis Learning Path takes you on a journey to building fast, scalable cloud-based applications using Go, specifically,  microservices in Go. We begin with learning about the basics of cloud-native applications. Then, we start learning about microservices, which form an integral part of applications that run on the cloud. We learn how to create simple microservices using the Go programming language. We then deploy our first application in the cloud using Kubernetes and Docker.  Later, we cover topics such as service discovery and microservice communication in detail. Along the way, we will also be working with and learning to use a plethora of useful tools such as Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and Consul.\nBy the end of this Learning Path, you would have become skilled in creating seamless cloud-first applications and services using Go.\nAbout The Author\nMario-Leander Reimer has been a chief technician at QAware since the beginning of 2014. He is responsible for the technical success of projects in the field of after sales for their customer BMW. He is a specialist in the design and implementation of complex system and software architectures based on open source technologies.

We start off by signing up for GitHub, creating a repository there, the makiing a local copy (clone), local changes (add/commit) and then update GitHub with our changes (push).\nIn Basic Commands, we walk through all the foundational commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable Git for an existing project) all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files. We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally being committed and how to review your repository's history.\nWith a strong foundation in place, we explore ways to make Comparisons in Git, including all the different local states, between commits, and between local and remote repositories.\nWe give great attending to Branching and Merging in Git. We start off with the simple \"happy path\" and learn about \"Fast-Forward\" merges and how to control them. The we walk through common \"automatic\" merges. Finally, we cause trouble on purpose so we can step through resolving conflicting merges with our visual merge tool.\nWith a strong foundation in branching and merging, we will then cover a more complex topic, Rebasing. In that section, we cover several rebasing examples, including how to resolve a rebase conflict.\nIn the Stashing section, we save our work-in-progress while we attend to more pressing issues, then pick up where we left off after that.\nNEW: In the Tagging section, we mark important milestones or releases within our project. We also use those tags later for comparing differences between important milestones. We also look at how to use tags within GitHub.\nAll tools have installation and configuration sections to ensure no one is left behind.\nCourse Features\n\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.\nScreencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There is nearly 4 hours of screencast based video training in order to step through each command or action in sufficient detail.\nSeveral attachments and document lectures throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.\nMoving Forward\nThis course will expand periodically to include more topics, supporting materials and bonus content! Some content may be in direct response to student feedback or discussions -- so get engaged with the course discussions feature!",

We’ll then see the role of Terraform in today’s IT Infrastructure. We’ll then learn how to install Terraform. This is followed by the basics of Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL). Next, we have our first lab, where you’ll get your hands dirty with HCL syntax. We will then learn the basics of Terraform, such as Providers, Input and Output variables, Resource Attributes, and Dependencies.\nWhat Is Terraform?\nAfter this, we take a look at the state in Terraform – what it is, why it is used, and considerations to follow when working with the state. We then dig deeper into the fundamentals– starting with the different commands provided by Terraform. This is followed by a lecture where we understand the difference between Mutable and Immutable infrastructure. This is followed by lifecycle rules in Terraform where we will learn how to manage the ways in which resources are created. This is followed by other basic topics such as data sources, meta arguments such as count and for each, and finally understanding of the version constraints in Terraform.\nTerraform and AWS\nAfter this, we have a dedicated section on AWS. This section begins with optional lectures and demos where we learn the basics of AWS. – such as setting up an AWS Account and learning about some of the basic AWS services such as IAM, S3, and DynamoDB. We will then see how to provision and manage these services using Terraform. Each of these topics, including the ones for AWS, is followed by hands-on labs where we get to practice the concepts on real infrastructure.\nSteps In Learning Terraform\nWe will then learn Terraform concepts such as remote state and state locking with Terraform and then see how to store state in a remote s3 backend.\nNext, we will see how to use terraform state commands to manipulate the state file. We then have a few lectures and demos where we get introduced to EC2 service and learn how to provision it using terraform.\nFinally, we will learn about provisioners in terraform – what they are, the different types, behaviors, and considerations to follow when working with provisioners.\nWe then look at resource taints, learn how to enable debugging, and then import other resources in the management of Terraform, Terraform modules – what they are, how to create them, and also how to make use of modules available in the public Terraform registry.\nWe will then learn about functions and continual expressions in Terraform and how to test them using the Terraform console.\nNext, we will then learn about workspaces in terraform – what they are, how to create them and when to use them.\nWe will wrap up the course with an introduction and high-level overview of the features offered by Terraform Cloud.",

      "description": "From this course, you can learn Git from basics to advanced concepts.\nThis course was created for software engineers who want to learn how to track changes with the help of Git. No matter what programming language you use - the git is equal for everyone :)\nThere are a lot of other courses on this topic. So, why would you choose exactly this course?  Here are just a few reasons:\n\n- Real-life cases & demo during the video lesson\nThere are a lot of other courses that taught you Git. But there are only PowerPoint presentations and nice diagrams. You may learn hundreds of git commands but you won't be able to apply them in real life after that courses.\n\nIn this course, we will imitate teamwork and work on one project from scratch. We will review different life scenarios online, on the video, I will show you the best way to approach various cases.\n\nYou are going to learn enough theory to understand practical examples and exercises. No watter :) Only Git!\n\n- Practical orientation of the course\nThis is what makes this course so unique. During the course, we are not talking about super abstract things and inventing our own Git. Your focus is put on the questions that you will face on daily basis during the software development. That's why this course is called 'Practical Guide for Developers'.\n\n- Q&A support\nThe significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer.\nIn this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue.\nSo with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh? :) ), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course.\n\n- Relevant knowledge\nAfter our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!\nThe instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha.\nWith this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT consultants in the world.\n\n- High concentration of useful material in each lesson\nSometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson.\nThis is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes 10 times as much (sometimes even 20) as the final lesson duration after video editing.\nAlso, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered.\nGo and try it yourself! We will appreciate your feedback.\n\n\nSo don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts!\nBuy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE!\nFor those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup? In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation!\nHope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better! Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever!\nSee you at the lessons! :)",

      "description": "Are you wondering if NiFi can replace your existing ETL Tool?\nThis course will help you to evaluate NiFi in a short period of time.\n\n\nThis is a Beginners Guide which helps you to understand the core functionality of Apache NiFi.\n\nNiFi enables the collection, curation, analysis, and action on any data anywhere (edge, cloud, data centre) with built-in end-to-end security and provenance.  These unique set of features makes NiFi the best choice for implementing new data-centric use cases that require geographically distributed architectures and high levels of SLA (availability, security, and performance).\n\n\nCongratulations! You've found the most popular, most complete, and most up-to-date resource online for learning Apache NiFi.\n\n\nWhat is Apache NiFI?\nApache NiFi is a robust Data Ingestion, Distribution framework & ETL Option. Apache NiFi is the core of the Hortonworks Data Platform. It can propagate any data content from any source to any destination.\n\n\nNiFi enables the collection, curation, analysis, and action on any data anywhere (edge, cloud, data centre) with built-in end-to-end security and provenance.  These unique set of features makes NiFi the best choice for implementing new data-centric use cases that require geographically distributed architectures and high levels of SLA (availability, security, and performance).\n\n\nNiFi is based on a different programming paradigm called Flow-Based Programming (FBP).\n\n\nIt is one of the fastest-growing Apache Projects and expected to grow exponentially in the coming few years.\n=============================\nRight Time For You To Start Your Big Data Journey\nThe Big Data job market is still hot. Big Data positions are tough to fill, demand for experienced Big Data engineers is intense, knowledge premiums are high, and more and more people are picking up Big Data skills in hopes of making more money.\n\n\nThe field of big data is quite vast, and it can be a very daunting task for anyone who starts learning big data & its related technologies. The big data technologies are numerous, and it can be overwhelming to decide where to begin. There is a lot of scope for big data and its related technologies like Hadoop, HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Spark, Flink, Kafka, Elastic Search, etc.\n\n\nSo, start your BigData journey today by learning about Apache NiFi which can integrate well with almost all the popular big data technologies like Hadoop, HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Spark, Flink, Kafka, Elastic Search, etc.\n=============================\nWhat this Course Delivers, and Who is it for?\nApache NiFi - A Complete Guide | Cloudera DataFlow | HDF/CDF\nI have created this course for all skill levels. You may be entirely new for Data Flow or Data Pipeline world. You may be already using any other Commercial ETL Tool and want to move to an Open Source solution.\n\n\nI have kept the course with the right balance between theory and hand-on, which makes it the Ultimate Guide for Beginners. I also kept the course relatively short to kept it interactive and delivered the required skills you need to start working with Apache NiFi.\n\n\n\"In this course, we will focus only on Apache NiFi and the various features of NiFi. We will not focus on any other specific big data technology integration with NiFi. But by the end of this course, you will have all the required skill sets to work on your Big Data Pipeline / ETL requirements using NiFi\".\n\n\nLearn how to apply and understand Apache NiFi is the best to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data.\n\n\n\"What are you waiting for?

I'm passionate about programming since I was 14, and I'm always willing to learn new things and continue to seek to improve myself.\n\n\nI have decided to teach what I have learned and started to train in Udemy & YouTube.\n\n\n\"My main objective is to provide high-quality course content to all my students in an easy and understanding way.\"\n=============================\nWhat do my Students think about this Course?\nSteve says, \"I purchased a couple of classes on this topic, including the one at the time that had more ratings, all high enough to put it above this class. I recommend this class be the first one -- especially if you only purchase one -- you purchase. There is quite a lot of detail, and yet the instructor moves the topics along without wasting time. Much appreciated, that.\" (Rated with ✨✨✨✨✨)\nNick says, \"Previous to this course I had a walkthrough of NiFi by a colleague and took another 2 hr introduction course, and did some playing around by myself. Even though this course is 3 hrs long, it covers many topics without wasting time, and so I felt that despite my previous exposure to courses and hands-on, that I probably benefited from more than half of this course with new and useful material, maybe even 2/3 of it. I'm very happy to see treatment being given to NiFi Registry plus Git integration. I never knew the purpose of the Funnel before, let alone things like clustering with ZooKeeper, making use of the Variable Registry and/or property files, and a working example of building your own custom data processor. Each of these things may have only been touched on somewhat briefly - enough to clear the fog on a topic so you know where to start and what to use it for so that you can then dig into it further yourself if need be. Really good job in concisely getting this quantity of material across in a relatively short time frame, and I feel a lot more empowered to use my new NiFi skills as a result.\" (Rated with ✨✨✨✨✨)\nTruman says, \"The instructor did a great job of taking me from beginner Nifi to clustering Nifi, to understanding how to build custom processors. I would recommend this course if you are interested in NiFi.\" (Rated with ✨✨✨✨✨)\nAkash says, \"The way this course was, I completed in a single day. I was new to this tool and since one interview was lined up and I had clearly no clue what is Apache Nifi. This is seriously the most comprehensive and lucid course that I have ever gone through.\" (Rated with ✨✨✨✨✨)\nPriya says, \"The course is easy to understand and covers all the basics of NiFi. The theory is explained with hands-on videos by the instructor. One needs to practice with all that has been covered in the course and will be good to go! Great instructor!\" (Rated with ✨✨✨✨✨)\nVenkatesh says, “Best NIFI Course on Udemy. I have started with no idea about NIFI, but now I learned a lot. The instructor is Knowledgeable and explained in simple and easy terms. Highly recommended for NIFI beginners.” (Rated with ✨✨✨✨✨)\nVivek says, “If you are new to Apache Nifi, then this course is best for you. This course is incredibly detailed, beautifully made, and amazing for the beginner like me. The instructor is knowledgable and was able to explain everything very clearly.” (Rated with ✨✨✨✨✨)\n=============================\nImportant Information\nAs if this course wasn’t complete enough, I offer full support, answering any questions you have 7 days a week.\n\n\nYou also have lifetime access to the course and 30 days’ money-back guarantee, so click on the “Enroll Now” button now and see you inside the course!",

      "description": "Today the technology sector is experiencing a boom throughout the world. There are hundreds of startups launching every day.  In order to move fast - these startups need people who are skilled at automating as much as possible. Mostly progressive startups - favor implementing completely automated DevOps pipelines from the get go.  They realize that these practices of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) will yield tremendous benefits regarding speed and agility. The demand for these skills has been steadily rising over the last few years.\nAWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy is a highly scalable and configurable toolset from Amazon AWS which enables us to build very sophisticated automated build and deployment pipelines.\nJenkins is an award-winning open source toolset which enables us to build very sophisticated automated build pipelines very quickly. It has extensive community support which has augmented the core functionality of Jenkins by building and sharing hundreds of very useful plugins.\nImplementing continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment with these tools and frameworks can help us immensely in reducing the risk within our software development lifecycle. It catches us bugs early and increases the quality of our software products. This, in turn, reduces the overall cost to develop innovative software in any environment - startups and enterprise alike.\nThe demand for professionals who have experience with these tools has been growing steadily over the last few years. The salaries and consulting rates for these skills have also been rising and are only bound to go up as the demand for these skills remains steady or increases. Professionals with AWS and Jenkins experience can demand as much as $130K as their yearly compensation and these jobs pay more than majority of the jobs posted on US job boards.\nIn this course we will:\nLearn about CI & CD and why it is important\nLearn about installing and configuring Amazon AWS EC2 machines\nLearn about installing and configuring PostgresSQL database in Amazon RDS\nLearn about AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins and AWS CodeDeploy\nBuild an automated CI and CD pipeline\nLearn how to version control and manage relational database schema\nRun the CI pipeline to maintain build artifacts\nLearn how to configure automated build notifications",

      "description": "Argo Workflows is a container native workflow engine for orchestrating jobs in Kubernetes. This means that complex workflows can be created and executed completely in a Kubernetes cluster.\nIt provides a mature user interface, which makes operation and monitoring very easy and clear. There is native artifact support, whereby it is possible to use completely different artifact repositories (Minio, AWS S3, Artifactory, HDFS, OSS, HTTP, Git, Google Cloud Service, raw).\nTemplates and cron workflows can be created, with which individual components can be created and combined into complex workflows. This means that composability is given. Furthermore, workflows can be archived and Argo provides a REST API and an Argo CLI tool, which makes communication with the Argo server easy.\nIt is also worth mentioning that Argo Workflows can be used to manage thousands of parallel pods and workflows within a Kubernetes cluster. And robust repetition mechanisms ensure a high level of reliability.\nThere is already a large, global community that is growing steadily. Just to name IBM, SAP and NVIDIA. It is mainly used for machine learning, ETL, Batch - and data processing and for CI / CD. And what is also very important - it is open source and a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.\n\n\nUpon successful completion of the course, you will be able to create complex workflows with and without cron triggers using the different concepts and workflow functionalities. You will be able to create workflow templates and use them as reusable building blocks for complex workflows. And you get to know and apply the Argo features.\n\n\nWhat can you expect in the course?\nYou will receive more than 50 primarily practical lessons, which include more than 6 hours of video material. You can download the associated workflow definitions as .yaml and the instructions as well as the Powerpoint slides as .pdf from the course materials.\nEach chapter ends with an exercise that you have to solve yourself. Of course, the solutions are also made available to you here as a video and the .yamls.\nYou will get access to the online Q&A forum, where either other course participants or I will answer your questions.\nAnd finally, if you successfully complete the course, you will also receive a certificate that will look good on your CV.\n\n30 days money back guarentee\nIf you are not satisfied with the course, you are welcome to return it without any problems within 30 days and you will get your money back.",

It is easy to have a fundamental knowledge of VMware Horizon 7 but it is way more challenging and difficult to implement and fine-tune it according to your business needs. This learning path overcomes this challenge and ensures you gain the basic to advanced practical knowledge required to manage and implement Horizon 7 efficiently in your organization.\nThis comprehensive 3-in-1 course aims at providing you the best possible way to learn how to design, architect, implement, and deploy your virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) with VMware Horizon 7. It provides in-depth content balanced with tutorials that put theory into practice. The focus is on giving you both the understanding and practical examples that will allow you to master the art of creating desktop resources using VMware Horizon 7.\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Learning VMware Horizon 7, starts with an overview of the architecture and latest features of VMware Horizon 7. You will then learn how to design and deploy your Horizon 7 environment. Next, you will learn how to build two operating systems and optimize them for your VDI. Finally, you will walk through the different methods of delivery for the instant clone, linked clone, and full clone options.\nThe second course, Advanced VDI with VMware Horizon 7, starts by demonstrating advanced installation and configuration, which will help you to customize Horizon 7 according to your business requirements. You will then delve into the features of Horizon 7 such as just-in-time delivery with instant clone; modernized life cycle management, which ensures faster application delivery; better user experience; smart policies, in order to improve security; and many more. This advanced-level course will teach you how to deliver virtual desktops and applications through a single platform, multiple deployment scenarios, Horizon client and agent security, integration with third-party software, best practices, and troubleshooting techniques.\nThe third course, Designing and Deploying VMware Horizon View 7, introduces you to the security aspects of Horizon View with SSL certificates and True SSO and shows you how these solutions can be implemented. You will then build a virtual desktop OS and several different desktops, ready for delivery to end users. You will also utilize the advantages afforded by the modern desktop and application delivery architecture of Horizon View and deliver only applications by publishing these to end users and delivering desktop sessions, rather than full desktops. With the help of these features, you will reduce the storage space required, and cut down on operational costs, by deploying truly stateless desktops. Towards the end of this course, you will investigate these features and configure Horizon View to deliver applications and desktop sessions to end users, thus ensuring painless application packaging and installation.\nBy the end of this Learning Path, you will be well-equipped to create desktop resources by using Horizon desktop pools and fine-tune the end user experience to ensure the best optimization from your virtual desktops.\nMeet Your Expert(s):\nWe have the best work of the following esteemed author(s) to ensure that your learning journey is smooth:\nPeter von Oven is an experienced technical consultant and has spent the past 20 years of his IT career working with customers and partners in designing technology solutions aimed at delivering true business value. During his career, Peter has been involved in numerous large-scale enterprise projects and deployments and has presented at key IT events such as VMworld, IP EXPO, and various VMUGs across the UK.

      "description": "Imagine yourself being prepared to launch a personal software project of your own making. You need a smart way to keep your development process secure, avoiding rework and making it easy to make changes to your code. More than that, you want to share your work with the world.\n\n\nCan you imagine?\n\n\n\"Where the world builds software\"\n\n\nMillions of developers and companies create, ship, and maintain their software on GitHub, the world's largest and most advanced collaborative software.\n- GitHub 2021\n\n\nDo you know Google? Amazon? Netflix?\n\n\nAll these companies above use Git and GitHub in their software projects!\n\n\nMost likely, there are companies that develop software in your neighborhood that also use Git and GitHub in their applications!\n\n\nGit is a very powerful tool that cannot be missed when programming and is currently indispensable for many companies, given its flexibility and speed in its process. That would make it a lot easier when managing the various versions of your project, wouldn't it?\n\n\nDid you know that by using version control in your projects, you can maintain multiple versions in your applications that can be web, mobile, or even frontend or applied to the backend?\n\n\nDo you want to understand how to do this?\nWell, you're in the right place!\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn what Git and GitHub are for and how to use them in your personal projects, all in a light, uncomplicated and practical way! You will understand the whys and how these tools allow you to control the versions of your software.\n\n\nIf you don't know anything about Git and want to start from ZERO, or if you already use Git in your projects but want to review the basics of versioning, distributed version control systems, Git, and GitHub, THIS COURSE IS PERFECT FOR YOU!\n\n\nNote that this course does not cover advanced Git concepts that allow you to work in a team with multiple people, such as Branch, Merge, and Rebase concepts, for example.\n\n\nIn other words, if you are an advanced user of Git, this course is not for you!\n\n\nThe focus of this course is REALLY to give you a solid foundation in a lightweight, uncomplicated way on how to use Git to make YOUR project more Git-secure, how to use GitHub to centralize version control of your software, and everything, publicize your work. Oh, and of course, you can also build on top of other projects available on GitHub. That could be a game-changer in your career!\n\n\nThat is, with this course, you will feel comfortable dealing with tasks related to project versioning in your day-to-day, as well as gaining experience in how to use Git in line with GitHub!\n\n\nHave you thought? A tool that makes the version control of your software easy to learn and allows you to work with the most diverse types of applications and files?\n\n\nThat is Git in line with GitHub!\n\n\nSo, are you ready to get your next skill in the coding world?\n\n\nAn intelligent decision is to take this course.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nLet me give you 8 reasons.\n\n\n1) This course is designed to teach you the fundamentals of Git and GitHub that are essential when developing a software project.\n\n\n2) Learn by doing, create repositories, and store and update your projects securely and in just one place on GitHub. Keep your repositories public or private if you prefer.\n\n\n3) Market visibility, reach more people through your projects on GitHub, and keep your projects online so everyone can see your source code.\n\n\n4) Lean. Using Git in your projects, you can reach the world. Instead of doing like other courses out there that push you content without the slightest connection, we did the heavy lifting of selecting the most important content, organizing it, and having it present in a cohesive and super simple way.\n\n\n5) This course is strategically designed to maximize your learning potential using scientifically proven techniques to optimize your brain's ability to build the neural pathways necessary to learn the concepts presented on Git & GitHub.\n\n\n6) The course contains classes that will take your code to another level. Today having an account and projects on Github has become a differential, as it is becoming an extra-curricular tool that makes it easier for clients and companies to get to know their work better on the web.\n\n\n7) This course was designed by Mirko Perkusich, a best-selling Udemy instructor, and Omni Academy, a company with over 250,000 students worldwide.\n\n\n8) This course is FREE. That's right. FREE OF CHARGE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you still have any doubts, check below real testimonials from students that purchased courses from Mirko Perkusich!\n\n\nWhat if you, for whatever reason, want a refund?\n\n\nThis course has a 30-day money-back guarantee policy!\n\n\nNo questions asked!\n\n\nThere is no risk for you!\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\nJoin now and take a step further into mastering Scrum and uplift your career!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nStudents Testimonials (What are students saying about Mirko's courses?):\n\n\n\"Undoubtedly the Best Course! Thanks a MIllion, Mirko!!!\" - Mirza Mehdi, Business Analyst\n\"As my goal is to get in a role of a Scrum Master, learning about Scrum, in general, is a must. This course gives good overall knowledge about the topic, with examples and some good tips. For me, as a beginner, it was a valuable experience.\" - Marko Djordjevic\n\"I like the course content! I will definitely recommend taking the course if you want to gain the full guide on Agile and specifically on Scrum. The Instructor explains each detail very clearly. Before this, I took another good course, but it gave me basic knowledge. This one was the best match for me. It gave me complete and enough knowledge about Scrum.\" - Anna Kirakosyan, Project Coordinator\n\"I never worked with Agile/Scrum, but I heard a lot, mainly negative things, so I started this course from a quite pessimistic and skeptical point of view. Now I can say, it was changed now, however, my opinion is still that some companies try to use the Agile/Scrum method as a golden tool for everything, even when the traditional project management would be better in that case. Anyway, now my opinion was changed and I would be happy to use this new knowledge in my job. During the training I got all help and support from the trainer, even for my extra questions. So finally I am very satisfied and I could offer this training to others without any doubt. Thanks, Mirko! :)\" - Gabor Szentesi, Quality Manager\n\"This course is one of the best I’ve taken in Udemy. I like its progressive style along with helpful quizzes and tips, which has helped me to assimilate and consolidate a solid knowledge about agile management with Scrum. Not to mention the insights that Dr. Mirko brings to the table with a perfect alignment between theory and practice, which also helped me a lot to connect with the concepts covered in the course. Dr. Mirko has great teaching skills. I couldn't recommend it more.\" - João Nunes, Software Engineer\n\"The course brings a lot of valuable information. The way that it's conducted and things are presented makes it easier to stay focused on the lectures. Moreover, the fact that it's not focused on Scrum practices and roles only, and relations with Agile principles are made, makes it even more valuable. I strongly recommend it to anyone. For people who already know Scrum very well, this is a good source of information to recycle from time to time, or even acquire a deeper understanding about it.\" - Arthur Freire, Software Engineering\n\"It's a clear course with pleasant listening. It has a glossary, templates, and tips for learning (I used the concept maps). The course is hands-on with helpful quizzes (You write yourself epics, use backlogs, and more). You will get a good idea of Scrum and insights on project management. It's to-the-point, quite fast-paced (perfect), and fun. I can only recommend this course!\" - Diana van Wijk, Marketing Specialist\n\"The course not only conveys knowledge and skills but also teaches the right approach that significantly increases the efficiency of using this framework. All in an accessible and friendly, but also professional, form.\" - Bagu Bagu\n\"I came in knowing nothing about Scrum and I now I feel that I am prepared to apply it. This course doesn't focus only on certifications, which are nice but don't mean much. It focuses on putting Scrum to practice. So, yes, I recommend it if you really want to know how to apply Scrum, when to use it, and when not to. Great job!\" - José Silva, Undergrad student\n\"Informative, comprehensive, and good consolidated training...absorbed and enjoyed the learning curve. Thanks to Mirko and team!\" - Narayan Ragothma Rao, Executive Director\n\"Dr. Mirko has good didactic and strong skills in both academic and Industry study cases. So, I recommend this course to you get the knowledge, practice and if you so get the Scrum Certification, this course is really complete.\" - Leonardo Melo de Medeiros, College Professor, and Research Scientist\n\"Very good! The approach of not only talking about the practices but focus on the agile mindset and management is what attracted me the most to this course and it has been a great experience. The first section is done and I didn't even notice. Congratulations on such an excellent course.\" - Thiago Xavier, UI and UX Designer\n\"I like how you get straight to the point but also make things very clear to understand!\" - Nina Paleracio\n\"All concepts clearly explained. Great examples and case studies provided to reinforce the theory.\" - Crystal Glassford, General Manager\n\"Very good course. Didactic and objective content.\" - Maria Elaine Silva dos Santos, Undergrad student\n\"This was a great course for a beginner or as a refresher course for those experienced.\" - Patrick Lowen\n\"So far so good. I like the way the content is explained using lots of examples and visuals, helps me understand better and the learning pace is good for me too.\" - Jonathan Nathan, IT Project Manager\n\"He's actually doing a great job of making what I was presuming to be a boring, tired class, into something I want to learn. Not lying about the subject matter is the best start. Promises kept are promises earned.\" - Jeremy D Shorter, Financial Analyst\n\"Mirko has a very good didactic and the course is highly recommended for people who are looking to develop their skills in agile management. There are also good quizzes to help us to keep in mind the presented content\" - Giovani Cavalcante Barbosa, Data Scientist\n\"Very good course. It is clear, direct, instructive, exactly what I need to get started with Scrum. This course indeed exceeded my expectations.\" - Leandro Dias da Silva, College Professor and Research Scientist\n\"I was a little bit tired of too theoretical explanations with no real-world cases. This course is not like that, but it really is a straightforward approach that is helping to adapt and improve the management skills of my project teams. For me, it worths a five-star rating, certainly the 60-lessons worths the price by itself.\" - Fabricio Silva, QA Manager\n\"It's the best online course on agile management. I think it was under-promised and over-delivered. The course organization and resources are amazing. I especially liked that the instructors shared the obstacles and challenges for applying Scrum in practice.\" - Kyller Costa Gorgônio, College Professor and Research Scientist\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

      "description": "This course is intended for R and data science professionals aiming to master R. Intermediate and advanced users, will both find that this course will separate them from the rest of people doing analytics with R. We don't recommend this course on beginners.\n\nWe start by explaining how to work with closures, environments, dates, and more advanced topics. We then move into regex expressions and parsing html data. We explain how to write R packages, and write the proper documentation that the CRAN team expects if you want to upload your code into R's libraries.  After that we introduce the necessary skills for profiling your R code. We then move into C++ and Rcpp, and we show how to write super fast C++ parallel code that uses OpenMP. Understanding and mastering Rcpp will allow you to push your R skills to another dimension. When your colleagues are writing R functions, you will be able to get Rcpp+OpenMP equivalent code running 4-8X times faster. We then move into Python and Java, and show how these can be called from R and vice-versa. This will be really helpful for writing code that leverages the excellent object oriented features from this pair of languages. You will be able to build your own classes in Java or Python that store the data that you get from R. Since the Python community is growing so fast, and producing so wonderful packages, it's great to know that you will be able to call any function from any Python package directly from R. We finally explain how to use sqldf, which is a wonderful package for doing serious, production grade data processing in R. Even though it has its limitations, we will be able to write SQL queries directly in R. We will certainly show how to bypass those limitations, such as its inability to write full joins using specific tricks.\nAll the code (R,JAVA,C++,.csv) used in this course is available for download, and all the lectures can be downloaded as well. Our teaching strategy is to present you with examples carrying the minimal complexity, so we hope you can easily follow each lecture.

Maybe you even hated CMake, like a lot of programmers. This will be taken care of, because this is a structured learning path, and we will cover some of the most frequently used features of CMake.\nNo prior experience with CMake is needed, but basic C++ is needed. Just the basics, nothing fancy.\nI've been a professional software developer for more than 10 years now. I've also been a trainer in one of my jobs. I noticed that it's better to take a hands-on approach and I encourage you to do the same with this course. Play around with the examples. Break them. See what happens.\nWhat you'll get out of this:\nCMake is cross-platform\nIt's in a lot of open-source projects, (maybe even your work projects) which you'll understand better\nSimple, easy to follow examples, some of them inspired by real projects\nWrite your own CMake projects:\nBuild\nExport\nUse 3rd party libraries\nTest\nMostly Linux examples, some Windows ones\nWindows setup in CLion, Visual Studio, the command line + cmake-gui\nHere's a rough outline of the course, but please look at the curriculum on this page:\nCMake basics\nVariables\nControl Flow\nStructuring your projects\nExport\nExternal dependencies\nTesting with CTest",

You'll be able not only to use ready-made Helm Charts to automate day-to-day deployments, but you'll also automate the most complex Kubernetes deployments and contribute them to the community.\nI've designed this course to focus on the important parts of Helm. I did my best not to bother you with boring material that you'd seldom use in your day-to-day life as a Helm and Kubernetes engineer. Instead, I will give you the core stuff of the tool together with some tips and tricks that will let you code Helm charts like a pro in no time!\nTo get the most out of this course, I highly encourage you to open your laptop and do the labs that I explain in the class. There's nothing better than getting your hands dirty learning a new tool or technology. That way, by the end of this course, you'll find yourself already developing, applying, maintaining, and even sharing your very own Helm charts.\nThe best way to learn any tool is by using it! In this course, we'll work together to deploy ready-made Helm charts to Kubernetes using Helm. After mastering that, we'll start analyzing the Helm chart bit by bit. Along the way, you'll learn the following:\nUnderstand why we need a package manager for Kubernetes\nDeploying Helm to minikube (local Kubernetes cluster)\nUnderstanding Helm repositories\nAdding one or more Helm repositories to your system\nSearching the Helm repository for your desired Chart\nUsing Helm to deploy ready-made Charts from popular repositories\nInspecting a Helm Chart deployment\nUpgrading a Helm deployment and viewing its history\nCustomizing the Helm Chart to your own needs by modifying the values file\nHow (and when) to create your own Helm Charts\nUnderstanding Helm Templates\nTesting your Helm templates without applying them using the dry-run flag.\nRevisiting Helm history by upgrading and rolling back package deployments\nUsing Helm functions (include, indent, nindent, toYaml, b64enc, and more)\nDecision making using conditional and logical statements (IF, NOT, AND, OR)\nLoop through simple and complex objects using the \"range\" keyword\nDeep diving into Helm variables\nDebugging your Helm charts\nCreating your own Helm repositories and pushing Charts\nDeploying even more complex Kubernetes environments using Helm Chart dependencies\nLearning about popular community-based Helm projects like Chartmuseum\nExtending Helm by building your own repositories\nExploring different Helm plugins to automate repetitive tasks and store charts in the cloud\nBuild your own Helm plugins and use custom commands and protocols\nConfigure Helm to create your own specific boilerplate charts using Helm starters\nWith a 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked, you have zero risk trying out this course.

This course provides a strong foundation for implementing continuous inspection, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and even continuous deployment at your company or studio. In order to ikeep the course short and to-the-point, several decisions were made in order to provide a complete path from CI to CD.\nThe pipeline created in this course consists of the following:\nJenkins CI server installed and configured on Windows\nGit as the source control system\nJava as the main programming language of build projects\nMaven as the build tool\nFindbugs, PMD, and Checkstyle as the static code analysis tools\nTomcat as the deployment server\nSetup Jenkins in AWS using Lightsail\nUse EC2 Plugin for Auto-scaling\nThis set of tools provides a comprehensive, end-to-end implementation continuous deployment pipeline. Jenkins can be installed on many operating systems and supports a myriad of tools and technologies -- which means, this course provides tremendous value to those comfortable or interested in other operating systems and/or technologies.\nCourse Outline\nIntroduction provides an overview for the course, which leas to the Core Concepts for Jenkins. This provides a foundation for the remainder of the course.\nInstallation provides step-by-step instructions on how to setup Jenkins and all the related tools specifically on Windows. The same principles are applicable to other operating systems as well.\nThe Basics provides a first look at Jenkins at work with a very simple \"freestyle\" project. This allows us to learn the Jenkins interface and the key features it provides.\nAfter that, we dive into Maven Projects specifically -- since Jenkins natively understand Maven and thus provides special features for Maven projects.\nJenkins can do so much more than simply building. In Test & Quality, we hook up a standard set of unit testing and quality analysis tools for Java projects. Then, we use that information to affect the build status based on established standards.\nWe also cover how to use Jenkins as an artifact repository which is used to store the build artifacts, like jars and wars, after successful builds. This is particularly useful when integrating Jenkins with other tools in a more comprehensive software delivery strategy.\nThen, we bring everything together for Deployment to a running Tomcat server. Don't worry, I'll walk you through the complete setup and configuration to work seamlessly with Jenkins!\nFinally, no course would be complete without talking about Security. In this final chapter, we setup Jenkins to allow users to login and only see their projects.\nCourse Features\n\n\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas in each major area or introduction of new concepts.\nScreencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There are several hours of screencat video content -- it makes up the vast majority of the course. Any command line based screencast will include a command listing in the lecture downloads.",

With the Ansible Essentials course, you can start from the basics and go all the way to creating your own playbooks and roles with Ansible.\n\n\nThis is a focused course designed to rapidly get you up to speed on using Ansible automation engine in real life. As an IT professional, you'll develop a solid understanding of Ansible and will be able to apply it to daily automation and configuration management tasks.\n\n\nAnsible Essentials course includes lots of examples and hands-on labs and aims at providing students with first-hand experience with course concepts. You can follow along the course by setting up your own lab environment. A Vagrant environment is used throughout the course, and in the appendix, you'll find detailed lectures showing you how to set up one for yourself.\n\n\nEach lecture introduces a new Ansible concept. Concepts are first explained, and then relevant examples are provided. Some of them are also demoed in the lab environment showing you how they can be applied to playbooks. And finally, we apply the concept to our LAMP Stack playbooks.\n\n\nCourse follows a progressive path that mirrors a real-world approach to automation. It's divided into five sections, starting with the architectural overview and foundational concepts. In section 2, we'll install Ansible automation engine and learn about inventory, which is the first thing we need to get started automating tasks with Ansible. We'll learn ad-hoc commands and also discover some of Ansible's commonly used modules in section 3.\n\n\nThen we'll move on to ansible playbooks. Playbooks let us use fully-fledged configuration management and orchestration capabilities of Ansible. Ansible playbooks are written in YAML, so before diving into the details of playbooks, we'll do a YAML overview. Then, we'll learn about playbook basics, including playbook structure, idempotency, and tasks. We'll learn how to run a playbook, check its syntax, and control its output with verbose.\n\n\nThen we'll start building our 3 tier web application. In each lecture, we'll learn one or more ansible features, and we'll apply them to our project. In this part of the course, you'll learn about handlers, Jinja2 templating, loops, variables, error handling, and much more. At the end of this section, you'll have prepared playbooks that can deploy a fully functional multi-node LAMP stack on your machines.\n\n\nIn section 5, we'll cover how to organize playbooks more effectively where you'll learn about imports, includes, and roles.

      "description": "I used to think that performance of the backend depends on the application logic itself. However, there are many other factors that play a role in overall quality and performance of the application. Networking, connection establishment, security, backend communication, protocol serialization, intermediaries and much more.\n\n\nOften debugging the app if you have the source code allows the developer to zone in to the problem and identify it, However most of the time as an engineer you either don’t have access to the source code or its time consuming to debug a complex app. That is why in this course I present you with some tools I use to analyze the backend application performance and provide a good guess and what might be the problem without stepping in the code. Often known as black box testing.\n\n\nIf your application is a web application that is consumable through a browser, devtools allow us to pretty much inspect all traffic going out from the app and can tell us so much about the app. If the app is not available in the browser we will then demonstrate MITM proxy which is a proxy that intercepts HTTP traffic and log it, this way we can inspect requests and see which of those are the culprit. Finally, if the app uses a protocol that isn’t HTTP intercepting it with a proxy becomes little tricky, so we will use both tcpdump and Wireshark to capture low level packets and see our requests this way.\n\n\nThis course is designed for developers and engineers who have built backend and frontend applications and would like to take their skills further. This course is intermediate to advanced and it is recommended that students have a background in networking and backend fundamentals both of which I have courses for.",

The course covers creating new microservices on Quarkus and deploying them to the Kubernetes environment as docker images or pods.\n\n\nWorking through a combination of theoretical concepts and practical code walkthroughs, a developer should follow along and build as we go through the lectures.\n\n\nWe will start our journey with basic concepts of JVM, why we need native deployable and the use of GraalVM. Then we build our first micro-service on Quarkus runtime, test it using RestAssured and deploy that on Minikube.\nOur microservice will be able to handle all HTTP methods GET, PUT, POST and DELETE and later, we will connect it to an external database.\n\n\nThen for our next section, we build another microservice and make it a dependency for the initial one. We mock this service in our primary service to test the behaviour, deploy both services in Minikube and see them in action.\n\n\nFinally, we add health checks for liveness and readiness for each service and monitor our services' health and performance.\nThe course material will be your guide along the way providing relevant commands, steps of execution and references to learn more about the topic.\n\n\nAnd if you face issues, feel free to reach out - I am here to help!",

      "description": "Important Note for Students\nThis course on Field Oriented Control (FOC) of Induction Motor Drives is designed for learners with a solid foundation in control engineering or electrical drives. It is not intended for complete beginners.\nYou will go through the full derivation of equations for machine modeling and controller design, ensuring a solid theoretical understanding. At the same time, we streamline some repetitive algebra steps so you can focus on practical modeling, design, and implementation in MATLAB/Simulink.\nIf you already have some background in control systems or power electronics, this course will give you the confidence and skills to design, simulate, and eventually deploy advanced motor control systems.\nFrom Theory to Practical Mastery\nThis course goes far beyond surface-level simulations. You will design, simulate, and validate complete FOC systems for induction machines — the same structure used in EV drives, robotics, and industrial automation.\nYou won’t just learn what FOC is. You’ll build it, tune it, and simulate it step by step with real control structures — exactly as professional engineers do.\nWhat You Will Build and Understand\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be able to:\nDesign PI and PID controllers for current, torque, and speed loops.\nImplement PWM and SVPWM strategies, including a 2-level IGBT inverter.\nModel induction machines in both stationary (αβ) and synchronous rotating (dq) frames.\nApply Clarke and Park transformations, plus inverse transformations.\nBuild cascaded control loops for torque, speed, and position control.\nValidate closed-loop performance through guided Simulink mini-projects.\nThis is not a “drag-and-drop” course. It’s a builder’s course — where you connect theory, design, and practical simulation in one workflow.\nWhy Take This Course?\nUnlike many purely theoretical courses, this one is application-focused:\nLearn the real control structures used in industry.\nSimulate, test, and validate your designs in Simulink.\nGain hands-on projects that mirror real-world applications.\nBuild confidence to apply these methods in EVs, robotics, and automation.\nFuture Updates — Beyond Simulation\nThis course is continuously updated to stay at the state of the art. Upcoming additions include:\nDeployment on microcontrollers for real-time execution.\nHardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing workflows.\nReal inverter setup demonstrations with practical hardware.\nWith these updates, you’ll not only master simulations but also bridge the gap to real-time hardware development and implementation.\nConclusion\nThis course is your complete guide to mastering Field Oriented Control of Induction Motor Drives.\n\nYou will walk away with:\nTheoretical foundations (full modeling and control design).\nSimulation skills (MATLAB/Simulink mini-projects).\nPractical workflows for hardware deployment.\n\n\nStart mastering Induction Motor FOC systems today — from modeling and design to real-time implementation.",

      "description": "Did you know that the most productive command line experts exploit the powerful features of the Vim text editor?\nThe problem is that if you want to get really good with Vim it can take you an extremely long time if you're trying to learn it on your own.\nThat's why the Vim Masterclass was created.\nThis course gives you the absolute shortest path to learning the basics. It also provides you the fastest way to learn the most advanced features, too.\nBy the time you finish the Vim Masterclass you'll know how to:\nWork with multiple files, including how to move data back and forth between different files, copying & pasting from one file to another, and quickly jumping to another file.  You'll also learn how to view multiple files at the same time using Vim's windowing system.\nUse the must-know keyboard shortcuts and how to remember them easily.  You'll actually learn how to \"think in Vim\" so you don't even have to memorize each and every command, saving you countless hours of work.\n\nFind and replace entire blocks of information within a file.  That includes how to refactor your code by renaming all variables in a file or set of files, reliably.  Of course, you'll learn simple find and replace techniques to replace a word in an entire file and much more.\nCut, copy and paste.  You'll find out how to make the most of Vim's built-in clipboard system, use Vim's clipboard history, and how to access your system's clipboard from within Vim.\n\nVisually select blocks of text and perform edits on those blocks like moving the block, deleting the block, indenting/shifting the block, and more.  You'll understand Vim's text objects so you can quickly select single or multiple words, lines, paragraphs, HTML/XML tags, code blocks, and more.\n\nHow to make vertical edits and use Vim's Visual Block Mode.  (Some call this column editing mode or rectangle mode…)\nEnable syntax highlighting for source code, configuration files, or any type of file you edit often.  That includes how to customize the color scheme and color code text in Vim.\n\nEmploy simple to advanced navigation techniques so you can go exactly to where you need in a file very fast.\n\nPractical application tips such as how to edit source code, scripts, HTML, and more.  You'll find lots of opportunities for practice in this course.\n\nMake the most of the built-in help system to quickly find what you need, all without leaving Vim.\nUse MacVim and gVim on Linux and Windows.  This includes learning the advantages and disadvantages of both the textual interface and the graphical interfaces to Vim.\n\nCreate, save, and replay macros to normalize data and quickly repeat complicated edits.  You'll learn how to append or prepend text to every line in a text file, how to format one line of text and apply that formatting to a specified area in the file and more.  In short, you'll learn how to automate everything in Vim.\n\nCreate custom shortcuts and personalized key mappings.  If you want to create a shortcut for something you do often, you'll find out how to make your life a whole lot easier.\n\nIndent and shift blocks of text.  You'll also learn how to enable auto indentation so you can quickly clean up and prettify your source code.\n\nAnd more...\nWhen you start the course, you'll be able to use vim almost immediately.  I want to make sure you get up and running as quickly as possible.  That's why at the beginning of the course you'll learn how to start vim, how to make simple edits, and how to save your changes.\nAfter that, we'll build on your knowledge and even get into some really advanced techniques such as editing multiple files at once, creating macros, making global substitutions in many files at the same time, ways to format and normalize data, how to \"think in vim\", and much more.\nHaving taught thousands of students over the years, I know people learn best by doing. That's why I've packed this course with tons of practice exercises.  For each exercise you, get detailed, step-by-step instructions.  I encourage you to try the labs on your own first.  Then I walk through the exercise while you look over my shoulder.\nNot only will you learn the concepts, you'll watch me demonstrate how to put those concepts to good use, and you'll practice those new skills immediately so that you really understand and retain what you're learning.\nThis course is ideal for anyone who works on the command line often.  Whether you're a system administrator, a developer, a database administrator, or anyone else who has to edit files in a command line environment, this course is for you.\nEven though this course does cover the graphical version of vim, it is NOT for people who are looking for \"what you see is what you get\" (WYSIWYG) word processing help.\nNo, this course is for people who want to get really efficient at editing plain text files, such as server configuration files, shell scripts, source code, and any other type of textual data.\nSo, if you're tired of being scared of vim, or just aren't making the progress you'd hope to by just dabbling in vim, it's time to take your vim skills to the next level by enrolling in this course.\nEnroll Now!",

It did become popular from the first day it was launched back in 2018. That success was due to the popularity of Github as a platform to host the source code used by more than 50 million users. It was very natural to use the same platform to build and deploy that code into production.\nThis course will walk you through the creation of CI/CD DevOps pipelines to take your code, build it, scan it, test it then deploy it into Dev, Test and Prod environments whether that is in premise or on the cloud.\nUsing multiple demonstrations, we will show the powerful features of Github Actions.",

      "description": "Take your knowledge in Containers and Linux to the next level. You don't need to be a Containers or Linux pro. We will start from the basics.\nHow does this course differ from other courses on the same topic? It will be a perfect complement to the other courses on this topic. The course will take a bottom-up approach, with a strong focus on the core mechanisms that make containers possible - Namespaces, Overlay Filesystems and Cgroups.\nHave you ever wondered how Containers work?  No, I don't mean just creating a Dockerfile or a Yaml file. Have you ever asked yourself (or others) what are the key mechanisms that enable us to isolate an application or to control how much CPU or Memory it gets?\nHow is it possible for an application to run on the same physical machine as other applications, yet not know about them? How do technologies like Docker make it happen? For many  of us, Containers and Kubernetes Pods are just a black box. But they don't have to be. In this course, you will learn the foundational mechanisms that make Containers possible.  We will take an in-depth look at Namespaces, Cgroups and Overlay FS, and understand how they combine to give us Containers.\nHands-on Course : The concepts will be demonstrated with detailed hands-on examples throughout the course. You will have access to a Ubuntu Virtual Machine that I have used for the demos. The course will include a good mix of theory and demos to illustrate the concepts.\n\n\nHere is what you will learn in this course:\nNamespaces: We will start with how Namespaces enable isolation, the key mechanism in containerization.  We will take a detailed look at different kinds of Namespaces - PID, MNT, IPC, USER and UTS ,  with hands-on examples to demonstrate each of these Namespaces.\nOverlay Filesystems: Next, we will look at what Overlay Filesystems are, and understand the key role they play in the world of containers.  Again, we will see working examples of how to create an Overlay Filesystem and how they enable sharing modules across multiple containers.\nCgroups:  We will also take an in-depth look at what Cgroups are, how they enable us to control the amount of resources available to an application. We will create our own Cgroups for controlling the amount of Memory and CPU available to an example application.\nRelated System Concepts: You will also learn related system concepts such as the Proc filesystem and Mount Points, which will come in handy while understanding the PID and MNT Namespaces.\nFor the demos, we will use very simple, easy-to-understand examples instead of complex applications. The focus will be on driving home the key concepts in this course.\nDocker: Once we have a solid understanding of Namespaces, Overlay Filesystems and Cgroups, we will jump into Docker. We will understand what Docker Images are and how to create one. Then, we will dive deep into how image layering works in Docker, and tie this back to the Overlay Filesystem. There will be detailed working examples to demonstrate how image layering works in Docker and we will peel these images layer-by-layer. Finally, using concrete working examples, we will  demonstrate how Cgroups work behind the scenes when we control the amount of CPU or Memory available to a Docker container.\nKubernetes: We will look at the idea of a Pod, why it exists and also create a Pod by just using Namespaces. Then, we will create Kubernetes Pods, and understand other resources such as Replica Sets and Deployments. We will understand what the key components of a Kubernetes Control Plane are and how they come together in helping us orchestrate Pods. Finally, we will demonstrate how Cgroups are again the key mechanism that enable us to control resources available to a Pod, such as CPU and Memory.\nThis course will keep evolving as I will continue to add more advanced topics and also clarifying videos to existing topics.\n\n\nWhy this Course?\nBecause basics do not change. Once you have a firm grasp of these foundational concepts, you will be well positioned to learn any container technology of choice with ease and a lot more clarity. In addition, these ideas are used in other areas - for example Cgroups are also used in Virtual Machines.  The knowledge you gain from this course will broaden your skill-set. With a solid understanding of how things work under the hood, you will see Containers in new light.\n\n\nWhat you need to bring to the table?\nCuriosity and Patience. Curiosity to understand how containers work under the hood. I intentionally go slow, specifically in the beginning of the course, setting the stage for the problem that Namespaces solve. You must be patient and understand the problem first, so that you can really appreciate why Namespaces exist and how they work. Once you understand the problem and the story setup that we will use for the most part of the course, you will start to truly appreciate the core concepts.\nPre-requisite background: If you have done some level of programming and can use basic command-line Linux, you are good to go. You are not expected to have any kind of background in container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes. I will walk you through any related areas such as the Proc filesystem and Mount Points. Also, you do not have to have an in-depth knowledge of Linux. I will provide the required background wherever necessary. It would be beneficial if you can download and use the VM that comes for free with this course.\n\n\nHow should you approach this course?\nFirst, DO NOT try to cram this into a few weeks - more so, if you have not dealt with these topics before. Because we go deep in to these topics, it is important that you pace yourself. Next, carve out time for the individual sections. There are some areas within each of these sections that demand more time. For example, Mount Namespaces is quite detailed and same goes for Image Layering. Take a break on a regular basis, revisit the ideas and let them sink in. Once it clicks, you will find it incredibly rewarding. It is also important that you get your hands dirty with the examples in the demos, and once you get the idea, try out your own examples.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nDocker and the Docker logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Docker, Inc. in the United States and other countries.

Most important is that you will learn how Git works and knowing it you will be able much more easier use Git features and fix mistakes in your development workflow. You can have zero knowledge about Git and GitHub. All will be taught from scratch, from basic to advanced features. If you want to get deep knowledge of Git and GitHub this course is for you!\n\n\nWe will start by exploring internal structure of the Git repository. You will learn that Git has 4 types of objects: blobs, trees, commits and annotated tags. Each object has unique SHA1 hash. Also all objects are stored in the folders. Every object has just single reference to it - SHA1 hash. Files are stored in blobs. Filenames are stored in other Git objects called trees.\nI will explain you how to create new Git objects without using git commit and git add. After creating Git object in the Git repository you will checkout it to staging area and working directory (opposite direction to traditional Git flow)\nAfterwards we will jump into tons of practice activities and use different Git and GitHub features\nIn practice sections you will perform multiple practice Git activities:\nInitialize new Git repository\nMake changes, add them to staging area and commit\nCreate branches, checkout branches and merge branches\nPerform fast-forward and 3-way merges of the branches\nResolve merge conflicts\nMove into detached HEAD state and make experimental commits there\nPerform rebasing of the branches\nYou will also learn and practice different GitHub features\nConnect local and remote repositories\nPushing, fetching and pulling operations\nOpen Pull Request\nMerge Pull Request\nAdd software versions using Git Tags\nCreate forks from other repositories\nContribute to public repositories using technique of forks and pull requests\nPerform rebasing with squashing\nYou will use not just terminal and shell commands for performing Git operations. In parallel you will also use GUI applications that simplify routine day-by-day Git operations:\nGitHub Desktop\nSourceTree\nVisualStudio Code\nWith this course you will get lifetime-long access to almost 200 lectures and tens of practical exercises. After the course you will become a guru of Git and GitHub and will be able easily perform basic and advanced Git tasks.\nBut most important is that you will UNDERSTAND Git.\nYou will also get 30-days money-back guarantee.

That is a pity.\nAgent-Based modeling is much simpler than machine learning. You basically just let agents interact in an environment and watch for any emergent behavior. You practically do not have to have any math background and you are able to create amazing things.\nYou can simulate society ( e.g. spread of virus, interaction of groups of people, of different individuals ... ), ecology (spread of fire) ... you can simulate chemical processes, physical phenomenons and more...\nDoesn’t that sound amazing? ( PS: simulating a society is a way to understand it )\nAs you’ll learn in this course, the Agent-Based modeling AI paradigm is very different from Machine learning. It’s even led to new and amazing insights in social sciences.\nWe will program in NetLogo language which is one of the most popular and poweful environment.\nWhat is covered in this course?\nAgent-Based Modeling theory\n1 Practical hands-on project ( we will simulate spread of a virus )\nStorytelling with simulation\nOn-Website simulation\nIf you’re ready to take on a brand new challenge, and learn about powerful AI technique that you’ve never seen before in any kind of machine learning, then this course is for you!\nSee you in class!\nTIPS (to get through the course):\nTake handwritten notes. I will provide my presentations. This will help you understand.\nLectures - 1.5x speed, Coding - 1.25-1.5x speed\nWrite code yourself, don't just sit there and look at my code.

This is 80% practice course without no useless demos!\nBuild custom Apache Kafka Producers and Consumers using native Java API. Also you will build projects using APIs for other programming languages like Node.js and Python.\nBecome a master of Apache Kafka by understanding and practicing its architecture and main features.\nAll project files and mostly used commands are available in the GitHub repository.\nThis is the most complete practical Apache Kafka guide here on Udemy that includes tons of practical activities. Most important is that you will learn how Apache Kafka works and knowing it you will be able much more easier use its features and fix mistakes in the future after you'll finish this course. You can have zero knowledge about Apache Kafka, Java, Node.js or Python. All will be taught from scratch, from basic to advanced features. If you want to get deep knowledge of Apache Kafka this course is for you!\n\n\nWe will start by installing Apache Kafka on your computer, VPS (Virtual Private Server) or Virtual Machine on your computer. You will learn that installation of Apache Kafka is pretty easy - you just need to download archive with executable scripts and run them. Also you will learn and practice how to run multiple brokers on the same computer.\nAfterwards we will jump into tons of practice activities and use different Apache Kafka features and built-in scripts. You will launch Zookeeper, multiple Brokers, Console Consumer and Console Producer. Also you will test performance of the Kafka Cluster using built-in utility called Performance Monitor.\nIn practice sections you will perform multiple practice Apache activities:\nCreate cluster with multiple brokers\nCreate topic with multiple partitions spread across different brokers\nCreate topics with replication factor that allows you to store copy of every message on different brokers for redundancy\nProduce messages using built-in Console Producer\nConsume messages using built-in Console Consumer\nLaunch multiple consumers in the same consumer group\nLaunch Performance Monitor for testing Consumers and Producers performance and speed\nYou will also learn and practice how to use Apache Kafka API to create your own Consumers and Producers\nCreate Java Maven project\nLaunch Producer and Consumer using Java\nLaunch multiple consumers in the same Consumer Group\nUnderstand and practice difference between \"subscribe\" and \"assign\"\nCreate Node.js project\nLaunch Producers and Consumers using Node.js\nCreate Python project\nLaunch Producers and Consumers using Python\nDuring the course you will need to view and edit text files. For that you will NOT use terminal. Instead you will use GUI application VisualStudio Code. Also all configuration files and project files are available in the GitHub repository. This means that during this course you will also learn how to use :\nGit and GitHub\nVisualStudio Code\nWith this course you will get lifetime-long access to more than 100 lectures and tens of practical exercises. After the course you will become a guru of Apache Kafka and will be able easily create custom Apache Kafka Producers and Consumers.\nBut most important is that you will UNDERSTAND Apache Kafka.\nYou will also get 30-days money-back guarantee.

      "description": "If you’ve heard of DevOps and seen the words: CI/CD, Pipelines and automation, then more than likely, the tool being used is Jenkins.\n\n\nWhere most courses go wrong is they teach you the tool in the web interface. Then as soon as you start the job, you’re presented with “Jenkinsfiles” as everything is done in code.\n\n\nThis course will show you how to do everything you need to do in Jenkins exclusively in the code format - why? Because that is what is used in Business!\n\n\nDo I need programming experience?\n\n\nNo, you don’t. It’s easy to get started and no scripting experience required.\n\n\nSign up now and get started with learning the most popular CI/CD tool on the market!\n\n\nHaving spent hundreds of dollars on training and getting up to speed with Jenkins when I was a contractor for Deloitte, I found that I had wasted loads of time and resources on courses that didn’t prepare me for what I would need to do on the job.\n\n\nThey will teach you how to use the web interface...\n\n\nREALITY CHECK: ALL THE PIPELINES ARE SCRIPTED IN Jenkinsfiles!\n\n\nThe web interface WAS NEVER used to set up the jobs, like I had been taught to do in the courses.\n\n\nI remember when I was in your shoes, TIME WAS EVERYTHING! I had to have this skill “yesterday” so if I had even just an hour to study it was crucial! Now imagine having spent that limited and invaluable time on JUST the installation! Like many of these courses do.\n\n\nThis fueled me to create this course  because I wanted to SAVE YOU the PAIN, TIME and MONEY that this mistake cost me.\n\n\nThis led to the birth of this course to teach you Jenkins and how it’s used in industry so you’re ready to go, immediately after you finish watching it!\n\n\nIn this course, you’re going to learn about:\n\n\nJenkins Pipelines: What they are and how they are used\nParameterized jobs: Pass information between the different jobs. You’ll be using these all the time at work\nIntegration with GitHub: Jenkins and GitHub go hand-in-hand which is why I’ll show you how to leverage both with this course\nFull breakdown of how to use Jenkinsfiles: From the ground up and for a complete beginner, by the end of the course you’ll know exactly how to create, use and update Jenkinsfiles\nTrains you to use Jenkins the RIGHT way! Get used to and familiarised with Jenkinsfiles and Declarative Pipelines so that you can hit the ground running at work\nScripting your CI/CD solution You’ll be surprised how often you’ll be asked to do this in your DevOps role and you’ll know exactly what you need to do to implement it\nHow to use functions in your Jenkins pipelines\nTake advantage of functions to save yourself time instead repeating big blocks of code\nMultistage Pipelines in Code These are one of the MOST POWERFUL FEATURES of Jenkins and now you’ll not only learn about them, you’ll know how to create them in code\nHow to use Declarative Pipeline Language The bread and butter of Jenkinsfiles, learn it here and learn it now\n\n\nSounds like a lot to take in right? I remember having to learn this on the job thinking “Where do I start?!”.\n\n\nI’ve gone through the PAIN so YOU DON’T HAVE TO!\n\n\nThe course has been expertly organised to maximise your learning efficiency!\n\n\nFollowing the Warp 9 mantra of mastering everything you need to know to get hired tomorrow, TODAY!\n\n\nIn just over 2 hours from now you will go from googling: “what is Jenkins” to being on the same level as a DevOps pro!\n\n\nAll the fluff, filler, mistakes, corrections and unscripted blunders REMOVED!\n\n\nEverything, from the filler “erms”, load times kept in and to the little details like the large gaps between sentences has been cut-down to streamline your learning experience and save you time!\n\n\nEverything you need to master Jenkins, packaged where YOUR Time is The Most Important Factor!\n\n\nI’ve shown this course to some of my former colleagues asking them what they thought...\n\n\nThey all loved it! Wished they had something this concise and quick to teach them when they were starting out!\n\n\nNow to the question you’re asking yourself…\n\n\n“Well that’s great, but how much does this cost?”\n\n\nNormally considering the time, research, professional know-how from REAL EXPERIENCE, and effort put in, I’d have charged MORE! A lot of my former associates who know the value of an expertly crafted course would have happily signed up early.\n\n\nBut I know recent events have been challenging for us all, and I wanted to do my part in helping you become the engineer I know you can be!",

      "description": "The Ultimate Kubernetes Course for Beginners: Now with Multilingual Subtitles!\nAvailable with quality subtitles in Hindi, Spanish and English.\n\n\nWhat is Kubernetes?\nKubernetes is the most powerful DevOps technology for managing (or orchestrating) the entire lifecycle of cloud applications. Google, for example, deploys more than 12 billion applications monthly based on Kubernetes, including well-known services such as Search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Play, Chrome, among others.\nCurrently, Kubernetes is a phenomenon in the technology sector, being adopted by the most innovative companies due to its versatility, security, and performance. With Kubernetes, it is possible to deliver new software and updates in record time, meeting the demands of the modern internet.\nIn summary, Kubernetes is a technology for orchestrating production-ready containers, according to the official definition of Kubernetes itself.\nIf I don't understand something, can the instructor help me?\nYes, absolutely! We want to ensure you feel fully supported throughout the course. We have a dedicated Q&A section where you can clarify your doubts. Additionally, you can send questions directly to the instructor privately, and they will respond with care and attention. Most questions receive responses in less than 4 hours, but the standard is under 24 hours during the week. We're here to make your learning journey as smooth as possible!\nWhat is the difference between Kubernetes and GKE (Google), AKS (Azure), EKS (Amazon), ACK (Alibaba), among others?\nThe difference is significant, as GKE, AKS, EKS, and ACK are not Kubernetes themselves! Kubernetes is a container orchestration system, an independent, open, and free technology. This training will teach Kubernetes in its pure form, which can be fully reused in any environment with Kubernetes installed, whether locally or in the cloud.\nIn general terms, GKE, AKS, EKS, and ACK are products that use Kubernetes. They are provided as services by the companies Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alibaba, respectively, to create an environment (cluster) where you can run your Kubernetes applications outside your company, that is, in their cloud. This is known as Managed Kubernetes Platform.\nIn summary, Kubernetes is the underlying technology, while GKE, AKS, EKS, and ACK are managed services that facilitate the deployment and operation of Kubernetes clusters in their respective clouds. Each of these services has its own specific characteristics and integrations, allowing you to choose the most suitable for your needs. Learning Kubernetes is essential to stand out in the world of distributed cloud applications with containers, regardless of the chosen platform.\nTherefore, GKE, AKS, EKS, and ACK are, in essence, environments to install Kubernetes. They charge for this service and offer other additional services to add value to your Kubernetes environment (cluster).\nWho owns Kubernetes?\nKubernetes is an open-source project under the management of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The CNCF is a sub-organization of the Linux Foundation, a non-profit entity that also oversees the development of the Linux operating system. Therefore, although Kubernetes is a community project with contributions from various organizations and individuals, governance and strategic guidance are provided by the CNCF and, ultimately, by the Linux Foundation.\nWhy should I learn Kubernetes?\nLearning Kubernetes puts you at the forefront of the expanding market for distributed cloud applications that use containers. With this course, you will have the opportunity to equip yourself with the same powerful tools used by industry giants!\nThe most impressive thing is to know which other organizations, besides Google, are using Kubernetes to innovate their systems. NASA, Nubank, Spotify, Adidas, Tinder, Airbnb, Bloomberg Financial Data Analytics, and Udemy are just a few examples of leading companies in innovation and market power that use Kubernetes.\nThis course will not only give you a deep understanding of Kubernetes but will also provide you with practical skills that you can immediately apply in your work. Whether to improve the efficiency of your current organization or to increase your employability in the market, knowledge of Kubernetes is a valuable skill that can open many doors for you.\nWhat will I have acquired upon completing this training?\nThis course will prepare you with comprehensive knowledge of Kubernetes, starting with the basics. You will understand what a container orchestrator is, what Kubernetes is, and the various possibilities of its use.\nBut we don’t stop there! This training will prepare you to manage the entire lifecycle of your application using Kubernetes. You will be able to handle the daily challenges that a Kubernetes administrator faces, acquiring professional skills to solve problems effectively and assertively.\nAt the end of this course, you will not only have a theoretical understanding of Kubernetes but will also have practical experience in solving real problems. This knowledge and experience will contribute to a successful career in the field of DevOps and help you stand out in the job market.\nCourse Structure\nThis course is structured based on an innovative neurolearning methodology. This pedagogical approach uses advanced teaching techniques that allow the student to absorb up to 70% more of the content of the technology under study, all with reduced mental effort.\nThe course content is organized around three fundamental pillars:\nUnderstanding: What is Kubernetes? Here, you will understand the concept behind this powerful tool.\nApplication: Why use Kubernetes? In this pillar, we will discuss the purpose and advantages of using Kubernetes.\nPractice: How to implement Kubernetes? Here, you will learn the practice of implementing and using Kubernetes in real-world scenarios.\nThe course is designed to be highly practical: 80% of the content is dedicated to practical classes, while the remaining 20% is reserved for theory and fundamental concepts. This approach ensures that you not only understand Kubernetes but are also ready to effectively apply it in your work environment.\nAdditionally, the course goes beyond the simple use of Kubernetes. It focuses on providing a deep understanding of what is happening behind the scenes. This will allow you to become a highly valuable professional, capable of handling complex situations and making informed decisions.\nWhat professional level will I reach with this training, and how complete is the course?\nThis course offers initial professional training, preparing you to enter the job market as a Kubernetes Administrator (Initial Level). The training content has been carefully crafted so that you are able to handle various situations related to the daily operation of Kubernetes. The course is pedagogically balanced and covers:\nBasic Themes: The course addresses all the fundamental aspects of Kubernetes.\nIntermediate Themes: Includes common day-to-day operations.\nAdvanced Themes: Deals with some advanced topics, focusing only on the essential issues.\nFinal Course Project\nThe final project is an opportunity to apply all the knowledge acquired during the training in a professional manner. The challenge consists of the complete orchestration of a widely used professional system.\nThe course will provide all the necessary conditions for you to face this challenge with confidence. The project will be carried out step by step, with detailed explanations from the teacher, so that you can achieve the final goal: to orchestrate a professional application, managing the entire software lifecycle. This includes deploying the software in production, managing fundamental aspects, and finally, removing the application. This practical experience will equip you with the necessary skills to stand out in the field of DevOps.\nDo I need to pay for a cloud service (Google, Azure, Amazon, Alibaba, etc.) to take this course?\nNo, you don’t need to! This course is based exclusively on FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) technologies. Therefore, you will not have to spend a single penny to use the technologies taught in this training, nor provide your credit card details to any company. We believe it is unacceptable for these large corporations to continue to monetize students.\nIn this course, we will use minikube, a system developed by the creators of Kubernetes themselves. Minikube creates a real (cluster) Kubernetes environment, complete with all the functionalities needed to run everything we need to learn in this training, and best of all, at no cost! This is because minikube is FOSS!\nBut what is minikube?\nMinikube is a system specifically designed to teach and learn Kubernetes. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and the Linux Foundation (CNCF partner and Kubernetes certifier) strongly recommend and encourage the use of minikube for learning.\nEverything we study using minikube will work identically in any environment where Kubernetes is installed, whether in a public cloud (Google, Azure, Amazon, Alibaba, etc.), a Raspberry Pi, a Virtual Machine, or Bare Metal (physical servers), for example.\nWhat do I need to know before taking this course?\nBefore enrolling in this course, it is important that you have knowledge in three main areas:\nDocker: This course assumes that you are already familiar with Docker, as it will not be covered here.\nComputer networks: It is necessary to understand the basic concepts of computer networks, including TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, Proxy, and Load Balancer.\nGNU/Linux: We recommend that you have basic knowledge of GNU/Linux.\nIs this course suitable for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certifications?\nThis course is essential for those planning to take the CKA and CKAD certification exams. It covers the concepts, resources, and components that are part of these exams. However, we recommend additional studies and taking practice exams before taking the actual exam, as this course does not include practice exams.\nAbout the instructor\nThe course is taught by Prof. Eng. Arnaldo Sousa, who has a background in Software Engineering, IT Management, and Systems Analysis and Development. He has served as an official instructor and consultant for IBM and Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), and is a licensed teacher with various specializations in the field of education, including Teaching, Communication, Neurolearning, Neuropsychology, Philosophy, and Special Education.\nWith extensive experience in using and teaching new technologies, Professor Arnaldo Sousa will present Kubernetes in an extremely comprehensible and accessible way!\n\n\nReady to take your career to the next level with Kubernetes? Don’t miss out on this opportunity to master the most sought-after skills in the industry. Enroll now and start your journey towards becoming a Kubernetes expert!",

After more than 10 years of experience in programming and leading many CMake workshops I was ready to prepare multiplatform friendly course for beginners in CMake world and also for people that has experience in CMake that will help to solve that problems.\nThere is many tutorials and blog posts, so why this training? In this training I put not only theory that you can find in the popular websites, but firstly I present:\ngood practices from first lecture\nhow to avoid making simple but hard to find mistakes\nadvantages and disadvantages of many solutions\nThis training is the first part of series \"Effective Modern CMake\".\nIn this training I try to avoid the command line that is usually good, but platform dependent, so never mind if you are using Windows, Linux or macOS. This training is for you. Moreover I show differences and in some topics dedicated solutions for each platform if it is needed. I prepared videos that help you setup environment in the most popular code editors like CLion, Visual Studio and Qt Creator. Of course you can use your favorite IDE.\nWould you like to have an example of given topic, eg. integrating with C++ library? Put a comment and collect the vote!",

Certainly the most popular shell is “bash”. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).  bash is not only an excellent command line shell, but a scripting language in itself. Shell scripting allows us to use the shell's abilities and to automate a lot of tasks that would otherwise require a lot of commands.\nBash scripting will help you automate routine tasks and save valuable time, whether you're a sys admin, Linux user or software developer. Shell script is much quicker than programming in any other languages.\nThe goal of this course is to provide you with a working knowledge of Bash scripting. We'll start with the basics, starting from creating our first Bash script and running it. Next you will learn about the bash environment, local variables, conditional statements, functions, loops, case statements, string operations, and coprocesses.",

      "description": "Learn and experience the world of modern CI/CD with Gitlab!\n\n\n**GitLab named a Leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for DevOps Platforms!**\n\n\nIt's no surprise that Gitlab is so popular among millions of developers and thousands of high-velocity teams around the world that want the best experience effortlessly and deliver their software to the world in an instant. Did you know Gitlab dot com alone has more than 30 million developers signed up? Not to mention those who run their own Gitlab...\n\n\nIn this course, you'll learn why developers and teams love Gitlab, build and continuously deliver great software to the users like you and me every day.\n\n\nWe'll start by exploring the world of Gitlab. I'll introduce myself and my experience over the years with Gitlab by actively using it. We'll then go ahead and explore the course section by section and what's in it for you. Then we'll see what you need to follow along with this course; a Gitlab account which I'll help you how to create, familiarity with git commands and a basic understanding of Docker. And make no mistake; I'll explain you at the every step of the way!\n\n\nIn Getting Started with Gitlab section, we'll start by creating our Gitlab account. Once our account is ready, we'll go ahead and explore our Gitlab account and it's features. Then we'll create an SSH key pair and configure Gitlab to trust this key to push our code and sign our commits with it. Time comes to creating a project and making our first commit to Gitlab! Once we learn how to do all that, we'll start exploring features of projects with Gitlab.\n\n\nIn Getting Started with Gitlab CI/CD section, we'll start by learning how Gitlab CI/CD works under the hood and how it helps us to quickly deliver our software to our users. We'll then explore and learn to work with Gitlab Web IDE; a modern IDE based on Visual Studio Code. Once we're familiar with the Web IDE, we'll implement our first Gitlab CI/CD pipeline with .gitlab-ci.yml. Then we'll explore our pipeline execution in Gitlab UI and I'll explain you every single line of code that we implemented for the pipeline. And finally, we'll explore the CI/CD settings for projects with Gitlab.\n\n\nIn Software Development Lifecycle with Gitlab section, we'll start by learning Projects, Groups, Subgroups. Then we'll learn how to manage user access for projects and groups. Now it's time to focus on project management capabilities with Gitlab using Issue Tracking and Milestones. Most importantly, we'll learn how to branch out, create merge requests and conduct code reviews with Gitlab. Finally, we'll learn how to use the Wiki feature to document our software and Code Snippets to store snippets of code in our projects.\n\n\nIn the first part of Advanced Topics with Gitlab CI/CD, we'll explore Gitlab package and container registries as well as the Gitlab Runner. We'll start by having a glance at the topics and the first up is Gitlab Package Registry. We'll learn how to push our packages to Gitlab Registry. Then we'll learn how to work with Gitlab Container Registry by building and pushing our docker images to it. Then we'll focus our attention to Gitlab Runners. We'll start by learning how to build our own Gitlab Runner images based on Docker. After pushing our image to Gitlab Container Registry, we'll integrate it with a project to use it. We won't stop there and we'll actually register our own custom runner by using an AWS EC2 instance. We'll tie everything together by integrating our customer runner that uses our custom runner image to customise everything in our Gitlab pipeline.\n\n\nIn the second part of Advanced Topics with Gitlab CI/CD, we'll explore more and more interesting topics that you can take advantage of, love and potentially use every single day!\nWe'll start by learning how to integrate a Kubernetes cluster with Gitlab and continuously deliver software with manifests in our Gitlab projects. Next up is to learn how to manage Terraform state with Gitlab; we'll see how easy it is to use Gitlab Terraform backend without any credentials!\nHere we come to another exciting part; we'll learn how to take advantage of Gitlab API and Gitlab CLI or glab to further enhance our experience while working with Gitlab!\nNext up is to learn how to integrate other tools with Gitlab and we'll integrate Slack to both talk to Gitlab from Slack channels as well as get notified in Slack when certain events happen in our projects. Finally, we'll explore project insights and analytics with Gitlab to learn, understand and have an insight into our projects in Gitlab.\n\n\nIn Getting More Out of Gitlab section, we'll learn more ways to elevate our Gitlab experience. We'll start by exploring the vast ocean of Gitlab documentation for every single topic about Gitlab. Then we'll learn Gitlab Learn which help your team get trained on curated content whether instructor-led or self-paced. We'll also explore certification possibilities for validating our Gitlab expertise even further. For those who are looking to run their own Gitlab instance for various reasons, we'll also explore various different ways of running and hosting our own Gitlab instance.\nFinally, we'll explore Gitlab plans and pricing for teams for those who are looking to get more out of their Gitlab experience with more features.\n\n\nThese and much awaits you in this course! Whether you're just starting your journey to the world of Gitlab or a day-to-day user who is looking to learn new ways to get more out of Gitlab, join me in this course to learn from my near-decade Gitlab experience!",

      "description": "Kubernetes is a container orchestration technology - a way to create and deploy clusters of machines running containers, usually Docker containers.\nKubernetes is also one of the hottest topics in tech today, because it is perhaps the only straightforward way to architect a hybrid, multi-cloud compute solution.\nLet's parse that:\nHybrid: This is a solution where an enterprise has a private cloud or on-premise data center, in addition to using one of the public cloud providers (such as AWS, GCP or Azure). Any firm migrating to the cloud is going to have to run a hybrid setup, at least during the migration\nMulti-cloud: This refers to the use of more than 1 cloud provider. Why is this so important? Well, because most large firms are unwilling to be completely locked into one provider, particularly after events like Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods (that gave pause to a whole lot of potential AWS customers, who decided that 'multi-cloud' makes sense for strategic reasons)\nOnly straightforward way: Most cloud providers offer a range of compute solutions, ranging from PaaS (Elastic Beanstalk, or Google App Engine) to IaaS (EC2, or Google Compute Engine VMs). The reality is that PaaS ties you down to 1 cloud provider, and IaaS is a lot of hassle, during migration and beyond.\nKubernetes is supported by each of the Big-3: GCP has a special relationship with Kubernetes (since K8S originated at Google) but now AWS and Azure support it as well. Kubernetes has won the battle of the container orchestration systems.\nThis is why containers running on Kubernetes constitute the hottest compute choice for a hybrid, multi-cloud world.\nHere is now is what this course contains:\nDocker, Kubernetes and the cloud platforms: understanding the inter-relationships\nPods and containers: Pods are the basic building block in K8S; each pod holds one or more containers that are tightly-coupled to each other\nReplicaSets: Higher-level abstractions that provide scaling and auto-healing (they encapsulate pods, and bring new pods back up if the old ones crash)\nDeployments: Even higher-level abstractions that provide versioning, fast rollback, rolling updates and more\nServices: Front-end abstractions (think of them as similar to load-balancers) that are loosely coupled with backend pods. Services provide a static, stable network frontend IP, as well as load-balancing\nOther K8S objects: StatefulSets, Secrets, ConfigMaps, Jobs and CronJobs and more\nCKA test tips: We don't reveal any information about the test that we should not, such as specific questions. But we do discuss the test format, what to expect, pitfalls to avoid, and strategies for success\nHope you enjoy the course!",

      "description": "Developing modern software requires an automated pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys your application, complete with its required infrastructure. GitLab is a Git-based version control server, available at gitlab .com or as a private server. GitLab CI provides automated builds and deployments right from within GitLab. With GitLab CI, it is easy to add build and deployment automation that triggers on every code change, helping you build high-quality, reliable software and deploy it to production at speed. This course will give you a hands-on tutorial on GitLab CI. You will use GitLab CI to create a DevOps pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy software to virtual machines and container environments.\nYou will explore the features of GitLab CI, including using runners to execute build jobs, creating multi-stage builds, and deploying to virtualized and containerized environments. You will see how easy it is to get started with GitLab CI by deploying your own runners in cloud environments or on your own servers, using Docker and Kubernetes or ordinary scripting.\nBy the end of this course, you'll be ready to use GitLab CI for your own applications to automate your build and deployment pipelines.\nAbout the Author\nAlan Hohn is a Lockheed Martin Fellow who specializes in DevOps, microservice architecture, and agile. He is experienced at deploying and configuring GitLab CI and in helping teams take advantage of its ability to automate application builds, tests, and deployments. He has extensive experience teaching technical topics and loves to combine examples and explanation to make any technology clearer.",

This DevOps course focuses on the detailed understanding and implementation of:\nGit and GitHub - free, open source, distributed version control system\nApache Maven - tool for build automation including software project management and comprehension\nJUnit - unit testing framework for the Java programming language\nApache Log4j - java-based logging utility and reliable, fast and flexible logging framework (APIs)\n\n\nThe term 'DevOps' was introduced by combining software “development” (Dev) and “operations” (Ops.) The aforesaid term was coined by Patrick Debois in 2009 to make way for quick and effective delivery of software updates, bug fixes, and features.\n\n\nDevOps, essentially as an approach or a work culture, is implemented by the right amalgamation of collaboration, automation, integration, continuous delivery, testing and supervising.\nPrior to the introduction of DevOps, the traditional or classic waterfall model was followed for software delivery. This process model involved a sequential flow of a defined set of phases where the output of one phase becomes the input of the next phase. Therefore, all the phases are dependent on each other, and the completion of one phase marks the beginning of the other. Despite the simplicity of SDLC, it has been found to have several defects. It has been observed that in the ever-changing contemporary world, a business is met with multifaceted problems which require quick fixes. Changes in the product like adding new features, fixing bugs, etc. require it to go through at least a few different silos in traditional SDLC, causing delays and increasing cost.\nDevOps resolves these bottlenecks and is a more inclusive approach to the software development process, where the development and operations teams work collaboratively on the project. Resultantly, the software development life cycle is shortened with the help of faster feedback loops for more frequent delivery of updates and features.\nConsidering the most important elements of DevOps viz. consistency (version control), build automation, testing, logging & supervision, this course covers the most popular tools & technologies used in DevOps. This DevOps course will help you learn the important DevOps building blocks and tools viz. Git, Maven, JUnit, and Log4j, thus opening a world of opportunities for you in DevOps engineering and project management.\n\n\nDEVOPS - Course Curriculum\nThe DevOps course curriculum is divided into:\nDevOps Introduction\nGit and GitHub\nMaven\nJUnit 5\nLog4j\nDetailed course topics of each of the above components are mentioned here.\n\n\nGit - Course Syllabus\n\n\nVersion Control System\nGit Introduction\nGit Installation\nGit Workflow\nCreating Remote Repository\nHow to add existing project to GitHub using Git Bash\nWorking with Repositories\nDeleting Files\nWorking with Branches\n\n\nApache Maven - Course Syllabus\n\n\nMaven Introduction\nDownloading and Installing Maven\nMaven Repositories\nCreating Maven Standalone Project in CLI\nWhat are JAR, WAR, EAR files\nMaven Build Life Cycle\nDeveloping Standalone Maven Project in Non-Interactive Mode\nRunning Test Cases with Maven\nCreating Maven Web Project in CLI\nCreating Maven Standalone Project through IDE\nCreating Maven Web Project through IDE\nAdding Dependencies to pom.xml\nDependency Chain\nMaven Scopes\n\n\nJUnit - Course Syllabus\n\n\nJUnit Introduction\nAdding JUnit 5 dependency in Maven project\nJUnit 5 Annotations\nJUnit 5 RepeatedTest Annotation\nJUnit 5 Assertions\nJUnit 5 Timeouts\nJUnit 5 Expected Exceptions\nJUnit 5 Parameterized Tests\nJUnit 5 How to run Unit Test with Maven\nJUnit 5 Tagging and Filtering\nHamcrest Framework\nUnit Testing on Spring Boot Repository\nSpring Boot Integration Testing\n\n\nLog4j - Course Syllabus\n\n\nIntroduction to Log4j\nLog4j Components and Implementation\nWorking with Log4j Properties\n\n\nGit\nGit is an open-source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers.\nBy far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).\nGit has been designed with the integrity of managed source code as a top priority. The content of the files as well as the true relationships between files and directories, versions, tags and commits, all of these objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. In simple words, Git is a modern and widely used distributed version control system in the world. It is developed to manage projects with high speed and efficiency. The version control system allows us to monitor and work together with our team members at the same workspace.\n\n\nGitHub\nGitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control. Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project.\nGitHub provides code hosting services that allow developers/people to build software for open source and private projects in organizations. GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.\nAt a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.\n\n\nApache Maven\nMaven is an automation and management tool developed by Apache Software Foundation. It is written in Java Language to build projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. It allows developers to create projects, dependency, and documentation using Project Object Model and plugins. It has a similar development process as ANT, but it is more advanced than ANT. Maven can also build any number of projects into desired output such as jar, war, metadata.\nMaven is a powerful software project management and comprehension tool that is based on POM (Project Object Model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process like ANT. But it is too much advanced than ANT. In summary, we can say that maven is a tool that can be used for building and managing any Java-based project. maven make the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java-based project.\nNo matter how small or large, all applications must undergo a specific series of processes, such as generating and compiling source code. Developers can manually configure these processes, but it’s a time-consuming burden. To solve this issue, we use Apache Maven, which automates the entire process and makes Java developers’ daily work easier.\n\n\nJUnit\nJUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit, that originated with JUnit. So in essence, JUnit is an open source Unit Testing Framework for Java and is useful for Java Developers to write and run repeatable tests. Erich Gamma and Kent Beck initially developed it. It is an instance of xUnit architecture. As the name implies, it is used for Unit Testing of a small chunk of code.\nA JUnit test is a method contained in a class which is only used for testing. This is called a Test class. To define that a certain method is a test method, annotate it with the Test annotation. This method executes the code under test. JUnit is used primarily to test each and every unit or component of your application like classes and methods. It helps to write and run repeatable automated tests, to ensure your code runs as intended. The framework offers support to Selenium for automation testing web-apps or websites.\nDevelopers who are following test-driven methodology must write and execute unit test first before any code. Once you are done with code, you should execute all tests, and it should pass. Every time any code is added, you need to re-execute all test cases and makes sure nothing is broken.\n\n\nApache Log4j\nApache Log4j is a java-based logging utility and can be considered as a reliable, fast and flexible logging framework (APIs) written in Java, which is distributed under the Apache Software License. In other words, Log4j is a popular logging package written in Java. Log4j has been ported to the C, C++, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby, and Eiffel languages.\nLog4j is an open-source logging API for java. Simply the logging means some way to indicate the state of the system at runtime. Logs are used to capture and persists the important data and make it available for analysis at any point in time. The API for Log4j is separate from the implementation making it clear for application developers which classes and methods they can use while ensuring forward compatibility. This allows the Log4j team to improve the implementation safely and in a compatible manner.\nLog4j is a tool that basically helps the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets. In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so that the problem can be located. With Log4j it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application binary.\n\n\nBenefits of DevOps\nEnsure faster deployment\nStabilize work environment\nSignificant improvement in product quality\nAutomation\nAgility\nContinuous delivery of software\nFast and reliable problem-solving techniques\nTransparency and high productivity\nMinimal cost of production",

      "description": "In this course you will learn the Fundamentals of Electrical Instrumentation - you will learn about the different types of devices, sensors, and circuits used in this field.\nInstrumentation is the vital ingredient that enables the process control systems of buildings and factories to run smoothly. Within these  process control systems are numerous instrumentation devices that take measurements and perform operations which are transmitted and received via electrical circuits - in other words along the wires that they are connected to!\nIt takes a skilful person to know how these electrical circuits work and how the wiring must be connected. That's where you come in!\nAfter completing this course, you will know how to wire up digital (discrete) & analog instrumentation devices and understand how the electrical circuits connected to them work.\n\n\nElectrical instrumentation devices come in many forms, the four types that we will focus on in this course are:\n-Digital (discrete) Inputs\n-Digital (discrete) Outputs\n-Analog Inputs\n-Analog Outputs\n\n\nIn the course we will start off by looking at Digital Inputs, we will learn about what digital input devices are used for and learn how to connect them to a controller in sink and source configuration. Connecting a push button and a proximity sensor as digital input devices will be demonstrated.\nDigital Outputs are covered next, we learn how to connect a solenoid actuated water valve as an output device and also look at sink and source wiring configurations.\nAbout halfway through the course we put what we've learnt to the test by surfing the net and studying some various wiring diagrams of instrumentation & plc circuits.\nWhen we get to Analog Inputs, we hone in on the basic fundamentals of analog circuits such as the 0-10volt and 4-20ma circuits. We then discuss 2, 3, 4 and 5 wire transmitters and round out the chapter by demonstrating a temperature sensor connected in a loop as an input device. WARNING - there may be a little maths involved (just a little)!\nAn Analog Output circuit is demonstrated next by using a variable frequency drive as our output device, we get to see what happens to a motor connected to the drive when the analog signal is changed.\nTo finish off we study a controller as it would look in a real installation with various inputs and outputs connected to it.\nSo if you are ready to boost your electrical control skills by learning the fundamentals of instrumentation I'll see you in the course!\nBut don't forget your pen and paper as there will be some fun exercises along the way!",

Every year there are many  engineering graduates coming out from each part of country . Be it Chennai Or Kashmir, from north to south. Process of manufacturing engineers is continuing at a fast increasing rate. But jobs in engineering are very less. There is a strong need of quality engineers.For an IT job, there is fight from all section of Engineering. Be it computer engineer, civil engineer or electronic engineer. If you go for online job search, latest job trend is DevOps. DevOps is an abbreviation for its two words. Dev implies to development and Ops stand for operation. DevOps offers various types of job opportunities for you, like engineering project manager, development engineering manager, automation engineers and many more various types of best jobs. Let's have a closer look at how DevOps is a better career choice for you:\n\nPackaging:-\nDevOps is awesome if you love to explore and play with variety of Technology and processes. In my opinion the first thing to consider is the Packaging of IT that the tech teams used to provide the organisations services. The maleable the packaging the easier it is to keep everything standardized and reusable. If you are are comfortable working with configuration management systems and developing some imaging systems such as docker you will like DevOps. Closer look to the recent trends tells us the amount of new technologies that are being released into the market is growing exponentially. In DevOps no technology is beyond limits and you find yourself constantly working with integrated and automating different Technologies. In DevOps your goal is to create machines as machine manageable data objects that are completely completely hands off on the production. The goal is to to allow programs written by different teams to efficiently automate as much as possible.\n\nScaling:-\nYou will definitely like DevOps if reusability is your passion. In my opinion the biggest factor in the successful tech organisations of the future will be their ability to scale rapidly while being able to deflate when not needed to minimise costs in downtime.\nIf the Application is reliable ,zippy and meet their needs, customers don't care about the tech behind it. They simply want speed.\nScalability is a hard thing to achieve and most would rather not have to worry about it, which is self explanatory about the growth scalability as a service offering.\nNow, Ask yourself. Do you want to jump from mobile to AI? DevOps will allow you. Do you want to play with that new SaaS service that is in trend these days? DevOps will let you do that.\nDevOps is all about being the glue that holds everything and everyone together, and if you ask me, that is what makes it so exciting. The possibilities are beyond limits and the technologies are always growing and evolving at an unexplanatory and unimaginable speed. And if you don’t focus on DevOps, you will still somehow have to manage infrastructure as a developer.\nQ. What is the need for DevOps?\nAs per me, this answer should start by explaining the general market trend. Instead of releasing big sets of features, companies see if small features can be transported to their customers via a series of release trains. This is very much advantageous like quick feedback from customers, better software quality, etc. which in turn takes the company to high customer satisfaction. To achieve this, companies are required to:\nIncrease frequency of deployment\nLower the New releases failure rate\nShorten their lead time between fixes\nDevOps lets you achieve seamless software delivery and fulfills all above requirements. You can give examples of companies like Amazon, Etsy, and Google who have welcomed DevOps to achieve levels of performance that were unimaginable even five years ago.\nQ. Explain your understanding and expertise on both the software development side and the technical operations side of an organization you’ve worked for in the past.\nDevOps engineers always work in a 24*7 critical business online environment. In my previous job, I was very much adaptable to on-call duties and was able to take up real-time, live-system responsibilities. I was successful in automated processes to support continuous software deployments. I have pretty good  experiences with public as well as private clouds, DevOps tools like CHEF or PUPPET, scripting and automation with languages like PYTHON and PHP, and a background in AGILE\n\nQ. What is Git?\nI will suggest that you attempt this question by first explaining about the architecture of Git.\nGit is a form of Distributed Version Control system (DVCS). It lets you track changes to a file and allows you to revert to any specific change.\nIts distributed architecture makes it more advantageous over other Version Control Systems (VCS) like SVN. Another major advantage of Git is that it does not rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files. Instead of that, every developer gets “clones” the copy of a repository. “Local repository”  has the full history of the project on its hard drive so that when there is a problem like a server outage, you need your teammate’s local Git repository for recovery.\nThere is a central cloud repository as well where developers can commit changes and share it with other teammates where all collaborators are committing changes “Remote repository\"\n\nQ. In Git how do you revert a commit that has already been pushed and made public?\nThere are two possible answers to the above question so make sure that you include both because any of the below options can be used depending on the situation's demand:\nRemove the bad file in a new commit and push the file to the remote repository. This is the most common and natural way to fix a bug or an error. Once you have included necessary changes to the file, commit it to the remote repository. For that purpose I will use the command\ngit commit -m “commit message\"\nNow, Create a new commit that will undo all the changes that were made in the bad Commit. To do so I will be using the command\ngit revert <name of bad commit>\n\nQ. How is DevOps different from Agile / SDLC?\nI would suggest you go through the below explanation:\nAgile is a set of values and principles about how to develop a software. For an instance: if you have some idea about something and you want to turn that idea into a working software the Agile values and principles can be used as a way to do that. But, that software might only be working on a developer’s laptop or within a test environment. You need a way to easily, quickly and repeatably move that software into production infrastructure, in a simple and safe way. To do that DevOps tools and techniques are required.\nIn a nutshell, Agile software development methodology keeps its focus on the development of software but, on the other hand, DevOps is responsible for development as well as the deployment of the software in the safest and reliable possible way.\nNow remember, keep this thing in mind, you have included DevOps tools in the previous answer so be prepared to answer some questions related to that. They might be thrown at you.\n\nQ. Which are the top DevOps tools? Which tools have you worked on?\nFew of The most famous DevOps tools are mentioned below:\nGit: Version Control System tool\nJenkins: Continuous Integration tool\nSelenium: Continuous Testing tool\nPuppet, Chef, Ansible: Configuration Management and Deployment tools\nNagios: Continuous Monitoring tool\nDocker: Containerization tool\nYou can also include any other tool if you want, but make sure you use the above tools in your answer.\nThe second part of the answer could have two possibilities:\nIf you have enough experience with all the above-mentioned tools then you may mention that I have worked on all these tools for developing good quality software and deploying that software easily, frequently, and reliably.\nIf you have experience with only with few of the above tools then name those tools and say that I have specialization in these tools and have an overview of the rest of the tools.\n\nQ. How do all these tools work together?\nThe code is developed by the developers and its source code is managed by Version Control System tools like Git etc.\nDevelopers transmit this code to the Git repository and any transformations made in the code is committed to this Repository.\nJenkins extracts this code from the repository using the Git plugin and creates it using tools like Ant or Maven.\nConfiguration management tools, puppet, deploy & provisions testing environment and after that Jenkins releases the code in the test environment on which testing is done using tools like selenium.\nAfter the code gets tested, Jenkins sends it for deployment on the production server (even the production server is provisioned & maintained by tools like the puppet).\nAfter its deployment, It is continuously monitored by tools like Nagios.\nDocker containers provide the testing environment to test the build features.\nQ. What is Version control?\nI guess this is the easiest question you could face in the interview. My take is to first define Version control. It is a system that keeps records of changes to a file or set of files over a period of time so that they can be recalled after specific versions later. Version control systems consist of a centrally shared repository where teammates can commit changes to a file or set of file. Then you might mention the uses of version control.\nVersion control allows you to:\nRestore back files to a previous state.\nRestore back the entire back to a previous state.\nCompare changes over a period of time.\nThe issue was introduced by whom and when.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of using version control?\nThe following advantages of version control are suggested to be used:\nVersion Control System (VCS), allows all the team members to work freely over any file at any point of time. VCS later allows you to merge all the changes into a common version.\nAll the past versions and variants are nicely and systematically encapsulated inside the CVS. Whenever you need it, you may request any version of software at any time and you can have a snapshot of the complete project right away.\nEach time you have an updated version of your project, VCS requires you to provide a short info about what was changed. Also, you can see what exactly was altered in the file’s content. This gives you the privilege to know who has made what altered the project.\nA distributed VCS like Git provides all the team members about the complete history of the project so if there is a breakdown in the central server, you may use any of your teammate’s local Git repository.\n\nQ. Describe branching strategies you have used.?\nThis question tests your branching experience so tell them about how you have used branching in your past jobs and what purpose does it serves, you can refer the below points:\nFeature branching:\nA feature branch model holds all of the changes for a particular feature inside of a branch. When the feature is completely tested and validated by the automated tests, the branch is then added to the master.\nTask branching:\nIn this model, each task is implemented over its own branch with the task key included inside the branch name. It is easy to notice which code implements which task, just search for the task key in the branch name.\nRelease branching:\nOnce the developed branch acquires enough features for a release, you can get that branch cloned to form a Release branch. Making this branch starts the further release cycle, so no extra features can be added after this point, only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should get on this branch. Once it is ready to be shipped, the release gets merged into master and tagged with a version number. In addition, it should be merged back inside develop branch, which might have progressed since the release was initiated.\nAt the end, tell them that branching strategies vary from one organization to another, so I am familiar with basic branching operations like delete, merge, checking out a branch etc.\n\nQ. What is meant by Continuous Integration?\nIt is advised to begin this answer by giving a short definition of Continuous Integration (CI). Continuous Integration is a development practice that needs developers to integrate code into a shared repository many times a day. Each check-in gets verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.\nI would suggest you explain how you have implemented it in your previous job.\n\nQ. Explain how you can move or copy Jenkins from one server to another?\nI could have achieved this task by copying the jobs directory directly from the old server to the new one. There are many ways to do that;  They are mentioned below:\nYou can:\nMoving a job from one installation of Jenkins to another by simply copying and pasting the corresponding job directory.\nCreate a copy of an existing job by making a clone of a job directory by a different name.\nRename an existing job by renaming a directory. Notice that if you change a job name, then you will need to change any other job that tries to call the renamed job.\n\nQ. Explain how can you create a backup and copy files in Jenkins?\nThe question has a direct answer. To create a backup, all you need to do is to back up your JENKINS_HOME directory at regular intervals of time. JENKINS_HOME directory contains all of your build jobs configurations,  slave node configurations, and build history. For generating a backup of your Jenkins setup, simply copy its directory. You may also copy a job directory for cloning or replicate a job or rename the directory.\nQ. How will you secure Jenkins?\nThe most common way of securing Jenkins is given below. But if you have any other way of doing it, you may go with it, but make sure you are correct:\nMake sure that the global security is on.\nMake sure that Jenkins is integrated with “my company’s” user directory using the appropriate plugin.\nMake sure that matrix/Project matrix is enabled for getting the fine tune access.\nAutomate the setting rights/privileges process in Jenkins with custom version controlled script.\nBound the physical access to Jenkins data/folders.\nRun security audits on same over a period of time.\nQ. What is Continuous Testing?\nIt is advised to follow the under mentioned explanation:\n“Continuous Testing is the process of executing automated tests as a part of the software delivery pipeline to produce immediate feedback over the business risks associated with the latest build. In this method, each build gets tested continuously, allowing Development teams to get fast feedbacks so that as to prevent those problems from progressing to the successive stage of Software delivery life-cycle. Continuous Testing speeds up a developer’s workflow dramatically as there’s no need to manually rebuild the project and re-run all of the tests after making changes.”\nQ. What is Automation Testing?\nAutomation testing or Test Automation is a process of automating the manual process for testing the application/system under test. The Process involves the use of separate testing tools which allows you to create test scripts which can be executed repeatedly and doesn’t require any sort of manual intervention.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of Automation Testing?\nSome of the many advantages of Automation Testing are mentioned below. Including these points in your answer and adding your own experience of how Continuous Testing helped you previous in your previous job, will make an impressive and impacting answer:\nSupports execution of repeated test cases\nAids in testing a large test matrix\nEnables parallel execution\nEncourages unattended execution\nImproves accuracy thereby reducing human-generated errors\nSaves time and money\nQ. What is the difference between Assert and Verify commands in Selenium?\nThe basic difference between Assert and Verify command is given below:\nAssert command checks if the given condition is boolean true or boolean false. For an instance, say, we assert whether the given element is present on the web page or not. If the condition results to be true, then the program control will execute the next test step. But, if the condition results in false, the execution would be terminated and no further test would be executed.\nVerify command also performs check whether the given condition is true or false. Irrespective of the condition being true or false, the program execution doesn’t stop  i.e. if the verification process fails, it would not stop the execution and all the test steps will be executed.\n\nQ. How can be a browser launched using WebDriver?\nThe following syntax could possibly be used to launch Browser:\n“WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();”\n“WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();”\n“WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();”\nQ. What are the goals of Configuration management processes?\nThe basic purpose of Configuration Management (CM) is to ensure if the product is integral or system throughout its life-cycle by making t0he development or deployment process controllable and repeatable, thus creating a higher quality product or system. The Configuration Management  process allows orderly management of system information and system changes for purposes such as to:\nRevise capability,\nImprove performance,\nReliability or maintainability,\nExtend life,\nReduce cost,\nReduce risk and\nLiability, or correct defects.\nQ. What is the difference between an Asset and a Configuration Item?\nAs per me, first of all, Asset should be explained. It has a financial value along with a depreciation rate attached to it. IT  assets are just a sub-set. Everything and anything that holds a  cost and the organization uses it for the calculation of its asset value and related benefits in the calculation of tax falls under Asset Management, and such item is called an asset.\nOn the other hand, Configuration Item may or may not have financial values assigned to it. Also, there will not be any depreciation linked to it. Thus, its life will not depend on its financial value but will depend on the time till that item becomes obsolete for the organization.\nNow  examples can be given  that can showcase the similarity and differences between both:\n1) Similarity:\nServer – It is both an asset as well as a CI.\n2) Difference:\nBuilding – It is an asset but not a CI.\nDocument – It is a CI but not an asset\n\nQ . What is Chef?\nStart the answer with the definition of Chef. The Chef is one of the powerful automation platforms that turns infrastructures into code. A chef is a tool for which scripts are written that are used to automate processes. What kind of processes?  Any process that is related to IT.\nNow the architecture of Chef can be explained, it consists of:\nChef Server: The Chef Server is the central store of infrastructure’s configuration data. The Chef Server stores the data necessary to configure the nodes and provides search. ChefServer is a powerful tool that lets you to dynamically drive node configuration based on data.\nChef Node: Node is any host that gets configured using Chef-client. Chef-client runs on nodes. ChefNode contacts the Chef Server for the information necessary to configure the node. Now, since a Node is just a machine that runs the Chef-client software, nodes may be sometimes referred to as “clients”.\nChef Workstation: A Chef Workstation is a host used to modify cookbooks and other confrontational data.\n\nQ2. What is Nagios?\nThis question can be answered by first mentioning that Nagios is one of the monitoring tools used for Continuous monitoring of systems, applications, services, and business processes etc in  DevOps culture. If a failure occurs, Nagios alerts technical staff about the problem, that allows them to begin remedial processes before outages affect business processes, end-users, or customers. With Nagios, you need not explain why an unseen infrastructure outage affects your organization's bottom line.\nNow once you defined what is Nagios, you can mention various things that can be achieved using Nagios.\nBy using Nagios you can:\nPlan for infrastructure upgrades before outdated systems cause failures.\nResponse to the issues at problem’s first sign.\nAutomatically fix detected problems.\nCoordinate easily with technical team responses.\nEnsure that your organization’s SLAs are being met.\nMonitor your entire infrastructure and business processes.\nNagios runs on a server, usually as a daemon or service. Nagios runs plugins residing on the same server over a period of time. They make contact to hosts or servers on your network or over the internet. One can see the status information using the web interface. Nagios also sends email or SMS notifications if something happens.\nThe Nagios daemon acts like a scheduler that executes certain scripts at certain moments. It then saves the results of those scripts and will run other scripts if these results change.\n*****************************************************************************************************\nDevOps Job Description\nDemand for people with DevOps skills is growing at a fast and steady rate because businesses are getting great results from DevOps. Organizations using DevOps practices are surprisingly high-functioning: -\n\nThey can deploy code up to 30 times more frequently than their competitors, and 50 percent lesser of their deployments fail.\nWith all this goodness, you would be thinking that there must be lots of DevOps engineers out there. However, just 18% of survey respondents in the survey said someone in their organization actually held this title. Why is that? Partly, it is because defining what a  DevOps engineers can do is still in flux. Although, That is not stopping companies from hiring for DevOps skills. On LinkedIn, people's mentioning of DevOps as a skill has seen a rise of 50 percent over the past few years. A survey revealed the same trend:\nHalf of about 4,000-plus respondents (in more than 90 countries) said their companies are considering DevOps skills while hiring.\n\nWhat are DevOps skills?\nThe survey identified the top three skill areas for DevOps staff:\nCoding or scripting\nProcess re-engineering\nCommunicating and collaborating with others\nThe above-mentioned skills point to a growing recognition, that software isn’t written in the old stereotypical way anymore. Where software was written from scratch using a highly complex and lengthy process. Also, creating new products is now a matter of selecting open source components and binding them together with code. The complexity of today’s software lies less in the programming, and more in ensuring that the new software works over a diverse set of operating systems. Making it platform independent right away. Same way, testing and deployment are now done at a much more frequency. That is, they can be more often— if developers start communicating more early and regularly with the operations team, and also if, operations people bring their knowledge of the production environment to design of testing and staging environment.\n\nWhat is a DevOps engineer, anyway? And should anyone hire them?\nThere’s no formal cliched career track for kickstarting your career as a DevOps engineer. They are maybe developers who get interested in deployment and network operations, they might be sysadmins who have an affinity for scripting and coding. Whatever world they are from, these are people who have pushed themselves out of their comfort zone of their defined areas of competence and who have a more holistic view of their technical environments.\nDevOps engineers are a quite elite group, so it’s not astonishing that we found a smaller number of companies creating that title. Kelsey Hightower, head of operations at Puppet Labs, described these people as the “Special Forces” in an organization. “The DevOps engineer encapsulates depth of knowledge and years of hands-on experience,” Kelsey says, “You’re battle tested. This person blends the skills of the business analyst with the technical chops to build the solution - plus they know the business well, and can look at how any issue affects the entire company.\nSo, in a nutshell, DevOps provides you lots of career opportunities and companies are ACTUALLY hiring DevOps engineers.\n******************************************************************************\nObject-Oriented Programming:-\nObject-Oriented Programming or commonly called OOPs is\nThere are 5 basic concepts of OOPs. Let's have a closer look at each of them.\n\n1. Abstraction\nThis is the property of OOPs which refers to the act of representing only the essential details and hiding\nthe background data. Consider a car as your object. You are told that if you apply the brakes, the vehicle\nstops. The background details, like the mechanism how the fluid runs through, the brake shoes stopping\nthe wheel, etc. are hidden from you. This is what abstraction is. Abstraction is the advantage that you\nget from Object Oriented Programming over Procedural Oriented Programming.\n\n2. Encapsulation\nThe process of binding characteristics and behavior in a single unit is simply known as\nLet's get back to our previous example of a car. In a car, we have a steering that helps to change the direction, we have brakes to stop the car, we have a music system to listen to music, etc. These all units are capsuled (or ENcapsuled) under a single unit called CAR. Like objects, each unit has its own\ncharacteristics as well as behavior.\nIt is a common observation that a class encapsulates objects of the similar kind under a single unit.\n\n3. Modularity\nModularity is the feature of Object Oriented Programming that allows us to break a bigger problem in\nsmaller chunks and assemble it together, later. For an instance, during the manufacturing of a car, parts\nare constructed separately. Like there is a unit that makes the engine, a unit makes the outer body, a\nunit makes the interior, etc. Later on, all the parts are assembled at one place. This way, a big problem is divided into small chunks and handled easily.\nIn Object Oriented Programming, Modularity is implemented by functions.\n\n4. Inheritance\nInheritance is the capability of a class to inherit the properties of some other class. For an example,\nconsider CAR as a class. Now let's take TOYOTA, NISSAN, SWIFT, HYUNDAI, etc. as some other class.\nThese classes will have them some individual properties but they will inherit some of their properties\nfrom the class CAR. Like moving on applying accelerator, stopping when brakes are applied, etc.\nThe inheriting class is called the subclass whereas the inherited class is called base class. In the above\nexample, CAR is the base class and others are a subclass.\n\n5. Polymorphism\nThe act of existing in more than one form\nLets again get back to our example of cars. Consider a class called HYUNDAI. The HYUNDAI class has an\nobject i10. Now there can be many cars with the name i10, but they have a unique identification. (\neither by their registration number or engine number, we are not concerned here about that)\nIn an Object Oriented Programming language, there can be many functions with the same name but\nthey should be of different parameters.\nSo now you know, the 5 pillars of Object Oriented Programming.\nHappy coding!\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nDevOps For Dummies- A Wiley Brand\nis an IBM limited edition written by Sanjeev Sharma\nand Bernie Coyne. Earlier it was written only by Sanjeev Sharma alone, but in the latest third edition,\nBernie Coyne co-authored the book. This is a book for the people interested in DevOps. It takes you\nfrom beginner to advanced level. The book is available in the form of electronic media i.e. e-book. The\nfree of cost book comes from IBM.\nGo to the link above and fill in your details, and you will get the download link of your copy.\nLet's take a look at the book's features:\nCover Page:-\nIt is often said, don't judge a book by its cover. But we humans are very much stubborn\nand the cover matters the most for the readers, as it lures them towards itself. The cover page for\nDevOps for dummies is a mixture of Black, blue and yellow color; with an animated geeky face outline.\nAt the top, IBM logo resides with its full dignity. The middle right half of the page covers the main\noutlines of the book:\n\n\nThe business needs and value of DevOps.\nDevOps capabilities and adoption path.\nHow Cloud accelerates DevOps.\nTable Of Content:-\nNext, as we turn over the \"virtual pages\" comes the table of content. This gives\nan overview of what you are going to learn from this book. There are chapter names with their\nsubtopics under them. The chapter names are as follows:-\n\n1.What is DevOps?\n2.Looking at DevOps capabilities.\n3.Adopting DevOps.\n4.Looking at how cloud accelerates DevOps.\n5.Using DevOps to solve new challenges.\n6.Making DevOps work: IBM's Story.\n7.Ten DevOps myths.\n\nIntroduction:-\nNext, comes in the introduction part.\nIn the first line, the meaning of DevOps with its expanded form of Development and Operations is\nexplained. Everyone talks about it, but not everyone is familiar with it. In a nutshell, DevOps is an\napproach based on lean and agile principles in which business owners and the development, operations,\nand quality assurance departments collaborate to deliver software in a continuous manner. The further\nlines tell about the IBM's broad and holistic view towards DevOps.\nThe book tells what a true DevOps approach includes:\nLines of business, practitioners, executives, partners, suppliers, and so on.\nAbout the book:-\nThe about the book section gives an overview of the book.\nThe book takes a business-centric approach to DevOps. Today’s rapidly advancing world makes DevOps essential to all enterprises that should be agile and lean enough to respond rapidly to the changes such as customer demands, market conditions, competitive pressures, or regulatory requirements.\nIt is assumed that, if you are reading this book, you’ve heard about DevOps but want to understand\nwhat it means and how your company can gain business benefits from it. This book is targeted for\nexecutives, decision-makers, and practitioners who are new to the DevOps, seeking info about the\napproach, who want to go through the hype surrounding the concept to reach t",

These containers are platform independent and can be executed on any host which runs a Linux kernel.\nDocker is one of the hottest tools in the market right now as a lot of teams have learned how to use it to break up their large, monolithic applications into smaller and more manageable units - often called microservices. This has allowed development teams to work on microservices independently and package it into a container once it is ready.\nDocker has also eased the pain of DevOps teams who often need to manage the deployment processes and environments - since containers can run independently of each other, they can simply focus on deploying containers rather than worrying about dependencies for each application.\nContainer orchestration tools such as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes have made it very easy to deploy microservices to a cluster and scale them according to demand.\nFor these reasons, Docker is a technology which you need to know if you're an app developer or DevOps engineer.\nThis course introduces you to all the main concepts of Docker, and focuses on getting you up and running with the tool in all the lab sections. The main topics of this course include:\nImages: Templates to define your container\nContainers: What they are and how Docker helps you create them\nStorage: Volumes, Bind Mounts and tmpfs to manage data in containers\nNetworks: Regulate connectivity to your containers whether on individual hosts or in a cluster\nDocker Swarm: The built-in container orchestration tool\nDocker EE, UCP and DTR: The enterprise offerings of Docker\nHope you enjoy the course!",

      "description": "Modern integrated development environments or IDEs in short allows us to perform miracles. Why? Because we live in the twenty first century and modern computers are so powerful that modern IDEs become indispensable assistants which can save us thousands of hours. A decade ago, no one could imagine how much powerful IDEs will become in the future. However, nowadays, developers are armed by super powers such as deep static analysis, automatically performed refactorings, code fixes, super simple navigation and many other things.\nWant to become an iron developer? Then listen to me.\nThis course consists of two main parts. The first one concerns the features of bear visual studio without any super-powerful plugins and  it covers:\nNavigate through the code base: how to select code, how to find code, camel humps in IntelliSense, navigating through the tabs\nEdit and format the code base: deleting and removing code, formatting, commenting and applying refactorings\nRun and debug your code: working with breakpoints, new features of modern visual studio, different debugging windows\nCode snippets: existing code snippets and creating custom code snippets\nExtensions for Visual Studio: Color VS Output, NCrunch, PInvoke, .NET Portability Analyzer, Roslynator\nThe second part is dedicated to ReSharper (R#). R# is one of the flagship tools developed by JetBrains. I need to warn you that R# is a paid tool but despite of this fact, the majority of professional developers use it on an everyday basis.\nR# is a Visual Studio plugin which empowers it by tons of refactorings, analytical features, fixes and a ton of other features. So, the second part is dedicated to R# and it covers:\nInstalling R#\nR# Settings\nCreating Code with R#\nExploring Code with R#\nRefactoring with R#\nUnit Testing with R#\nR# Annotations\nThis is only an introduction to R#. I’ll update this course from time to time teaching you other cool features provided by R#.\nEnroll and start learning how to double your coding speed in bear Visual Studio and Visual Studio empowered by R#!",

If you are a Udemy Business user, please check with your employer before downloading software. Any recent Kubernetes installation will be suitable, but Docker Desktop is recommended).\nKubernetes is one of the hottest topics right now, and engineers with Kubernetes skills are in big demand.\nGet those skills with this course! It's is a great chance to work on a real Kubernetes project, and to get yourself to a high professional standard on real projects.\nAll the way through the course you'll be working on realistic requirements - but you don't need to be a coder or know any particular programming language - I've prepared for you a set of Docker images, and your job is to use Kubernetes to get these images running.\nThe system is a Microservice-based architecture, and along the way, we'll look at design decisions and trade-offs you need to make when managing these complex systems. Note the course isn't about how to design Microservices (although we'll certainly be talking about that); the development work is done and we need to get the system running on a production cluster.\nWe'll also discover that the developers have made some bad mistakes in their code, by analyzing the run time performance of the cluster!\nYou can do the first part of the course on your local development computer (PC/Mac/Laptop). The second part (from Chapter 13 onwards) moves to the cloud. You'll use a real AWS account, and we go-ahead to set up monitoring with the ELK/Elastic Stack and monitor with Prometheus and Grafana.\nThe course now supports EKS, the AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service, but we also show how to use the alternative system, called Kops. The pros and cons of each are explained in detail.\nI've designed this course for a wide audience - whether you're a DevOps engineer, a developer, or if you're quite new to the whole field, I'll explain everything along the way. Just some basic knowledge of working with computers, and maybe a bit of command-line experience will suffice.\nYou will need an AWS account for a part of the course if you want to work on the system yourself. If you're new to AWS then don't worry, I've got you covered -but Amazon will charge you for running the system (as with all/most cloud providers). Expect to pay no more than around 10USD for this (this is a safe overestimate), but you are expected to manage this spend yourself and you must delete your Kubernetes cluster at the end of your session. Don't let that put you off, it's a great investment.\nYou can absolutely just watch the AWS videos if you'd prefer not to incur these costs - you will still learn plenty!\nAs always, I'm here to answer questions and I aim to respond within 48 hours.\nGood luck!",

Most companies today realize that the practices of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) will yield tremendous benefits like increased business revenue and faster time-to-market. The demand for these skills has been steadily rising over the last few years.\n\n\nThere are a plethora of tools available in the CI/CD/DevOps landscape today. Implementing continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment with these tools and frameworks can help us immensely in modernizing our software development lifecycle. It catches us bugs early and increases the quality of our software products. This, in turn, reduces the overall cost for software development in startups and enterprise alike.\n\n\nBut before getting into tools and frameworks, it is important that you get a holistic picture of CI / CD and DevOps. For this, you need to understand where we started from - the old school traditional software development cycle. We will pick holes in the old model, identify pain points and learn how CI / CD and DevOps evolved, one step at a time. Once you build a rock solid foundation using this course, you can move on to more specific tool oriented courses.\n\n\nIf you are thinking about moving on to CI/CD/DevOps from your old school software development model, this course is for you. Well illustrated with animations to help you grasp a clear understanding of the underlying principles. Once you complete this course, you can take on bigger challenges related to implementation.\n\n\nThe demand for professionals who have experience with CI/CD/DevOps has been growing steadily over the last few years. The salaries for these skills have gone through the roof and are only bound to go up as the demand for these skills increases. Professionals with CI / CD / DevOps skill set can demand as much as $150K as their yearly compensation as per latest US job and salary surveys. And this is where you start!",

Jenkins X handles the job of configuring Kubernetes to build, test, and deploy your applications, so you can focus on fast delivery and make your applications great!\nKubernetes is powerful but complicated; using it not only to run your application but also to build and test it requires a lot of configuration. Jenkins X provides automation for Kubernetes so you can use it to its full potential without spending all of your time configuring and debugging.\nThis course adopts a step-by-step approach to show you how to use Jenkins X, with plenty of hands-on examples that you can use for your own applications. You'll start with a simple example application deployed to Kubernetes using Jenkins X, then build up to awesome features such as preview environments, promotion, and monitoring. With this course, you can learn Jenkins X fast, and immediately apply what you've learned.\nAbout the Author\nAlan Hohn is a Lockheed Martin Fellow with experience teaching DevOps, cloud, and Agile. He loves to combine examples and explanation to make technology clear. He has written multiple guides to Kubernetes and has taught numerous classes on using Kubernetes for containerized microservice architectures.
