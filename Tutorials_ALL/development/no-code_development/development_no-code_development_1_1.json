Decisions are made as to what should be constructed based on NYC Zoning and other city regulations. Meeting attendees ask questions as to why, for example, there is no parking in the building. Why do most buildings have studios and single-bedroom apartments? And, how decisions are made about the building uses? Most of these questions are answered by knowing what zoning regulates and how decisions are made toward its uses.\n\n\nThis course is an overview of how those decisions are made and what to look for when deciding the building's use. The course uses a site in the South Bronx to know what can be constructed on the site. This course is for students who are interested in knowing what zoning regulates.\nThe courses use a Bronx lot as a case study on how to use zoning to provide housing and resources to the community. It is broken down into two sections. What information and sketches are required in a site plan? What is the site and what are the surrounding structures of the site? A basic overview of what to look for when deciding the use of the building.",

      "description": "The Caro-Kann Defense is a chess opening that has earned its reputation as one of the most dependable and strategic choices for players at all levels. Originating from the analyses of Horatio Caro and Marcus Kann in the late 19th century, this opening has been a staple in the repertoire of many top players, including World Champions like Anatoly Karpov and Mikhail Botvinnik. The Caro-Kann is characterized by its solid pawn structure, typically arising after 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5, where Black aims to exchange the d-pawn for White’s e-pawn. This trade leads to a robust setup with pawns on c6 and e6, providing Black with a solid and enduring position that is notoriously difficult for White to break down.\n\n\nOne of the key reasons the Caro-Kann is so highly regarded is its strategic flexibility. Unlike more rigid openings, the Caro-Kann allows Black to adapt their play based on White’s responses. Whether choosing a solid formation with e6 or opting for a more aggressive approach with an early c5 pawn break, Black has the tools to steer the game into favorable channels. This adaptability not only makes the Caro-Kann suitable for various playing styles but also means that it can transpose into different structures, keeping the opponent guessing and allowing for rich, complex middlegame positions.\n\n\nMoreover, the Caro-Kann is not just about passive defense; it offers plenty of opportunities for counterattacking play. While Black initially focuses on establishing a solid foundation, the opening also sets the stage for dynamic play, especially when White overextends or fails to seize the initiative. The ability to smoothly develop pieces and control key central squares often leads to powerful counterattacks, giving Black the chance to turn the tables and launch their own offensive.\n\n\nAnother significant advantage of the Caro-Kann is its relatively low maintenance in terms of theoretical preparation. Unlike the heavily analyzed Sicilian Defense, for example, the Caro-Kann’s principles are more straightforward and can be understood through clear strategic concepts rather than requiring the memorization of extensive move sequences. This makes it a practical choice for players who want to invest in an opening that offers both reliability and ease of study.\n\n\nThe enduring success of the Caro-Kann at the highest levels of chess speaks to its effectiveness. It has been a trusted weapon for many of the world’s strongest players and continues to be relevant in modern chess. Its combination of solidity, strategic depth, and counterattacking potential makes the Caro-Kann Defense a great opening for anyone looking to build a strong foundation while keeping their options open for dynamic play.",

      "description": "Hello there and welcome to my new course! This course is sponsored by Editor X.\nFor those of you who are not familiar with Editor X, Editor X is basically a web application or an advanced creation platform for designers and web professionals. Editor X combines cutting edge responsive design with relatively easy and smooth drag and drop experience. With Editor X you can design and build almost any website you imagine. It's possible to design and build beautiful websites without any experience with Web development whatsoever!\nEditor X allows you to build fully responsive websites that automatically scale to any screen size or device they are being viewed on to deliver the  best user experience. Using the latest design technology like flexible grids, layouts, fluid sizing and breakpoint customization, you can ensure that your site looks exactly how you want on various different screen sizes.\nAlso Editor X has quite clean and intuitive interface which will allow us to easily navigate between many different tools, features, categories, panels and that way keep our focus primarily on building our website.\n\n\nNow we are going to start this course by completely introducing with almost every Editor X tool and feature. You'll get familiar with it's design interface, canvas, shortcuts, compositions and all other components which are essential for one website to be responsive and good looking.\nYou'll see in action how Flexbox technology can help us apply responsiveness to our website. Flexbox is a CSS container created around elements to ensure they're automatically arranged depending on screen size. It's a helpful tool in responsive design that prevents things from getting messy, like when elements overlap or change their order. The most useful Flexbox technology tools are Layouters and Repeaters. They will automatically adjust your content to every screen size without even thinking about breakpoints.\n\n\nAfter that I will introduce you to the Content Manager. And it's main purpose is to act as a database on the backend. With content manager we can create something that's called a collection, and a collection is basically a data table which can contain different types of information in the form of rows and columns. There we can put images, links, text video, audio, document and many other different types of data.\nWe can use Content manager to display that data to our website or ever gather some information from our visitors through the forms, where users can write some information and send them directly to our backend inside a collection.\nYou will learn how to apply beautiful and smooth animations and hover interactions to a website as well. Also we are going to explore an app market where we can search and find many different useful applications which are available on Editor X platform. Those applications can be installed on our website in just a click within a few seconds. And Like I said there you can find many different apps but some of the most popular ones are for building a blog, forum or even an online store on your website. In this course I have explained everything you need to know about it.\n\n\nAnd there's more! At the end of this course, when we cover everything you need to know about building websites with Editor X, we are going to start working on a real project, where we are going to design and build our own website from scratch!\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for, let's get started!",

However most people assume that this is the domain of computer experts with years of experience. Sure, that’s the case if you’re trying to create a complex website with special links to other business systems. However for most of these 137,000 businesses this is not what they need, which means that if you have the right tools and some simple training you can tap into this huge business opportunity.\nIn this course we will show you how to use one of the easiest to use website design tools, Weebly, for creating websites. I’ve been creating websites for years, but I wanted to see if my daughter, who is new to this could also do it, and in no time she had her own business up and running. Together we will show you how you can easily create websites for businesses. The best part is that the income you earn is annuity income – that means you create the website once, but the customer keeps paying you, because after all they don’t want to lose their website.\nSo, join us to learn how easy it is, without any coding skills or any previous experience, to setup professional websites for businesses that will not only impress them, but set you up in your own home-based business!\n\"Craig is possibly one of the most interesting presenters I have encountered.

Creating a website is hard!\nThis course is for you.\nThis course is designed to help you walk away with an attractive 4-5 page brochure website (which includes a contact form) - no artistic / technical ability needed.\nWe will be using the Squarespace platform, which is the most turnkey and user-friendly DIY website creation platform.\nMy class is very different in two big ways:\nRather than simply showing you how to do things (e.g. how to add text, pictures, a form, etc.) - much of the course is designed to teach you my framework to help you learn the basics of thinking like a web designer and helping you envision your perfect website.

      "description": "You must already know about ChatGPT and Microsoft 365 Copilot by now. But did you know that you can create your own copilots through Copilot Studio? You can build own your own copilots that can be trained on your knowledge base and perform actions on your behalf with Copilot Studio. You can deploy them internally on Teams, or externally on a website or social media apps (like Facebook). This can all be done through Copilot Studio.\n\n\nNote, Copilot Studio was previously called Power Virtual Agents.\n\n\nMicrosoft built Copilot Studio as a way for knowledge professionals to leverage Generative AI for personalized use-cases. Imagine creating a chatbot that your customers can use to place orders, that your vendors can use to process receipts, that your employees can use to get relevant information.\n\n\nThink of it as ChatGPT that you can control for your specific use-cases.\n\n\nMicrosoft Copilot Studio enables everyone to build sophisticated copilots to leverage Generative AI.\n\n\nLearn from more than 11 hours of relevant instructional video content, with the only course that will teach you how to build copilots with Microsoft Copilot Studio. We even create two full copilots and chatbots from scratch.\n\n\nWhat is this course all about?\nThis course teaches you how to build your own personalized copilot using Microsoft Copilot Studio. You will learn how to be more productive with your own custom copilot, that you can deploy internally to your employees or externally to your vendors.

It functions like ChatGPT, but with access to all your data—including emails, files, meeting notes, chats, and more—and integrates seamlessly into your preferred work applications.\n\n\nWhat is Microsoft Copilot Studio?\nMicrosoft Copilot Studio is a no-code extensible platform that enables anyone to create custom copilots. It's an end-to-end AI platform to create customized copilots for your business, which can recall your data and even perform actions. Once it's built, it can be published anywhere (Teams, Website, Facebook, and more). It was previously called Power Virtual Agents.\n\n\nWhat will you learn?\nBuild your own copilots - use Copilot Studio to build copilots from scratch with a fully custom no-code platform that leverages conversational design logic, LLMs, Generative AI, and other technologies.\nIntegrate data, knowledge, and actions - Use Copilot Studio to create a copilot that can read data from uploaded documents, SharePoint, OneDrive, website data, and more.\nLearn advanced copilot developer topics - this course includes full lessons on entities, variables, and other complex topics\nBuild two full copilots - we apply everything that we learn and build two full copilots from scratch (an internal HR service bot and an external customer service bot).\nProductivity superstar - Microsoft Copilot Studio is a productivity game changer, as it enables you to create a personalized copilot that can leverage Generative AI to recall knowledge or call actions.\n\n\nWhy choose this course?\nComplete guide - this is the 100% start to finish, zero to hero, basic to advanced guide on Microsoft Copilot Studio. There is no other course like it that teaches you everything from start to finish. It contains over 11 hours of instructional content!\nStructured to succeed - this course is structured to help you succeed. We go through two in-depth streams (Copilot Studio Builder and Copilot Studio Developer), followed by building two full chatbot and copilot examples.\nFully instructional - we not only go through important concepts, but also apply them as we are building our application so that we can solidify them. This is not only a walkthrough of the all the features and theoretical concepts, but a course that actually uses real-life examples and integrates workflows with you.\nStep by step - we go through every single concept one-by-one. This improves your probabilities of learning this Copilot Studio rather than going haphazardly through each feature.\nTeacher response - if there's anything else you would like to learn, or if there's something you cannot figure out, I'm here for you!

And as, it is on Udemy, you can watch and complete this course at your convenience.\nIn this course, we will go through all the topics of the Pega right from the beginning like Downloading the Pega software, first-time login, application creation, and till creating the package and deploying it. This course will also include advanced topics like Integration and Background Processing as well. The course content has been designed with the topics from CSA and CSSA courses.\nThis course is totally practical-based. The intention is to provide the complete practical knowledge so that anyone can immediately start working on any Pega Development project after completing this course.\nNot only this, it will help you to clear your concepts which will help you to clear the CSA and CSSA certifications.\nI have designed and updated this course based on my experience and the feedback I have received so far.\nAt the moment, its necessary to learn both Traditional UI & latest Constellation UI. This course starts with Traditional UI Development in Pega 8.6 with the help of Personal edition. Pega 8.6 is great starting point to learn pega. In this course, we will go through all the basic of Pega. Later on, you will find the updates on the further version, App build on KYC app, Interview Preparation.

This course is rooted in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, widely considered the most effective and systematic fighting methodology ever conceived, and it’s structured to give you the full spectrum of control, from standing positions to final submissions. Volume 1 dives into the essential skills for the standing position, addressing the most common ways an assailant may try to grab or harm you. Not only will you learn to defend these attacks, but you’ll also master a unique, never-before-seen self-defense takedown system—complete with ukemi, the art of falling safely without injury, a skill that alone can save lives.\nVolume 2 moves to the guard play and passing phase. If you’re on the ground, this section ensures you’re prepared to win from the bottom, or if you’ve landed a takedown, to pass through to the top position seamlessly. Here, we start maximizing control with Volume 3—the positional control phase—where I reveal the most effective methods for holding dominant positions that keep everyone safe. Plus, you’ll learn powerful escapes if you find yourself on the other side of the situation.\nFinally, Volume 4 brings it all together with an elegant finish: transitioning seamlessly from control to submission and restraint. You’ll master the application of the Rear Naked Choke, Kimura, and handcuffing procedures, learning to neutralize the threat in a controlled, safe way. This course isn’t just another self-defense class; it’s a structured, real-world approach used by law enforcement to overcome life-and-death scenarios. Enroll now, and gain access to knowledge that will set you apart and keep you safe.",

Amazon offers the largest selection of products and some of the best commission rates for affiliates. It’s also open to just about anyone in the world, regardless of your physical location. Another great feature of this business model, is that it’s infinitely scalable. You can start by selling just a few products a week, and easily scale to selling thousands. Once your store is set up, it requires nearly no maintenance. If you’re interested in building passive income streams, this is about as close as you’ll get.\nThe course starts with an introduction into the benefits of joining the Amazon Affiliate network. From there, you’ll learn to build a fully customized online store, using WordPress, WooCommerce, Elementor and the WooZone Plugin.

You can use the free Carrd account for your website hosting and domain. It is however recommended that you get the Pro plan for $19 (what I use in this course). This gives you access to better templates and features required for capturing emails / making more powerful websites.\nYou may also want to buy a custom domain which costs around $10 depending on the domain name you use.\nDid you really make this in 1 hour?\nYes, I did it all in one sitting in 1 hour. I cut out boring, repetitive bits for your sake. I have done this process in 30 mins many times.\nWhy did you focus on doing it quickly? Didn’t you rush things?\nBecause done is better than not finished. Too many people never achieve their business goals because they are waiting for their work to be perfect. A website can never be perfect and there is never a perfect time. So we focus on having a finished version, even if it isn’t perfect.\nSo once you finish the course and publish your website, you can and should edit it to make it better.",

Once you understand the tools and the platforms, you'll be able to launch in less than a day. Plus, you'll be able to make tweaks and changes to your site and see them go live instantly.\n\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar?\nDo you want to know how to build and publish a website, but you don't know how to start?\nWould you love to create something unique and make it available for people to see?\nAre you getting ready to launch something big?\nDo you want to create a website that will help you collect leads in the days and weeks leading up to your big reveal?\nDo you wish there was a way to launch a production-ready website with little to no money?\nAre you overwhelmed with too many choices for building and hosting your web project?\n\n\nThe hardest part about launching a website is getting started. So many tiny decisions to make. It's easy to get overwhelmed. But, I've narrowed everything down, and curated the best services and resources to help you launch your new landing page in about an hour.\nAfter completing this course, you'll have a stunning landing page under your own custom domain name with a form to capture email addresses from your customers giving you time to map out your full website strategy. You'll also learn how to use the powerful combination of Gitlab Continuous Integration and Netlify to automatically publish updates to your site any time you make changes. The principles in this course can be learned and repeated to help launch similar sites quickly.\n\n\nAfter completing this course, you will...\nbe able to publish a simple but beautiful one-page website optimized for SEO on your own custom domain name\nbe equipped with a simple form that collects email addresses from guests on your website\nbe setup with everything you need to launch a teaser or \"coming soon\" style landing page for your next big project\n\n\nStill not convinced?\nI've been developing websites for over 20 years. I've tried SO many different platforms: WordPress, Drupal, Concrete, Yii, Sharepoint, Shopify... way too many. I have also built very intricate custom solutions for myself, for my clients, and for my employers. I've used React, Angular, PHP, C#, Go, Python... you get the idea. I haven't tried everything, but I've tried a lot.\nWhat I discovered along the way is that a lot of people overbuild and overpay on projects. I started looking for a way to get my clients what they wanted without committing to pricy monthly contracts and hefty development costs up front. I encouraged them to consider launching lean and building iteratively on top of that initial launch. In the midst of that pursuit, I found that many service providers like Netlify offer a very generous free service tier that can sustain most of my clients for months.\nImagine launching with almost no out of pocket costs up front. Then, as your site grows and evolves you can gradually increase your costs to match your revenue and your traffic. I did some simple math and found that for a one-page website like we're building in this course, the Netlify free tier would allow my clients to serve thousands of visitors on the website each month. And recently, Netlify added their painless forms integration service into their free tier, allowing up to 100 submissions per month (at least, that's the limit as I'm writing this). When you combine Netlify with Gitlab -- who now allows free private git repos so that you store your website's code securely -- you can automate the tedious process of making changes to code, tracking who made them, and publishing them to your site.\nMuch of what I show you in this course is a blueprint for how I solve the same problems for my employer. That's the real value of this course. The simple one-page website and lead collector won't solve all your problems. It's just a placeholder as you prepare to launch your next project. But, what I'm teaching you is my process for launching lightning fast static websites using tools that make it deceivingly simple for FREE! If you pay attention, you'll be able to extrapolate from this course a reproducible methodology for launching more complex websites.\n\n\nNeed some urgency?\nEvery minute that you spend wasting time thinking about what you could do with your website, your customers are slipping through your fingers. While you're busy thinking, put your website to work capturing leads for you. I've done all the work to curate the perfect template and a combination of services that let you launch your landing page with little to no cost.",

This setup enables organizations to take advantage of both traditional infrastructure and modern cloud capabilities, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and enhanced security. As businesses continue their digital transformation journeys, hybrid AD environments provide a practical bridge between legacy systems and cloud adoption.\nOne of the key benefits of a hybrid AD environment is improved security. Azure AD introduces features like Conditional Access, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Identity Protection, which enhance the overall security posture without requiring a complete migration to the cloud. These features help organizations better control access to resources based on user behavior, device health, and location, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Moreover, hybrid environments support business continuity and gradual migration strategies. Instead of fully shifting to the cloud, businesses can migrate users, workloads, and applications in phases.\nHybrid Active Directory environments offer a powerful, flexible solution for organizations transitioning to the cloud. By leveraging both on-premises AD and Azure AD, companies can optimize their IT infrastructure, enhance security, and ensure a smoother path to digital modernization. With proper management and strategic planning, a hybrid AD approach can provide the best of both worlds.",

Put it on in front of your children. Dr. Loveless cares about learning most of all and is actually an electrical engineer, so he knows a little bit and that shows in this video series.\n\n\nThese are hard coding exercises that are not scripted, they are performed from experience. IF a problem arises, we solve it in real time.\n\n\nBest Wishes and the 'IsValid?' method is completely viable to complete majorly complicated feats and tasks with if you so choose to learn it.\n\n\nWhat is 'IsValid?' ?\n\n\nIf an object is valid, it is available to be acted upon.\n\n\nWhy is that so important? Look inside and see what you can do.\n\n\nThanks for being there to watch the videos, I shot this one from an exotic location and no I am not on a luxury vacation right now, but there is some noise in the background at least a couple times or once that I heard during revision.\n\n\nMy normal microphone (Astro A40, Mixamp Pro) is at home right now.\n\n\nI will be getting a new computer soon for development so stay tuned for more videos if you like them.\n\n\nBest Wishes and Many More to Come,\n\n\nDr. Loveless",

If you want more pleased customers, you should implement chatbots in your business. this course will help you to build your own chatbot for your business without or with less coding. in this course we are using Google DialogFlow platform for building chatbots.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Chatbot ?\nA Chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a  real person. so if you heard of Siri, IBM Watson, Google Allo, etc. The basic problem that these bots try to solve is to become an intermediary and help users become more productive. They do this by allowing the user to worry less about how information will be retrieved and about the input format that may be needed to attain specific data.\nor simply we can say that Chatbot is an assistant that communicates with us through text messages, a virtual companion that integrates into websites, applications or instant messengers and helps entrepreneurs to get closer to customers.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Google DialogFlow ?\nDialogflow is a natural language understanding platform that makes it easy to design and integrate a conversational user interface  into your mobile app, web application, device, bot, interactive voice response system, and so on. Using Dialogflow you can provide new and engaging ways for users to interact with your product. Dialogflow can analyze multiple types of input from your customers, including text or audio inputs (like from a phone or voice recording).  It can also respond to your customers in a couple of ways, either through text or with synthetic speech.\n\n\n\n\nThis course is divided in to different parts\n\n\n0. Course Introduction : In this section we are going to introduce the course, also we are going to talk about course requirements.\n1.

Simple Restaurant Chatbot:  In this section we are going to build a simple restaurant chatbot.\n6. Backend REST API for ChatBot: In this section we build Backend REST API with Django and Django REST Framework, and after that we integrate that with our DialogFlow Chatbot.\n7. Firebase Integration for ChatBot: In this section we integrate our Chatbot with Firebase Real Time Database.\n8. Crypto Currency Finder ChatBot: In here we create a simple Crypto Currency Finder ChatBot, we will use an external API for this section.\n9. Human Hand Off: In here we build a simple human handoff functionality, for example if the chatbot does not handle about the issue that you are asking, than after a few attempts it will hand over the chat to human agent.",

      "description": "Think of an AI that can talk to anything on the web!? This comprehensive course teaches you Model Context Protocol (MCP) - the revolutionary standard that's changing how AI models connect to real-world systems.\nThink of MCP as USB-C for AI. Just like USB-C standardized how devices connect to each other, MCP provides a standardized way for AI models like Claude to connect to APIs, databases, tools, and services. Instead of building custom integrations for every AI model and every tool (the dreaded M × N problem), MCP lets you build once and connect everywhere.\nHere's the challenge most developers face: modern AI models are incredibly powerful, but out of the box, they're like super-smart brains with no arms or legs. They can think brilliantly, but they can't actually do anything in the real world. If you want them to pull data from GitHub, update a Slack channel, or query your company database, you end up writing mountains of glue code, custom APIs, and authentication layers - and you have to do this over and over for every model and every tool.\nMCP solves this elegantly. It's an open standard that gives AI models a structured, secure way to connect with tools, services, and real-time data. Once you implement MCP, your model and tools can talk to each other without reinventing the wheel. Whether it's Claude, another AI model, or an internal chatbot, once it supports MCP, it can use any tool that also supports MCP.\nThis course is built around hands-on learning. You won't just learn concepts - you'll build real, working MCP servers that AI models can use immediately. We start with understanding the fundamental architecture: clients (AI models), servers (your tools), and capabilities (the actions they can perform). Then we dive straight into building.\nYou'll create your first MCP-compliant server using Python and FastAPI, implementing proper HTTP methods and capability schemas. We'll explore real-world examples by examining .well-known/mcp.json files from popular platforms like GitHub, Slack, and Notion. You'll see exactly how these companies expose their functionality to AI models through standardized interfaces.\nThe hands-on lab is where everything comes together. You'll build a complete task tracker API with full CRUD operations, proper data validation, and OpenAPI documentation. This isn't a toy example - it's a production-ready server that demonstrates real-world patterns you'll use in your own projects.\nIntegration is where the magic happens. You'll connect your MCP server to Claude, test it with development tools, and see your AI assistant actually using your custom tools. We'll cover multi-tool management, fallback strategies, and how to handle complex workflows that span multiple services.\nSecurity isn't an afterthought - it's essential. You'll implement API key authentication, OAuth integration, CORS configuration, and rate limiting. You'll learn how to protect your endpoints from abuse while maintaining the seamless experience that makes MCP so powerful.\nFinally, you'll master the debugging and troubleshooting skills that separate professional developers from beginners. We'll cover systematic approaches to common issues, performance monitoring, and deployment strategies for cloud platforms.\nThis course positions you at the forefront of AI development. Every organization will need professionals who can bridge the gap between AI capabilities and existing systems. The skills you learn here - building standardized AI tool integrations - will only become more valuable as AI adoption accelerates across industries.\nWhether you're building internal AI assistants that need company database access, creating chatbots that interact with multiple services, or developing AI-powered automation that spans different platforms, this course gives you the standardized framework to make it happen reliably and securely.\nBy the end, you'll have built multiple MCP servers from scratch, connected them to Claude, and deployed secure, production-ready integrations. More importantly, you'll understand the architectural decisions that make some integrations robust while others fail in production. This isn't just about learning a protocol - it's about unlocking the full potential of AI in your organization.",

Many people still use plain PDFs, images, or unformatted chat messages that get outdated quickly and are not exciting.\ni-o. fun/udemy\nACCESS THIS COURSE FOR FREE ! No joke, go to the web address above to access all of the learning materials for no cost at all. Why? I want more websites made with Docusaurus, and I figured. Understandable information should be publicly available. The new version is mostly text since I realized students are more likely to ACT if they read instead of watch. The new free version also includes a slightly improved workflow (use Codespaces instead of CodeSandbox).\n\n\nThe software's essential part is its documentation. Google, Facebook, and other big tech companies have well-structured and outstanding docs designed to share knowledge. Why don't we mimic the best?\nThe docs are so crucial that Facebook released its internal software called Docusaurus to open-source (made it free to use) so that everyone can present their knowledge with a high stacontinuously always available online:\n\n\nthey look readable on a device of any size,\nsupport many languages with a click of a button,\nand offer appropriate information for each software version (e.g., Hasura has version dropdown `v2.x` at the top).\nA structured sidebar allows jumping between sections,\nand the content has many formatting options to draw the reader's attention to important parts. One can even insert YouTube videos, maps, or other embeddable content for a better illustration\n\n\nIt's unsurprising if you haven't heard about Docusaurus before, as only developers have used it for other developers\nIn this course, we want to show how to make a wiki website using Docusaurus. Its motto is \"Build optimized websites quickly, focus on your content.\" Combining this philosophy with handy tools like CodeSandbox requires zero coding knowledge to make his Docusaurus website\n\n\nBy completing the lectures:\nYou'll know how to host and version your content on GitHub\nMake use of CodeSandbox to edit and preview the changes in real-time\nUse Vercel to deliver the content as a website with your customized domain name\nAdditionally, your website will be FREE to make and FREE to host! Contrary to many other website builders like famous WordPress, Docusaurus doesn't need a \"server.\" So, unless you have massive traffic, Vercel's generous free tier will cover all expenses.\n\n\nDocusaurus is software with many options, including website translation, versioning, custom pages, and blogging support. However, this is a beginner course; we can't dive too deep. You can likely figure those features out by simply reading the official documents. If not, you can always ask us a question :)\nPlease be aware that changing the design and making custom landing pages (not part of documentation or blog) requires some basic coding knowledge and is not covered in this course. This being said the default design is already stunning, and you will learn in this course how to customize many aspects of your website: colors, menus, docs style, etc.\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? You can have your website live in less than 30 minutes!",

      "description": "We make tens of thousand of decisions every day. Admittedly, a lot of those decisions are not critical. But some decisions can make the difference between success and failure, profits and losses, and even life and death.\nWe have to be honest with ourselves that most major decisions involve a tradeoff. That raises an interesting question about decision making: what’s your tolerance for risk? What are you willing to give up to get something important?\nAre you willing to make decisions based on objective data, facts, an accurate analysis and not emotions?\nHere’s more about what you’ll learn in this course:\n—The power of feelings in decision making.\n—The need for instant gratification will lead us to make poor choices.\n—Indecision is a decision. But is it the right one?\n—Assumptions can be the enemy of smart decisions.\n—Know your blind spots.\n—Be aware of the law of unintended consequences.\nOur goal in this course is to suggest ways that we can make smarter, better informed, wiser, more profitable decisions, and reduce the number of bad, self-destructive, not clearly thought out choices. We want to reduce those times when we’ve said to ourselves: “What was I thinking?”\nI hope you’ll decide to watch this course and learn how to make more impactful, sharper, and beneficial decisions for every aspect of your life and your business.",

You will grasp many of the programming concepts faster via this course too.\n\nInstead of theory, you'll learn practical skills as we work through projects, such as:\n\n- Creating Browser Automations\n\n- Automatically Populating Databases With Data\n\n- Creating Data-Driven Content Idea Generators\n\nAnd, more.\n\nThis course would have saved me a lot of; confusion, money (I spent $5,000+ on a coding bootcamp - don't do the same), and wasted hours on my learning programming journey.\n\nGo from zero to building up a portfolio of automations, and gain lifetime access to the lectures and worksheets this course offers you.\n\nFor a small investment, you can re-ignite your passion for building and be sure to create automations that save you time. And if you don't love the course, take advantage of Udemy's refund policy.\n\nIt's time to decide; will you continue struggling for time, or are you going to dive in with zero risks, with all to gain by learning how to automate?",

This application is always used in organizations to manage employees. Some features of this application:\n\n\nAdd a new employee to the application\nNew/Existing users can add/edit personal information or skillset information like adding new skills to it.\nDepending on the skill set of an employee, allocate an employee to a project or allocate some percentage of the employee's work to a project\nRemove an employee from the application\n\n\n... and so on...\n\n\nSo, I've taken an example of the above application which I also made from scratch in one of the previous organizations. Hence, in this course, I'm trying to showcase a mini version of the above-explained application which is to:\n\n\nCREATE EMPLOYEES\nDELETE EMPLOYEES\nUPDATE EMPLOYEES\nVIEW EMPLOYEES\n\n\nThis course will really help you to gain exposure to what real-time applications look like.",

But you're not a software developer, and you don't know how to code? Until now, there was only two ways you can build an app:\n1. Learn how to code - which has a steep learning curve and is very time consuming for non-technical people.\n2. Hire a developer to build your app for you - however, development and on going maintenance costs are very expensive.\nI had the same problem as you until I discovered this incredible tool called Bubble. Bubble is a revolutionary visual programming platform that enables people with absolutely no technical background to build complete web or mobile applications without code using drag and drop and workflows.\nIn this course you will learn:\nUser interface design\nUser experience design\nPayment gateways\nSocial media sign in\nDatabases structuring\nCreate, read, update and delete data\nWorkflow logic\nConditionals\nCustom states\nData constraints\nLinking data objects\nNested search\nPaths and navigation\nParameters\nUser inputs\nAuto-binding\nAPI calls and integration\nAPI Keys and authentication\nUser testing\nDebugging\nPrivacy settings\nAccessing user location\nOptimizing performance\nResponsive screen settings\nDeploying your app to the world\nAnd more!\nIf you don't know what any of those words mean, don't worry we start right from the beginning. In this course, we get hands-on and build several applications from scratch. Plus as our main project, we will be building a clone of the Tinder dating app explaining every detail and step while building the app.\nI am a qualified Industrial and Systems Engineer, experienced Bubble developer and Udemy instructor since 2015. I've incorporated everything I've learned in my years of engineering and teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:\nOver 100 Lectures and 10 hours of on-demand video content.\n11 Interactive assignments.\n4 Projects.\n5 Quizzes.\n12 Downloads.\n1 E-book.\n17 Articles.\nAnd the best part… Templates!\nAs an extra, I will give you the templates of all the apps we build completely free including the Tinder clone app.  You can use these templates and modify them to build your own unique applications.\nAt the end of this course not only will you be able to build your own fully functional apps but you will be able to start that online business you've always wanted.",

You will learn from very basics to Advanced concepts of Active Directory & Group Policy on Window Server in this course. Active Directory (AD) and Group Policy are two critical components of Microsoft's Windows Server infrastructure that provide centralized management of users, computers, and network resources within an organization. These tools are essential for ensuring efficiency, security, and consistency in enterprise IT environments.\nActive Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft that enables administrators to manage permissions and access to network resources. It stores information about objects on the network such as users, groups, computers, printers, and other resources, and organizes them into a hierarchical structure. This structure includes domains, trees, and forests, which allow for scalable management of resources across multiple locations and departments.\nGroup Policy, on the other hand, is a feature of Windows Server that works in conjunction with Active Directory to enforce specific configurations and rules across users and computers within a domain. Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are the building blocks of Group Policy and can be applied at various levels including sites, domains, and organizational units. GPOs allow administrators to define settings such as password policies, desktop environments, software installation, security options, and scripts that run at startup or shutdown.\nActive Directory and Group Policy work together to create a centralized, secure, and manageable IT infrastructure. While Active Directory serves as the backbone for identity and resource management, Group Policy acts as the mechanism for enforcing rules and configurations across the network. Together, they form a powerful combination that enables organizations to maintain control, enhance security, and improve operational efficiency in their Windows Server environments.",

Thanks to Wix.\n\n\nFirstly, I'll make you familiar with the basics of Web Design, in which we'll discuss the structure of a website like Header, Footer and Body, and then we'll learn some basic terminologies, for example: Call to Action, Uptime, SEO etc.\nAfter that we'll set things up like creating an account in Wix, choosing the right category and knowing the difference between Wix ADI and Wix Editor.\nAs we know Wix provides more than hundreds of templates, I'll help you to choose one, that suits best to your needs and I'll start from a blank template, so that it would be more customizable, you can do this too.\n\n\nThen we'll understand the dashboard of our Wix Website, this is the place from where we'll be making some significant changes to our website. After that we'll learn how to add your domain name to your website but in order to do that, we must upgrade to the premium version of Wix (I have even covered that too !)\nThen we'll customize the background using free images and videos. Next Step would be to create Website-Menu, so that the visitors could access all the pages hassle-free.\n\n\nEvery brand is uniquely recognized by its logo, that's why we'll also create and add a logo in our Website. Next comes then, adding our other social media platforms with our website which would help our visitor to connect with us on other platforms. Call to Action is also very important feature, if we want our visitors to spend more time on our website. And for that we'll add digital buttons with different functions. Then, using Wix Stripes, we'll add multiple pages like Contact Form, Maps, Footer, Team etc.\n\n\nAfter that, we'll see how to add blog in our Wix website and learn to manage posts and customize them. Now our Wix website is structured. But we haven't made it Mobile friendly yet. That could lead to a loss of huge traffic. So we' ll make our Wix Website Mobile-responsive.\n\n\nNow we have created a wonderful website, but what is its use, if nobody could ever find it.\nSo we'll work on SEO system of our Wix website, which would help us to rank better in search results.\n\n\nOur Website is now live and performing wonderful, more and more visitors are coming on it. But wait, how would know that?\nThat's why, we'll link our website with Google Analytics, which will help us to track each and every detail of our website and helps to answer questions like:\nThe number of visits our website gets daily, weekly, monthly or the average time a visitor spends on our website or which page gets the most number of visits and many more.\n\n\nNow that, you've learned a great skill in this Wix course, I'll tell you to, how you can use it to make money for yourself.\n\n\n\n\nSo, what are you waiting for......ENROLL NOW !",

This no-code approach makes it easy to experiment, play, and learn by doing — even if you’ve never programmed before. From there, we’ll gradually transition into SwiftUI and SwiftData, showing you how to move from prototypes to fully coded, idiomatic iOS applications.\nAlong the journey, you’ll gain hands-on experience with essential skills every iOS developer needs: fundamental programming concepts, user interface design, app logic, and persistent data storage. To put everything into practice, you’ll build a Todo App that leverages SwiftData to save and manage tasks. This project will give you a strong foundation in state management and data handling, and it’s something you can showcase as part of your portfolio. As the course grows, additional real-world projects will be introduced, giving you more opportunities to practice, expand your skills, and build apps you can be proud of.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have both the skills and confidence to transform your ideas into polished SwiftUI apps. Whether you’re starting from scratch or leveling up your skills, this course will guide you from vibing to coding, and from ideas to fully functional iOS apps.\n\n\nAnd remember, I’m always available through the course Q&A, where I check in daily and respond quickly. Your questions, ideas, and progress matter, and I’ll be there to support you every step of the way.\n\n\nHappy Coding!",

      "description": "Hello there! Are you entrepreneurial and yearning to build the next big thing without a developer? Have an idea in your back pocket that you want the world to see? Maybe you don't like current solutions and want to build one on your own but without coding? That's what this course is for - you'll be able to develop your startup through harnessing the power of Bubble and exploring numerous apps that we'll make together. (plus more apps will be made every month!)\nWhat is this course? If you've ever had a SaaS startup idea of your own that you really wanted to execute but didn't have a developer by your side, then this course enables you to realize how to build it from design to shipment without writing a single line of code.\nWho's teaching it? Good question. I've been involved with startups since I was 16. After founding, funding and exiting my own local commerce startup, I learned a thing or two. Currently, as a user experience lead at a well-funded startup and a passionate instructor, I'm helping people build their ideas themselves.\nWhy would I take it? There is nothing like the feeling that you can build anything. When I started learning web development, I felt overwhelmed by all that I had to learn though I still wanted to. If you're ever felt that way or don't have too much time to invest in learning, then this course will convince you that is very possible to take your ideas and make them into realities.\n\nWhat will I do? Once I get you caught up with a platform called Bubble, I'll show you how you can not only design, but structure, architect and execute your startup ideas. Who knows? You could someday be a millionaire, all because you said yes to learning how to develop your startup without any coding.\nHow much time? Not much at all. The platform you'll be using makes it easy not only for me to explain to you what things to consider when developing a startup, but also for you to pick things up and get going entirely on your own.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Starting learning how to build your startup without any coding and tons of more apps with free lifetime updates! Looking forward to seeing you.\nCheers.",

There are already thousands of no-code developers making a full-time living building no-code apps.\nSo if you're looking to become a no-code app freelancer, this course will be the perfect starting point as I will cover four ways to monetize your apps. You will learn how to sell your app templates, sell products via your apps, charge people to access your apps, and even become a certified Glide developer.\nLearn by Building Four Mobile Apps from Scratch\nWith Glide, you can literally build your first app in less than 60 seconds (I'll show you how). But in order to take full advantage of Glide's potential, you'll need to learn some of the basics (tables, relations, computed columns, custom actions, etc.) that will allow you to create apps with powerful functionality (rivaling costly enterprise-grade apps).\nTo help you unlock Glide's incredible potential to build powerful mobile apps, I'll show you how to build four projects from scratch:\n1. A task tracking app: with logic to assign tasks to specific users, add multiple project managers, set task deadlines, get overdue messages, and track overall project and task progress.\n2. A flashcards app: this tutorial you will learn how to implement Glide's swiping component to create a flashcards app to learn languages.\n3. A fully-featured e-commerce store app: with product categories, multiple product variations, discount coupons, payments powered via Stripe, and an admin dashboard to track sales and enable global settings across the store.\n4. A Tinder clone*: using swipe cards, dynamic search functionality, geographical distance calculations, some clever user profile matching logic, private user chats, and even a dashboard to track overall matching statistics.\n*UPDATE: I added a new version of this project that uses buttons instead of the swipe component which is not available anymore on the new version of Glide.\nThese projects are designed to help you implement all the concepts required to learn the ins and outs of the Glide platform and become a confident no-code app developer.\nYou might get stuck. But I'm here to help.\nAlthough building apps without code is much easier than coding them from scratch, you may get stuck sometimes.\nI'm in the Q&A every day to help you get unstuck. I reply to every question to get you back on track.\nIf you were looking for an alternative to developing great-looking mobile apps without coding, this course is for you.\nAre you ready?

Let's go!\n\n\n*******************\n\n\nFrom the Wordpress course reviews:\n\"I am a 70 year old technophobe who has avoided anything concerning Wordpress. After reviewing all of Udemy's Wordpress courses, I selected Easy Wordpress by Uri Brilliant. I'm very glad I did becasue Uri couldn't have made Wordpress any easier to understand. For those who are afraid or doubtful as I was, I highly encourage you to enroll. The lessons are very short but complete and Uri's delivery is very none threatening. Sincerely, Mike Canavan\"\n\"Building a website has been something I have wanted to do for a long time but was too intimidated. I am very pleased with how well Uri broke down each step into easy to understand instructions. I wish I had done this sooner! Can't recommend highly enough!\" (Joshua Stein)\n\"Thanks Uri, you've managed to take a subject that looks hard and unfriendly and make it simple, easy and usable. The course is carried out in a pleasant, patient and even funny way :) Well designed, built in \"Small steps\" that enabled me to understand and try to implement :)\" (Dafna Frenkel)",

You will grasp many of the programming concepts faster via this no-code course.\n\nInstead of theory, you'll learn practical skills as we work through projects, such as:\n\n✔ Scraping Websites\n\n✔ Working With APIs\n\n✔ Building Voice Apps For Alexa\n\n✔ Creating One-Page Websites\n\n✔ Developing Mobile Apps\n\nAnd, more.\n\nThis course would have saved me a lot of; confusion, money (I spent $5,000+ on a coding bootcamp - don't do the same) and wasted hours while on my journey of learning development.\n\nGo from zero to building up a portfolio of products, and gain lifetime access to the lectures, and worksheets this course has to offer you.\n\nFor a small investment, you can re-ignite your passion for building and be sure never to waste your time again. And if you don't love the course, take advantage of Udemy's refund policy.\n\nIt's time to decide; are going to continue struggling with building products, or are you going to dive in with zero risks, and all to gain by learning a new skill?",

So pretty much anyone, as long as you have a good work ethic, you do have to work obviously.\nIt also works for the people that have started a complex online business that is too hard or complicated to work like eCommerce, amazon or SEO etc and want something that is easier to manage and makes money faster. It is also for the people who really want to make money online but have no clue where to start.\nWhy should you learn building websites and not some other skill like logo making or SEO or building apps?\nWell the reason is very simple, all the skills I mentioned are in demand but those skills are not easy to learn, for those skills you will need to spend tremendous amount of time and effort to master them. But web development is the easiest skill you can acquire without learning any complex code or anything like that. Web development is also in high demand and every business owner requires a website to be built for his business and it’s not going anywhere in near future.\nSo my goal for you is to show you that even a total beginner can build amazing websites without writing code.",

Learn my system for ranking directory sites and easily using AI to create content to help get your directory found by real users.\n\n\n7. Scalable\nOnce you have learned to build a profitable, passive directory, you can create multiple directories easily - creating more income streams from this amazing business model.\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn in This No-Code DIrectory Building Course\n\n\n- Choosing the Right Niche: Discover how to identify profitable niches that align with your interests and market demand.\n- Monetization Strategies: Learn multiple ways to earn from your directory, from memberships to advertising.\n- Building Your Directory: Step-by-step tutorials on using no-code platforms to create a sleek and functional site.\n- Marketing Your Directory: Proven strategies to attract businesses and users to your platform.\n\n\n---\n\n\nReal Success Stories\n\n\n*\"I had zero technical experience but always wanted to start an online business.

Or are you a seasoned website developer who has heard about Velo, and are interested to learn more about it? Then this course is for you!\nThis course will step you through the development of a social media website similar to Facebook or Twitter, to demonstrate the unparalleled power and rapid deployment capability of Velo. Mark Zuckerberg spent almost 3 months developing the initial version of Facebook. In this course you will develop a social media platform with functionality such as posting, commenting, liking, messaging and following - but you will develop it in only 20 hours, including full line by line explanation of the code as you go!\nWhy a social media platform? A social media platform represents an advanced and complex development problem which will require a wide range of coding skills useful to many other website applications. It is also an ambitious and exciting development project which showcases the capability and speed of Velo. While the objective of this course is to develop a social media platform, the lessons you will learn along the way will be applicable to many other use cases. This course covers site member operations such as log-in / log-out / verification / profile, data storage, manipulation, querying, filtering, sorting, calculation, reference fields and display using repeaters, user actions and inputs, triggered emails, lightbox pop-ups, API’s and much more.\nThis is an applied guide to Velo where you will learn how to build a fully functional website, from scratch, using code. The best way to learn is by way of practical example. Therefore, everything taught in this course will have a purpose or function behind it. This is not a course in programming theory and principles – but real-world application and functionality which you can take, adapt and apply to your own Wix based websites.\nThis course assumes you have a basic working knowledge of Velo for Wix. If you have never used Velo before, then please complete my free 3 part course titled \"Velo for Wix\" also available on Udemy.",

      "description": "* COURSE UPDATED IN JAN 2024! *\n\nDo you have a million-dollar website idea but don’t have the technical skills to bring it to life? This course is for people just like you who want to create websites with advanced functionality – but are not website developers by trade. You are generally quite computer savvy, and may have a light coding background – even if it is just with formulas in Excel, … hey that’s a start! The good news is: you have found the right course!\n\n\nEver since Wix released Velo, you can do just about anything on the Wix platform using code and data – while still having the traditional Wix 'drag and drop' functionality at your disposal to make it all look great. Velo is the name of the new programming language for the Wix platform. Some people refer to it as Wix Code. It is essentially a variant of Javascript and the best part is: it is relatively easy to learn. Velo by Wix allows for the rapid development of advanced websites with significantly less development time needed. It is literally a game changer!\n\n\nThis is an applied guide to Velo (a.k.a. Wix Code) meaning you will learn how to build a fully functional website, from scratch, using code. I believe the best way to learn is by way of practical example. Therefore, everything taught in this course will have a purpose or business function behind it. This is not a course in programming theory and vague principals – only real-world application and functionality which you can take, adapt and apply to your own Wix based websites.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\nIn this course you will learn how to build a fully functional jobs seeker website, step by step using Velo Code and Wix! The finished website will:\n· allow job seekers to browse for jobs using conditional filters and keyword searches\n· allow job seekers to submit their CV and cover letter to apply for jobs\n· allow recruiters to create, update and manage their profiles\n· allow recruiters to post job adverts to the jobs board and edit their jobs if need be\n· allow recruiters to access the job seeker applications for each of their jobs advertised\n· allow website admins to approve job listings before they are live on the jobs board website\n· allow recruiters to see how many people have actually viewed and applied to each of their posted jobs\n· and much more!\n\n\nWhat useful things are covered in this course which I can apply to my own Wix based websites?\n· Learn functional code which can be applied to a variety of purposes\n· Conditional dropdown lists and conditional filtering\n· Dynamic pages which populate from your various databases\n· Repeater menus which allow for dynamic browsing of data\n· Receive user input using custom forms\n· Create unique reference numbers for database entries\n· Saving user input into a database and retrieving it again for later use/display\n· Querying and updating data from a database\n· Work across related databases with reference keys\n· Calculated fields in code e.g. days until each job advert closes\n· Create members pages including profile and dashboard\n· Scheduling automatic code to run on interval\n· Add a views counter to dynamic pages\n· And lots more!\n\n\nThis is the course you have been waiting for and is suitable for beginners. Hurry before someone else develops your amazing website idea before you get a chance to build it for yourself!",

This comprehensive course is meticulously designed for entrepreneurs, content creators, small business owners, and aspiring innovators who want to bring their vision to life in the global mobile app marketplaces, such as the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, without writing a single line of code.\nWe begin by laying a strategic foundation for your project. You will move beyond the initial idea to critically examine your core motivations, define clear and achievable goals, and identify your target audience. We'll conduct a thorough analysis of the pros and cons of using a no-code app builder, ensuring you understand its powerful advantages in speed and cost-effectiveness, as well as its potential limitations, so you can make an informed decision for your project's future.\nNext, you will dive into a hands-on, project-based journey using the powerful Appy Pie platform. Through step-by-step guidance, you will master the art of visual app design, learning to craft an intuitive user interface (UI) and a seamless user experience (UX). You will learn to populate your application with dynamic content by seamlessly integrating your existing website, embedding your podcast feed, connecting to external sites, or curating a video gallery directly from your YouTube channel.\nFinally, we demystify the publishing process. This course provides an exclusive tour of the Google Developer Console, guiding you through the essential steps for preparing your store listing, creating compelling marketing assets, and managing your app build for release. To ensure your app's success continues after launch, you will learn the crucial skills of localization—adapting your app for different countries and cultures—and conducting data-driven A/B testing experiments. This will empower you to scientifically test changes and discover what optimizations have the most significant impact on your app's downloads and user engagement.",

The process must be quick, easy and most important, error free.\nIn this course we are going to create an ALL-IN-ONE BACKUP SOLUTION without using any plugins.\nWe will create a server level backup solution that will backup your database and site files to either the server that is hosting the site or to a remote server.\nAfter being setup, the entire backup process will be automated and require no interaction on your part. We will also cover, in detail, the correct process to restore a WordPress site from the backups we created.\nA backup is the process of keeping a duplicate copy of your site. Keeping a backup copy of your site is extremely important. Backups act as a safety net, that allows you to restore or rollback a site back to its original state in a matter of minutes.\nYou never know when disaster may strike. Don't put months of work at risk by not implementing a backup plan for your site. It's essential that you are in a position to restore your site back to its original state.\nWhy do you need a WordPress backup?\nIf you server's storage device crashes, you'll need to reconfigure the entire server first and then restore your site from a backup located on a remote server.\nWith every new update, there always seems to be a compatibility issue. Some of these issues are serious enough to take your site down. It's easy to roll back to an earlier version of your site, delete the site files and the database and restore both from backup - problem solved.\nIf you accidentally deleted content from your site, no problem, simply restore the latest backup and your content will be restored to the site.\nThere is no need to panic if your site is suddenly displaying ads for another site or if your site has been defaced. Delete the site files and the database and restore both from backup - problem solved. Then you need to find the vulnerable plugin that created a situation that allowed your site to be hacked.\nBackup plugins are not the solution!!\nThe golden rule of WordPress, use as few plugins as possible. With each additional plugin added to your site, the possibility of vulnerabilities being introduced increases and you are adding more bloat which in turn will slow down your site.\nGoogling \"WordPress backup plugin vulnerability\" returns between 200 000 and 500 000 results. Top of the list displays a backup plugin vulnerability that impacted over 3 million users.\nDO NOT PUT YOUR SITES AT RISK\nServer level backups are performed using the tools available on the server. There is no comparison between a server level and plugin backup. Server level backups are much faster than plugin-based backups and offer none of the security issues that accompany using plugins.",

      "description": "Imagine this: You’re planning to host a series of events or offer appointment-based services, and you know that having a smooth online booking system is essential. You check around for someone to build it for you, but the quotes are sky-high, and none of them quite fit what you’re looking for. That’s exactly what happened when my wife wanted to set up a booking and payment website. She tried to find someone who could make it happen at a reasonable cost, but it just wasn’t coming together.\nThat’s when she turned to me. As someone who’s spent years working with WordPress, I knew there had to be a better way—something that didn’t involve breaking the bank. I dug into the world of plugins and found exactly what we needed: a versatile, easy-to-use booking plugin. It’s open-source, just like WordPress itself, which means you can customize it to your heart’s content. Plus, it’s free to get started, with an affordable upgrade option if you want to add online payments.\nIn this course, I’m going to walk you through how to set up that very same booking system. I’ll start by showing you the final product we’ll build together, so you know exactly what to expect. Then, we’ll break it down step-by-step, from installation to customization, making sure you feel confident every step of the way.\nEven if you’re new to WordPress, you’ll find my approach practical and straightforward. I’ll focus on the essential features to get you up and running, but I’ll also include a reference section for the more advanced features that I didn’t use.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll not only have the skills to build a booking system for your own business or project—you’ll also have the know-how to create one for clients, opening up a whole new opportunity for you.

And now I will show you how can too!\nBefore I discovered THIS method I tried all the services out there and paid hundreds of Dollars for Hosting and thousands of Dollars for Web-designers. But not anymore!\nI tried Wordpress. I tried Webflow. I tried Mailchimp Landingpages, Wix, Unbounce, Leadpages and Instapage. I used an absurdly configured Shopify-Store as Landingpage. I have even implemented my own Landingpage Generator based on Pimcore.\nDon't get me wrong, they're all great, but if you're just starting out or need a beautifully designed page really really quickly then those methods are mostly a waste of your precious time and money. Because they all need special hosting and a web-designer or expensive Themes on top.\nAnd I spent a lot of money. This is unnecessary using the methods and workflows presented in this course.\nI simply changed my workflow. So can you too!\nIf I just start out now then I'm using THIS method now to get a new business page out in TWO hours. Two hours! A full page, beautifully designed, mobile ready, blazing fast. And the best is: It's totally FREE!\nAll you need to do is plugin your own Text and add your own pictures and hit publish.\nIn this course I'll even show you how to get the BEST Free Pictures for your Websites!\nAnd on top of it, I'll show you my favorite Chat App, which is obviously totally Free as well! I will show you how you can integrate it into your existing website quickly and the right way, so people can get in touch with you instantly and frictionless!\nIf you ever wondered how to create websites for free, mobile ready including free Hosting, then THIS course is for you!\nI'll show you my FULL Workflow from A-Z!\nDon't look any further and enroll right now!",

      "description": "Do you want to save time and automate your online repetitive tasks?\nIt is a rhetorical question because the answer is YES! In this hands-on video training, I will teach you how to use Microsoft Power Automate Desktop to create bots that will automate any repetitive task you perform on the web.\nTo make you learn the best and give you the most value, we will build bots for Linkedin, Twitter, and Facebook. The bots we will build will automate different tasks, from posting to multiple Facebook groups simultaneously to unfollowing or following connections on Twitter. You will also learn how to create an send messages on LinkedIn, extract the email from all your contacts, send emails, and much more!\nThe best part of all of this is that you will also learn how to use this free no-code tool to create any bot you will require in the future.\nI have provided all of the bots' projects so that you can start immediately and follow along easily. There is also a discord server where you can ask additional questions or share your success stories.\n\n\nThe Project is essential for this training. We will be completing 4 projects that will range from the most simple one to the most complex one.\nProject 1: Twitter Unfollow Bot: We will create a Twitter bot that will unfollow all our collections and allow us to save time by unfollowing connections. The robot will unfollow as many links as we specify.\nProject 2: Search, connect and message new connections on LinkedIn. We will build a bot that will search for specific connections and send them a friend request with a message. This process is often used for lead generation and can help you save countless hours and exponentially accelerate your campaign's effectiveness.\nProject 3: Post to multiple Facebook groups at the same time. Imagine, with a click of a button, you could paste the same post to as many of your Facebook groups as you want. This will save you hours of repetitive work and allow you to focus on what matters.\nFinal Project (2 parts): Part 1: We will build a process that extracts connections from LinkedIn and puts them in an excel. Part2: We will use the excel we created and visit each profile to get their email and send them a custom email. This will be a fantastic process that will teach you how to use all the skills we learned to this point, plus some new concepts required to make stable processes.",

It uses OOP and Java ideas and is built on the Java platform. Without any coding knowledge, PEGA assists in automatically creating an application. With Pega, we don't have to start from zero like with traditional programming; instead, we can automate tasks and write programme code.\n\n\nPega's comprehensive offering is a market leader in CRM, BPM, case management, and business rules, according to industry analysts. We create the business process flow using Pega and choose the capabilities that the flow requires.\n\n\nDescribe Pega PRPC.\nA piece of software called PRPC (PegaRULES Process Commander) was developed, licenced, and promoted by Pegasystems Inc. (PEGA). The PRPC is the central element of the \"SmartBPM\" suite of BPM (Business Process Management) solutions from Pegasystems.\n\n\nWhat purpose does Pega serve?\nPEGA focuses mostly on programme code and work automation. Pega can provide quick responsiveness to change while dramatically reducing installation time, costs, and hazards. Even the industry's top software configuration management system is integrated into Pega. It has been demonstrated that developing an application in Pega requires only one-third as much work as developing one in Java.\n\n\nCareer Potential at Pega\nPega is currently leading the IT sector, and there are numerous employment openings for qualified candidates. The Pega sector is in in demand, but there are not enough professionals available. As a result, Pega employees receive some of the highest salaries available.",

The lecturer's voice and the audio in general is very clear and the talking is always relevant to what is happening, no mumbling or going off track. The lectures proceed at a reasonably fast pace, you can of course stop the video occasionally to keep up. The visuals and descriptions are good. You will build a website, step by step alongside the lecturer. I felt I learned quite a bit in terms of using WordPress, using the block editor, creating a website and general knowledge about the whole process. Well worth my time.\"\n-Terrance D.\n\"With an engaging delivery, Michael leads wonderfully through this course.\"\n-Terry B.\n\"This course was precise and understandable for anyone wanting to learn how to set up a website.

You can ask me any questions you may have as you work through the course.\nDon't love the course? It comes with a MONEY BACK GUARANTEE! That means if you don't like the course for any reason, you can get a full refund within 30 days of your initial enrollment.\nThanks for your interest, and if you decide to enroll - I'll see you in there.",

      "description": "Do you know Power Apps but want to extend your knowledge and integrate other Power Platform features (Power Automate and SharePoint), including with PL-900?\n\n\nDo you want to build full enterprise solutions and applications for your organization and don't know where to start? Do you want to upgrade from using Dynamics 365 to Power Platform?\n\n\nDo you know to know how to interact and transfer data between Power Platform applications, like Power Apps, Power Automate, SharePoint?\n\n\nDo you want to learn PowerApps, Power Automate, SharePoint in one integrated course, and help master PL-900?\n\n\nThis is the course for you. Learn from more than 20 hours of relevant instructional video content, with the only course that will teach you how to use Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint (Power Platform) to create a full solution beginner to end. We leverage the Power Platform to its full potential, and surpass Dynamics 365.\n\n\nFirst you will learn the basics of Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint (Power Platform). Then, you will learn how to interact and transfer data between these platforms, and how to communicate with third party applications and user interfaces using HTTP requests and APIs. Finally, we will put our knowledge together and create a full end-to-end real-life enterprise application.\n\n\nIn this course, we will rely on the solution formula: Full solution = User Interface (PowerApps) + Workflows (Power Automate) + Data (SharePoint)\n\n\nThis is the only complete guide to building enterprise solutions using Microsoft's framework - you won't need another course. This course is not only comprehensive (it covers everything you need to know right from the start / beginner level) but is also instructional in nature, meaning that as we learn new concepts, we are also integrating them in our solution. Don't just learn concepts, learn how to actually apply them. That also means that whether you are a beginner or expert, there's something for you in this course.\n\n\nThis course is also for those students who know either PowerApps, Power Automate, and SharePoint, but want to take their solutions to the next level by integrating all three platforms together. Students in this course will be experts at the Power Platform. Students can also take this course for the PL-900 certification, and to go beyond Dynamics 365.\n\n\nAgain, we also go through a full solution at the end of the course, where you build and deploy a real-life enterprise application with the Power Platform (PowerApps, Power Automate, and SharePoint).\n\n\n\n\nWhat is this course all about?\nIn this course, we learn about Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint and take these platforms to the next level by building complete applications and solutions. We learn how data and information is transferred between these three platforms, and how you can extend these platforms through third party and user interface integrations. We discuss how you deploy, monitor, and improve your application and solution. Finally, we take all that we learn, and build a full complete application from start to finish.\n\n\nThis is the course if you want to build a complete enterprise application, and want to use the solution formula and the Power Platform to do it.\n\n\nWhat is the solution formula?\nThe solution formula is the three elements you need to create full applications and solutions for your organization. You need:\nUser Interface (Power Apps)\nWorkflow system (Power Automate)\nData storage (SharePoint)\n\n\nWhat in Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint?\nMicrosoft Power Apps - PowerApps is Microsoft's platform to build fully functional and cross-platform applications with little to no code. Think of PowerApps as Microsoft Word, but instead of building documents you are building real-life applications.\nMicrosoft Power Automate - Power Automate is a platform to automate any and all tasks. You can streamline anything, including your emails, calendars, and business processes. Users have seen more than a 15% increase in productivity after using Power Automate for only a week!\nMicrosoft SharePoint - SharePoint is a platform that organizations use to create internal websites (called team sites) that empower teamwork and improve collaboration. SharePoint allows organizations to seamlessly organize, share, manage, and access content and knowledge across their businesses.\n\n\nWhy learn Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint to build solutions and applications?\nMicrosoft ecosystem - these platforms are similar to other Microsoft applications. They use the same ribbon and design functionality like commonly used tools, such as Word, Excel, and Power Point. They also interact and integrate well with each other, because they are part of Microsoft's Power Platform.\nEasy to use (no-code platform) - No coding necessary or even required. Similar to other Microsoft applications, these platforms are a drag-and-drop system which makes things easy, and has an amazing user-friendly interface. The most complex code you will write are Excel-like formulas and functions.\nConnectors - Microsoft has built thousands of connectors for these platforms to extend them outside the Power Platform environment. For example, your application and solution can interact with Outlook, Gmail, Trello, Twitter, Airtable, Zapier, and so much more.\nFull control and customization - these platforms give you full control in what you want to create (PowerApps), what tasks you want to automate (Power Automate), and what data you want to store (SharePoint). All Power Platforms are built with customization in mind.\nPowerful reach and scaling - these platforms are used in self-employed organizations and for individual employees, all the way to large 100,000+ employee corporations and organizations.\nExtensions - If Microsoft does not already have a connector, these platforms have HTTP requests and API tools, enabling you to connect your application and solution to any other platform, even if it's proprietary.\n\n\nWhy choose this course?\nComplete guide - this is the 100% start to finish, zero to hero, basic to advanced guide on building full solutions and applications using Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint. It also goes through crash courses on each platform. There is no other course like it that teaches you everything from start to finish. It contains over 20 hours of instructional content!\nSolution formula - we cover the solution and application formula in detail. This theory tells us that in order to build an application, we need to create a user interface (Microsoft Power Apps), a workflow management system (Microsoft Power Automate), and a database (Microsoft SharePoint). We also needs to learn how information and data is transferred between these applications.\nStructured to succeed - this course is structured to help you succeed. We first go through a crash course on PowerApps, Power Automate, and SharePoint so that everyone is on the same footing, and then we discuss how to create cross platform interactions, and third party integrations. We then create a full complete end-to-end solution and applications for our company, Dog Walkers United.\nFully instructional - we not only go through important concepts, but also apply them as we are building our application so that we can solidify them. This is not only a walkthrough of the all the features and theoretical concepts, but a course that actually builds applications with you. This also helps with PL-900.\nStep by step - we go through every single concept in a sequential order (from learning about the platforms independently, to seeing how they connect together, and then to create a complete end-to-end solution). This improves your probabilities of learning these platforms to build solutions rather than going haphazardly through each feature.\nLearn to learn - during the latter parts of the course, we go through situations where we encounter new features or errors, and work through how we would use the documentation to resolve them. In this way, you not only learn about these platforms and how they interact inside and out, but learn how to resolve your own issues as they come up.\nTeacher response - if there's anything else you would like to learn, or if there's something you cannot figure out, I'm here for you! Look at the ways to reach out video.\nReference material - follow along! I provide all reference material directly to you so you can follow along in your learning journey. This is also great reference material for PL-900.\n\n\nCourse overview\nIntroduction - learn what this course is about, solution formula, and how to succeed\nSharePoint Crash Course - learn about SharePoint, its features, and how to use it to create Lists\nPower Automate Crash Course - learn about Power Automate, its features, and how to automate tasks\nPower Apps Crash Course - learn about Power Apps, its features, and how to build user interfaces\nConnect Power Apps to SharePoint - forms, validations, custom inputs, galleries, filters, and modals\nConnect SharePoint to Power Automate - custom alerts, http requests, notifications, approvals, lookups\nConnect Power Automate to Power Apps - transfer data and images, response procedures, concurrent functions\nThird party interactions - external input forms, syncing, HTTP requests, REST APIs\nUser Interface Interactions - chatbots, adaptive cards, apps on your phone\nMonitor, Deploy, and Process Improvement - deploy solutions, monitor logs, see errors\nSolution Build - Dog Walkers United - build a complete enterprise application for an Uber for Dog Walkers\nConclusion - earn your online certification, and read about next steps\n\n\nIf you want to learn how to create enterprise-grade applications and solutions using the Microsoft Power Platform (Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint), then this is the course for you. We're looking forward to having you in the course and hope you earn the certificate.\n\n\nMusic: Bensound",
