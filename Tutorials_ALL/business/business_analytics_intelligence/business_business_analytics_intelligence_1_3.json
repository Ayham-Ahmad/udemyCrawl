      "description": "A warm welcome to the Data Visualization with R course by Uplatz.\n\n\nData Visualization refers to quantitative analysis that allows us to explore data and communicate our findings. In data science, analyzing your data is only half the battle - communicating your data and results to share knowledge and facilitate decision making is also essential. Data visualization is a powerful tool that can allow people across all ranges of statistical know-how to understand complex patterns and findings.\nNot only the R programming language was specifically designed for statistical computing, it was also developed with a focus on graphics. As well as the standard plotting functions available in base R, additional functionality is also available through add-on packages of code. The ggplot2 package was developed by Hadley Wickham as part of the tidyverse (a collection of packages designed with data science in mind) and is considered one of the best tools for plotting graphs. It combines high levels of customization with clean and visually pleasing graphics, often with minimal effort put in on the part of the programmer. Thus ggplot2 is basically a set of packages that aim to make data management, analysis and visualization more user-friendly. It contains a wide range of options to customize plots and can be used for all types of data.\n\n\nUplatz provides this in-depth training on Data Visualization using R. This Data Visualization with R course helps you to effectively create figures based on your quantitative data. If you want to understand your data better and add impact to your publications, Data Visualization in R is the right course for you.

Here's how you can start on a path to become one.\nData analytics is the process of examining data sets to extract information that may be hidden from the casual user and draw conclusions about the impact of that information. Data analytics can range from the simplest of business intelligence, to online analytical processing, all the way up to very advanced analytics.\nA data analyst collects, cleans, and interprets data sets in order to answer a question or solve a problem. They can work in many industries, including business, finance, criminal justice, science, medicine, and government.\nData analysis is the process of gleaning insights from data to help inform better business decisions. The process of analysing data typically moves through five iterative phases:\n\n\nIdentify the data you want to analyse\nCollect the data\nClean the data in preparation for analysis\nAnalyse the data\nInterpret the results of the analysis\n\n\nData analysis can take different forms, depending on the question you’re trying to answer. Briefly, descriptive analysis tells us what happened, diagnostic analysis tells us why it happened, predictive analytics forms projections about the future, and prescriptive analysis creates actionable advice on what actions to take.\n\n\nBusiness intelligence (BI) combines business analytics, data mining, data visualisation, data tools and infrastructure, and best practices to help organisations to make more data-driven decisions. In practice, you know you’ve got modern business intelligence when you have a comprehensive view of your organisation’s data and use that data to drive change, eliminate inefficiencies and quickly adapt to market or supply changes.  Business intelligence comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data analysis and management of business information.",

You'll get hands-on experience with Hugging Face, the leading open-source platform for accessing and working with pre-trained models across a wide variety of generative tasks.\nThe course introduces basic prompt engineering techniques to guide generative models effectively and predictably. From there, you'll dive into the fundamentals of Explainable AI (XAI)—what it is, why it matters, and the unique challenges it presents in generative contexts like text and image generation.\nYou'll learn practical methods for implementing XAI in both text-based and conditional generative systems, including techniques like attention visualization, latent space analysis, and post-hoc explainability tools such as LIME and SHAP. Finally, you’ll discover how to operationalize XAI through prompt engineering, crafting prompts that not only guide model output but also elicit transparent reasoning via Chain of Thought and other explainability-oriented prompting strategies.\nBy the end of the course, you'll have the skills to build more interpretable, responsible, and human-aligned generative AI systems—ready for use in production environments and high-stakes applications.\nWhy Should You Take My Course?\nI have an MPhil (Geography and Environment) from the University of Oxford, UK. I also completed a data science PhD (Tropical Ecology and Conservation) at Cambridge University.\nI have several years of experience analyzing real-life data from different sources and producing publications for international peer-reviewed journals.",

However this needs to be configured correctly. Simply enabling multinode within Vagrant is not good enough. It needs to be tuned. Developers and Operators within large enterprises, including investment banks, all use Vagrant to simulate Production environments.\nAfter all, if you are developing against or operating a distributed environment, it needs to be tested. Tested in terms of code deployed and the deployment code itself.\nYou'll learn the same techniques these enterprise guys use on your own Microsoft Windows computer/laptop.\nVagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.\nThis course will use VirtualBox to carve out your virtual environment. However the same skills learned with Vagrant can be used to provision virtual machines on VMware, AWS, or any other provider.\nIf you are a developer, this course will help you will isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable, consistent environment, without sacrificing any of the tools you are used to working with (editors, browsers, debuggers, etc.). Once you or someone else creates a single Vagrantfile, you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work. Other members of your team create their development environments from the same configuration. Say goodbye to \"works on my machine\" bugs.\nIf you are an operations engineer, this course will help you build a disposable environment and consistent workflow for developing and testing infrastructure management scripts. You can quickly test your deployment scripts and more using local virtualization such as VirtualBox or VMware. (VirtualBox for this course). Ditch your custom scripts to recycle EC2 instances, stop juggling SSH prompts to various machines, and start using Vagrant to bring sanity to your life.\nIf you are a designer, this course will help you with distributed installation of software in order for you to focus on doing what you do best: design. Once a developer configures Vagrant, you do not need to worry about how to get that software running ever again. No more bothering other developers to help you fix your environment so you can test designs. Just check out the code, vagrant up, and start designing.",

Power BI stands out with streamlined publication and distribution capabilities, as well as integration with other Microsoft products and services.\n\n\nPower BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization, or embed them in your app or website.\" The solution comprises several products and services, and value and versatility comes from leveraging the individual elements, and taking advantage of how they work together.\n\n\nData has become a ubiquitous part of business today, making it essential for businesses to understand how to gain value from the wealth of raw data available to them. The right information must be gleaned from the data and presented clearly for making well-informed business decisions. Because of this, business intelligence (BI) systems have gained tremendous traction that can assist an organization in discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making. BI is a system that analyzes data, provides actionable information, and helps users to take informed business decisions. As a proven technology leader, Microsoft has propelled itself to the forefront with the introduction of its powerful analytics tool, Power BI.\nMicrosoft’s Power BI toolkit transforms your data into meaningful information, making it one of the most popular business intelligence tools in the world. The increasing popularity of Power BI has led to an increased demand for Power BI professionals and business analysts.\nPower BI provides an optimized ,live connector to SQL server so that we can easily analyse data, create reports, charts and dashboards by directly working with a large amount of data.\nMicrosoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications—which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network .\nIn this course we will connect  Power BI to Microsoft SQL Server Database , analyse the data from the database and create visualization reports.",

Participants learn the conceptual basics of the following critical path modeling terms and processes: What is PLS path modeling?, formative versus reflective constructs, assessing reliability and validity, bootstrapping and blindfolding, how to estimate direct, indirect, total, mediating and moderating effects.\nThis course is intended for graduate students, faculty and other researchers who seek explicit and comprehensive explanations and of the foundational concepts that underlie PLS path modeling. It addresses basic issues such as: How does the PLS algorithm 'work'? What are the differences between the outer measurement and inner structural models in a path model with latent variables? What are the fundamental distinctions between formative and reflective constructs? What can one determine about direct, indirect, and total effects? About mediating and moderating effects? What do path coefficients, weights and loadings tell you about the underlying data relationships? What are latent variable ‘scores’ or values?

      "description": "This course is designed for individuals at all levels of expertise in supply chain analytics, from beginners to experts and managers, who aim to grasp and influence the overarching analytics strategy. The cases presented lay the groundwork for developing a comprehensive supply chain analytics approach.\nThis course offers an in-depth overview of supply chain analytics cases to optimize global supply chains. As businesses expand and their supply chain structures grow in complexity, the need for enhanced visibility and decision support becomes imperative.\nOverall, we outline more than 20 high-impact value cases throughout the supply chain, focusing on the overarching process perspective. Analytics demands thorough integration into processes to support data-driven decision-making effectively. Many of these cases span classical supply chain management practices to advanced data science skills. Nearly every case can be implemented from simple to complex.\n\n\nThe initial session will break down the four critical components of supply chain management: sourcing, production, planning, and distribution. Subsequent sections will explore how analytics can be integrated into each segment to enhance efficiency and flexibility.\n\n\nPlanning aims to optimize the distribution of resources in line with the capacities throughout the entire supply chain. Analytics can play a crucial role at various stages within the so-called 'supply chain planning matrix,' beginning with sophisticated forecasting and inventory management. We will discover that forecasting demand patterns accurately at strategic, tactical, and operational levels is essential and that fine-tuning inventory levels represents a prime opportunity for applying analytics.\n\n\nIn the sourcing module, analytics are applied to improve supplier selection and performance, ensuring high-quality inputs. By analyzing supplier data, companies can identify risks and opportunities in their supply chain, leading to more informed decision-making.\n\n\nThe making phase utilizes analytics to refine manufacturing processes, from cost reduction to predictive maintenance. This includes using sensors linked to process status information to monitor equipment health, predict failures, and optimize production schedules.\n\n\nLastly, the delivery aspect leverages analytics to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline delivery logistics. This involves using real-time tracking and route optimization algorithms to reduce shipping times and costs.\n\n\nAt the end of this lecture, attendees will possess a thorough grasp of the vast array of analytics applications within supply chain management. You will be introduced to fundamental best practices for your analytics journey. This knowledge aims to enable everyone to back data-driven decisions that boost operational efficiency, cut costs, and elevate customer satisfaction.",

      "description": "Statistics consists of ways to analyze data and make informed decisions. However, to be able to deploy statistical methods appropriately and properly, one needs to have a firm understanding of the available statistical methodologies and continuously build on the basic information acquired from classes like this one. Therefore, statistics is a powerful tool needed by business managers, engineers, political scientists, medical and biological researchers in the data-driven world of today. Recent and evolving advances in information technology have expanded the role of data and “big data,” in all areas of endeavor, especially in the business, marketing, and medicine, among others. Huge volumes of the available data cannot be utilized properly unless they are summarized and visualized effectively. Business analytics provides methodologies that enable decision makers to effectively use large data sets that would not be practical by any other means. Those who are familiar with visualization tools like Tableau routinely encounter analysis that are statistics-based. This course teaches the basics of data analysis and summary statistics, visualization of data, pivot table, probabilities, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and regression analysis. For instance, regression models may be used as basic tools of forecasting sales, costs, spread of diseases, among other uses. The tool we use is MS Excel. In most situations, once data are extracted using other tools such as SQL, Excel becomes the main platform for analysis.",

In this article, you will see how to work with the Query Editor in Power BI desktop. Power BI comes in various versions, i.e., Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service, Power BI Mobile, and Power BI Developer. Power BI desktop is the free version, and the query editor is available in all three versions.\nPower BI Desktop has several components to transform, model, and visualize data and also generate reports from data. The Query Editor in Power BI is used to transform or edit data files before they are actually loaded into the Power BI.\nThe Query Editor plays the role of an intermediate data container where you can modify data by selecting rows and columns, splitting rows and columns, pivoting and unpivoting columns, etc. The changes made by the Query Editor in Power BI are not reflected in the actual dataset. Once you have pre-processed the data and have transformed it into the required format, you can load the data into the Power BI environment.\nPower Query is a data transformation and data preparation engine. Power Query comes with a graphical interface for getting data from sources and a Power Query Editor for applying transformations. Because the engine is available in many products and services, the destination where the data will be stored depends on where Power Query was used. Using Power Query, you can perform the extract, transform, and load (ETL) processing of data.",

      "description": "Hello and welcome.  From the get go please be aware this course is part 2 of another course (Tableau : A quick start guide) and contains lessons not able to be presented in the first class due to limitations placed on publishers on this site. How this effects you is your decision.  Simply know you can take this class as a stand alone course, or enroll in Part 1 in the event you want all of the course as it was originally intended.  You see this site places time limits on free course so unfortunately things had to be divided up to meet their guidelines.\nBoth courses are free and I've done my best to have modules line up between each course.\nIf you wish to take part one of the course look up: Tableau | A Quick Start Guide\nWhew...\nAll that said imagine you have a big list of data (say an Excel list, or database application) it's fair to say that data is practically unreadable.  Trying to get a mental picture of a data list is tough to do. Or put another way how do you make heads or tales  out of something so illegible? This is where Tableau can save the day.  :)\nWith Tableau you can create really cool, slick, visualizations (AKA charts) that allow you to interpret your data in \"picture\" form to learn the story it's telling you.  Tableau is highly intuitive, incredibly powerful and flat out fun to use.\nThis course has been designed to provide a high level overview of the foundational topics in Tableau, with the hope you will take what you learn and apply it to higher levels of Tableau.\nEach module/ video tutorial is topical in nature and you can pick and choose the order in which you learn since there is no true progression path to the course.  That said, we've tried to arrange the content so it has the best and easy logical flow.\nTopics you will learn in part 2 include: calculations in Tableau (DateDiff, calculated fields, IF and Case functions), how to create bullet graphs, scatter plots, histograms, control charts and a few others, an intro to joining types in Tableau, how to animate visualizations, ending with a walk through of some grab-bag topics.\nThis course is designed for beginners/ novices in Tableau so experienced people need not apply.  :)\n\n\n** IMPORTANT** This course was recorded using Tableau 9 which is not the most recent version of Tableau since the video series was put together a few years ago.  However all the content within the class applies to Tableau 9.x and higher, just note your screen may look a little different.\n\n\nSo why is this course free?  Simple. By chance this course can help someone, somehow, someway stay afloat economically, move to a better vocation, or allow them a better career....it's well worth it in my view.  ~ Dave (the course author)",

Well, actually, before a bit before that. The 5th of December 2018 was the date I posted my first video.  Before that, I've invested time into learning about this awesome platform, did a YouTube course and a personal branding course.\n\nOn YouTube, I decided to share my experience of selling on Amazon, I started selling there in late 2016 (first sale 25th of January 2017 XD), and still sell on the platform. So I had some cool experience (about 2 years at that point), so I started sharing tutorials, personal stories, vlogs, software/course reviews, and more content in the Amazon FBA YouTube niche. I love it :)\n\nSo at the time of writing, 14th of September 2020 (a bit after I finished creating this course), I have 1506 subscribers, 161 videos (some unlisted) and in the last 28 days, my channel got 7258 views, 628.2 watch time hours, 217$ in profit from YouTube ads. Yay, so it grew from the numbers recorded in the course, which is cool =) Maybe I should keep updating the description here, as I progress... But sorry, I am off topic a bit, there's a course about YouTube data analytics here xDDD\n\nSo...\n\nCome, join the YouTube analytics course today :) Invest your time to go through the course, I did my sincere best for you.

      "description": "This is a rare opportunity to learn about probability distributions from an experienced data scientist. You will get an intuitive understanding of probability distributions.\nWhether you aspire to be a data scientist or just a data literate leader, probability distributions are an essential concept to understand. Whatever your journey, this course will boost your data literacy.\nA lot of courses on probability distributions will give you 10 hours of maths. And they will teach you to pass written exams. But they won't give you the conceptual and intuitive understanding that you can use in your role.\nSo you need a short course that will give you an intuitive and practical understanding of the concepts without burying you in equations and theory that you'll never apply in your role.\nYou might have looked into probability distributions before. You might have taken other courses. You might have looked through books, and you might have been left wondering, how does this apply outside of the classroom?\nThe truth is that other training material on probability distributions is not created by experienced professional data scientists. Other courses are created to teach theory that you can use to pass exams and to publish academic papers. The university professors that teach these courses are not concerned about applying their theories outside of the classroom.\nIn your personal learning journey, you have two paths.\nThe first path involves learning all of the theory and then working as a data scientist for 14 years to truly understand it.\nOr the quicker path, take a short course where an experienced data scientist explains the concepts that you need to know.\nIf your ultimate goal is to truly understand the theory, this course is the perfect primer. It's better to have an understanding of the concepts before diving into the details of the formulas, rather than learning the formulas before understanding what they're actually measuring.\nSo who am I? My name is Slava Razbash. I've worked in data science roles since 2011. I've worked as a data scientist at some of the largest companies in Australia. I hold a master of applied econometrics from one of Australia's top universities, Monash University. So, you can see that I might know a thing or two about the practical application of probability distributions and data literacy.\nThis course is a gentle introduction to the concept of a probability distribution.\nWe start with discrete probability distributions. I'll use the example of rolling a six sided die to introduce the concept.\nI also used the six-sided die example in my probability theory basics course. If you're completely new to probability theory, then start there.\nNext, we build on your knowledge to introduce continuous probability distributions. The examples become more interesting and you will learn a little bit about mathematical history.\nThe most unique and practical section of this course is the section on extreme values and outliers, because it's a topic that's usually left out of beginner courses.\nFinally, there's a short lecture to define some additional terms that you will hear in the workplace.\nGetting started is easy, just enrol in this course.\nBy comparison, taking a subject at a university will cost you thousands of dollars, and your professors may not have worked outside of academia.\nAlthough this course doesn't cover as much as a university subject, it's much more affordable and it's taught by a real industry expert.\nSo you get access to over 14 years of industry experience for much less money than you would spend in a restaurant.\nNow, there is a caveat. If you are completely new to probability theory, then you should start with my free probability theory basics course. It's free. It was originally designed as part one of this course.\nNow, some people might be thinking, I'm an AI engineer. I vibe code B2B SaaS unicorns. Why do I need to know about probability distributions? Well, did you know that LLMs predict the probability distribution of the next token? Understanding how it works will make you a better unicorn vibe coder, especially in the B2B space.\nFrom my experience, I can see that you have three different paths in front of you.\nYou can do nothing and get replaced by someone who is more data literate than you.\nThe second option is to jump into a long theory heavy course that will teach you to pass exams. You will then need years of industry experience to understand how the theory applies outside of the classroom.\nOr you can enroll in this course and get an intuitive introduction to probability distributions from an experienced data scientist and quickly boost your data literacy.\nYou might choose to continue learning and then take a long theory heavy course later. Having already done this course as a foundation, you will understand the maths better because you will already have an intuitive understanding of the concepts.\nSo if you want to quickly leverage my 14 years of data science experience, enrol in this course.",

SSIS includes graphical tools and wizards for building and debugging packages; tasks for performing workflow functions such as FTP operations, executing SQL statements, and sending e-mail messages; data sources and destinations for extracting and loading data; transformations for cleaning, aggregating, merging, and copying data; a management database, SSISDB, for administering package execution and storage; and application programming interfaces (APIs) for programming the Integration Services object model.\nSSIS Designer  is used to create a Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services package. The package that you create takes data from a flat file, reformats the data, and then inserts the reformatted data into a fact table.\nIn this course, we will create a simple ETL package that extracts data from a single flat file source, transforms the data using two lookup transformations, and writes the transformed data to a copy of the FactCurrencyRate fact table in the AdventureWorksDW sample database. We will also  create new packages, add and configure data source and destination connections, and work with new control flow and data flow components.",

So even if you have no experience with shiny right now, when you finish this tutorial you will be able to start building simple shiny applications.\n\n\nSo, let’s see what you are going to learn in this course.\n\n\nIn the second section of the course, before getting into stuff, we review the app that we are going to build. This way you will have a clear idea about our goal. You can refer to this section at any time – while learning – to see what you have done until that moment and what remains to be done.\n\n\nIn the third section we’ll clarify the main Shiny concepts. We’ll talk about the big components of any Shiny app – user interface and server – and we’ll explain their role and function. Then we’ll present the basic shiny app template – you can use this template as a starting point for any app that you’ll build in the future.\n\n\nIn the next section we’ll build a neat layout for our app. We cannot enter into advanced layout techniques , but we’ll still create a grid layout to organise the app elements in the page and make the user interface good-looking.\n\n\nThe fifth section is about creating input objects. The inputs are the elements that allow the user to interact with the app. You’ll learn how to write input objects using shiny code and we’ll create the inputs that we need in our app.\n\n\nThe sections six and seven are about the outputs. First, we’ll learn about output placeholders – some special functions that indicate the type and place of each output object in the user interface. You will be acquainted with the output objects that the shiny program can build – text, tables, charts and images. Furthermore, you will learn the exact procedure that shiny employs for creating outputs.\n\n\nAfter learning about the user interface elements, you must understand how the server function works. But first you must grasp the concept of reactivity. The section number eight is dedicated to this topic. Here we define reactivity and explain the crucial concept of reactive context. To manipulate variables in Shiny we absolutely need to generate reactive context. That’s why we’ll learn a few functions that do exactly that. Everything is presented in detail in section eight.\n\n\nWhen you become familiar with reactivity, you are able to write the server part of you application. This is what we are going to do in the last section of the course. We will learn how to manipulate data in a Shiny environment (that is, in a reactive context), how to print text in the user interface, how to create and display an interactive table, how to build charts in shiny using the ggplot2 package.\n\n\nAt the end of this section, our app will be completely functional.\n\n\nThere is also a bonus section, where I shortly present a more complex app and explain a little bit how it works. This way you’ll realise better the possibilities and capabilities of the Shiny package.\n\n\nEnrol today and start your journey to becoming a Shiny expert!",

      "description": "AI is everywhere.\nIt’s reshaping decisions across industries.\nBut with bold claims and fancy buzzwords, it’s easy to feel lost or even be misled.\n\nThis course helps you cut through the noise.\nYou’ll learn how AI and machine learning really work, step by step, no coding, no equations, just practical insight.\nEach section builds from the basics, giving you just enough of the underlying concepts before showing how they can be misunderstood, misused, or oversold.\n\nWhat sounds smart isn’t always right.\nWhether you're new to the field or already working around AI, you'll find clear explanations that sharpen your understanding and strengthen your judgment.\nWe’ll do that by breaking down the kinds of things confident consultants love to say, like: “This model is 99.9% accurate.” or “Deep learning figures it out.”\nSometimes they’re right. Often, they’re not. This course helps you see the difference.\n\n\nHere's what you'll learn, step by step:\n1. Understanding AI and Model Flow\n“AI is very different from machine learning.”\nYou'll start with the essentials: how machine learning models are built, how they differ from AI buzzwords, and what types of models exist (from supervised to generative). We'll walk through the full data-to-prediction process, including scores, probabilities, and decisions.\n2. The Importance of Data Quality\n“Garbage in, magic out - the model will figure it out.”\nYou'll explore common data pitfalls like sample bias and missing values, and why even sophisticated models break down when fed flawed inputs. We'll also question the idea that perfect data quality is all you need.\n3. Model Evaluation and Metrics\n“The AI works great, it is 99.9% accurate.”\nWe break down the misuse of accuracy and introduce better metrics. You'll learn how to evaluate models the way real decisions work, with nuance, thresholds, and trade-offs.\n4. Responsible AI\n“My data is anonymous and the AI model is fair.”\nThis section introduces fairness, privacy, and the pitfalls of black-box models. You'll explore tools like SHAP and counterfactuals, see why they’re both useful and limited, and learn how fairness can’t be boiled down to a single metric or technical fix.\n5. Generative AI\n“ChatGPT is just next word prediction.”\nWe demystify generative models: how they work, and why hallucinations, leakage, and societal bias matter. You'll learn what tools like ChatGPT can do well, and what they only appear to do well.\n6. Why AI Projects Go Off the Rails\n“Let’s see how we can use this fancy deep learning.”\nWe wrap up by diagnosing common project failures: misaligned goals, poor framing, unclear communication, and tech-driven enthusiasm without business grounding. You'll see how to improve cross-functional collaboration and keep AI work focused and effective.\nBy the end of the course, you'll understand how AI systems really work, not just in theory, but in practice, and you'll be ready to question claims, spot weak spots, and guide projects with confidence.\n\n\nYou’ll also get a one-pager summarizing all the key claims, corrections, business implications, and the critical questions to ask, ready to use in your next AI conversation.",

As the latest breakthrough in Natural Language Processing (NLP), ChatGPT has opened doors to a new era of possibilities, impacting industries ranging from healthcare and finance to customer service and education.\nChatGPT has numerous practical use cases. It can be used to draft emails or other pieces of writing, answer customer service queries, create dynamic characters for video games, and even as a study tool for learning new topics. Some developers have even used it as a coding assistant. It's also a powerful tool for businesses, particularly in fields like marketing, where it can generate advertising copy, social media posts, and more. Its ability to generate human-like text can save time and resources, automate tasks, and provide value in various applications. ChatGPT is wonderful however despite its capabilities, ChatGPT has limitations. It doesn't 'understand' text like humans and instead generates responses based on learned patterns. This can sometimes lead to nonsensical or incorrect answers, especially in complex or nuanced situations.\nAnother limitation is that it's sensitive to the input prompt: slight changes in the phrasing of a prompt can lead to different responses. It can also be excessively lengthy and tends to overuse specific phrases.",

      "description": "Analytics has been defined as the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions. Analysis is more than just analytical methodologies or techniques used in logical analysis. It is a process of transforming data into actions through analysis and insights in the context of organizational decision making and problem solving. Analytics includes a range of activities, including business intelligence, which is comprised of standard and ad hoc reports, queries and alerts; and quantitative methods, including statistical analysis, forecasting/ extrapolation, predictive modeling (such as data mining), optimization and simulation.\nIn this course, you will learn to identify, evaluate, and capture business analytic opportunities that create value. Toward this end, you will learn basic analytic methods and analyze case studies on organizations that successfully deployed these techniques. In the first part of the course, we focus on how to use data to develop insights and predictive capabilities using machine learning, data mining and forecasting techniques. In the second part, we focus on the use of optimization to support decision-making in the presence of a large number of alternatives and business constraints. Finally, throughout the course, we explore the challenges that can arise in implementing analysis approaches within an organization.\n\n\nThe course emphasizes that business analysis is not a theoretical discipline: these techniques are only interesting and important to the extent that they can be used to provide real insights and improve the speed, reliability, and quality of decisions. The concepts learned in this class should help you identify opportunities in which business analytics can be used to improve performance and support important decisions. It should make you alert to the ways that analysis can be used and misused within an organization.",

      "description": "Welcome to the course “Most useful SAS functions in your daily work for beginners”. First of all, I want to say thank you for choosing to take this course. I sincerely hope you will like and enjoy this course.\nIn my opinion, it’s most complete SAS course about the functions.\nIn this course, you are going to learn a variety of SAS functions. We will cover more than 60 functions, and I will only concentrate on function that you need in your daily work. I divided the functions into three categories: Character functions, Date and Time functions, and Statistical and Mathematical functions.\nA few words about teaching method. I believe in practice. Therefore, during each lesson, you will have different assignments to see if you understand the material. I put a strong emphasis on practice. Moreover, at the end of the course, you will have three projects on real data. These projects should give you an indication of whether you have understood the SAS functions and are ready to implement them.\nThis course has course folder, that you will download. You will find there all the material you are going to learn during the course. It contains all SAS programs we develop during the lessons. In addition you will find there instructions to projects, the real datasets you going to use during the projects and of course the solutions to the projects.\nWhat about the requirements of the course? You have to know only SAS Base. In simply words, you have to know data manipulation, write conditional statements, loops and no more than that.\nIn this course, we are going to work on SAS Studio and sometimes called also “SAS University Edition”. This is free version, and if so far you have not downloaded it, don’t worry. We will do it together. It's pretty simple.\n\n\nCurriculum of the course :\nI divided the course into five sections : The first section is introduction. In this section, you are going to learn the content of the course. Another two lectures are about Installation & Familiarity with SAS University Edition. If you have SAS Studio and you got to work on it, you can skip these lectures and go straight to the video about downloading course folder. And in the last video of this section, we will download course folder and put it into SAS shared folder. As I said in the previous video, this folder contains real datasets for three projects, project’s instructions and solutions, and of course, all the functions and examples, syntaxes of the functions, we are going to solve during the course.\nLast section, contains conclusions and discounts to my other courses. The rest three parts is a core of the course. In the second section, we are going to learn character functions. We will see, how to extract substrings from string, count the number of characters and words in the string, remove and replace specific characters in the string, how to concatenate character strings and numeric values, how to search a character expression within a string and how to convert numeric variable to character variable and vice versa.\nThird section concentrates on most useful date and time functions. We start from declaring constant date, time and datetime variables and after that, go straight to functions. We will learn most basic functions that returns date, time or datetime values based on parameters. We will also see, how can we extract ‘parts’ from date, time or datetime values. We will also learn more complex SAS date, time or datetime functions that are asked in each job interview. These are Interval Functions. For example, these functions can determine how long a period has elapsed between two time points or advances a given date, time or datetime by a specified number of intervals.\nFourth section dedicated to mathematical and statistical functions. We are going to draw distributions, generate random numbers from different distributions, round numbers. Also, we will talk about calculation of p-values and critical values and et cetera.\n\n\nGuys, you can ask me any questions you want during the course or even after you finish. I usually answer within a few hours, but no more than 24 hours.\n\n\nThank you very",

      "description": "Neural networks are powerful predictive tools that can be used for almost any machine learning problem with very good results. If you want to break into deep learning and artificial intelligence, learning neural networks is the first crucial step.\n\n\nThis is why I’m inviting you to get into the fascinating world of neural networks. In this course you will develop a strong understanding of one the most utilised network, multilayer perceptron, suitable for both classification and regression problems.\n\n\nThe mathematics behind neural networks is particularly complex, but you don’t need to be a mathematician to take this course and fully benefit from it. Our emphasis here is on practice. You will learn how to operate multilayer perceptrons using the R program, how to build and train models and how to make predictions on new data.\n\n\nAll the procedures are explained live, on real life data sets. So you will advance fast and be able to apply your knowledge immediately.\n\n\nThis course contains three sections.\n\n\nThe first section is dedicated to the basic concepts related to neural networks and predictive analytics. You will find out what multilayer perceptrons are how they learn, what procedure they employ to make predictions. Also, you’ll learn the main prediction accuracy metrics for both numeric and categorical response variables.\n\n\nIn the second section we’ll build and train a multilayer perceptron to predict a bank customers’ default. In other words, our response is categorical in this case. After training the network, we’ll use it to measure prediction accuracy in the test set. But that’s not all. We will also try to improve our model by manipulating various parameters of the network and test our model accuracy using the k-fold cross-validation technique.\n\n\nIn the third section we build and train a model with a numeric response variable. More exactly, we’ll predict car prices depending on their technical features, using a multilayer perceptron, of course. After building the model we’ll measure its accuracy on the test set, try to improve it by modifying he network parameters and, finally, validate our model using the k-fold cross-validation method. So, the same steps as in the previous section, but this time for the particular case of a numeric dependent variable.\n\n\nA number of practical exercises are proposed at the end of the course. By doing these exercises you’ll actually apply in practice what you have learned.\n\n\nThis course is your opportunity to become familiar with neural networks very fast. With my video lectures, you will find it easy to master these major neural networks and build them in R. Everything is shown live, step by step, so you can replicate any procedure at any time you need it.\n\n\nSo click the “Enroll” button to get instant access to your course. It will surely provide you with new priceless skills. And, who knows, it could enhance your future career.\n\n\nSee you inside!",

      "description": "Multi-domain MDM manages all different types of master data in one place, bringing the multiple data domains and processes associated with each into a centralized platform. MDM ensures your master data is consistent, complete, and accurate throughout your organization, enterprise systems, and partners. Multi-domain MDM takes that one step further by integrating all your domains into one single platform. A domain refers to the type of data referenced. Some of the most popular data domains are customer data, products, financials, locations, employees, and data about different industries.\nOrganizations used to only implement single-domain MDM solutions. That meant there was one system for each data domain, such as one for customer data, another for products, another for locations, and so forth. This gives you a single view of customers; however, it doesn’t offer a complete view, leading to confusion, errors, and lack of consistency in an organization’s master data. With a single domain system of customer data, you would need to integrate it with the product and services data domains. You might want to use financial or location data for a complete, holistic view of what that customer purchased, what services they used, and all the data about their behaviours and interactions with the company. A single-domain MDM approach puts up barriers to correlate information across multiple domains.\nMaster data management is more essential than ever. Every transaction in your organization relies on master data: products, customers, employees, suppliers, financial hierarchies, or reference data. Accurate and consistent master data streamlines your operational processes and increases the quality of your reporting and analysis. You need a system that simplifies multi-domain master data management by providing one way to manage, govern, and share all your master data. With multi-domain MDM, organizations can implement any domain needed into the organization using only one set of technologies.\n\n\nWe will achieve the below in this course:\nIntroduction to Multidomain Master Data Management\nHow to setup semarchy for free\nCustomer Data Model\nProduct Data Model\nMultidomain Data Model with customer and product\nImporting data\nDashboards\nCreating Customer and prospect\nAdd a new product\nIf you want to learn key concepts and capabilities of multidomain master data management solution, this is the course for you. We will build a complete solution with Semarchy . The principals used to build our semarchy multidomain MDM solution can be used with other MDM products as well if they offer standard OOTB functionalities like setting up screens, match and merge capabilities, workflows etc.\nWe will use free 7 day trial from Semarchy xDM to build our MDM solution. Please note this course focuses on building  multidomain MDM key capabilities which can be implemented in any standard MDM solution and not on teaching Semarchy basics, have got another course 'Introducing Semarchy xDM (MDM) for Beginners' for that.",

      "description": "Course Overview: This course is designed to provide beginners with a solid foundation in MySQL, a widely used open-source relational database management system. Through a combination of theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises, participants will gain proficiency in writing queries, understanding essential SQL clauses, mastering join operations, and engaging in practical application exercises.\nCourse Objectives: By the end of this course, participants will:\nUnderstand the fundamental concepts of databases and relational database management systems.\nBe proficient in writing basic to intermediate SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in a MySQL database.\nAcquire a comprehensive understanding of important SQL clauses, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and their variations.\nMaster the art of joining tables to retrieve data from multiple sources and understand different types of joins.\nGain hands-on experience by working on real-world scenarios and practical exercises to reinforce the concepts learned throughout the course.\nWhat is MySQL?\nMySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle that is based on structured query language (SQL).\nA database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or a place to hold the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. In particular, a relational database is a digital store collecting data and organizing it according to the relational model. In this model, tables consist of rows and columns, and relationships between data elements all follow a strict logical structure. An RDBMS is simply the set of software tools used to actually implement, manage, and query such a database.\n\n\nMySQL is open-source\nAny individual or enterprise may freely use, modify, publish, and expand on Oracle’s open-source MySQL code base. The software is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).\nFor MySQL code needing to be integrated or included in a commercial application (or if open-source software is not a priority), enterprises can purchase a commercially licensed version from Oracle.\nAgain, these options provide organizations with additional flexibility if deciding to work with MySQL. The public and community-based nature of open-source releases enriches MySQL’s documentation and online support culture, while also ensuring that sustained or newly-developed capabilities never stray too far from current user needs.\nMySQL is easy to use\nThough MySQL’s relational nature and the ensuing rigid storage structures might seem restrictive, the tabular paradigm is perhaps the most intuitive, and ultimately allows for greater usability.\nIn fact, MySQL makes many concessions to supporting the widest possible variety of data structures, from the standard but rich logical, numeric, alphanumeric, date, and time types, to more advanced JSON or geospatial data. Beyond mere data types and an expansive built-in feature set, the MySQL ecosystem also includes a variety of tools, easing everything from server management to reporting and data analysis.\nRegardless of the RDBMS’s overarching architecture, users can invariably find a MySQL feature allowing them to model and codify data how they wish. MySQL remains one of the most straightforward database technologies to learn and use.\n\n\nPrerequisites: No prior knowledge of databases or SQL is required for this course. Basic computer literacy and familiarity with working in a command-line interface or graphical user interface (GUI) is recommended.\nTarget Audience: This course is suitable for beginners who have little to no experience with databases and SQL but are eager to learn how to manage and manipulate data effectively using MySQL.\nNote: This course focuses specifically on MySQL and SQL concepts and does not cover other aspects of database administration, server management, or advanced topics like stored procedures or triggers.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Web Analytics course by Uplatz.\n\n\nWeb Analytics is the process of collecting, measuring, analyzing, and reporting web data to understand and optimize web usage. It helps businesses and website owners understand how visitors interact with their sites, which pages they visit, how long they stay, and what actions they take. This information is crucial for improving user experience, driving traffic, and achieving business goals.\n\n\nHow Web Analytics Works\nData Collection: Web analytics tools (like Google Analytics) use JavaScript code embedded in web pages to collect data about user interactions. This includes page views, clicks, session duration, and other user behaviors.\nData Processing: The collected data is processed to filter out irrelevant information, such as bot traffic, and to organize it into meaningful categories.\nData Analysis: The processed data is analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and insights. This analysis can reveal information about user demographics, behavior flows, and conversion rates.\nReporting: The insights from the analysis are presented in various reports and dashboards. These reports help stakeholders understand the performance of their website and the effectiveness of their marketing strategies.\n\n\nBenefits of Learning Web Analytics\nImproved Decision Making: Web analytics provides data-driven insights that help make informed decisions about website design, content, marketing strategies, and user experience improvements.\nEnhanced User Experience: By understanding how users interact with a website, you can identify pain points and areas for improvement, leading to a better user experience.\nOptimized Marketing Strategies: Web analytics allows for tracking the performance of marketing campaigns, helping to allocate resources effectively and optimize marketing efforts for better ROI.\nIncreased Conversion Rates: Analyzing user behavior and identifying drop-off points in the conversion funnel can help optimize the website for higher conversion rates.\nCompetitive Advantage: Understanding web analytics helps businesses stay ahead of competitors by quickly adapting to changes in user behavior and market trends.\nCost Efficiency: By identifying the most effective channels and strategies, businesses can reduce wasteful spending and focus on high-performing areas.\n\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest version of Google's web analytics platform, designed to provide a more comprehensive and user-centric approach to tracking and analyzing user interactions across websites and apps. GA4 is built to adapt to the evolving digital landscape, offering advanced features and capabilities that enable businesses to gain deeper insights into user behavior and improve their online strategies.\n\n\nKey Features of GA4\nEvent-Based Data Model: Unlike Universal Analytics, which primarily focuses on sessions and pageviews, GA4 uses an event-based data model. This allows for more detailed tracking of user interactions, such as clicks, video plays, and downloads.\nCross-Platform Tracking: GA4 enables tracking user interactions across multiple platforms and devices, including websites, mobile apps, and more. This provides a holistic view of the customer journey.\nEnhanced Measurement: GA4 automatically tracks certain key interactions, like scrolls, outbound clicks, and file downloads, without requiring additional setup. This simplifies the process of data collection.\nAdvanced Analysis: GA4 offers powerful analysis tools and techniques, such as funnel analysis, path analysis, and segment overlap. These tools help uncover deeper insights into user behavior and conversion paths.\nUser-Centric Reporting: Reports in GA4 are centered around users rather than sessions, offering a more accurate representation of how individuals interact with a brand over time.\nMachine Learning Insights: GA4 leverages Google's machine learning capabilities to provide predictive metrics, such as purchase probability and churn probability. These insights help businesses make data-driven decisions.\nPrivacy and Compliance: GA4 is designed with privacy in mind, offering features that help comply with data protection regulations. It provides more granular data control and options for anonymizing user data.\nIntegration with Google Ecosystem: GA4 integrates seamlessly with other Google products, like Google Ads and BigQuery, enabling more efficient data analysis and marketing campaign management.\n\n\nBenefits of Learning Google Analytics 4 (GA4)\nAdvanced Analysis Tools: GA4 offers more sophisticated analysis tools compared to its predecessor, Universal Analytics. It includes features like event-based tracking and enhanced data modeling.\nCross-Platform Tracking: GA4 allows for tracking user interactions across different platforms and devices, providing a comprehensive view of the customer journey.\nEnhanced User Privacy: GA4 is designed with privacy in mind, offering better data control and compliance with data protection regulations.\nPredictive Analytics: GA4 includes predictive metrics, such as churn probability and potential revenue, which can help in making proactive business decisions.\nImproved Reporting: GA4 offers more flexible and customizable reporting options, enabling users to create tailored reports that meet specific business needs.\nIntegration with Google Ecosystem: GA4 integrates seamlessly with other Google tools, such as Google Ads and BigQuery, allowing for a unified approach to data analysis and marketing.\nBy learning web analytics, including the features of Google Analytics 4, individuals and businesses can leverage data to optimize their online presence, enhance user experience, and achieve their strategic goals.\n\n\nWeb Analytics - Course Curriculum\nA.

      "description": "Note on the Short Version of the Course\nI have launched the course as a free, shortened version. It is an excellent introduction to the basics of handling data. Two points I want you to know:\n1. The course so far is an in-depth view on a small & important part of SQL, rather than a light-touch overview of everything.\n2. Technically, the full paid version is on the way. But I am finding it very difficult to find the time to complete the lessons (between other projects and work).\nTherefore for those who need a comprehensive course now, I'd suggest signing up to a couple of courses now including this one while it's free. That way you can learn now but also enjoy all the additional lessons for free when they arrive.\n\n\nNote on the Communicating\nUdemy prevents instructors of Free courses from answering any questions from students. Therefore for now I cannot provide any feedback or respond to comments.\n\n\nSummary\nForget the dry, old, textbook approach to learning code. Forget endlessly drilling syntax.\nThis course puts SQL in context and gets you solving real-world business problems from Day 1.\nYou'll play the role of a data analyst at Australia's largest fictional consumer bank, with a uniquely rich relational database at your fingertips. This context brings SQL to life and makes it easier for you to understand deeply and quickly.\nWith this new approach, you'll be surprised to see that SQL is fun and simple to learn. My course guarantee is that you'll go from zero to functional SQL coder within the weekend.\n\n\nBest features in a nutshell\nIn plain English, with business context and fun analogies to explain the otherwise dry syntax.\nUnique database, using a fictional bank relational database with incredibly rich transaction data to keep the course interesting and relevant.\nFocuses deep on the absolute basics, to get you the strong foundations required for a data career.\nDoesn’t cost money! If you sign up now while it’s free, you have lifetime free access, even as the course grows and becomes paid.\n\n\nRead on for more detail\nMy story and building the course\nMy SQL learning experience was not ideal. When I started work I hadn’t the slightest idea what data was, let alone the power it brings to those who wield it skillfully. I took probably a year longer than necessary to master the SQL for data analytics. Even though I was practicing everyday on the job, I was slow to understand new concepts and struggled to remember new syntax.\nNow as a full-time data analytics and insights manager, I have the hindsight to know it should have been much easier.\nThe main ingredients missing for me were:\nStructure\nWhat is important, what isn't, and why.\nContext\nAnalogies, interesting examples, and plain English explanations. Bringing it to life!\nSo I’ve taken what was lacking in my learning experience and build a course around it. Specifically, here’s why my course stands out:\nStructured\nWe learn what you need for on the job data analysis using SQL, no more less.\nThe topics are covered in an order that makes sense and helps you build on past learning.\nYou understand why each lesson is important, where it sits in the grand scheme of SQL.\nIn context\nSQL shouldn’t have to be dry or boring, so I have used realistic business problems and analogies.\nYou’ll be playing the role of a data analyst at the largest fictional company in Australia, the Royal Bank of Australia, solving problems to drive sales, improve marketing reach, and manage customers.\nKnowing why you’re learning the syntax, you’ll learn faster.\nHands on/practical\nYou’ll practice writing SQL in every single lesson.\n\n\nWe are going to have fun too, investigating cryptocurrency trading among customers, and even learning about Australian animals!\n\n\nWhy learn SQL?\nMost successful companies today are data-driven.\nThey record every bit of information about their business (e.g. customers, sales).\nThey store that information (called data) in complex databases.\nAnd they draw insights from the data to improve their business.\nThat’s where SQL comes in.\nThe only way to gather data and transform it into valuable business insights is to combine SQL and a smart analyst like you.\nIt's with SQL that companies know answers all sorts of where do my customers prefer to shop? Who was incorrectly charged fees? Why are sales going down?)\nAnd as you may have noticed in the Promo, SQL is a great skill to build your career\nData careers, in data analysis (business analysis), data science, & data visualisation (business intelligence).\nSQL is needed to actually find and handle data in most organisations.\nThe data handling and management skills learned via SQL are fundamental to understanding data in general, and are useful even if you don't use the SQL language (rare).\nAccess to data can make you powerful in organisations. It's hard to argue with an analyst armed with well-prepped data and a solid numbers-based argument.\nMarketing, product management, and tech sales:\nSQL (and the accompanying data skills) are a great way to stand out in marketing and product.\nMarketers and product managers propose changes to improve the business.\nNowadays, any proposed change needs a strong case to support it.\nData is the foundation of any strong business case.\nTherefore marketers and product managers with data skills can put together stronger cases, get more initiatives approved, and grow their career faster.\n\n\nWhy start with mySQL? mySQL is:\nVery common, used by major companies and organisations across the world, such as Uber, Netflix, Spotify, and JPMorgan.\nFree and easy to set up.\nSimilar to other forms of SQL like Microsoft SQL Server, PostGre SQL, Oracle SQL, Teradata SQL.",

      "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the basis for mimicking human intelligence processes through the creation and application of algorithms built into a dynamic computing environment. Stated simply, AI is trying to make computers think and act like humans.\nAchieving this end requires three key components:\nComputational systems\nData and data management\nAdvanced AI algorithms (code)\nThe more humanlike the desired outcome, the more data and processing power required.\nWhy is artificial intelligence important?\nToday, the amount of data that is generated, by both humans and machines, far outpaces humans’ ability to absorb, interpret, and make complex decisions based on that data. Artificial intelligence forms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision making. As an example, most humans can figure out how to not lose at tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses), even though there are 255,168 unique moves, of which 46,080 end in a draw. Far fewer folks would be considered grand champions of checkers, with more than 500 x 1018, or 500 quintillion, different potential moves. Computers are extremely efficient at calculating these combinations and permutations to arrive at the best decision. AI (and its logical evolution of machine learning) and deep learning are the foundational future of business decision making.\nRequirement of Artificial intelligence\nApplications of AI can be seen in everyday scenarios such as financial services fraud detection, retail purchase predictions, and online customer support interactions. Here are just a few examples:\nFraud detection. The financial services industry uses artificial intelligence in two ways. Initial scoring of applications for credit uses AI to understand creditworthiness. More advanced AI engines are employed to monitor and detect fraudulent payment card transactions in real time.\nVirtual customer assistance (VCA). Call centers use VCA to predict and respond to customer inquiries outside of human interaction. Voice recognition, coupled with simulated human dialog, is the first point of interaction in a customer service inquiry. Higher-level inquiries are redirected to a human.\nWhen a person initiates dialog on a webpage via chat (chatbot), the person is often interacting with a computer running specialized AI. If the chatbot can’t interpret or address the question, a human intervenes to communicate directly with the person. These noninterpretive instances are fed into a machine-learning computation system to improve the AI application for future interactions.\nMachine Learning\nMachine Learning is naturally a subset of AI. It provides the statistical methods and algorithms and enables the machines/computers to learn automatically from their previous experiences and data and allows the program to change its behavior accordingly.",

      "description": "Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. Developed by the Apache Software Foundation, Hadoop is designed to scale up from a single server to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Its robust architecture ensures that applications can handle vast amounts of data efficiently, making it an essential tool in the era of big data. By breaking down large data sets into smaller, manageable chunks, Hadoop processes data in parallel, significantly speeding up the computation process.\nThe Hadoop framework is composed of four main modules: the Hadoop Common package, which contains the necessary Java Archive (JAR) files and scripts needed to start Hadoop; the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which provides high-throughput access to application data; Hadoop YARN, a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management; and Hadoop MapReduce, a YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets. HDFS ensures that data is stored across various nodes with redundancy, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.\nOne of Hadoop's most significant advantages is its ability to handle unstructured data, which is increasingly prevalent in today's data-driven world. Traditional databases struggle with unstructured data types such as text, images, and videos, but Hadoop's flexible storage and processing capabilities allow organizations to analyze these data types effectively. This flexibility makes Hadoop an invaluable tool for businesses and researchers looking to extract meaningful insights from diverse and complex data sources.\nHadoop has revolutionized data management and analytics, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for big data challenges. Its open-source nature encourages continuous improvement and innovation from a global community of developers and users. As a result, Hadoop continues to evolve, integrating with other technologies and frameworks to offer even more powerful data processing capabilities. Whether used for real-time data analytics, large-scale batch processing, or storage and retrieval of massive data sets, Hadoop remains a cornerstone technology in the field of big data.",

      "description": "Sustainability has become a popular term that is closely related to the principles of the circular economy. The circular economy aims to reduce the use of new natural resources by implementing various business models. Companies are increasingly adopting circular economy principles due to customer demand, regulations, and a desire to enhance their brand value. Businesses can help preserve natural resources and promote environmental regeneration by adopting circular economy concepts, transforming their linear supply chain into a circular supply chain. However, designing a circular supply chain for a product can be challenging, as it requires visualising the interaction between different supply chain partners and analysing its performance.\nanyLogistix is a leading supply chain analytics software that streamlines the design, optimisation, and analysis of a company's supply chain operations. It integrates powerful analytical optimisation and simulation methodologies to provide a platform for end-to-end supply chain analytics.\nBy combining simulation and optimisation techniques, anyLogistix enables companies to design and analyse the performance of a circular supply chain without actually implementing it in a real business.\nThis beginner's course provides an excellent foundation for learners to understand the concept of sustainability, its different types, and how it relates to the circular economy. It explains various business models that companies use to implement circular economy principles. One of the business models is then used to develop a comprehensive circular supply chain in anyLogistix. The course starts by developing a greenfield model that focuses on locating distribution centres and factories based on customer locations and demands. The outcome of the greenfield analysis is then used to develop a distribution centre, factory, recycling facility, and landfill network to optimise profits. Finally, a simulation model is developed to optimise inventory policies, profits, and revenue. The course provides a comprehensive explanation of how to analyse the simulation results.",

      "description": "Post implementation of any IT applications like ERP systems, there have long been a few fundamental challenges associated with business process management.\nThe  most troublesome problems happens over period of time with growth of transaction volume: Those are,\nProcess Bottleneck due to various reasons.\nNon-conformance of process.\nMajor problem involves the creation of “current state” processes — a description of how a business process is being performed today.\nIn business process reengineering, organizations are primarily interested in an improved “to be” process, so often they have little interest in exploring “as is,” or how the process is currently performed. It also become complex and complicated as time progress with not many tools earlier to study \"as is\" process. But understanding the current process is critical to knowing whether it is worth investing in improvements, where performance problems exist, and how much variation there is in the process across the organization.\nAs a result, some companies tend to either skip current process analysis altogether, adopt shortcuts to it, or pay consultants a lot of money to analyze the “as is” process.\nIn addition, their current process analysis is frequently based on interviews and sticky notes, which executives sometimes regard as overly subjective and treat with justifiable  skepticism. The other general problem with process management is the lack of connections between business processes and an organization’s enterprise ERP information systems\nSome enterprise systems (SAP, Oracle, for example) has become process-oriented in the sense that they support processes like order-to-cash or procure-to-pay,  but there is rarely an easy way to understand how the different process along with its variants are being executed in the ERP-information system. This make identification of issues to be complex as well\nEnter... Process mining and it can address all of these issues.\nIts a relatively new and innovative technology has the capability to solve both of the problems and to revitalize process management  in firms where it has lain fallow for years. Hence, this course provides you with complete details on Process Mining approch.\nTopics of coverage in the couses are :\n•Overview about ERP\n•Business process to ERP\n•Business process flow\n•Order to Cash Business Process flow\n•Procure to Pay Business Process Flow\n•Variation in Business flow.\n•ERP Audits\n•Process Mining\n•What is Process Mining?\n•Types of Process Mining\n•Benefits of Process Mining\n•Event Log\n•Output of Process Discovery\n•Getting Access to Celonis Free account\n•Datapool uploads with sample\n•Dataflow diagrams (DFDs).\n•Business Process Modeling Notation & Conformance Checking with Celonis\n•Analytics\n•Process Mining with sample Oracle EBS O2C transaction data.\n\n\nHappy Learning!!",

Understand how the insights will help leaders make strategies and policies to reduce offer dropout.\n\n\n\n\nThis course and all other courses in this series is the accumulation of all of our years of working in Data Science, Human Resource, learning, and teaching and all of the frustrations and incomplete information we have encountered along the way. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things. So, this course is the answer to that exact problem. Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked, and what hasn't and I've created this course to narrow down the best way to learn and the most relevant information.\nWe firmly believe that you won’t find a course like this out there that is as well organized, and as useful, to build a strong foundation for you.",

In this course students will learn statistical concepts and techniques, and econometrics tools and techniques through a mix of lectures on theoretical concepts and intuitions underlying statistical techniques, and practical application of statistical methods in solving real world business problems. The course covers basic to advanced level concepts, and allows students to learn both concepts and applications. After finishing this course students will have learnt how to use different statistical models to analyse any type of data to solve business problems; and how to study trends in data and use these trends to infer about the business setting they are studying. The course will also allow students to gain a better understanding of key concepts and the nuances in statistical methods. Statistics isn't a one size fits all discipline, and hence for different types of data and contexts, different analytical tools and models are required. This course goes beyond the simple linear regression and logistic regression techniques that are taught in most data analysis and data science classes, and exposes the students to advanced techniques meant for datasets which aren't appropriate for linear regression. The course also has hands on practical lessons on the GRETL ( GNU Regression, time series and econometrics library) software , through which students will learn how to use GRETL to implement advanced statistics and econometrics models. The course covers the following topics:\n1. Hypothesis Testing\n2. Correlation.\n3. Simple Linear Regression.\n4. Multiple linear regression.\n5. Logistic Regression.\n6. Multinomial Logistic Regression.\n7. Ordinal Logit Model.\n8. Probit Model.\n9. Limitations of Linear Regression.\n10. Time Series analysis and autocorrelation.\n11. Panel Dta Regression.\n12.

      ],
      "description": "Your analytical thinking and coaching skills will determine whether you thrive in the increasingly-disrupted post-COVID future of work.\n\n\nYet traditional advice in analytical thinking so often leads to disasters, as revealed by research in behavioral economics, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. So what are the best practices for Fortune 500 firms to make the right calls on analytical thinking and coaching scenarios?\n\n\nFortune 500 firms recognize that behavioral science has revealed that our typical approach to analytical thinking skills suffers from systematic dangerous judgment errors called cognitive biases. Fortunately, recent scholarship has revealed effective yet counterintuitive strategies to enable you to defeat these cognitive biases. In this course, you will learn about and address these dangerous judgment errors, while mastering techniques for analytical thinking and coaching drawing on cutting-edge behavioral science and real-world best practices from Fortune 500 companies.\n\n\nAfter taking this course, you will:\n· Solve typical challenges in analytical thinking and coaching scenarios using Fortune 500 firm best practices\n· Master emotional and social intelligence research-based approaches to analytical thinking and coaching\n· Develop a plan with specific next steps to adapt for your toolkit analytical thinking and coaching best practices from Fortune 500 firms\n· Discover how Fortune 500 firms defeat dangerous judgment errors (cognitive biases) that harm quality assurance & analytical thinking & coaching\n· Align these strategies with International Coaching Federation Core Competencies for analytical thinking and coaching skills\n\n\nHere’s a recent testimonial from Cheryl Smith, Global Director of Talent Management, Organizational Capabilities, and Diversity at Xerox, a company ranked #415 by Fortune, about the impact of my coaching for her:\n· “I really like your coaching style. You ask meaningful questions without 'leading the witness.' It's a great fit for executives.\"\n\n\nHere’s a recent testimonial from Leon Vliegen, Owner, FLY Consult, about the impact of this course for him:\n· \"It was a great learning experience and I can apply a lot of the concepts and thinking in my coaching practice and leadership programs that our organization FLY Consult performs for a number of clients. I and we focus strongly on helping people to make mindful and effective decisions. This program has deepened and broadened my knowledge and insight in an excellent way. Dr. Gleb Tsipursky is clearly at the edge of this field of science and practice. I can recommend the program strongly.\"\n\n\nHere's another recent testimonial by Susan Winchester, the Chief Human Resource Officer at Applied Materials, a Fortune 200 high-tech manufacturing company:\n· “Hi, I'm Susan Winchester, and it's my delight and pleasure to tell you a little bit about our experience with Dr. Gleb. He had a big positive impact at Applied Materials. Our leaders and engineers love data-based, research-based insights, which is exactly what he brings. He hit it out of the park, and he used a team led process, which was incredibly engaging. He introduced us to a concept he created called asynchronous brainstorming. It was a process we used with hundreds and hundreds of leaders globally at the same time. We did this during our CEO kickoff session for our strategy work. In a very short amount of time, we were able to get great benefits. I also love the work he's doing to educate leaders around the power and positive benefits of hybrid and virtual working. And one of his techniques that I'm planning to use is what he calls “virtual coworking”, where you and as many coworkers as you'd like create a virtual meeting, no purpose or agenda, but rather just to be working with one another. I highly endorse Dr. Gleb's work with leadership teams.”\n\n\nThis course has received International Coaching Federation (ICF) approval for 12 continuing coaching education (CCE) credits, including 5 core competency credits and 7 resource development credits (Resource Development includes training formerly called Personal Development, Business Development, or Other Skills and Tools).\n\n\nICF Core Competencies Covered in the Course\nCreating awareness in analytically-minded people of their emotions and situations when their analytical mindset may be causing them problems\nDirect communication with analytically-minded people, balancing hard data and research with than stories and questions\nEstablishing trust and intimacy, through using the kind of evidence that’s convincing to analytically-minded people\nActive listening, to determine whether someone’s learning style is deductive or inductive and targeting their specific information consumption needs\nEstablishing the coaching agreement, focusing on preparing for the almost-inevitable conflicts and addressing emotions\n\n\nSounds too good to be true? I used these methods successfully at Fortune 500 companies such as Aflac, Applied Materials, Entergy, Honda, IBM, Reckitt, Wells Fargo, and Xerox. Over the last two decades, I coached and trained the leaders at these Fortune 500 companies, as well as at numerous middle-market companies and quickly-growing startups, as the CEO of the boutique future-proofing consultancy Disaster Avoidance Experts.\n\n\nBesides such real-world, pragmatic expertise, I have a strong academic background as a behavioral scientist studying analytical thinking, coaching, decision making, and emotional and social intelligence. I spent 8 years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, first getting a PhD and then serving as a lecturer there. Then, I spent 7 years as a professor at the Ohio State University’s Decision Sciences Collaborative and History Department. There, I published dozens of peer-reviewed articles on this topic in high-quality academic journals such as Behavior and Social Issues and Journal of Social and Political Psychology. Thus, this course is thoroughly informed by cutting-edge research.\n\n\nThis combination of business and science led to my expertise gaining global recognition. I published over 550 articles and gave over 450 interviews for prominent venues, such as Fortune, USA Today, CNBC, Fast Company, CBS News, Business Insider, Inc. Magazine, and Time.\n\n\nThat's what you can expect in this course: methods used successfully at even the biggest companies, thoroughly informed by cutting-edge research, and featured in top media venues and best-selling books around the globe.\n\n\nCourse Content and Structure Overview\nThe textbook for this course is my bestseller on analytical thinking and coaching, The Truth-Seeker’s Handbook: A Science-Based Guide.\nThe course is self-paced, consisting of modules which the participants can complete any time they want.\nFor each module, participants in the course will first read the book chapters. Then, participants will answer questions in the book chapters. Each chapter has references for additional readings that participants are invited to check out for additional context on any concepts about which they wish to learn more.\nNext, participants will watch the video for each segment, which uses case studies to apply the content of the readings to real-life coaching scenarios\nAfter each video, the participants should journal for 20-30 minutes about how they can apply the strategies described in the book and video to their coaching\nI look forward to welcoming you into the world of evidence-based, science-driven techniques tested in the real world of many Fortune 500 companies and numerous middle-market companies and startups.

      "description": "Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.\nData visualization brings data to life, making you the master storyteller of the insights hidden within your numbers. Through live data dashboards, interactive reports, charts, graphs, and other visual representations, data visualization helps users develop powerful business insight quickly and effectively.\nHidden within your data lie important insights that can help drive business forward. But the challenge is that you can’t always connect the dots by looking at raw numbers alone. When you look at your data presented in a visual format, patterns, connections, and other “a-ha” insights emerge that would otherwise remain out of sight.\nBeing able to see the story within the numbers makes data visualization a powerful tool for sharing and communicating information. Data visualization can be used for demonstrating performance, communicating trends, understanding the impact of new strategies, showing relationships, and beyond. These representations can be powerful tools for communication and collaboration, bringing greater value to reports, journalism, apps, or any context where sharing information is required.\nBringing visual clarity to the story told within your data helps you identify insights that lead to better decision making, planning, strategies, and actions. How is your business performing, what needs to be modified, and where should you focus your resources? The ability to understand the significance of your data drives more effective operations and decisions.\nWhile stunning, rich visuals can be great tools for communicating ideas, the end benefit of data visualization is its ability to drive better decision making.\nA database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.",

Technology evolves, and so do the challenges in interviews. Our dedicated team of experts constantly reviews and updates the questions to keep them relevant and aligned with the latest industry trends. This means that you'll always have access to the most current and valuable Hadoop interview questions, giving you a competitive edge in your job search.\nSample Practice Test Questions with Detailed Explanations:\nTo give you a taste of what to expect in this course, here are five sample practice test questions, each accompanied by detailed explanations:\nQuestion 1:\nWhich Hadoop component is responsible for resource management and job scheduling in a Hadoop cluster?\nA) HDFS\nB) MapReduce\nC) YARN\nD) Pig\nExplanation: YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is responsible for resource management and job scheduling in a Hadoop cluster. It separates the resource management and job scheduling functions, allowing for more efficient cluster utilization. HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is the distributed file storage system, while MapReduce is the processing framework. Pig is a high-level scripting language used for data processing on Hadoop.\nQuestion 2:\nWhat is the primary function of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)?\nA) Real-time data processing\nB) Data storage\nC) Data analysis\nD) Job scheduling\nExplanation: The primary function of HDFS is data storage. It is designed to store vast amounts of data across multiple machines in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner. While Hadoop is known for its data processing capabilities, HDFS is responsible for storing the data efficiently.\nQuestion 3:\nWhat is the purpose of a reducer in the MapReduce framework?\nA) Data sorting\nB) Data splitting\nC) Data mapping\nD) Data aggregation\nExplanation: The purpose of a reducer in the MapReduce framework is data aggregation. Reducers take the output of the mappers, which consists of key-value pairs, and perform aggregation operations on the data, such as summing values or calculating averages. Reducers help in summarizing and processing the mapped data.\nQuestion 4:\nWhich Hadoop ecosystem tool is commonly used for querying and analyzing data using SQL-like queries?\nA) Apache Hive\nB) Apache Pig\nC) Apache HBase\nD) Apache Oozie\nExplanation: Apache Hive is commonly used for querying and analyzing data using SQL-like queries in the Hadoop ecosystem. It provides a high-level language called HiveQL that allows users to write queries to retrieve and analyze data stored in HDFS.\nQuestion 5:\nWhat is the purpose of Apache Sqoop in Hadoop?\nA) Data transfer between Hadoop and relational databases\nB) Real-time data processing\nC) Data aggregation in HDFS\nD) Resource management in YARN\nExplanation: The primary purpose of Apache Sqoop in Hadoop is to facilitate data transfer between Hadoop and relational databases. It allows users to import data from relational databases into HDFS and export data from HDFS to relational databases, enabling seamless data integration between the two environments.\nThese sample questions and explanations are just a glimpse of the in-depth learning experience you'll receive in this course. Each topic is accompanied by similar practice test questions with detailed explanations to ensure you not only know the answers but also understand the underlying concepts.\nEnroll Now:\nJoin our comprehensive Hadoop practice test course today and take the first step towards acing your Hadoop interviews.

All you need is a computer, internet and willingness to learn.\nPython is one of the most popular programming languages (and this is important because if you get stuck there should be plenty of help on the internet for you). Python is found in applications everywhere, ranging from research to industry, as well as entertainment industry. Programming in general allows for you to greatly reduce workload, as well as solve problems that would be impossible to solve by hand, or create great, new, and fun applications/software.\nSQL is the language that you can use to interact with one major database type (SQL databases), one that is very wide-spread in today's world. Knowing SQL will give you a nice ability and understanding of how to handle data and databases, and being able to integrate it into Python code enables you to create great, dynamic, and automatic systems that combine the power of programming and data. Python and SQL can also convert all your data sitting in CSV or numerous excel files into an organised structure which is both light to view and easy to manipulate.\nThis course will be using SQLite3 in Python, which allows us to execute SQL commands through python, and will allow you to create, connect, use, and manage local SQL-based databases. And finally we will utilise Flask to create a HTML web application to dislpay your SQL database.",

On one side, organizations still rely on proven data modeling and business intelligence fundamentals — star schemas, facts and dimensions, data warehouses, and ETL pipelines. On the other side, AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are transforming the way we design, implement, and optimize data models.\nThis course brings both worlds together. It gives you a solid foundation in traditional data modeling while showing you how to use AI as a co-pilot in your daily work. You’ll learn how to design conceptual, logical, and physical models, build data warehouses and data marts, and understand how ETL and OLAP vs. OLTP systems shape your architecture. At the same time, you’ll discover how ChatGPT and Copilot can help you brainstorm schemas, generate SQL code, check data quality, and even document your models.\nUnlike many theory-heavy courses, this one is practical and hands-on. You’ll work with free tools like MySQL Workbench and dbdiagram to create your models, build ETL flows with Apache Hop, and connect your data to Power BI for analytics. You’ll also tackle realistic dirty datasets, practicing data cleansing and transformation just like you would in a real project.\nThe highlight of the course is the FastBite Capstone Project, a simulated food delivery business. You’ll start from raw source data, design the dimensional model, implement a data warehouse in MySQL, build ETL flows to populate your fact and dimension tables, and finally connect to Power BI to answer real business questions. Along the way, you’ll learn how to use AI tools as your assistant: to suggest schema designs, classify facts and dimensions, generate transformation logic, and write documentation.\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nApply AI support with ChatGPT and Copilot at every stage of the modeling workflow\nConfidently design and implement data warehouses and data marts\nMaster dimensional modeling with star schemas, SCDs, facts, dimensions, and additivity\nUnderstand the role of ETL/ELT pipelines and where to implement logic\nBuild a portfolio-ready project that proves your skills in data modeling and business intelligence\nThis is the modern way to learn data modeling: combining classic BI best practices with AI-powered productivity.\nIf you want to build strong foundations in data modeling and business intelligence, while also learning how to leverage AI tools to become a faster and smarter data professional, this course is for you.",

But in this course I show how important and insightful descriptive statistics can be. Concepts such as skew, and kurtosis for example are pivotal in understanding the dispersion and distribution of data, and in this course I teach the intuition underlying these measures and their applications.\nThe following measurements will be taught in the course:\n1. Mean\n2. Median\n3. Mode\n4. Variance\n5. Standard Deviation.\n6. Standard Error.\n7. Maximum\n8. Minimum.\n9. Range.\n10. Rank\n11. Percentile.\n12. Skewness.\n13. Kurtosis\n14. Outliers\nAlso, in this course, using Excel, I teach how descriptive statistical measures can be obtained easily in the form of statistical reports.\nIn this course I use real world data to demonstrate concepts, and at the end of the course the students will be provided with a  dataset to apply the techniques learnt in Excel.\nFurther, in this course, I  teach about the most commonly used plots for data visualization. I teach how each plot is generated, what it represents and what can be inferred from them.\nI, then, show how the plots can be generated with Excel and how data is visualised using Excel.\nThe following types of plots are taught:\n1. Bar Plot\n2. Pie Chart.\n3. X-Y Scatter Plot\n4. Histogram.\n5. Line Plot\n6. Box and Whisker Plot.\nAt the end of the course, you'll be well equipped to visualise data in Excel and interpret the visualised plots.\n\n\nThe course is meant for students who want to learn basic statistics, and understand how basic statistics can be used to draw inferences about the nature of data. The methods taught in the course will allow students to draw the following inferences:\n1. Is the data widely dispersed.\n2. Does the data have outliers.\n3. Is the data skewed?\n4. Is the distribution normal?\n5. What is the structure of data?\n6. What does the statistical measures tell about the dataset?\n\n\nThe course is structured as follows:\n1. Activating data analysis toolkits in Excel.\n2. Descriptive Statistics measures and concepts, their definition, intuition.\n3. Descriptive Statistics in Excel.\n4. Different types of plots.\n5. Data Visualisation in Excel.",

      "description": "Web scraping is the process of collecting structured web data in an automated fashion. It’s also called web data extraction. Some of the main use cases of web scraping include price monitoring, price intelligence, news monitoring, lead generation, and market research among many others.\nIn general, web data extraction is used by people and businesses who want to make use of the vast amount of publicly available web data to make smarter decisions.\nIf you’ve ever copied and pasted information from a website, you’ve performed the same function as any web scraper, only on a microscopic, manual scale. Unlike the mundane, mind-numbing process of manually extracting data, web scraping uses intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet’s seemingly endless frontier.\nWeb data extraction – also widely known as data scraping – has a huge range of applications. A data scraping tool can help you automate the process of extracting information from other websites, quickly and accurately. It can also make sure the data you’ve extracted is neatly organized, making it easier to analyse and use for other projects.\nIn the world of e-commerce, web data scraping is widely used for competitor price monitoring. It’s the only practical way for brands to check the pricing of their competitors’ products and services, allowing them to fine-tune their own price strategies and stay ahead of the game. It’s also used as a tool for manufacturers to ensure retailers are compliant with pricing guidelines for their products. Market research organizations and analysts depend on web data extraction to gauge consumer sentiment by keeping track of online product reviews, news articles, and feedback.\nThere’s a vast array of applications for data extraction in the financial world. Data scraping tools are used to extract insight from news stories, using this information to guide investment strategies. Similarly, researchers and analysts depend on data extraction to assess the financial health of companies. Insurance and financial services companies can mine a rich seam of alternative data scraped from the web to design new products and policies for their customers.\n\n\nIn this course we will be building scraping bots (scripts) using JavaScript and then use them with the YouTube  Data API to scrape data from  YouTube.",

      "description": "Business process mapping details the steps that a business takes to complete a process, such as hiring an employee or ordering and shipping a product. They show \"who\", \"what\", \"when\", \"where\" and \"how\" for these steps, and help to analyze the \"why\". These maps are also called business process diagrams and business flow charts. Like other types of diagrams, these maps use symbols such as circles, rectangles, diamonds and arrows to depict the business activities.\nBusiness processes mapping can be used to document a current process and to model a new one. Its purpose is to gain a detailed understanding of the process, people, inputs, controls and outputs, and then potentially to simplify it all, make it more efficient and/ or improve the process results. It requires time and discipline to conduct this mapping, but the payoff can be significantly overtime. Mapping has become common in the business world to standardize procedures, become more efficient, meet audit requirements and gain competitive advantage.\nBusiness process mapping is better for some types of processes than others. For example, it usually does not lend itself to diagramming decision-making processes. High level, open-ended decision making often has too many intangibles and wild cards to effectively map.\nbusiness process is better for other two types of processes: transformational and transactional, both of which have more clearly defined activities.",

      ],
      "description": "What's this course about?\nThis is the first part of a series of analytics courses that are fine-tuned for product managers. It covers a carefully-curated list of topics like outlier analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cohort analysis. These topics are taught using product management specific use cases for immediate application to your daily work. The overarching goal of the course is to enable product mangers influence customers and stakeholders using data.\n\n\nWhat’s unique about this course? Why should I care?\nFirst, this is not a programming language course. This course teaches you to use R as a tool to advance your career and business goals. The R notebooks provided with this course are meant to be run with minimal training. They have been rigorously tested on Windows and Mac. Updates if any, will be posted in a timely manner. This was done so learners can focus on modifying the notebooks for their specific needs.\n\n\nHow will it benefit me?\nThis is a highly curated course with a very narrow target learner - the product manager. With this course, product managers will save months of time they would spend learning R and applying it to their work. The curriculum focuses on practical implementation so the material is concise and precise. You will not be bombarded with hours of lectures and hundreds of source files only to find yourself confused about what's next.\n\n\nWhy R?\nR is a scripting language that is widely used by research scientists and statisticians - not software programmers. It is easy to learn and master and you get results instantaneously. If scientists, with little or no programming skills can master R, so can you. R has a very active and solid community that maintains existing functionality and regularly introduces new innovation. As R is statistical software, you will find several excellent packages for every statistical procedure imaginable. What's more, you can also write powerful ML models in R easily.\n\n\nThe best part is that R is free and secure. It is not as CPU-hungry as most spreadsheet tools and can be run in the cloud as well. It also works seamlessly with popular IDEs like VS Code.\n\n\nHow do I use it at work?\nRemember, this course has been created by a product manager for other product managers. The code samples can be run straight out of the box and modified endlessly.\n\n\nThe R Notebooks contain all the code being taught in the class. They can be run on any Windows or Mac laptop. It is highly recommended that you take a hands-on and curious approach to this course. Modify the files to suit your needs.\n\n\nWhat does this course cover?\nThis course focuses on descriptive analytic techniques to facilitate data-driven decision making and cross-functional collaboration. In addition, this course covers entry-level data engineering topics like EDA and data management. These topics are introduced early to serve as foundations for the rest of the course. Three key career skills are addressed for product managers:\nCross Functional Collaboration\nCreating a Reproducible Data Analysis Environment\nCreating a Master Dataset for Inter-departmental Collaboration\nStorytelling with Data\nBuilding Customer Profiles\nSegmentation Using Indicators\nTranslating Feature Usage to Retention\nLearning from Extreme Customers\nAutomation of Data Analysis Tasks\nAutomating the Data Curation Process\nCreating Reproducible Reports\nIn future courses, I will cover prescriptive and predictive techniques.\n\n\nAre there any copyright issues\nR is a very popular language and there are thousands of free and paid resources available on the internet. To avoid copyright infringement, I have developed the data set used in this course. It is not copied from any paid or free repository. All the code in this course has been developed by me.\n\n\nWhat if I have problems?\nIf you have questions about the course, send me a note in the course and I will respond within 24 hours.\n\n\nHow long will it take me?\nThe total course duration is approximately 5 hours spanning 9 sections. By blocking off 1-hour or so a day, you can finish the course in 10 days. You can also go at in Boot Camp style and finish it over a weekend.\n\n\nTo get the most out of this course, prioritize your learning time and stick to the plan. There is no shame is copy-pasting code and there are no brownie points for memorizing the function and parameter names. If you obsess over them, you will not do yourself any justice. Just understand the overall flow of each lesson and how the code is organized. Focus on running the notebook and studying the results. Then modify the code to suit your needs, run the notebooks, and study the results again. Rinse and repeat.\n\n\nWhat kind of machine do I need?\nIn comparison to traditional spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, R is not a resource-intensive software. A Windows or Mac laptop with 8 GB of RAM is more than sufficient to run the exercises in this course. Check the R and R Studio sites for detailed system requirements.",

Think no more, for this Learning Path guides you how to integrate Elasticsearch - the world renowned scalable and fast open-source search server - with your AngularJS app.\nElasticsearch is a search server that also doubles up as a NoSQL data store, and hence provides lightning-fast search functionality within a website. Moreover, you can rapidly scale up a website using Elasticsearch. It is also highly available, meaning that a website would almost never face any downtime or lags, when having an Elasticsearch backend; which is also attributed to its NoSQL nature.\nAngularJS is a web framework powered by Google, that has revolutionized web development over the past few years. With its advanced and unique 2-way data binding between the data and the UI, strong template-building solutions, code reuse features, allowing the creation of custom DOM elements whenever needed, AngularJS can indeed be said to be the framework of the future.\nElasticsearch and AngularJS: IntraWeb Search is Packt’s Video Learning Path that is a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that each video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.\nFirstly, we would be looking at getting started with AngularJS. We will be looking forward to developing a strong foundation in AngularJS by learning the basics, and then moving on to topics such as controllers, templates, routing, and services.\nNext, we would be studying about Elasticsearch right from the basics, so that our concepts are built well. Moving on, we would be learning about how to create queries to enable searching data in an Elasticsearch data store. Finally, we would be looking in detail at integrating Elasticsearch with an AngularJS application, and improving the search features by tweaking various configurations, so as to boost the overall efficiency and scalability.\nBy the end of this course , you will have developed a strong foundation in Elasticsearch and understood the basics of AngularJS well enough to integrate Elasticsearch with an AngularJS application environment and improve its performance drastically.\nThe goal of this course is to teach you to integrate Elasticsearch with an AngularJS-based app and improve the overall performance and scalability of your application.\nThis course is authored by some of the best in the field.\nDaniel Beach is a search architect, specializing in client-side application development.\nHe works at OpenSource Connections where he has built search applications for organizations ranging from publishers to government agencies.\n\nMathieu Chauvinc is a Managing Director at Red Ape Solutions. He has been involved in web technologies for over a decade, from Django, Node.js, Go, SQL, NoSQL, Mootools, and Angular 2. He has also studied in Karlsruhe University, Germany. He has authored several video courses, such as ‘Learning JavaScript Promises’ and ‘Introducing Ionic 2’.",

Power Query is a data connection technology that enables you to discover, connect, combine, and refine data across a wide variety of sources. In Power BI, Power Query is used primarily for data transformation tasks, such as filtering, sorting, and merging data, making it a crucial tool for preparing your data for analysis.\nWhich DAX function is used to calculate the total year-to-date sales?\nA) TOTALYTD()\nB) SUM()\nC) CALCULATE()\nD) YEARFRAC()\nExplanation: A) TOTALYTD() is the correct choice. The TOTALYTD function calculates the year-to-date value of a measure, such as sales, for the current context. It's a time intelligence function that allows for easy calculation of total values within a specified date range, essential for temporal data analysis in Power BI.\nWhat is the purpose of using star schema in Power BI data modeling?\nA) To optimize query performance\nB) To create complex relationships\nC) To enable row-level security\nD) To visualize data more effectively\nExplanation: The answer is A) To optimize query performance. A star schema is a type of database schema that is optimized for data warehousing and business intelligence applications, including Power BI. It consists of a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables, which simplifies the data model and improves query performance, making it a popular choice for data modeling in Power BI.\nWhich of the following is not a Power BI visualization type?\nA) Pie chart\nB) Gantt chart\nC) Funnel chart\nD) Radar chart\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) Gantt chart. While Power BI offers a wide range of visualization types, including pie, funnel, and radar charts, it does not natively include Gantt charts. However, Gantt charts can be created in Power BI using custom visuals available through the Power BI marketplace.\nIn Power BI, what is the purpose of row-level security?\nA) To optimize data refresh rates\nB) To manage user permissions on reports\nC) To secure individual rows of data based on user roles\nD) To enhance data visualization clarity\nExplanation: The correct choice is C) To secure individual rows of data based on user roles. Row-level security (RLS) in Power BI allows you to restrict data access for given users. By implementing RLS, you can control which data is visible to which user, based on filters that apply to specific rows in your dataset. This feature is crucial for maintaining data security and privacy, especially in scenarios where multiple users access the same reports but require different data access levels.\nEnroll now and take your Power BI skills to the next level!

      "description": "The tools of business continue to change and grow. Long ago, paper and pencil replaced rote memory and more recently were themselves replaced by computers. Analysts used to work out calculations on calculators, then switched to spreadsheet applications, like Excel. Understanding SQL used to be a skill reserved for IT personnel; now, SQL is becoming an indispensable analytical tool in the modern workplace. Just like spreadsheets were once a tool known only to specialists but are now ubiquitous in the workplace, likewise SQL is beginning to become more accessible throughout organizations.\nThis course focuses on the SELECT statement in SQL so stays squarely in the realm of Data Query Language (DQL) commands. Although this focus may sound limiting, understanding the SELECT statement is essential for many of the other commands, since typically the data will need to be selected first before doing something else with it. As well, many of the standard and exotic commands and functions can be easily presented with a SELECT statement, and mastery of this beginning set will prepare people for further explorations into SQL.\nI learned everything I know about SQL on the job, and so can you. After teaching for 10 years, I was pulled into IT at my first corporate position and have used SQL in every role since then. I know what it is like to learn a keyword for the first time, to start exploring its uses, to be shown tricks and techniques using it by others, and to eventually gain a deeper understanding of why it works the way it does. I have trained many others in SQL in companies large and small, including some Fortune 50 companies. I have compiled my experiences and curated from those lessons what I believe to be the important initial steps to share with you. (Those of you from my past training sessions will likely recognize parts of these lessons!) I trust you will take this knowledge, and Spirit willing, share it with others.\nSo, without further ado, let's begin. Please click on the first lecture in section 1, the starting point to work your way through this course.",

      "description": "The data analyst serves as a gatekeeper for an organization's data so stakeholders can understand data and use it to make strategic business decisions.\nBusiness intelligence (BI) helps organizations analyze historical and current data, so they can quickly uncover actionable insights for making strategic decisions. Business intelligence tools make this possible by processing large data sets across multiple sources and presenting findings in visual formats that are easy to understand and share.\nThere are four keys steps that business intelligence follows to transform raw data into easy-to-digest insights for everyone in the organization to use. The first three—data collection, analysis, and visualization—set the stage for the final decision-making step. Before using BI, businesses had to do much of their analysis manually, but BI tools automate many of the processes and save companies time and effort.\nStep 1: Collect and transform data from multiple sources\nBusiness intelligence tools typically use the extract, transform, and load (ETL) method to aggregate structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. This data is then transformed and remodeled before being stored in a central location, so applications can easily analyze and query it as one comprehensive data set.\nStep 2: Uncover trends and inconsistencies\nData mining, or data discovery, typically uses automation to quickly analyze data to find patterns and outliers which provide insight into the current state of business. BI tools often feature several types of data modeling and analytics—including exploratory, descriptive, statistical, and predictive—that further explore data, predict trends, and make recommendations.\nStep 3: Use data visualization to present findings\nBusiness intelligence reporting uses data visualizations to make findings easier to understand and share. Reporting methods include interactive data dashboards, charts, graphs, and maps that help users see what’s going on in the business right now.\nBusiness intelligence is applied differently from business to business and across a range of sectors—finance, retail and consumer goods, energy, technology, government, education, healthcare, manufacturing, and professional services. Here’s how business intelligence is being used by different industries to achieve success.\nPower BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\nPython is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\nPandas is an open-source python library that is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides many functions and methods to speed up the data analysis process.  It is one of the most important and useful tools in the arsenal of a Data Scientist and a Data Analyst.",

Depending on your level of familiarity with this technology, these answers may either bring you closer to an ah-ha moment or further confuse you. But the truth is, all of these answers are correct and that’s part of the appeal of Elasticsearch. Over the years, Elasticsearch and the ecosystem of components that’s grown around it called the “Elastic Stack” has been used for a growing number of use cases, from simple search on a website or document, collecting and analyzing log data, to a business intelligence tool for data analysis and visualization\nElasticsearch is a distributed, open-source search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene and developed in Java. It started as a scalable version of the Lucene open-source search framework then added the ability to horizontally scale Lucene indices. Elasticsearch allows you to store, search, and analyze huge volumes of data quickly and in near real-time and give back answers in milliseconds. It’s able to achieve fast search responses because instead of searching the text directly, it searches an index. It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schemas and comes with extensive REST APIs for storing and searching the data. At its core, you can think of Elasticsearch as a server that can process JSON requests and give you back JSON data.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the best overview/starter point for those who are keen to learn about elasticsearch and kibana.\nBy the end of this course you should be able to interact with elasticsearch and tweak it to some extend.",

So:\n- statistics is a tool of the scientific method in science, which has several components (observation, hypothesis development, empirical data analysis, conclusion);\n- variables are characteristics of reality that can take different values and are directly measurable;\n- latent variables express science constructs measured indirectly by means of indicators (observed variables);\n- descriptive statistics deals with the organization, synthesis, description and presentation of data;\n- inferential statistics deals with the generalization of the results at the level of the population from which the sample was drawn and supports conclusions regarding the research hypotheses;\n- the dependent variables are those that are the object of the researcher's direct interest, being measured in order to draw a conclusion;\n- the independent variables represent the condition or context from which the variation in the values of the dependent variable results and are those variables that the researcher manipulates;\n- the population represents the totality of information units that constitute the objective of interest of a research. As a rule, in social and human sciences the units of information represent persons;\n- the sample represents a selection, based on a certain rule, of the units of information, with the aim of drawing conclusions about the population . A sample is representative when its characteristics fairly reproduce the characteristics of the population from which it was drawn. Sample representativeness is always imperfect (contains some error);\n- measurement means assigning numbers or symbols to some characteristics of reality (objective or subjective) according to certain aspects (quantitative or qualitative);\n- measurement levels are: nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio (they are ordered hierarchically which means that the higher scales include the properties of the lower scales). Levels are also called measurement scales. In statistical programs Measure columns contain three coding options (nominal, ordinal, scales). For the first two options (nominal and ordinal) the measurements are equivalent.",

      "description": "A Data warehouse is a database that is used for data analysis and reporting. It is a central repository for all the data that is needed for reporting and analysis. Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.\nA data warehouse may contain multiple databases. Within each database, data is organized into tables and columns. Within each column, you can define a description of the data, such as integer, data field, or string. Tables can be organized inside of schemas, which you can think of as folders. When data is ingested, it is stored in various tables described by the schema. Query tools use the schema to determine which data tables to access and analyze.\nA data warehouse is specially designed for data analytics, which involves reading large amounts of data to understand relationships and trends across the data. A database is used to capture and store data, such as recording details of a transaction.\nThe course is a right blend of concepts with right examples for making the topics easier which includes\n2+ hours of on demand videos\nClarifications through community\nUnderstand everything step by step from the absolute basics to the advanced topics\nHere is what you'll learn:\nWhat is a Data Warehouse?\nWhat is the need for Data Warehouse?\nHistory of Data Warehouse\nOLTP & OLAP\nIntroduction to ETL\nExtraction, Transformation and Load data in ETL\nTypes of Transformation\nData Warehouse Architecture\nData Warehouse Architectures based on layers and Tires\nData Mart\nStoring Data in Data Warehouse\nDimension Tables and Fact Tables\nDimension and Fact table with Example\nData Warehouse Schema and Types\nSlowly Changing Dimensions Introduction and Types\nETL Tools\nScheduling the Tools\nReporting Tools",

      "description": "Why Take This Course?\nDashboards are everywhere; good judgment isn’t. Many people stare at numbers yet miss what matters—context, quality, hidden groups, or the fact that a flashy spike came from one bulk order. This course gives you a repeatable way to question data before you act.\n\n\nWhy this course is unique?\nMost courses teach tools; this one trains judgment. No code—just a 4‑step loop, 20+ mini cases, and checklists you’ll use in real decisions tomorrow.\n\n\nWhat This Course Covers?\nSee beyond headline numbers: noise vs signal.\nRead context fast (timing, seasonality, external shocks).\nSpot common traps: cherry‑picking, bias, confounding, Simpson’s Paradox.\nJudge data quality: accuracy, timeliness, representativeness, completeness, consistency.\nUse both numbers and comments (quant + qual) for a full view.\nThink like an analyst: stats sanity, outliers, trends vs anomalies, correlation vs causation.\nPick the right metric for the goal; don’t celebrate vanity numbers.\nEstimate when data is missing; stress‑test assumptions.\n\n\nWho Is It For?\nAnyone who makes choices using numbers—even if Excel scares you. Students, founders, operators, managers, analysts‑in‑training, marketers, product folks, educators, non‑profits, and curious self‑learners. No technical background needed.\n\n\nWhat This Course Is NOT?\nNo Python. No SQL. No statistical software lessons. No machine learning. We focus on thinking, interpretation, and decision framing. If you later want tools, you’ll use them far better after this mindset.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes (What You’ll Be Able To Do)\nBy the end you can:\nAsk the right first question when a metric moves.\nBreak a top‑line number into parts to find the driver.\nSeparate noise from a real signal.\nCheck for missing context (season, holiday, outages, policy changes).\nIdentify cherry‑picking, bias, and confounding claims in reports or media.\nUse a 5‑point data quality check before trusting any dataset.\nCombine quant & qual feedback to see hidden pain points.\nRead basic stats (mean, median, spread) without getting fooled by outliers.\nTell correlation from likely cause using the 5C test; design a lightweight experiment when you need proof.\nChoose metrics that match goals (growth, retention, engagement, revenue quality, etc.).\nBuild quick estimates when data is missing; run simple sensitivity ranges to judge risk.\n\n\nSection‑by‑Section Promises\nEach section starts with a real question learners face, then moves into examples and a mini exercise.\n1. Understanding Data ≠ Reading Numbers\nNoise vs signal, why more data can confuse, how context flips meaning, everyday data examples\nMini cases: E‑commerce revenue drop (noise); Café holiday slump (context); Sleep tracker quality vs duration; App onboarding “churn” that was friction.\n2. Hidden Traps That Mislead Smart People\nCherry‑picking, confounding variables, bias & bad sampling, survivorship bias, Simpson’s Paradox, media claim teardown (gender admit headline)\nMini cases: Campaign spin; Ice cream vs drowning; Loyalty survey blind spot; WWII aircraft armor; University admit rates vs totals.\n3. Foundations: Data Types, Sampling & Quality\nQuant, qual, mixed data; sampling methods (random, segmented, bias pitfalls); picking sample sizes; 5‑point data quality check; source check (Who/Why/What’s missing?)\nMini cases: 5‑star restaurant yet flat sales; App store review sample error; Overweighting older users; Silent majority churn; Influencer engagement illusion.\n4. Think Like a Data Analyst\nQuick stat sanity (mean, median, mode, range, std dev); subgroup masking; correlation vs causation; 5C test; when to experiment; outliers vs system issues; trend windows beyond 12 months\nMini cases: Salary bands hidden in averages; Commute vs productivity; Bulk order spike misread as ad win; Login drop caused by outage; Seasonal January dip.\n5. Pick the Right Metric, Solve the Right Problem\nMatch goal → metric; avoid vanity counts; growth % vs raw signups; activation & retention beats installs; when data’s missing—estimate, sanity check, sensitivity\nMini cases: SaaS signup spike that fooled leadership; Tire market size estimation walk‑through; Stress‑testing what breaks your decision.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThis course teaches data interpretation for education only. It does not provide professional statistical, financial, medical, or legal advice. Examples use public, simplified, or anonymized data. Always validate critical decisions with qualified experts and your own datasets.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Google Analytics 4 (GA4): Real-Time Insights & Web Analytics course by Uplatz.\n\n\nGoogle Analytics (GA) is a web analytics tool that helps businesses track and analyze website and app traffic. It provides insights into user behavior, traffic sources, conversions, and engagement, enabling businesses to optimize their digital presence.\n\n\nHow Does Google Analytics Work?\nGoogle Analytics collects data using a JavaScript tracking code placed on a website or app. The process involves:\nData Collection\nWhen a user visits a website, the tracking code gathers information such as page views, clicks, session duration, device type, and location.\nIn GA4, it tracks user interactions as events (e.g., button clicks, video plays, scroll depth).\nData Processing\nGoogle Analytics processes the raw data into structured reports.\nIt categorizes users based on sessions, demographics, traffic sources, and engagement metrics.\nData Reporting & Analysis\nUsers can access dashboards in Google Analytics to view reports on:\nReal-time activity (current active users).\nAudience insights (user demographics, interests, devices).\nAcquisition (how users found the site—search, social media, ads, etc.).\nBehavior (what users do on the site—pages visited, events triggered).\nConversions (tracking goals like purchases, sign-ups, downloads).\nData-Driven Decision Making\nBusinesses use GA insights to optimize marketing campaigns, improve website UX, and increase conversion rates.\n\n\nGA4 vs. Universal Analytics (UA): Key Differences\n\n\nEvent-Based Tracking: GA4 tracks everything as events, unlike UA, which relied on session-based tracking.\nAI-Powered Insights: GA4 uses machine learning for predictive analytics.\nPrivacy-Focused: GA4 offers better compliance with GDPR and CCPA by supporting cookieless tracking.\nCross-Platform Tracking: GA4 seamlessly integrates website and mobile app data.\n\n\nWhy learn Google Analytics?\nKnowing how to use Google Analytics and find insights in your data is vital for improving your website, focusing your marketing efforts, and growing your business. Your reports offer insights into your audience and their behavior to help pinpoint what’s working (and what’s not working). If you don't understand Google Analytics, you're missing out on an entire suite of tracking metrics and optimization opportunities.\nData analysts prepare, process, and analyze data to help inform business decisions. They create visualizations to share their findings with stakeholders and provide recommendations driven by data. Since Google Analytics is a popular tool for web analytics, professionals with knowledge of Google Analytics are up for in-demand jobs in data analytics.\n\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4): Real-Time Insights & Web Analytics - Course Curriculum\n\n\nGoogle Universal Analytics (UA) vs. Google Analytics 4 (GA4)\nReal-time and Audience\nAcquisition and Behavior\nReporting Events\nWhat is missing in GA4",

      "description": "Use the science of probability to turn vague terms such as \"likely\" into precise values you can use to assess risks and alternatives. This beginning course gives you all you need to apply probability to real-world questions. Use Bayes' Rule to incorporate what you know about the outside world. Combine simple probabilities to find the likelihood of complex events. Use conditional probability to focus on groups or situations. Draw correct conclusions from conditional probabilities, including false positives and false negatives. Avoid the many probability fallacies that often lead to bad decisions. Try out your knowledge in exercises, then take on some tricky challenges (you'll get the solutions). A formula “cheat sheet” and optional spreadsheets are included.\nWhat You'll Learn\nProbability is both a science and a measure of likelihood. We go beyond the standard examples of cards and dice and discuss what it means for weather prediction or medical tests. Probability is useful for giving you an expected value, what you would expect the outcome to be on average. Yet, as we watch random events play out in a simulation, we see that we need to also expect the unexpected.\nProbability appears simple and straightforward, which leads people to get misled by various common probability fallacies. One key fallacy is seeing patterns that aren't there. You will see examples in which ordinary randomness leads to silly conclusions. Another is the confusion of the inverse of conditional probabilities. This causes confusion in assessing the results of medical tests and making faulty causal connections.\nFrom Your Instructor, Carol Jacoby\nI’ve been using various types of analysis to answer tricky questions for over 30 years. I did this as a mission analyst at Hughes Electronics and other companies to predict outcomes and compare alternatives. The applications were broad and ill-defined: protect Europe from missile attack, limit drug smuggling, design a highway system for self-driving cars and more.\nI have a PhD in mathematics, and I’ve been teaching technical classes to managers through major universities for 20 years. The students praise my enthusiasm and ability to make complex subjects clear. A common comment is, \"I wish you had been my math teacher in high school.\" Here are samples of classes that were heavy in analysis.\n· Predictive Analytics: Caltech Center for Technology and Management Education\n· Lean Six Sigma: Caltech Center for Technology and Management Education\n· Systems Engineering: UCLA Extension for Raytheon\n· The Decisive Manager: UCLA Technical Management Program\nOne thing I like about teaching is interacting with the students. I look forward to comments and direct messages and respond promptly. Any feedback is encouraged. If something is confusing or doesn’t work as expected, I want to hear about it right away so I can fix it. I especially want to hear about your own data explorations and other topics you’d like to learn about or problems you’d like to solve.\nSo, are you ready to dig into that data and see what you can learn? Learn probability in just a couple hours. Sign up now. If you want more of a taste first, check out the quick promo video or some of the free lessons. I hope to see you in class.",

      "description": "Our philosophy\nKnowledge-based on rote learning is useless if it is not applied.\n\n\nOur course\nYou enter a simulated company as an intern to follow your mentor and learn to apply descriptive statistics to collect, analyze, interpret, and develop a competitive business presentation.\n\n\nWe offer\nA non-intimidating cartoon styled business atmosphere where learning is fun and concepts are easy to understand.\n\n\nWe provide tools to help you build data analysis skills so you can break through entry-level jobs, succeed in a new position, gain job security, or get a long-overdue promotion. Acquiring increasingly valuable data collection, interpretation, presentation, and reporting skills are critical in helping you achieve your career goals. Data is everywhere and on every level, such as the fast-food worker who always volunteered to help with weekly reports and is now the assistant manager. And the office workers, who carved out niches for data collection and reporting, are getting promoted while others are getting laid-off.\nIf you have spent any time in the workforce, you probably have noticed the worker that seems indispensable. When there are layoffs or furloughs, that person always manages to survive; and is often promoted when others are not. This person is always present at important meetings. And the boss will often stop in mid-sentence and say something like, “What percentage of sales in widgets did we have last quarter?” And this worker will pop up right away with the correct answer. This worker regularly provides reports for the boss and is often sent scrambling for answers when the boss needs quick information. We find people who are well established in the workplace because they have mastered the descriptive statistic skills required to collect, analyze, present, and report data that are proven assets for career advancement.\nOur multicultural world is infused with statistics. We make many business decisions based on data, and in that respect, data controls much of what we do. There are many forms of data to include automated programs that are based on statistics to run operations. For example, in sales operations, people with the highest sales automatically receive the most sales leads from automated systems. Whereas people with lower average sales do not receive many sales leads from the system.\nThis course is unique.\nSince data and statistics are vital to the business, we created a course that places you in a simulated business environment to learn to master data analysis and presentation. This course features fun and easy lessons to help you understand descriptive statistics as building blocks for data collection, analysis, and reporting in your workplace. We structured the course to answer 3 crucial questions that are often asked in statistics courses:\n· What is this?\n· Why do I need this?\n· How is this going to help me at work?\nWe presented descriptive statistics in a series of dramatic episodes in a fictional company to answer these questions. In each episode, the characters are either mentoring, training or learning to analyze company data. We also included an Excel segment featuring statistical analysis and data charting. You participate by becoming an intern to observe how the characters apply descriptive statistics and complete assignments that apply lesson content. A big take-away is that you will be able to apply descriptive statistics and discover opportunities to analyze data.\nWhat this course covers:\n· Understand the definition of descriptive statistics, and why the statistical application is a critical skill in the workplace.\n· How to collect data and identify valid sources of professional data.\n· Why you need to know the difference between a population and a sample when collecting data at work.\n· Understand the different statistical operations that are used for population and sample data.\n· Know why you need representative large random samples to produce bell-shaped curves or normal distributions.\n· What happens when we do not use large random samples, and what is right or left-skewed distribution curves.\n· Know descriptive statistics that showcase product advantages in competitive markets.\n· Compute descriptive statistics for small samples on your calculator and explain how each measure is useful for identifying or describing data.\n· Use Excel, especially for computing large data samples and creating charts for presentations.\n· Explain how measures of central tendency and dispersion are used in data collection and analysis.\n· How central tendency and dispersion affect your data and why it is important in managing data, planning, and creating strategies.\n· Know what measures of central tendency let us determine how close data is to average.\n· Understand statistics that measure dispersion or how data is spread out from the average.\nMarket Analysis\nTarget Market and Demographics\n· Identify potential customers and demographics using population and sample data.\n· Analyze statistics for large random samples of non-personalized data such as age, gender, income, education level from databases.\n· Understand how descriptive statistics help identify the right customers for advertisement campaigns.\nCompetitive Analysis\n· Research competitors to identify strengths and weaknesses.\n· Discover valid sources of competitor data for analysis.\n· Determine how close the competition’s prices are to the average price by looking at distribution curves.\n· Identify statistics that highlight product advantages, strengths, and unique features in a competitive market.\n· Know what descriptive statistics to use to gain the best advantage when marketing products.\nSales and Price Forecasting\n· Based on descriptive statistic information, identify sales or price changes you expect during a specific operation period.\n·  How central tendency and dispersion help you in forecasting data such as sales and prices.\nExcel\n· Learn how to use EXCEL to compute statistics and make grafts or charts.\n· Become proficient in preparing data for presentations using Excel.\nExercises\n· The exercises located throughout the lessons help you practice using what you learned.\n· The lessons are designed to be easy and intuitive.\n· Answer sheets for the exercises and instructions are located at the end of the course.\nThis course is for\n· People who are not employed and are seeking skills to interest potential employers\n· Employees seeking advancement and promotions\n· Entry-level employees needing opportunities to showcase skills\n· Self-employed and needing data for advertising to attract customers\n· People seeking job security in a turbulent job market\n· Management seeking better ways to interpret and present data\n· Companies needing a fresh outlook on data collection, analysis, and reporting\n· Grant writers and fundraisers who need to report data\nWhat you need to know to prepare for this course\n· Basic high school level math\n· How to use an ordinary or statistical calculator\n· A readiness to learn descriptive statistics in an exciting new way\n\n\nWelcome to your exciting adventure as a professional intern in our simulated company.",

We are going to work with Excel VBA like any other programming language such as Python or R, and not just like an add on to excel that just formatts your worksheets.\n\n\nWe will first start with a refresher on arrays and objects. Then we just jump into getting data from worksheets and other workbooks. In any business setting a lot of data you will receive will be in an excel workbook, so it is important that you can gather this data programmatically.\n\n\nIn our transformation section we will be building 14 functions to help process and transform your data. This will all be written from scratch. This section is meant to give you functions that you can immediately apply in your day job, but more importantly it will help you start thinking about how you can start building other functions to add to your tool box. We will then improve those functions by learning to work with header names instead of working with indexes.\n\n\nFinally, we have your ERP project. This is where you will use what you learned to help solve a real life scenario that comes up a lot in business, data migration to a new ERP system.\n\n\nYou will learn:\nHow to develop function to work with data directly in the editor.\nHow to programmatically get data from worksheets and workbooks.\nExport your data for you to review as you develop your data processing workflow.\n\n\nFunctions we will code:\nGet Data\nExport\nAbsolute Value\nSum Columns\nAdd Columns\nMath\nCompare\nCopy Column\nFill Column If\nFill Column\nFill Column If\nSwap Columns\nStack Data\nTranspose\n\n\nThis is an intermediate Excel VBA course and students should be comfortable with the following concenpts:\nModules\nVariables (including constants & enums)\nFunctions and Subroutines\nIf Statements\nFor & For Each Loops\nSelect Case\n\n\n** There are a lot of great beginners courses available that will get you up to speed realatively quickly  and this would be a great companion course to any of them**\n** A VBA Quickstart code book with commentary is provided, but this is meant to be a refresher**\n** If you have programming experience then you can probably pickup these concepts as you go through the course **\n\n\nWho is this course for:\nBusiness Analyst\nFinancial Analyst\nData Analyst\nAnyone wanting to advance their VBA skills",

      "description": "Expanded course description\nThis course equips you with the end-to-end skills needed to design, conduct, analyze, and present rigorous, reproducible research across disciplines. You’ll begin by sharpening the craft of asking excellent questions—translating curiosities into precise problem statements, operationalizing constructs into measurable variables, refining hypotheses, and anchoring everything in an appropriate theoretical or conceptual framework. Along the way, you’ll learn how to scope a literature review strategically, map gaps, and build a defensible conceptual model that guides method choice and analysis plans.\nFrom there, we dive deep into methodology with equal emphasis on practicality and rigor. On the quantitative side, you’ll learn survey construction (question wording, scaling, pilot testing, bias reduction), experimental and quasi-experimental design (controls, randomization, power and sample size considerations), sampling strategies, and data quality safeguards to ensure validity and reliability. On the qualitative side, you’ll gain hands-on proficiency with interviews, focus groups, and participant observation, including recruitment, protocol design, field notes, reflexivity, ethics, and rich data capture. Mixed-methods integration is addressed throughout, so you can triangulate insights and align methods to your research goals rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach.\nAnalysis and interpretation are taught as a disciplined conversation with your data. You’ll practice descriptive summaries and visualizations that reveal structure, then progress to inferential techniques (assumption checks, effect sizes, reporting standards) and model-based reasoning that answers “so what?” with clarity. For qualitative data, you’ll apply systematic coding, memoing, and theme development, strengthen credibility through audit trails and inter-coder agreement, and synthesize findings into coherent narratives. You’ll also learn to pre-empt common pitfalls—p-hacking, overfitting, confirmation bias—by building transparent analysis plans and ethical guardrails.\nFinally, you’ll translate results into compelling outputs that stand up to scrutiny: literature reviews and conceptual diagrams, IRB/ethics-ready protocols, data-collection instruments, analysis notebooks, and polished deliverables such as manuscripts, conference presentations, and policy briefs. Throughout, real-world case studies, templates, and checklists make each step concrete, so you can move from idea to impact with confidence and a repeatable, professional workflow.",

      "description": "The way we measure and verify energy performance is changing.\nIn the past, energy analysis relied heavily on monthly utility bills. That was enough to provide a rough estimate of savings, but it lacked detail and often masked the true impact of energy efficiency measures. Today, thanks to advances in smart metering and digital monitoring, we have access to high-frequency data — hourly, 15-minute, even real-time energy use data streamed directly from modern meters.This course shows you—step by step—how to turn raw meter data into trusted, auditable results using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (ML), CUSUM, Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing, and grid emission factors aligned to IPMVP Option C.\nThis shift has created a new era in energy analytics. With high-frequency data, we can:\nSee immediate responses to changes in building operations\nCapture the effect of occupancy, schedules, and weather in much greater detail\nIdentify subtle savings patterns that would never appear in monthly billing data\nProvide stakeholders with transparent, evidence-based reporting\nBut higher data resolution also brings complexity. Traditional regression methods may struggle to keep up with the volume and variability of high-frequency data. That’s where modern machine learning comes in. Techniques such as Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest regression can handle nonlinear relationships and large datasets, giving analysts more accurate and flexible models.\nThis course takes you on that journey — from building reliable regression baselines to applying machine learning for high-frequency data. Along the way, you’ll also learn CUSUM analysis, a simple yet powerful tool for visualizing and communicating savings.\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nUnderstand how high-frequency energy data is collected from meters and why it matters.\nBuild regression models to normalize for weather, occupancy, and other factors.\nApply machine learning methods to high-frequency data for improved accuracy.\nUse CUSUM analysis to clearly visualize savings and performance trends.\nConnect all analysis to the IPMVP Option C framework for transparent verification.\nCalculate GHG emissions savings by converting kWh savings into CO₂e using grid emission factors (hourly or annual averages), and report results in kg and tonnes with simple, auditable math.\nThis course is designed for energy analysts and engineers, facility managers, sustainability/ESG professionals, and data-curious learners who want practical, job-ready skills.\nEnergy efficiency isn’t just about saving kilowatts — it’s about proving impact with confidence, using the best data and the best tools available. High-frequency data is the modern fuel for that transformation, and machine learning is the engine that drives it.\nThis course is designed for:\nEnergy analysts and engineers\nSustainability and M&V professionals\nData enthusiasts interested in energy efficiency\nAnyone seeking to bridge theory with practical, hands-on analytics.",

If you run an equestrian business like a riding school or lesson barn, do you know how to find out what your customers really think and use that information to inform future business decisions?\nIn this course you will find out why monitoring and evaluation are important, what the commonly used jargon means, and how to embed fun and creative data-gathering exercises into your daily business. You'll also learn how to analyse, collate and share the results to increase income and generate awareness around the value of the services you provide.\nIn essence: Monitoring and Evaluating means making sure we are delivering the right thing to the right people at the right time.  In the horse world, we're not always the best at demonstrating that what we are doing is effective using cold, hard evidence, statistics and reports. In today's financial climate, it's not enough to just know that what we do works. We can't measure our effectiveness solely in terms of horsemanship skills gained or ribbons won. We also need to think about calculating our impact on the wider community.\n•Monitoring and evaluation can be used to demonstrate that your efforts have had a measurable impact on expected outcomes and have been implemented effectively.\n•They help with identifying the most efficient use of resources and are critical for developing objective conclusions regarding the extent to which equestrian initiatives can be judged a “success”.\n•Monitoring and evaluation together provide the necessary data to prove to funders, donors, commissioners, participants, parents, and carers that your service does what it says it will do.",

This course is designed to equip planners, analysts, and supply chain professionals with the skills to integrate AI into their forecasting processes.\nYou'll start by learning the fundamentals of demand forecasting, exploring both traditional techniques (like Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Linear Regression, and ARIMA) and specialized methods for intermittent demand such as Croston’s Method. We’ll dive deep into how and when to apply each model, using real-world business examples and intuitive explanations.\nNext, we shift into the world of AI and machine learning. You'll discover how AI enhances forecasting accuracy, handles large datasets, adapts to changing trends, and uncovers patterns that traditional models might miss. With practical demos and hands-on guidance, you'll learn to use Python-based tools and platforms like Prophet, Scikit-learn, and even cloud-based solutions such as AWS Forecast and Google AutoML.\nWhether you're managing inventory, planning production, or leading demand planning initiatives, this course will help you move beyond spreadsheets and into data-driven, intelligent forecasting. No previous coding experience is required—just curiosity, analytical thinking, and a desire to bring forecasting into the future of digital transformation.\nInstructor: Abraham Natanael Camargo Ortega",

      "description": "Behind every successful MicroStrategy project stands an Architect. While developers and analysts create dashboards and reports, it is the Architect who designs the foundation that makes everything possible: the schema.\nA well-designed schema ensures that data is consistent, business rules are enforced, and insights are trusted across the entire organization. Without it, BI projects quickly collapse into fragmented reports and endless “data disputes.” That’s why MicroStrategy Architects are among the most valuable and hardest-to-find professionals in the BI world.\nThis course exists to help you step into that role.\nYou will learn how to think like an Architect — how to bridge the gap between raw warehouse data and the semantic layer that powers enterprise reporting. You will discover how MicroStrategy organizes facts, attributes, hierarchies, and transformations into a coherent schema, and why this layer is the single most important part of any MicroStrategy project.\nBut this is not just theory. The course is fully hands-on with the latest MicroStrategy version, showing you how to set up projects in Workstation and Developer, register tables, create schema objects, validate designs, and optimize performance. And because Architects don’t just build objects, but deliver solutions to business problems, you will also work through a complete Sales Analytics project that simulates the real challenges you’ll face in practice.\nBy the end of this course, you won’t just know how to use MicroStrategy Architect. You will understand why these skills are rare, why organizations struggle without them, and how you can position yourself as a highly valuable BI professional with expertise that few others have.\nIf you want to stand out in the BI job market and learn the skills that truly differentiate beginners from experts, this course is your path forward.",

      "description": "Data exploration is the initial step in data analysis, where users explore a large data set in an unstructured way to uncover initial patterns, characteristics, and points of interest. This process isn’t meant to reveal every bit of information a dataset holds, but rather to help create a broad picture of important trends and major points to study in greater detail. Data exploration can use a combination of manual methods and automated tools such as data visualizations, charts, and initial reports.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first step in your data analysis process. Here, you make sense of the data you have and then figure out what questions you want to ask and how to frame them, as well as how best to manipulate your available data sources to get the answers you need.  You do this by taking a broad look at patterns, trends, outliers, unexpected results and so on in your existing data, using visual and quantitative methods to get a sense of the story this tells. You’re looking for clues that suggest your logical next steps, questions or areas of research.\n\n\nData analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.\nData visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Power BI Certification.\nPower BI is a business intelligence tool that gets data from different sources, such as Excel, JSON, PDF, etc., and can be analyzed and converted to meaningful reports, dashboards, charts, etc. This assists in making business decisions by tracking performance.\nMicrosoft developed Power BI in 2011 to analyze and visualize large amounts of data and generate meaningful insights helpful for organizations in scaling. The Power BI Desktop version is freely available, and in this tutorial, we will understand it thoroughly with examples.\nData Analysts are hired mostly to work on such BI tools, therefore let us first understand the role of a data analyst in an organization.\nTasks of a Data Analyst\nThe role of a Data Analyst is quite crucial for any organization. The Data Analyst understands the data and gets valuable insights from it that help track the performance and scale the organization. The data analysis process includes:\nData Preparation: The first step is to prepare the data. It includes profiling, cleaning, and transforming the data. This makes the data ready. Data preparation takes the raw data and converts it into useful, easy-to-understand information. This process fixes the inaccurate data, identifies missing data, corrects the wrong data, etc.\nModel: The data gets ready to be modelled after the preparation step. This determines how the tables are related to each other by defining and creating relationships between them.\nVisualize: The graphics are easier to understand than the textual data, correct? The visualization steps bring data to life and represent it in the form of reports. This makes it quite easier to understand and make better decisions. This step designs and creates reports for accessibility.\nAnalyse: Analysing the data helps in finding insights, identifying patterns, and predicting outcomes. Interpret the information displayed in the report with the analysis step. With advanced analytics, business decisions become easier with meaningful results.\nManagement: If you are the Data Analyst of an organization, then you need to manage the reports, dashboards, semantic models, etc. of the Power BI. You need to supervise the sharing the distribution of reports and dashboards.\nWhat is BI\nBusiness intelligence, as the name suggests, involves analyzing data and displaying it in a way that speaks, i.e., in the form of dashboards, charts, reports, etc. This easy-to-understand data helps the founders track performance, resolve issues, and prepare for market changes.\nWhat is Power BI\nPower BI is a tool that helps people understand a large amount of data and build reports. PowerBI is a collection of components:\n· Power Query (ETL tool to extract transform, and load the data i.e., clean the data from null values, empty records, and unclean data for visualization)\n· Power Pivot (Data Modelling – connect data from multiple data sources and create relationships)\n· Power Views (Create 200+ charts i.e. visualization)\n· PowerBI Service (allows users to communicate with reports)\nFeatures of Power BI\nData Visualization: Create interactive reports and dashboards with a wide range of visualizations.\nData Connectivity: Connect to various data sources like Excel, databases, and cloud services3.\nAI-Driven Analytics: Use AI to uncover patterns and insights in your data.\nCustom Visualizations: Create custom visualizations using R and Python.\nPower Query: Easily source and transform data.\nData Refresh: Automatically refresh data to keep reports up-to-date.\nMobile App: Access reports and dashboards on the go with the Power BI mobile app.\nIntegration with Microsoft Products: Seamlessly integrate with other Microsoft products like Excel, SharePoint, and Azure.\nCollaboration: Share reports and collaborate with others in real time.\nSecurity: Robust security features to ensure data protection and compliance.\nNote: In this course, we will work on the free plan.\n\n\nThe following lessons are covered in the Power BI tutorial:\n**Course Lessons**\nPower BI – Overview & Setup\n· Power BI – Introduction & Features\n· Power BI vs Power BI Pro vs Power BI Premium\n· Install Power BI on Windows 11\nPower BI – Get Data\n· Get Data from Excel\nPower BI – Visualizations\n· Create a Gauge Chart\n· Create a Column Chart\nPower BI – Cards\n· Create a card\n· Format the cards\n· Update the cards\nPower BI – Tables\n· Create a Table\n· Format the table\n· Table Conditional Formatting\nPower BI – Filters\n· Create a Filter\nPower BI – Slicer\n· Create a slicer\n· Select multiple values from a slicer\n· Set a chart with slicer\nPower BI – Data Transformation\n· What is Data Transformation\n· Group rows\n· Pivot columns\n· Create custom columns\nPower BI – Reports and Dashboards\n· What is a Report in Power BI\n· Create a Report and Publish it in the Power BI Service Account\n· Create a Dashboard from Report in Power BI Service\n· Subscribe to Report\n\n\nNote: All the excel source files used in the tutorial are uploaded in the respective lessons.

      "description": "Microsoft Excel is one of the most popular applications for data analysis. Equipped with built-in pivot tables, they are without a doubt the most sought-after analytic tool available. It is an all-in-one data management software that allows you to easily import, explore, clean, analyse, and visualize your data.\nPivot tables are known for being the most purposeful and powerful feature in Excel. We use them in summarizing the data stored in a table. They organize and rearrange statistics (or \"pivot\") to bring crucial and valuable facts to attention. It helps take an extremely large data set and see the relevant data you need in a crisp, easy, and manageable way.\nSorting data is a very critical and vital part of Data Analysis. You can sort your Excel data by multiple columns or even a single column. The sorting is done in ascending or descending order as well.\nWhat is Filter in Excel? The filter in excel helps display relevant data by eliminating the irrelevant entries temporarily from the view. The data is filtered as per the given criteria. The purpose of filtering is to focus on the crucial areas of a dataset.\nPower Query allows a user to import data into Excel through external sources, such as Text files, CSV files, Web, or Excel workbooks, to list a few. The data can then be cleaned and prepared for our requirements.\nPower Pivot is a data modelling technology that lets you create data models, establish relationships, and create calculations. With Power Pivot you can work with large data sets, build extensive relationships, and create complex (or simple) calculations, all in a high-performance environment, and all within the familiar experience of Excel.\nA pivot table is a table of grouped values that aggregates the individual items of a more extensive table within one or more discrete categories. This summary might include sums, averages, or other statistics, which the pivot table groups together using a chosen aggregation function applied to the grouped values.\nA pivot chart is the visual representation of a pivot table in Excel. Pivot charts and pivot tables are connected with each other.",

Whether it is agile, waterfall, or while you sit for your interview, you will be able to clearly articulate the value you can deliver as a BA  and the skills that you have to achieve that value.\nI have been a business analyst for over 12 years. I spent my early career trying to distill exactly what it is that - the knowledge of what value I should be bringing to the table and the confidence to know that I can bring it. After years of honing my skill, leading projects, and mentoring junior business analysts I became a manager of business analysts using my knowledge and experience to grow future kick-ass BAs. Now I’m making that available to you.\nIn this course ...\nI guide you through realistic scenarios to give you a clear understanding of what business analysis is\nI provide a mental framework for how to conduct business analysis work regardless of the project type or delivery methodology\nI provide assignments that simulate BA work to test your abilities against a set of industry-standard BA competencies\nIf you want the knowledge to write a resume that gets interviews, the confidence to kick butt in those interviews, and the ability to be a strong business analyst in any industry, with any methodology, at any organization, then enroll today.",

So, not only will you master the graphics in r, you will also be able to interpret your graphics and make an impressive plots. All done by yourself.\n\n\nWhy learn data visualization with R?\n\n\nData Visualization helps people see, interact with, and better understand the data. Whether simple or complex, the right visualization can bring everyone on the same page, regardless of their level of expertise.\nAlmost all the professional industries benefit from making data more understandable. Every STEM field benefits from data analysts that are able to understand data—and so do fields in government, finance, marketing, history, consumer goods, service industries, education, sports, and so on.\n\n\nAs the “age of Big Data” and \"Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"  kicks into high gear, visualization is an increasingly key tool to make sense of the trillions of rows of data generated every day. Data visualization helps to tell stories by curating data into a form easier to understand, highlighting the trends and outliers. A good visualization tells a story, removing the noise from data and highlighting useful information.\n\n\nWith R tools such as ggplot2 , lattice package, we can create visually appealing graphics and data visualizations by writing few lines of code. For this purpose R is widely used and it is easy to use and understand when it comes to data visualizations, good appealing graphics, data analysis (dplyr) etc. Through R, we can easily customize our data visualization by changing axes, fonts, legends, annotations, and labels.\n\n\nIn this data visualization course you will learn the following:\n\n\nR for beginners: Vectors, Matrices, Arrays, Data frames and Lists\nFactors in R: Create factors, understand factor levels\nregular expressions in r: grep and gsub functions\nreshape package for data analysis: melt and casting functions\ntidyr package for data analysis: gather and spread functions\ndplyr package for data analysis: merge functions, filter, select, sort, arrange, pipe operator etc\nAfter Mastering R Programming for beginners and Data Analysis, you will begin creating graphics with r and visualizations. Here is the summary overview of what you will learn:\nGraphics in R: Beginner Level\nGraphic Devices & Colors\nThe Plot Function\nLow Level Functions\nData Visualization in R: Beginner Level\nBarplots & Pie Charts\nHistograms in r\nBox and Whisker Plots\nScatterplots\nIntermediate Data Visualization & Graphics in R\nWhat is ggplot2?\nqplot() function\nggplot() function\nData Visualization with Lattice Package\nLattice Graphics\nHigh Level Functions in lattice package\nLattice Package panel functions\nGoing further with data visualization\nHow to Handle and switch between graphics\nControlling layout with layout function\nggplot2 scales and guides:\nscale_x_continous, scale_y_continous, scale_color_manual,scale_fill_manual\nscale_shape_manual,scale_shape_manual,scale_alpha_continous\nguide_legend, gudei_colorbar\nggplot2 faceting: facet_wrap() vs facet_grid()\nggplot2 themes\nggvis package:\nscatterplot with layers, interactive plots with input_slider(), add_legend(), add_axis etc\nAfter completing the course you will receive the electronic certificate that you can add to your resume or CV and LinkedIn profile from Udemy.\nThe access to this course is also lifetime, hence you will learn at your own pace.

      "description": "In this course, the content is going to leverage participants understanding the total data flow principles of surface and subsurface data management by going through golden rules in detail, various data categories in geology, seismic, navigation, E&P database design, knowing G&G software. All the important points covered are also illustrated by figures and tables with examples given.\nIn all disciplines of oil and gas industry, acquired data is growing exponentially day by day. Currently, storage capacities are in the size of petabytes which is equivalent to ~1000TB (One thousand Terabytes). Thus, the need to perform data governance is cumbersome but inevitable.  A strong and consistent data governance ensures operational success, long-term cost and time savings.\nThis course reveals the value that data generates within E&P companies. It then reviews the most important themes that the areas where improvements are commonly can be found. All E&P companies are generating value with their existing data management, the important question is whether there are compelling business cases to expand on their current capabilities.\nThis course is focused on the information generated through data analytics related to the subsurface. This data ranges from exploration data, such as seismic surveys to production data, such as hourly flow readings, and from objective measurements, such as raw log readings to interpreted results such as dynamic reservoir models. The key reason that oil companies spends millions on data is in order to reduce the “development uncertainties”.\nThe final conclusion is that all oil company personnel should carefully review their current data management tasks and responsibilities. In most companies there are opportunities to expand the governance, access, security or quality of data which would significantly increase the total value an organizational profitablity.\nThroughout the course, you will find communication medium informal, interactive and the topics are covered by implementation of practical case studies/hands on exercises. Every time in video recordings I ask questions, try to write your own reply on a pieces of paper and check yourself.\n\n\nInstructor\nMr. Serdar Kaya is a senior consultant with an extensive experience in geoscience, data analytics, reservoir characterization, geological modeling and various high tech applications. He has published several journal and conference papers about innovative data modeling approaches for challenging issues. He has also successfully trained, mentored and coached many geoscientists, geologist and engineers. He holds both MSc and BSc degrees in Petroleum Engineering.

It is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula, or expression, to calculate and return one or more values. You can use DAX to solve a number of calculations and data analysis problems, which can help you create new information from data that is already in your model.\n\n\nData Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a programming language that is used throughout Microsoft Power BI for creating calculated columns, measures, and custom tables. It is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula, or expression, to calculate and return one or more values.\n\n\nWhy is DAX so important? It's easy to create a new Power BI Desktop file and import some data into it. You can even create reports that show valuable insights without using any DAX formulas at all.\n\n\nMeasures\nMeasures are dynamic calculation formulas where the results change depending on context. Measures are used in reporting that support combining and filtering model data by using multiple attributes such as a Power BI report or Excel PivotTable or PivotChart. Measures are created by using the DAX formula bar in the model designer.\nA formula in a measure can use standard aggregation functions automatically created by using the Autosum feature, such as COUNT or SUM, or you can define your own formula by using the DAX formula bar. Named measures can be passed as an argument to other measures.",

If we keep spend at the same level, how many incremental units will we get from our marketing efforts next year?\nWe would like to increase price by 10% next year, what impact will that have on our business?\nIn addition to this, we will also briefly go over the theory of ordinary least squares regression and the Gauss Markov theorem. Which we will then put into practice to validate our model by analyzing the residuals. We will also learn how to evaluate our model using key statistics like the R Square, Durbin Watson and the MAPE.\nAll analysis will be done in excel, so we will learn how to setup a model workbook in excel and learn how to use essential functions such as Index Match, Sumifs and Countifs.

      "description": "Many Crime and Intelligence analysts spend hours or days creating expansive link charts. In this course, we'll cover how to automate the creation of link charts using data structure common to police records management systems. These techniques are applicable to any link chart program but for the purposes of this course, we'll use NodeXL which is a free plugin for Microsoft Excel and available at the link below. Additionally, we will make extensive use of Microsoft Access.\n\n\nStudents need no prior technical training or programming experience. This course starts from scratch, providing an overview of relational databases using common police department records management systems. You'll learn how these systems organize data and how to write simple SQL queries. Students will then learn how to package a series of SQL queries in an MS Access macro to create two tools. The first is an offender search tool that will allow you to overcome dirty data and duplicate data issues common in law enforcement agencies. This tool simply allows you to type in a name, or a partial name, and search your master names list. You can then review the individuals returned and select one or more that you identify as the  target of your analysis.\n\n\nWe will then move into creating a second macro that takes your selection and runs a series of SQL queries to create an edge list for that individual. The edge list can then be copied and pasted into any link charting tool. A task that may have taken hours now takes only seconds! We'll conclude with a brief overview of visualization options in NodeXL.",

      "description": "Data Migration is an important function anyone working with a database should be able to carry out.\nThere are several tools available to perform database and data migration. In this course we will be using a free powerful tool by Oracle called Oracle SQL Developer to migrate a third party database from Microsoft SQL Server into Oracle.\nDatabase migration involves several steps specified below:\nSetting up a Migration Repository : The Migrations Repository is a database schema that stores the meta_data collected and transformed in the migration process.\nConfiguring the Third Party Database Connection  : You  need to configure a database connection for the database  which  you would like to migrate. There are two steps to this process:Download JDBC driver and Connecting to Third\nParty  Database.\nCapturing Source Database :This step is used to capture a snapshot of the current state of your third-party database and is necessary to provide SQL Developer  with a \"point in time\" view of your database. Once this step is complete, the Migration wizard works on the meta-data stored in its repository, instead of issuing queries against your live database.\nConvert Captured Model to Oracle : The next step in the migration process is to convert the captured model  of the database to an Oracle-specific model.\nTranslate Third Party SQL Objects to Oracle :The next step in the migration process is to translate the T-SQL objects - constraints, functions, procedures, triggers, views - to Oracle SQL objects.\nGenerating Scripts to Create Target Database :Once the conversion process has completed, SQL Developer has a model of what the converted database will look like. This is used to generate SQL scripts for the creation of the new Oracle Database schema(s) and to run these scripts.\nMove Data from Third Party Database  to Oracle :The last step in the Migration Wizard is to  move the data to the new database.  Migrating the data is a process that copies the data from the third-party database to the new tables\nin the Oracle database. The Migration Wizard uses the  same Oracle database connection required to run the scripts as it does to move the data.",

Use SSMS to access, configure, manage, administer, and develop all components of SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Synapse Analytics. SSMS provides a single comprehensive utility that combines a broad group of graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide access to SQL Server for developers and database administrators of all skill levels.\nTransact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with relational databases. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.\nTransact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.\nAzure Data Studio is a cross-platform database tool for data professionals using on-premises and cloud data platforms on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Azure Data Studio offers a modern editor experience with IntelliSense, code snippets, source control integration, and an integrated terminal.",

      "description": "In today's data-driven world, understanding how to organize, structure, and model data is not just a technical skill—it’s a career advantage. Data modeling is the foundation of data analysis, business intelligence, and decision-making in nearly every industry, from tech to finance to marketing. And yet, most beginners feel overwhelmed when they hear the term \"data modeling.\" If that sounds like you, this free course is the shortcut you’ve been looking for.\n\"Data Modeling for Beginners\" strips away the jargon and complexity to give you a practical, easy-to-follow introduction to data modeling, using real tools and real examples. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone who just wants to strengthen your analytics skills, this course will give you a strong foundation that many paid courses don't even cover.\nYou will learn how to build data models using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and understand how Python plays a role in data analytics pipelines. You’ll explore different types of data joins, understand data relationships, and discover how to connect data from different sources. This isn’t about theory—it’s about application. You'll walk away with actionable skills that you can use in real business scenarios, job interviews, or freelance work.\nBut here's the truth: if you don’t understand data modeling, you’re at risk of staying stuck at the surface level of data work. You might know how to make a chart or write a SQL query, but you won’t know how to build a system that scales, analyzes properly, or delivers insight. You’ll miss the big picture—and worse, you’ll miss out on job offers and promotions where data modeling is a core skill.\nThis course is designed to eliminate that risk and give you a serious head start.\nYou’ll begin by understanding what data modeling really means, then move on to identifying the key components of a model. You’ll learn about structure, relationships, and data flow. Then you’ll get hands-on: we’ll walk through the tools you’ll use in the real world, how to download and connect sample datasets, and how to build your first model in Excel and Power BI.\nWe even dedicate an entire section to mastering joins—the most confusing and critical part of data modeling. You'll not only learn what they are, but how to use them in practical scenarios with confidence.\nBy the end of this course, you'll have built your first real data model, understood how data fits together across platforms, and gained the skills to confidently move into more advanced analytics, dashboarding, and data science roles.\nAnd yes—this entire experience is completely free. No upsells, no fluff. Just pure, value-packed learning.\nIf you’ve been feeling stuck, lost, or just unsure how to begin your data journey—this course is your moment to move forward.",

Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\n\n\nPower BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:\n\n\nA Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.\nAn online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.\nPower BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.\nThese three elements—Power BI Desktop, the service, and the mobile apps—are designed to let you create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves you and your role most effectively.\nHow you use Power BI may depend on your role in a project or on a team. Other people, in other roles, might use Power BI differently.\nFor example, you might primarily use the Power BI service to view reports and dashboards. Your number-crunching, business-report-creating co-worker might make extensive use of Power BI Desktop or Power BI Report Builder to create reports, then publish those reports to the Power BI service, where you view them. Another co-worker, in sales, might mainly use the Power BI phone app to monitor progress on sales quotas, and to drill into new sales lead details.\nIf you're a developer, you might use Power BI APIs to push data into datasets or to embed dashboards and reports into your own custom applications. Have an idea for a new visual? Build it yourself and share it with others.\nYou also might use each element of Power BI at different times, depending on what you're trying to achieve or your role for a given project.",

This course is for those who want to learn how businesses, markets, and the \"nuts and bolts\" of finance work through using MS Excel to improve profitability and make good decisions.

      "description": "Master Data Storytelling: Transform Data into Actionable Insights\nUnlock the power of your data by learning how to weave compelling narratives that drive decisions and inspire change.\nAre you struggling to communicate the valuable insights hidden within your data? Do your reports and presentations fall flat, failing to engage your audience or compel them to act? In today's data-driven world, simply presenting numbers isn't enough. You need to tell a story.\nThis course, \"Data Storytelling Guidelines,\" provides you with the essential guidelines and techniques to transform complex data into clear, engaging, and actionable narratives. Designed by experienced senior consultants specializing in analytics solutions, this training moves beyond basic data visualization to teach you the art and science of effective data communication.\n\n\nWhy is Data Storytelling Crucial?\nCompare the \"Before\" and \"After\". Raw data, presented in cluttered charts and tables, often confuses more than it clarifies. Effective data storytelling, however, turns that same data into a clear, executive-level dashboard that highlights key metrics, trends, and insights at a glance. It’s the difference between data obscurity and data clarity, between inaction and informed decision-making. As Thomas Jefferson noted, \"The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do\" – this course teaches you that vital conciseness in data communication.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\nThis comprehensive course covers the essential pillars of impactful data storytelling:\n\n\nStart with a Plan : Learn to define your audience, pinpoint the purpose of your communication, identify your core story, and create a storyboard before you even touch your data visualization tools. Understand why your audience should care and tailor the detail accordingly.\nMake the Purpose Clear: Craft obvious cover titles and state your intended action.\nSimplify Your Message: Master the art of concise communication. Use short sentences, active voice, everyday language, and eliminate jargon and filler words. Remember Hemingway: \"Long sentences and big words don’t impress, they just confuse\". Structure your narrative with powerful headlines that tell the \"so what\" and stick to one core message per page.\nCreate Simple & Clean Data Visualizations: Choose the right simple charts (lines, bars, tables) that clearly convey your message. Learn why complex charts like pie charts can hinder understanding and how to tidy up your visuals by removing clutter like borders and excessive gridlines. Explore different visualization options to find the most intuitive way to present your data.\nRemove Distractions & Draw Attention: Embrace white space. Use colour strategically and sparingly to highlight key points, leveraging brand colors and grey tones effectively. Ensure icons and images are informative, not just decorative.\nSeek Feedback: Understand the importance of getting feedback at different stages.\nWho Should Take This Course?\nThis course is ideal for:\nData Analysts & Scientists\nBusiness Intelligence Professionals\nConsultants\nProduct Managers\nMarketers\nExecutives and Managers\nAnyone who needs to present data and influence decisions.\nTransform Your Communication:\nStop just presenting data; start telling powerful data stories. Enroll today and learn the techniques to explain, engage, and enlighten your audience, inspiring them to take meaningful action. Master the skills to turn your data insights into compelling narratives that drive results.",

We'll dive into tools that can help you brainstorm ideas, generate outlines, and even draft content. Think of it as learning how to collaborate with AI, not replace yourself. It's about getting those creative juices flowing and making writing fun again.\nKey Takeaways\nHands-on experience with AI writing tools.\nTechniques for using AI to generate ideas and outlines.\nTips for editing and refining AI-generated content.\nHow to use AI for different writing styles and formats.\nDeliverables\nAccess to presentation materials.\nInteractive prompts, examples and projects.\nResource list with AI tools and tutorials.\nWhat We'll Cover\nHands-on experience with AI writing tools.\nTechniques for generating ideas and outlines.\nEditing and refining AI-generated content.\nUsing AI for diverse writing styles and formats.\nResource list with AI art tools and tutorials.\nInteractive prompts, examples and projects.\nYour first question on AI’s role in your content operations should be, “Where does it make the most sense to use it?”\nFocus on impact\nMake sure AI’s incorporation aligns with your company. Start with your mission and values and see if using artificial intelligence contradicts them.\nConsider how the AI tools’ capabilities work with your marketing and business priorities.\nThink about the questions you’ve been unable to answer or problems you’ve struggled to solve.\nConsider where these AI tools can help increase brand value or marketing impact. Will it help increase audience reach or enable you to branch out to new creative areas?\nExplore efficiency gains\nUse AI to tackle smaller, time-consuming assignments like writing search-optimized headlines, compiling outlines and executive summaries, and repurposing articles for social posts and promotions.\nThis approach frees your team to explore new creative avenues and focus on work they’re more passionate about.\nFill skill gaps and resource shortfalls\nAI can also fill in where your team lacks technical skills.\nCommunicate requirements clearly\nIntroducing AI tools usually requires some adjustments to the way your team works, such as adding steps to a collaborative workflow or rebalancing team members’ roles and responsibilities.\nBut it could also require you to provide training and guidance. For example, a team member who writes clear, concise content briefs might help train others on the team about crafting effective AI prompts.\nCheck your facts\nGenerative AI can produce content with misleading or inaccurate information. This can happen if it doesn’t have access to enough relevant data in its training model to respond accurately to your prompt or if the data it used included inaccuracies. So, publishing AI-generated content without careful editorial oversight isn’t wise.\nBe mindful of mediocrity\nEven if your AI-created copy is editorially impeccable, it can still come off as generic, bland, and uninspiring. Involving your human team at every step of the creative process can mitigate these challenges.",

Designed for students, professionals, and business users, the course covers essential financial concepts and shows how to apply them using Excel’s built-in formulas and functions.\nIn the loan-focused section, students will explore the time value of money and learn to calculate loan payments, interest, and principal using functions like PMT, IPMT, and PPMT. They’ll build amortization schedules—both fixed-rate and dynamic—and analyze balloon loans, principal paydowns, and variable-rate mortgages. Additional lessons guide learners through determining loan terms, calculating borrowing capacity, and solving for interest rates.\nThe investment section shifts toward building future value models. Students will calculate the value of lump sums, recurring deposits, and mixed investments, using compound interest and both nominal and effective rates. They’ll also develop investment schedules and solve for required contributions to meet financial goals.\nFinally, the course introduces discounting techniques to evaluate the present value of future cash flows. Learners will work with NPV, IRR, and payback period functions to assess investment performance. Real-world scenarios such as leasing vs. buying and property investment decisions are included.\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to build accurate financial models in Excel to support smarter personal, academic, and business decisions",

In fact, when adopted properly, analytics is highly cost-effective in the long run. Whether you are a small SME, a solopreneur, a startup, or a multinational corporation, moving toward a more mature data analytics approach is essential for sustainable growth and competitiveness.\nFrom a business perspective, for smaller companies, the most important step is simply to start. Building strong analytics capabilities takes time and effort, and it is not a task for one individual alone. Instead, it requires commitment across the entire organization, beginning with senior management. Some industries face even greater urgency, particularly those handling large volumes of data. Examples include car rental companies, education centres, travel agencies, health clinics, and real estate or insurance agencies. Many of these businesses still rely on manual, paper-based processes such as printed checklists or invoices. These methods are error-prone and time-consuming, problems that analytics can quickly resolve by streamlining workflows and providing clearer insights.\nFrom a technical perspective, key steps include building a data warehouse, designing data pipelines, and selecting suitable methods for metrics design and analysis flows. Advanced visualizations also play a critical role, making complex information easy to interpret and act upon. Together, these solutions strengthen data flows, reduce reliance on fragmented systems, and establish a reliable single source of truth for decision-making.\nUltimately, while business leaders already understand their domain expertise, data solutions enable them to transform raw data into structured insights. This creates a logical flow that supports actionable decisions, enhances KPIs, and ensures long-term monitoring for continuous improvement.",

Many organizations, from small businesses to large enterprises, find themselves trapped in a cycle of spreadsheet-related frustrations. They grapple with the practical nightmares of reconciling conflicting data versions, spending countless hours generating reports that are often already out of date, and constantly worrying about the security of sensitive information stored within these vulnerable files. These challenges not only waste valuable time and resources but also hinder informed decision-making and impede growth.\nThis course is designed to help you break free from the \"Spreadsheet Trap.\" We'll delve into the root causes of these persistent issues by thoroughly examining the inherent limitations of spreadsheets when used for managing business-critical data. We’ll explore how the very flexibility that makes spreadsheets initially appealing ultimately becomes their downfall.\nWe’ll analyze how spreadsheets’ free-form, unstructured nature leads to a cascade of problems, including:\nData inconsistencies and errors: We’ll uncover how the lack of enforced data types and validation rules leads to inaccuracies and makes data analysis unreliable.\nLimited scalability: We'll demonstrate how spreadsheets struggle to handle growing data volumes and increasing user demands, creating performance bottlenecks and hindering business expansion.\nWeak security: We’ll expose the vulnerabilities of spreadsheets to unauthorized access, data breaches, and accidental deletion, putting sensitive information at significant risk.\nHidden costs of manual workarounds: We'll reveal the often-overlooked expenses associated with manual data entry, formula maintenance, and error correction, which drain resources and divert valuable time from strategic initiatives.\nWe’ll begin with a deep dive into the concept of the “Spreadsheet Trap.” This foundational understanding is crucial for appreciating why adopting modern data management principles and technologies is not just an option, but a necessity for thriving in today’s data-driven world. This introductory module will lay the groundwork for the powerful solutions and strategies we'll explore in subsequent modules, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to move beyond spreadsheets and unlock the true potential of your data.",

Managers today no longer make decisions based on pure judgment and experience; they rely on factual data and the ability to manipulate and analyze data to support their decisions. No matter what your academic business concentration is, you will most likely be a future user of analytics to some extent and work with analytics professionals.\nBusiness analytics, or simply analytics, is the use of data, information technology, statistical analysis, quantitative methods, and mathematical or computer-based models to help managers gain improved insight into their business operations and make better, fact-based decisions. Business analytics is “a process of transforming data into actions through analysis and insights in the context of organizational decision-making and problem-solving.” Business analytics is supported by various tools, such as Microsoft Excel, commercial statistical software packages such as SAS or Minitab, and more complex business intelligence suites that integrate data with analytical software.\nThe purpose of this course is to provide you with a basic introduction to the concepts, methods, and models used in big data analytics for business intelligence so that you will develop not only an appreciation for its capabilities to support and enhance business decisions but also the ability to use business analytics at an elementary level in your work.\nThe course is spread over eight modules, and each module carries a quiz to reinforce the learning experience.",

This process isn’t meant to reveal every bit of information a dataset holds, but rather to help create a broad picture of important trends and major points to study in greater detail. Data exploration can use a combination of manual methods and automated tools such as data visualizations, charts, and initial reports.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first step in your data analysis process. Here, you make sense of the data you have and then figure out what questions you want to ask and how to frame them, as well as how best to manipulate your available data sources to get the answers you need.  You do this by taking a broad look at patterns, trends, outliers, unexpected results and so on in your existing data, using visual and quantitative methods to get a sense of the story this tells. You’re looking for clues that suggest your logical next steps, questions or areas of research.\nData analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.\nData visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.\nWe will connect to Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL as our data sources then explore the database data before creating visualizations.",

You’ll gain not just rote memorization but deep conceptual clarity to tackle even the most complex scenario-based questions.\nWhy This Course?\nIndustry-Aligned Structure: Questions are organized into 6 core sections mirroring actual Big Data Engineer job requirements.\nZero Fluff, 100% Practicality: Every question tests skills directly applicable to real engineering tasks (e.g., optimizing Spark jobs, designing fault-tolerant pipelines).\nBuild Confidence: Simulate timed interviews or learn at your own pace with instant feedback.\nCovers All Experience Levels: Freshers get foundational clarity; seniors master advanced trade-offs (e.g., CAP theorem, JVM tuning).\nFull Course Breakdown: 6 Expert-Validated Sections\n(Each section contains exactly 250 questions for balanced depth)\nSection 1: Core Concepts of Big Data\nMaster foundational principles including the 5 Vs of Big Data, data lifecycle stages, batch vs. real-time processing models, and industry-specific use cases (healthcare, finance, IoT). Understand how structured/unstructured data sources drive modern analytics.\nSection 2: Big Data Tools and Frameworks\nDive deep into Hadoop (HDFS, YARN, MapReduce), Apache Spark (RDDs, DataFrames), Kafka, Flink, NoSQL databases (HBase, Cassandra), and ecosystem tools (Hive, Pig, Sqoop). Compare performance trade-offs and architectural roles.\nSection 3: Data Pipeline Design and ETL Processes\nLearn to design robust pipelines: ETL vs. ELT workflows, schema modeling, optimization techniques (partitioning, compression), error handling, and cloud integrations (AWS Glue, Azure HDInsight, Google Dataproc).\nSection 4: Real-Time Data Processing and Streaming\nMaster streaming fundamentals: event-time processing, Kafka architecture (brokers, consumer groups), Flink/Spark Streaming windowing, and real-world use cases (fraud detection, IoT telemetry).\nSection 5: Data Storage and Warehousing Solutions\nExplore distributed storage (HDFS, S3), data lakes vs. warehouses, columnar formats (Parquet, ORC), query engines (Presto, Impala), and security compliance (GDPR, Kerberos).\nSection 6: Advanced Topics and System Design\nTackle complex challenges: system design case studies (e-commerce, healthcare), CAP theorem trade-offs, performance tuning (shuffle optimization, JVM), ML integration (Spark MLlib), and emerging trends (serverless, edge computing).\n\n\nSection 1: Core Concepts of Big Data\nSample Question:\nQ: Which Big Data characteristic is primarily concerned with the consistency and reliability of data sources?\nA) Volume\nB) Velocity\nC) Variety\nD) Veracity\nCorrect Answer: D) Veracity\nExplanation: Veracity addresses data accuracy, trustworthiness, and noise levels (e.g., inconsistent IoT sensor readings or social media misinformation). Volume (A) measures data size, Velocity (B) refers to data speed, and Variety (C) covers data format diversity. Misjudging veracity leads to flawed analytics—critical when building pipelines for healthcare or finance where data integrity is non-negotiable.\n\nSection 2: Big Data Tools and Frameworks\nSample Question:\nQ: In Apache Spark, what is the primary purpose of the repartition() transformation?\nA) To reduce data shuffling during joins\nB) To coalesce partitions without full shuffle\nC) To evenly redistribute data across partitions\nD) To cache intermediate data in memory\nCorrect Answer: C) To evenly redistribute data across partitions\nExplanation: repartition() triggers a full shuffle to redistribute data uniformly across partitions, preventing skew. Option A describes broadcast joins; B refers to coalesce(); D relates to cache(). Uneven partitions cause resource wastage—this is essential for optimizing large-scale ETL jobs where skewed data can crash clusters.\n\nSection 3: Data Pipeline Design and ETL Processes\nSample Question:\nQ: When designing a cloud-based pipeline on AWS, which service is best suited for serverless orchestration of ETL workflows?\nA) Amazon EMR\nB) AWS Glue\nC) Amazon Kinesis\nD) Amazon Redshift\nCorrect Answer: B) AWS Glue\nExplanation: AWS Glue provides fully managed, serverless ETL with automatic schema detection and job scheduling. EMR (A) requires cluster management; Kinesis (C) is for streaming; Redshift (D) is a warehouse. Serverless orchestration eliminates infrastructure overhead—critical for startups needing rapid pipeline deployment without DevOps overhead.\n\nSection 4: Real-Time Data Processing and Streaming\nSample Question:\nQ: In Apache Flink, how does event time processing handle out-of-order events?\nA) By discarding late events\nB) Using watermarks and allowed lateness\nC) Through checkpointing mechanisms\nD) Via keyed state backends\nCorrect Answer: B) Using watermarks and allowed lateness\nExplanation: Watermarks define progress in event time, while allowedLateness specifies how long to wait for delayed events. Discarding late events (A) loses data; checkpointing (C) ensures fault tolerance but doesn’t reorder events; keyed state (D) manages per-key state. This is vital for financial systems where delayed transaction data must be processed accurately.\n\nSection 5: Data Storage and Warehousing Solutions\nSample Question:\nQ: Why is Parquet format preferred over CSV for analytical queries in data lakes?\nA) It supports real-time streaming ingestion\nB) Its columnar storage reduces I/O for selective queries\nC) It natively encrypts data at rest\nD) It integrates with NoSQL databases\nCorrect Answer: B) Its columnar storage reduces I/O for selective queries\nExplanation: Parquet stores data by column (not row), so queries scanning specific columns (e.g., SELECT sales FROM table) read only relevant data—slashing I/O and costs. CSV (row-based) reads entire rows. Parquet lacks native streaming (A) or encryption (C); it’s for structured analytics, not NoSQL (D). This optimization is non-negotiable for cost-efficient petabyte-scale analytics.\n\nSection 6: Advanced Topics and System Design\nSample Question:\nQ: In a distributed system, if a database prioritizes consistency and partition tolerance (CP), what must it sacrifice according to the CAP theorem?\nA) Low latency\nB) Availability during network partitions\nC) Data durability\nD) Horizontal scalability\nCorrect Answer: B) Availability during network partitions\nExplanation: CAP theorem states you can only guarantee two of: Consistency (C), Availability (A), Partition Tolerance (P). A CP system (e.g., HBase) rejects writes during partitions to maintain consistency—sacrificing availability. Low latency (A) isn’t a CAP pillar; durability (C) and scalability (D) are orthogonal. Misapplying CAP leads to catastrophic outages in e-commerce during network failures.\n\n\nKey Outcomes\nBy completing this course, you will:\nConfidently answer 95%+ of Big Data Engineer interview questions.\nUnderstand how tools work under the hood—not just memorize features.\nRecognize subtle distinctions between similar technologies (e.g., Spark Streaming vs. Flink).\nApply best practices for optimizing pipelines, storage, and security.\nSolve system design problems with scalable, fault-tolerant architectures.\nWhy Trust This Course?\n100% Interview-Focused: Questions sourced from actual FAANG, Netflix, and Fortune 500 interviews.\nNo Outdated Content: Covers modern tools (Spark 3.x, Kafka 3.0+) and cloud-native patterns.\nLearning Over Memorization: Explanations teach why—preparing you for follow-up questions.\nStructured for Efficiency: 250 questions per section lets you target weak areas fast.\nEnroll today to transform uncertainty into expertise.
