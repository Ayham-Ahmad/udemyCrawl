However, since we don't have all the whistles and extra stuff in Blender...you as a student are forced to learn the basics without cheating ;). I know from my own experience that it is a good path to walk if you really want to know how all things are put together.\nThe teacher you will get, me, has more than 10 years of experience of Blender, is educated as Technical Artist in one of the highest ranked 3D schools in the World; \"The Game Assembly\" and are currently working as a Technical Artist for the game \"Midnight Ghost Hunt\" in a Swedish Game Studio.\nNB! You will however NOT learn about how to create realistic and nice materials.

      "description": "Thanks for showing interest in our, Doodly Course: Create Whiteboard Animation with Doodly\nHey, everyone! I just wanted to share with you something I’m really excited about that’s going to help you take your doodle animation videos to the next level.\nIn the course. I will show you how to create super-professional videos, using all the advanced tips and tricks that would take most people months—and maybe even years--to uncover on their own. I’m actually kind of embarrassed to admit, but even I learned things you could do with Doodly that I had no idea you could do.\nThese Tips Are Going to Help You Create Videos That Are\nMore Professional, More Visually Stimulating, and Far More Engaging to Your Prospects…\nMeaning, they’ll be shared more often, watched longer, and ultimately, they’re going to get you much better results.\nSo, let me tell you what you can expect from the course, this course teaches you the most advanced training methods you can use for creating absolutely incredible videos.\nAnother reason you’re going to love this course is that we devised all kinds of time-saving ways to do things using Doodly. With the course, you’re basically being given the opportunity to peek over her shoulder, so you can watch an expert doodler show you the best workarounds for stuff that very few people know about.\nSo let me tell you what you’ll get:- It consists of 25videos Divided into7modules that get progressively more advanced as you move forward in the course.\nModule 1 - Solid Foundation\nThe first module is an intro to get everyone up to speed and on the same page. After that, you’ll begin the asset management module. This module creates a solid foundation for what’s to come later. It’s where you’ll learn everything you need to know about managing assets and creating complex scenes--for example, by timing characters and props to appear in a video at just the right moment, so they correspond with your voiceover.\nModule 2 - Elements Module\nOnce you’ve finished that, you’re ready to move on to the backgrounds, sidebars, borders, and frames module. These elements are crucial for making your videos pop.\nSo in this module, you’ll learn how to make a background or logo appear in every scene. You’ll also learn fading techniques you can use to lighten or darken a background sky, for example. Plus, you’ll discover how to create borders, frames, and sidebars to make your videos way more visually appealing.\nModule 3 - Asset Sourcing\nThe next module is asset sourcing, where you’ll learn how to source and create your own graphics—even if you can’t draw a stick figure. We will teach you several ways—both free and paid—for finding characters, props, and even chalkboard images you can add to the Doodly assets you already have.\nModule 4 - Powerpoint/ Keynote Assets\nPlus, you’ll learn our super-simple method for creating literally hundreds of new Doodly assets using Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple's Keynote. You’ll even learn how you can create an asset from a hand-drawn image you scribbled on a piece of your own paper!\nModule 5 - Advanced Drawing Paths\nIn the 5th module, We teach you some really fun stuff you’ll want to use all the time in your Doodly videos. You’ll learn how you can control the way a drawing comes to life with advanced drawing paths.\nYou’ll also discover how to add color to your assets, how to crop characters, and how to work with layered drawings. Plus, we will show you how to add depth to scenes by adding drop shadows to text and images.\nModule 6 - Whiteboard Animation Module\nThen, it’s on to the animation module. Here’s where you’ll learn how you can make assets fade in and out, how to create rolling credits, and how to make objects grow, shrink, shatter, fly, or reveal themselves slowly, one piece at a time.\nModule 7 - Final Module\nFinally, you’ll be ready for the last module of the course. Here’s where you’ll learn how to create square and vertical videos you can use on social media. You’re also going to learn how you can display a regular video within a Doodly video—and vice versa.\nPlus,\nwe will show you advanced tactics for working with audio. For example, you’ll discover how to prevent music from drowning out your voiceover, how you can add sound effects to your video, and how to shorten a music file so it fits your video--without sounding like it cuts off abruptly.\nSo that’s a brief overview of some of what’s in the Masterclass. It actually covers much more than that. And in case you’re wondering, we rely on Doodly for most of the stuff we teach in the course. When we have to use other software to create an effect, we use free software whenever possible.\nThe bottom line, this course is going to be really valuable to you. Not only is it going to help you create Doodly videos that are even better than the ones you’re creating now, but it’ll also save you an absolute ton of time.\nThink about it. You won’t have to bang your head against the wall, spending hours and hours trying to figure this stuff out—for a lot of people, that alone is going to make the course well worth your time.\nOK, so you’ve heard me say the course is great, but I’m sure you’re wondering what other people think about it.\nYou’ll be happy to hear that the course has gotten rave reviews from Doodly users just like you.\nA few of them were so excited about the opportunity to learn directly from us that they asked me if they could buy the course before I’d even made the course publicly accessible. I let them and so far, the feedback’s been amazing.\nBut the videos aren’t even the only thing you’re going to get with the course. The course also comes with a special bonus—15 additional files we created that you can use alongside Doodly to save you time. These files are the same ones we use throughout the course, and they’re designed to make it easier for you to work with scenes and assets.\nSo, when you replicate the things you’ve learned in the course, you won’t have to start from scratch. For example, when you’re designing scenes or altering characters, you’ll already have the tools we created, making it easier and faster for you to do advanced things with Doodly. Again, these are free bonuses that you’ll get when you access the Masterclass.\nSo why & for what you are waiting\nEnroll now in our course \" Doodly Course: Create Whiteboard Animation with Doodly \"\nEnroll Now!!!!",

I have worked for TV commercials, movie agencies and 3D animation studios, currently I’m working as a freelance character artist and 3D tutor.\n\n\nBy the end of this course:\n● You'll be able to sculpt realistic characters using blender and you’ll get a great sense of the head construction from start to finish.\n● You’ll be able to model, sculpt, make retopology, UV mapping, texture, shading, grooming and render of realistic characters.\n\n\nWHAT WILL I LEARN:\n● Blender Sculpting System\n● Blocking head guidelines\n● Sculpting the female head\n● Making Retopology\n● Head UV mapping\n● Texturing workflow\n● Skin shading process\n● Creating hair in blender\n● Rendering with cycles\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE PROJECTS:\nWe will start with a sphere using our sculpt system. Then we will make the general blocking of the head. I will explain what you should watch for in an initial sculpting. Then we will make the hair block and torso, always starting the model from the top to the bottom. Then we will make the eyelashes and eyebrows using particle system, then it we are going to make the hair too. After that we will work on the eyes shading, unwrap the head and start the texture process. After we're done with our female model and texture, we will start refining the shading and finished with the render.\n\n\nIS THIS COURSE RIGHT FOR ME:\n● I have designed this course for intermediate 3d modelling students, who want to model realistic female characters for cinematic industry but they struggle to get it because they don't find a tutorial which is step by step, no fast forward, no skip and coming from a production artist who is doing this for years.\n● The course is also for artists who want to speed up their workflow in Blender and improve their skill in making female heads, and all processes from sculpt to render.\n\n\nWHO IS NOT THE IDEAL STUDENT:\nThis course is not designed for absolute Blender beginners. This course doesn’t cover the entire body it only focuses on the face.\n\n\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW OR HAVE FOR THE COURSE:\n● I expect you have some sort of basic Blender experience.\n● You should have Blender installed on your computer.\n\n\nJOIN ME NOW:\nSo if you want to model realistic characters, then join me now, and take your skills to the next level. Don't forget that investing in yourself will pay for the rest of your life. Hope to see you in the course.",

In this course, I will take you through the entire process of creating a Pocket Watch from Start to Finish.\nThis course will take you through the entire process of creating a High Quality and Realistic asset from start to finish.\nWe will start with modelling the Pocket Watch in Blender and we will make use of Poly-modelling techniques and learn a lot about different modifiers. After finishing with the modelling we will apply all the modifiers and UV unwrap our model for exporting.\nThen after that we will export our model to Substance Painter and start by baking mesh maps for our model, after that we will start to texture our model. We will learn how to create realistic textures for our models by using different features in Substance like Smart Masks, Smart Materials etc.\nAfter we finish with texturing in Substance Painter we will take our model back to Blender and render it. We will setup the material, lighting and the camera. We will also learn how to use HDRIs. I will be rendering the scene using Cycles.\nThis course is for everyone who has a basic understanding of Blender and Substance Painter and wants to upgrade their skillset",

It is a procedural system that allows you to create complex simulations and animations with an easy-to-use interface.\n\nMASH is often used in motion graphics scenarios. However, MASH can easily be harnessed in a Visual Effects shot as it has plenty of scope to create dynamic and realistic simulations, especially when combined with the rendering power of Arnold.\nGUI is a popular area of Visual Effects and Motion Graphics. Being present in many Marvel films and plenty of other sci-fi films it is a visual that many people are familiar with.\nThis course aims to break down the process of creating GUI elements in MASH for Maya that are ready for film. These GUI elements will be rendered in Arnold for our VFX shot and we will aim to composite these elements into a greenscreen plate. The course will briefly cover chroma keying in After Effects and Nuke but the primary focus is the utilisation of MASH to create the GUI elements.\n\n\nThe pre-requisites to this course are as follows:\n\nA basic understanding of navigating Maya\nAccess to a copy of Maya from 2017 onwards\nAccess to After Effects and/or Nuke with an understanding of basic navigation\nPrevious experience of chroma keying is useful but not essential\n\nThe rest I will teach you from the ground up across 1 main exercises\n\nCourse outline\nLesson 1 – Accessing greenscreen footage (A walkthrough of where to access the greenscreen footage used in this course)\nLesson 2 – Creating and Rendering our Main GUI element (This session will introduce you to some key techniques for using MASH to create GUI elements)\n\nLesson 3 – Keying breakdown in Nuke (This session will show a breakdown of the keying process in Nuke)\n\nLesson 4 – Despill and final composite in Nuke (This session will show you some key despill methods in Nuke and it will also cover how the final composite comes together)\n\nLesson 5 – Keying and compositing in After Effects (This session will cover how you would approach the keying and compositing of the shot in After Effects)\n\nBonus Lesson – Additional GUI Assets in MASH (This Bonus Lesson will cover some additional techniques that you could use in MASH for Maya to create a wide range of additional GUI assets)\n\nProject Task (Assignment) – (This lesson will walk you through the final assignment that you have been tasked with, summarising the skills and techniques learnt in this course.\n\n\nAs mentioned above in the course outline, the course will finish with a really fun assignment where you will have the opportunity to practice the skills that you have learnt in this course!

This tool is very powerful and it allows you to create polygons with a click of the mouse. This tool enables you to create any shape you like. It allows you to add more polygons, delete polygons, and add extra EDGE LOOPS. there is also  a RELAX function that allows to space the polygons evenly, giving you a great looking model.\nYou will also learn how to create a DISPLACEMENT MAP. This map allows you to add extra details to the model without doing any extra modeling. The process is simple. Firstly, you will learn how to create UVs using the UV editor, then save the UV map to take into Photoshop.\nIn photoshop you will learn how to make the displacement map, then you will learn how to plug the map into the model for the final render.\nNext, you will earn how to set up the lighting in Maya. You will learn how to use the SKYDOME light, and how to use a HDRI map, which is a high resolution texture map that acts as a light source.\nThen you will learn how to create extra lights to create a more interesting lighting scenario, making your character look more cinematic and stylish.\nFinally, you will learn how to set up the Arnold render so you can create beautifully rendered images.\nThen afterwards, you will learn how to composite the image in Photoshop, and how to add extra details, like extra lights for the character's eyes and a background that matches the lighting on the model.\nThis course teaches you all the principles of modeling, how to light efficiently, and how to use Maya effectively for your future modeling and lighting projects.",

This course is for children, adults and  seniors. Basically for anyone who is interested in animation and passionate about it. If you are a student you will be able express your ideas more efficiently. If you are a professional, you can use animations in your presentations. If you are a senior, just interested in animation , you will have lot of fun in creating a moving cartoon. After this course you will be able to make interesting and effective animations in 2D. You will be introduced to a simple but powerful animation package. It is a very basic animation package which you can easily download from the internet. There are no too many tools to confuse you. There are may be just a dozen commands to master. I have taken special care so that even a slow learner can catch up easily. Presentation is slow, so even  if you are from a country where English is not spoken you can easily understand what I say. There are hardly half a dozen tools like selection, brush, eraser, paint bucket etc. User interface is simple and fun to look at. Even if you don't have a digital pen, just with mouse you can create great stuff. So friends, come join me in in this fantastic journey of animation. I promise , there will be a lot of fun and remain so for the rest of your life.\nSuitable examples are provided. Even a complete novice will be able to learn very comfortably. Animation revolutionizes  the way you communicate. Let it be any field, education, entertainment , web or TV.",

      "description": "Hello, I am Juan Carlos Munguia Engineering Director of the company M Aerospace RTC and in this course we will talk about the various applications that exist for 3D printing, as well as we will introduce you to the design techniques for Additive Manufacturing developed through the passing of the years within the company covering the basic principles of the various 3D printing technologies in the world.\nAdditive Manufacturing (AM), known as 3D Printing, is revolutionizing the way components are designed and produced.

Another similar technology is Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). Both are common 3D Printing technologies widely available at the consumer level. They work by melting and depositing thermoplastic on specific arrangements to form your design. You can think of it as an auto-moving hot-glue device\nHow does FDM 3D Printing work?\nFDM 3D Printing works by melting thermoplastics through a hot nozzle, then arranging that melting plastic layer by layer to form a solid part. The movements of the 3D Printer forming the final part are governed by code that is generally referred to as G-code. G-code can be automatically generated using slicer software.\nWhat are common FDM printing materials?\nAll FDM 3D Printers work by melting thermoplastics. Thus, plastics are the most common materials. More specifically, PLA and ABS plastics. However, the types of printable materials are increasing over time as the field develops further. Newer, less common materials include flexible TPU and many different composites.",

We will also do some exercises in Python. After we finish Python we will start doing VEX in Houdini. We will start with basic attributes in VEX to variables then moving to loops and its types such as for, while and do while and foreach loop which is specially used for arrays. Discussing nested loops is also a very important part of this course. We will learn how to add and remove elements from the array using loops. From there we will move to bbox functions and point, detail and HScript functions not to miss out on Sin and Cos functions. distance and xyzdist are also discussed in full detail which are important as well. Functions such as neighbours, neighbours and neighbourcount are also addressed in full detail. We will finish with point finding functions such as pcfind and pcfind radius.

I will explain what you should watch for in an initial sculpting. Then we will make the torso and legs, starting the body from the bottom to the top. Then we will make the feet, arms and hands. After that we will work on the overall sculpt and head, so we are gonna finish the body details and volumes as well set up the scene to create a render presentation.\n\n\nWho is This Course For?\nI have designed this course for intermediate 3d modelling students, who want to model beautiful looking production ready female anatomy characters but they struggle to get it because they don't find a tutorial which is step by step, no fast forward, no skip and coming from a production artist who is doing this for years.\nThe course is also for artists who want to speed up their workflow in Blender and improve their skill in making female anatomy.\n\n\nWho is Not The Ideal Student For This Course?\nThis course is not designed for absolute Blender beginners.\n\n\nWhat Are The Requirements Or Prerequisites For Taking This Course?\nI expect you to have some sort of basic blender experience.\nYou should have blender 3.2 installed on your computer.\n\n\nJoin Me Now:\nSo if you want to model realistic anatomy in blender, then join me now, and take your skills to the next level. Don't forget that investing in yourself will pay for the rest of your life. Hope to see you in the course.",

How to add, delete them, and other useful actions.\nWe will learn the basic modifiers such as: subdivision surface, mirror, solidify, remesh. We will work in sculpting mode. We will study the main brushes that are most often used. I will teach you how to use masking and show interesting features with its use.\n\n\nI'll tell you the principle of unwrapping the plane of a 3d model on a 2D texture.

How to understand the\n\n\n\nDesign philosophy:\n\n\nAs I used to say in my design courses, that design cannot be learned in the rot learning way or Text book learning way that you learn through a chapter and remember some formulas that will yield you some solutions. Design is unique and when different people approach the same we will get different solutions based on the inputs that designer works on.\nSo design can be approached in the way of learning through the case studies and by doing action on your own to learn yourself.\nLearning by doing and learning by action.\n\n\nBenefits of the Master Class:\n\n\nLearn about the form generation with the basic elements of shapes like squares, cylinders, spheres and how it can manipulated as a form.\nHow to convert forms from basic shapes in to many forms and then to iterate them beacuse form keeps getting beautifies or evolved only when it is iterated.\nHow by basic sketching we can iterate simple forms to start visualising the variations and beauty it can be create from with which we cn actually learn form generation and study\nHow to add colours and elements to make look like solid forms and gives some attributes\nHow to convert 2D forms to 3D forms and visualise the same\nHow to generate forms in material like wood and thermocol and study them for form manipulation and radii manipulation how to present them.\nHow to generate with the visual expression arrived from the bike to air automobiles and make a 3D form out of it\nLearning about the form addition, form subtraction, form integration in depth by inserting the cube 67 times and seeing the final outcome",

      "description": "Welcome to a creative journey into the world of 3D rendering and real-time visualization — a course designed to transform your architectural exteriors using Chaos Vantage and V-Ray or Corona.\nThis isn’t just a set of tutorials. It’s a complete, project-based learning experience, shaped by years of professional rendering at MIMViz, a studio known for its high-end 3D architectural renderings. Every technique, every tip in this course is taken straight from real-world rendering workflows and delivered with clarity.\nIf you already use V-Ray or Corona Renderer to build materials for your 3D scenes, this course will help you take the next step — turning static images into cinematic real-time animations using Chaos Vantage.\n\n\nYou’ll learn how to:\n• Set up realistic 3D lighting that enhances your renders\n• Create immersive atmospheric effects to add emotional depth\n• Animate 3D objects (like wind turbines) with natural motion\n• Design camera paths for smooth, storytelling-style 3D animation\n• Master real-time rendering techniques using Chaos Vantage\n• Scatter objects and foliage efficiently across 3D environments\n• Export beautiful, professional renders and animations\n\n\nYou’ll get the full 3D project file, including all textures and assets, so you can practice rendering and animation every step of the way. The entire course is hands-on and project-driven — you’ll build, animate, and render as you learn.\nEvery question you have will be answered with care — because your growth as a 3D artist matters.\nThink of this as a creative journey through light, space, and motion — a rendering experience where you learn to direct your scenes, not just light them.\nIf you have a 3D model and materials set up in V-Ray, you’re ready to begin.\nI’ll see you in class — and I can't wait to see what you’ll render.",

Lectures focus on modelling assets that can then instantly be used outside of the course for whatever purpose you desire if its to use in games, animations and 3d printing.\nThe course is divided into sections based on object types rather than difficulty, meaning that a student can follow a single section of this course and by the end of that section they will have the models they need to create a scene. For example the course has a section on constructing objects found in the dining room.\nIf you have a basic understanding blender 3d, then this is the perfect course to begin creating your own 3D models for your own personal use. Even though we will dive in at the deep end for 3d modelling, every step of the modelling process will be explained for every model that you create.",

I am Harshavardhan, a professional 3D designer, I have always been fascinated by great looking industrial design products all my life , join me on this course where I will be showing you to model, texture and render a drill machine from scratch using 2d drawings.\n\n\nIn the following lessons, we will be taking a look at specialised polygonal modelling techniques that I use to visualise products. This involves creating a 3D mesh surfaces from 2d drawings, blocking out the basic forms to fine detailing, solving common modelling problems, understanding shading using procedural techniques offered in blender, followed by basic lighting and rendering. This course aims to deliver 3d modelling techniques which will give you an idea on product modelling in general and can be used to create any product and not just a drill machine. The techniques can be used in in a variety of applications such a industrial design or prop design for games or film. We will be doing all this inside blender without needing any other software.\n\n\nAlthough this tutorial is done using blender, the techniques can be easily translated into any other polygonal modelling software package such as Maya, 3Ds max, cinema 4d, Modo etc.\n\n\nI am excited to share my learning which I acquired over the past few years. Enrol now and I hope to see you in the course.\n\n\nMusic Credits Bensound",

      "description": "Introducing: ‘Blender Basics Geometry Node Brick Walls Workshop'!\nHave you ever wanted to create detailed and realistic brick walls for your 3D projects? Or perhaps you're looking to master Blender and explore the powerful capabilities of Geometry Nodes?\nIf so, this workshop is perfect for you!\nWelcome to the 'Blender Basics Geometry Node Brick Walls Workshop'! I'm Luke, your guide from 3D Tudor, where we sprinkle a bit of 3D magic to enhance your virtual environments. We also whip up Blender Geometry Nodes to turbocharge your workflow, making your projects smoother than a buttered pancake.\nToday, I’m thrilled to guide you through the 'Blender Basics Geometry Node Brick Walls Workshop', where you'll learn to create your own geometry nodes from scratch!\nWhy This Workshop?\nIn this spellbinding course, we'll start from square one, ensuring that even if your 3D skills are currently at zero, you’ll be a pro in no time.\nWe’ll kick things off with some introductory videos that walk you through the Blender viewport and the arcane art of shading. This rock-solid foundation will prepare you for the wizardry to come as we delve deeper into the enchanting world of the 'Blender Basics Geometry Node Brick Walls Workshop'.\nTop 6 points about 'Blender Basics Geometry Node Brick Walls Workshop':\nBeginner-Friendly Approach: Accessible to all experience levels with introductory videos on Blender navigation and shading.\nHands-On Geometry Node Learning: Engage in practical projects, starting with basic mesh lines and progressing to a complete brick wall generator.\nDynamic Parameter Techniques: Create dynamic spawn points and precise alignments for natural, professional 3D models.\nEfficiency and Workflow Optimization: Learn to clean up and organize Geometry Nodes, enhancing readability and efficiency.\nAdvanced Texturing and Material Generation: Master aged effects, gaps, weathering, and realistic PBR materials for detailed brick walls.\nPractical Castle Project: Apply skills in a miniature castle project, creating walls, towers, pathways, and decorations using Geometry Nodes.\nInitial Setup\nUsing Mesh Lines: Our journey starts by using mesh lines from custom curvatures. We'll create duplicates of these lines vertically within Geometry Nodes, which will serve as the placement for our bricks. This will give you a solid grasp of setting up your project and preparing it for more intricate details.\nDynamic Elements\nCreating Dynamic Spawn Points: Next, we'll move on to creating dynamic spawn points that adjust based on the scale of a curve. Using the curve length node, you’ll learn to control the spawn rate and ensure your bricks are placed accurately and dynamically.\nCurve Placement and Alignment: Positioning is key in any 3D model. We’ll utilize the 'index' node to align our points along the curvature, creating an offset value for a randomized yet cohesive placement of bricks. This will help you achieve a natural look for your walls.\nMaintaining Uniformity\nEnsuring Uniform Columns: One of the challenges in creating brick walls is maintaining uniformity while allowing for variation. We’ll tackle this by learning how to keep the first and last columns straight, ensuring a clean and professional appearance.\nEfficient Workflow: Efficiency is crucial in any workflow. We’ll dedicate a lesson to cleaning up our Geometry Nodes, setting up reroutes, and grouping nodes for better readability and usability. You’ll also learn to hide unused parameters, making your setup more compact and efficient.\nCreating Bricks\nBrick Formation: Creating the bricks themselves is a fun and rewarding process. You’ll learn to form brick shapes from primitive cubes, rescale them based on your curvature setup, and add random variations to their size. We’ll also align brick rotations to the curve using the 'align euler to vector' node, ensuring each brick fits perfectly in place.\nAdding Character\nWeathering Effects: To add character to your walls, we’ll explore how to create aged effects. You’ll learn to set up gaps, create individual rotation offsets, and apply weathering effects using noise textures. We’ll also cover dynamic resolution changes and bevel techniques to achieve that weathered, realistic look.\nCement Fillers: Cement fillers between bricks are essential for authenticity. We’ll create a cement layer using grid creation techniques, accurately positioning it along the curve shape. You’ll learn to offset the cement based on brick scale, ensuring it always fits perfectly.\nTexturing and Shading\nTexture Generation: Texture generation is where your wall comes to life. We’ll combine noise textures with PBR materials to create realistic brick textures. You’ll also learn to randomize brick colors based on the Cycles renderer and highlight brick edges for added detail.\nPractical Application\nFinal Project: We’ll finish with a practical project where you can apply everything you’ve learned in the 'Blender Basics Geometry Node Brick Walls Workshop'. You’ll create a castle wall and tower, complete with walkable pathways and detailed decorations. We’ll tweak parameters and shaders to fit different scenes, cut holes for windows, and create a slanted tower roof.\nCourse Duration and Benefits\nThroughout the course, you’ll benefit from annotations that help visualize each step of the process, making it more intuitive and easier to follow.\nThis 23-lesson, 4-hour and a half hour course is packed with valuable information and hands-on experience. By the end, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of Blender’s Geometry Nodes and the ability to create detailed and dynamic brick walls for any project.\nKey Lessons\nLesson 1 - Blender Viewport Basics:\nMaster the foundational skills needed to navigate and manipulate the Blender viewport effectively.\nLesson 2 - Introduction to Geometry Nodes:\nDiscover the basics of geometry nodes and how they can be utilized in Blender to create complex structures.\nLesson 3 - Creating Curve Line Layers:\nExplore the process of creating curve line layers to build the base structure of your brick wall.\nLesson 8 - Creating Brick Primitives Using Dynamic Width and Height Parameters:\nCreate versatile brick primitives by adjusting dynamic width and height parameters.\nLesson 18 - Blender Material Shader Basics:\nGet introduced to the basics of Blender material shaders to start adding color and texture.\nAdditional Lessons (Summarized):\nCreating Dynamic Spawn Points: Set up dynamic spawn points to control the placement of your geometry nodes.\nCurve Placement and Alignment: Learn to position curves accurately along points for precise alignment in your projects.\nGeometry Node Cleanup: Clean up your geometry nodes for a more efficient workflow.\nBrick Surface Details: Add realistic surface details to your bricks with bevel and displacement techniques.\nAdvanced Texturing Techniques: Generate realistic cement shader materials and create normal and roughness PBR values.\nPractical Project Application: Apply your skills to create a castle wall and tower, complete with walkable pathways and detailed decorations.\n\n\nSumming it all up\n\n\nThe 'Blender Basics Geometry Node Brick Walls Workshop' is like Hogwarts for Blender enthusiasts!

      "description": "UV Mapping Bootcamp: Master Unwrapping & Texturing in Blender\nBad UVs wreck great artwork—master clean, distortion-free unwrapping today!\nI am Luke from 3D Tudor, and UV Mapping Bootcamp distills fifteen years of texturing pain points into one focused Blender workshop. We will turn stretched checkerboards into crisp atlases, tame texel density, and build trimsheet-ready layouts that export cleanly to Substance, Unreal, and Unity.\nStretched textures, popping seams, and checkerboards that slide around like budget origami can make even a gorgeous model look amateur in seconds. I have fought those same misbehaving UVs myself, so let us sort them out together and give your textures the respect they deserve!\nWhat You Will Learn\nThe real purpose of UVs and how Blender’s editor organises them\nSmart UV Project versus seam-driven unwrapping—choose the right tool for the job\nCube, cylinder, and sphere projections (and how to combine them)\nTroubleshooting: flipped normals, hidden overlaps, mip-map bleed, poor packing\nConsistent texel density across modular scenes, props, and characters\nTrimsheet workflows for bolts, vents, and sci-fi panels\nTexture-atlas strategy: pack more detail into fewer materials\nHuman and creature unwrapping—ears, mouth bags, fingers, and toes without stretch\nVertex-paint blending, AO masks, and curvature maps that respect your UVs\nInside the Course\nStage 1 – UV Concepts & Basics\nWe start at the beginning—what UVs are, how they work, and why they matter. You will see how 3D surfaces are flattened into 2D space and how Blender’s UV Editor helps you control distortion. We also break down UV axes, the role of checker maps, and the difference between good and bad UVs. Visual tools and real-time examples set the foundation before moving into more hands-on workflows.\nStage 2 – Auto Unwrapping\nHere, we speed through Blender’s Smart UV Project tool. You will learn how it slices geometry based on angles, when to use it for hard-surface models, and where it falls short (like painting or packing). We explore how the tool auto-rotates UV islands and the trade-offs of speed vs. precision.\nStage 3 – Projection Methods\nLearn how cube, cylinder, and sphere projections behave when applied to different meshes. We test them on primitive and subdivided models, using checker maps to identify which method works best for each shape—and when to mix them.\nStage 4 – UV Troubleshooting\nThis stage focuses on clean geometry and solid workflows. You will learn to apply transforms, fix flipped normals, avoid mipmap bleed, and handle overlapping UVs. We also introduce Blender and Substance tools for visualising distortion, and explore padding’s role in texture clarity across engines.\nStage 5 – Volume vs. Surface Density\nUnderstand how surface area affects texel density. Through examples like brick walls and terrain planes, you will learn to optimise padding, scale, and UV island layout to get the most resolution without visual compromise.\nStage 6 – Organic Unwrapping\nUnwrapping irregular shapes—like mushrooms and rocks—requires a different mindset. You will mark seams for curved objects, balance seam visibility with material flow, and test UV quality using procedural materials. Perfect for stylised or organic assets.\nStage 7 – Custom Shape Strategy\nWhen textures need directional alignment (like roof tiles), you will learn how to unwrap cones, pyramids, and house shapes to preserve visual consistency. We also cover stylised rock unwrapping, showing how to prioritise density and flow depending on the asset’s purpose.\nStage 8 – Directional Noise & Flow\nThis stage tackles directional textures—like wood grain—and how UVs affect their appearance. Using a stylised sign, we compare directional vs. non-directional materials, introduce the Magic UV and UV Squares add-ons, and show how to control texture flow for better realism.\nStage 9 – Beveled Mesh Workflow\nBevel modifiers are great visually, but difficult for UVs. We unwrap a stylised barrel before and after applying bevels, showing how early planning and proper seam placement can preserve clean UVs, even on rounded geometry.\nStage 10 – 0–1 UV Space & Atlases\nHere, we jump into real-time workflows. You will unwrap props like shelves, books, and plants using a single UV space. Learn how to scale islands based on asset importance, align layout to a master atlas, and balance quality with modularity.\nStage 11 – Human Unwrapping\nAnatomical forms need care. You will learn how to unwrap hands, feet, ears, and facial features like the nose and mouth bag. We cover pinning, stretching, and isolating geometry to maintain clean seams and efficient island management for humanoid characters.\nStage 12 – Vertex Painting Prep\nLow-res terrain or large landscape meshes need special treatment. You will unwrap them efficiently and create shaders that let you paint directly on the geometry—great for blending textures without blowing up texel costs.\nStage 13 – Procedural Masks & Decals\nYou will explore AO, curvature, and gradient masks inside Blender and Substance Painter. We also dive into decals for breaking up repetition and use shaders to blend in extra details where needed—essential for stylised props or terrain.\nStage 14 – Trimsheet Techniques\nWe end with trimsheets. You will learn to align UVs to trim patterns, bend and mirror them, and use them to quickly decorate stylised props like sci-fi crates. This technique is the crown jewel of UV reuse, giving you complex texture results with minimal overhead.\nWhy This Course Stands Out\nExpect a zero-fluff blueprint that starts with a cube, scales up to characters, and ends with a production-ready asset. Every pitfall is demonstrated, fixed, and summarised—so the workflow survives version updates and engine changes.\nWhen the course ends, you will spend your time designing art, not hunting stretched pixels.\nUntil next time, happy modelling everyone!\nLuke – 3D Tudor",

      "description": "This one's epic, folks! Over 30 hours of pure 3D awesomeness! I will take you on your amazing 3D journey on how to create a Gundam robot character from those classic Japanese cartoon shows.\nYou will learn how to model the head, the helmet and all the details on it, then the body, the arms, the legs -- in fact the entire thing! And then how to model the weapons.\nYou will master the most common modelling tools. How to use the various options, and shortcuts. You will master the Multi-Cut Tool, the Bevel Tool, the Mirror Tool, and how to master component selections.\nYou will learn all about topology and resolution. What makes great topology, and how to fix bad topology. You will earn how to create quadrangulated geometry - that is, 4-sided geometry.\nYou will learn how to work in low resolution level, and how to increase the geometry to high resolution. You will understand how adding holding edge loops creates sharper edges for your models.\nYou will learn how to delete history, how to center the pivot, and how to freeze transformations -- very important aspects in 3D modelling.\nFinally, you will get to pose the character to make him look interesting and exciting. A big part of modelling is presentation, so therefore it is very important that your model looks like it has personality.",

      "description": "Whether you're just opening Blender for the first time or looking to refine your skills to professional polish, this training is your all-access pass to mastering the 3D pipeline — one object, one detail, one shortcut at a time.\nThis training condenses over 15 years of my experience teaching 3D to professionals. I started using Blender relatively recently after many years and awards on Cinema 4D, and I love how this free, open-source software makes 3D accessible to anyone.\nI designed this scene to be as close as possible to a real-world project, showcasing  a variety of techniques and strategies that can be used to achieve your goals.\nStart simple — model a breakfast table. An orange. An apple. A banana. A spoon resting by a coffee cup. A glass of fresh juice. By the time you're done, it’s not just food — it’s photorealism.\nThen level up. Sculpt artisan bread, simulate cloth drapes, and scatter droplets on fruit with Geometry Nodes. Simulate a pile of delicious-looking coffee beans. Model a Moka pot with engineering-level precision, then shade it with custom metal materials, scratches and all.\nUV unwrap like a pro. Paint your models with subtlety and flair. Dive into Eevee and Cycles and discover how to make your scenes pop with lighting, materials, and mood. Smoke, sunlight, condensation, and cinematic camera moves — it’s all here.\nFrom static to cinematic. Set your scene, light it like a director, and breathe life into your shots with animation and compositing.\nThis isn’t just training. It’s a step-by-step, object-by-object transformation into a 3D artist who can model, texture, shade, light, and render — with confidence.\n120+ focused lessons. No fluff. Just pure Blender magic.\nReal-world results. Professional techniques. Begginer friendly.\nOne scene. Many lessons. Endless possibilities.\nReady to create your world?",

Are you interested in a course that guides your hand and takes you step-by-step through a series of gradually more complex designs until you are confident in making anything you want? If you are then this course is for you! I designed this course to introduce design in a cohesive and practical way, by taking real life objects and giving them a sci-fi twist! We will take objects like thermoses, crates, shovels, helmets, concrete barriers, medkits, glasses, traffic cones, coolers, game consoles, and more and turn them into sleek sci-fi props. You will become proficient in 3D Studio Max, V-Ray, and Plasticity and learn some great techniques for fast design such as the auto-crease workflow for Max. To sweeten the deal, in addition to modeling, you will also learn how to create procedural materials in V-Ray so you can add complex detail and damage and grime to your models right away without having to worry about unwrapping UVs or going into Substance Painter. V-Ray decals are used extensively so you can add stickers and logos quickly by just placing the decal object on your model. You will also learn how to easily render and add post-processing effects, volume lights, and lens effects directly in Max without having to go into Photoshop or any other program. Max and V-Ray have all that you need! This course will continue to get updates for months to come so be sure to visit often to see the new content and stay tuned for updates on my Youtube channel: Arrimus3D.",

      "description": "In this series, we'll be introduced to the world of Fibermesh in Zbrush. We'll first use Fibermesh on a simple plane and using some of the many groom brushes to 'brush' the hairs. We'll then move onto adjusting hairs with symmetry as well as doing some polypainting on the hairs for colour. We'll then go over some hair styling ideas for what we might want to create for our main Horn Head mesh by examining some painted hair layers in Photoshop. Once we decide on a style, we'll then use Fibermesh to start to create each hair element (beard, stubble, goatee, etc) individually and then we'll use the groom brushes to add more natural variations to the fibers/hairs we create.\nFinally, we'll use polypainting to color and tint the hair on the Horn Head's face to something more naturalistic and complimentary to the character. A final render to see how it all turns out and then looking at the render pass in Photoshop will complete our whirlwind introduction to Fibermesh!\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nStephen Wells is an expert 3D modeler for characters, props, vehicles, weapons and environments and have created both high and low polygon assets for game productions. He has over 20 years experience in creating a variety of game assets for several different genres (fantasy, sci-fi, combat, superheroes, horror, etc) using 3ds Max, Maya, Photoshop, ZBrush, Mudbox, Topogun, and xNormal. As an enthusiastic instructor, he loves creating video tutorials on a wide variety of subjects to help students better their skillsets.",

      "description": "Hello Houdini Artists.! This course will show you all the steps involved in setting up an Avalanche FX rig.\nThere are over 5 hours of lecture videos going over the process of creating this setup.\nYou should have working knowledge of Houdini before enrolling in this course. If you have done my previous Houdini course “Master Houdini FX”, you will have all the Houdini basics needed to be able to follow this course with ease.\nThis course is “Fast paced”, which means I will not be explaining every function of every node I use on screen. I will explain what is necessary, but basic nodes will not be explained in detail, this is to try keeping this total course time to a minimum and to not bore those that have a working knowledge of Houdini's core functions and nodes.\nAll lectures will have Houdini hip files for you to download and any other necessary assets. There are two sets of files for students to download. Files for those rendering in Redshift, and files for those rendering in default Mantra. The rendered output of the Redshift render will not be exact to the Mantra output since they are different engines using different shaders and lighting, but they will be pretty close.\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I encourage you to watch the intro video and watch some of the “free” videos so you can get a sense of what the course is like.\nThis course will be using Houdini 18.5.499. If you have any version of Houdini that has sparse solving, then you should have no problems following along with the lecture videos. You can still do the entire course if using an earlier version(as long as it has grains), you would just have to use the dense solver for our snow powder sim.\n\n\nHere is the basic breakdown of the course:\n\n\nWe will start by examining the still image I used to create a \"2.5D\" scene for us to create our Avalanche Effect in.\n\n\nWe will discuss what parallax is and why it is important and how to \"fake it\" to create what looks like moving footage from any still image.\n\n\nWe will show how to use grains to create a large volume of particles that stick together like a body of snow moving down a mountain side.\n\n\nWe will see how to do many tricks to add additional FX elements like small particles flying up from the leading edge and use sparse solving to create volumetric snow powder.\n\n\nWe will see how to create 3D geometry from a textured plane to generate Tree collision geometry.\n\n\nI will show you a trick to get the volumetric snow powder to trigger emission of particles to act as a wind force.\n\n\nWe will then go into rendering and I will show how to create all the renders necessary for a full comp.\n\n\nWe will be using Redshift in the course and on screen, however you can use Mantra if you do not have the Redshift Plugin. There will be scene files for you to download that are setup for Redshift shaders, and another set of scene files that are for rendering with Mantra shaders.\n\n\nOnce all the renders are done, we will assemble a full comp using Natron, or you can use Nuke if you have access to it.\n\n\nI will be presenting a very straight forward and approach to creating an FX shot like this. We will break it down into smaller sims and go through it step by step progressively building new sims from previous sims until we are done with the shot.\n\n\nIf you have been using Houdini for a little while, you should have no problems following this course. If you need a refresher or are just starting to use Houdini, I recommend doing my first Houdini course “Master Houdini FX” as a primer to this course.",

      "description": "3D Walk Cycle Animation using Autodesk Maya is an intermediate 3D Animation course that teaches how to animate a human walk cycle.\nThe aim of the course is to showcase the animation pipeline of creating an organic and well-balanced 3D walk cycle. This workflow is the base for both 3D films and games.\nThroughout the course, we'll build the mechanics of the walk cycle through several and progressive animation passes. You will develop a strong foundation on how to build the animation from blocking the first key contact posses, to cleaning the motion graphs, to adding the final body overlaps.\nUnderstanding the mechanics behind real human locomotion is crucial for a walk animation. Therefore, this course offers an insight into human locomotion concepts in connection to the animation pipeline.\nThis course it’s an insight on how to bring that spark of life into a human character and once you follow this workflow you’ll be able to animate any human walk, with any type of rig because the secret is the same.\nTeaching modules\nThe course is being divided into several sections covering all the necessary tools with a 100% real-time animation process and explanations. The workflow is a progressive where each animation pass is being saved as a new Maya scene.\nThe course modules are:\nIntroduction Lecture\nSetting the Maya Project\nAnimation Pass 1. Heel Contact Postures\nAnimation Pass 2. Foot Pass Postures\nAnimation Pass 3. Squash Postures\nAnimation Pass 4. Stretch Postures\nAnimation Pass 5. Cleaning the Motion Graphs\nAnimation Pass 6. Arms Overlaps\nAnimation Pass 7. Head Overlaps\nAnimation Pass 8. Feet Grounding and Orientation\nAnimation Pass 9. Final Cycle and Good Bye\nWhat you’ll learn in this course\nA human walk cycle is known as a gait cycle where each walking step is being build up from 4 key poses: the heel contact, the squash pose, the passing pose and the stretch pose, after which we walk back into the the second step. This course is approaching all this in great detail.\nAs animators, we must use real world principles in order to capture the illusion of a believable motion. So the course starts with a short lecture on Animation Resources and Workflows but also a brief into the real science of Bio-mechanics for Human Locomotion.\nThen, we gonna approach the animation task with a plan in how to address  all the animation passes. This approach optimizes the process and creates clarity. Therefore, each animation pass or course section starts with a few minutes introduction around what we need to accomplish. And then, then will jump into action.\nThe working files\n1 Maya project containing 10 different *.ma files, each file represents an animation pass, from blocking version to final version\n1 JPG file as a walk cycle animation planning sheet\n1 Ghosting Script, free resource\n1 Character Maya rig with texture files, free resource\n4 playblast Videos of the final Walk Animation (front, back, side, perspective views)\nSpecific animation tools and frameworks\nMaya Project and File Referencing\nTimeline, Auto-keying, Graph Editor\nCreating a custom shelf with shortcuts and tools\nInstalling and using a Maya Ghosting Script\nAfter this course\nRemember, the walk cycle animation is an extremely knowledgeable process in learning character animation, with the right rig and the right application of animation principles this course gives you a very solid foundation for bio-mechanics animation.\nOnce you understand the mechanics and workflows of the generic human locomotion, you'll get a huge boost of confidence and skills. You’ll be able to create any type of walk cycle animation, any type of personally walk, using any type of human character.",

      "description": "MAKE 70% OF YOUR ANIMATION LOOK AMAZING\nIt’s time to improve all your animation ideas by making each frame look awesome. How? By creating beautiful backgrounds.\nMost animations done by beginners are ignored. Why? One of the reasons is that if you pause the video at any time, the image looks wrong, why? Because as we know the background usually takes 70% of the screen.\nSo, if the background is ugly, then 70% of the frame is ugly. And that will cause the animation to look bad. Animations that look bad get ignored.\nThat is not what we want for you.\nMichael Schutte, your instructor, understands how it feels to have something to share, and no one who cares.\nThrough his live academy in Canada, he has been able to help tons of students become great artists.\nWith art, now they can express themselves\nWhy did we choose to work with him? Well because:\nHe is a really cool guy\nAnd he is also one of the top 10 Best Wild-Life Painters in all Europe.\n(Yes, being a cool guy comes first in my priority list, credentials come second)\nMichael Schutte will help you paint something that, if your spouse or sibling is walking by while you are training, they will stop by and look with their mouths open, not believing what they are seeing. They will say: “Did you paint this?”\nAnd with your chest high you will say: “Yeah, I made it”\nBeing proud of your work, feeling that finally what you do is something people care about, is a great feeling.\nHow do you get there? Simple! All you have to do is follow plan:\nTHE DIGITAL ARTIST DEVELOPMENT PLAN\nSTEP 1: Take Lessons\nSTEP 2: Practice\nSTEP 3: Improve\n\n\nENROLL NOW\n\n\nYou can struggle getting attention to your ideas, by making your animations look bad.\nOr you can have people stop cold and pay attention to your work by creating animations that look really good.\nGreat backgrounds will at least make 70% of each frame looking great.\nJust imagine the options you will have once you graduate as a digital painter:\nPaint beautiful backgrounds for your projects, making 70% of every frame looking amazing.\nBe hired as a digital painter by others\nBe hired by us as a coach to help beginners starting as digital painters\nBeing hired of course doesn’t depend only on your digital painting skills, it will also depend on your work ethic, being responsible to deliver on time, have great communication with clients and being a kind person in general. (We don’t hire arrogant buttheads)\n\n\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN?\nThis is what you will be painting.\nYou will learn how to get and download cool brushes to use in Photoshop. Use the Pentool for masking and to create artistic lines.\nYou will also learn about art appreciation, understanding how painters use composition and some of the rules.\nThen you will be painting the background for a Sci-Fi Space desert.\nYou will be:\n- Adding some clouds\n- Paint the background mountains\n- Adding a Planet\n- Then continue with the background mountains\n- Then the right side of the mountain\n- The balanced rock\n- The Arch\n- Then the river\n- And finally ending by adding some smoke effects to the painting.\n\n\nThe course will have a lot of fast forward moments just to not take much of your time, but just so you know, you can change the speed of the playback if you want.\nIf the video is too fast for you, you can just go to the bottom right of this player and select the gear icon, that is the settings. Then just change the playback speed. You can play it faster or slower if you want.\nExcited?\nGood! Join us and get ready to paint with Michael Schutte.\nRequirements:\nA digital drawing tablet (iPad, or any Drawing Tablet like Wacom Intuos or Wacom Cintiq)\nA drawing software (We recommend Photoshop, but you can follow along with Procreate on iPad, Clip Studio Paint, Affinity, etc)\nWhatever software you choose, you need to already be familiar with it.\nHow to set up a new Document\nHow to change Brush Sizes\nHow to change Brush Types",

      "description": "Do you want to make realistic CG Animals?\nTried searching for a step by step tutorial online but still no luck?\nThen I welcome you to Nexttut education's Realistic Animal Creation for Film: Zbrush and Maya Xgen course.\n\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU LEARN FROM ME:\nMy name is Adrian Krokodil and with a bit of medical background I founded a company called SA Anatomy where I have been teaching human & animal anatomy in ZBrush for many years now. Precision & Accuracy has been always mandatory for me since I supply 3D Anatomical models around the globe.\n\n\nBy the end of this course:\nSculpt accurate animal anatomy.\nTexture & groom realistic animals.\nRender awesome portfolio piece.\n\n\nWHAT WILL I LEARN:\nSculpting the basic tiger skeleton with ZSphere\nSculpting the major superficial muscles\nAdding skin & fat layer on top\nQuick retopology using ZRemesher & PolyGroups\nQuick UV unwrap in ZBrush\nPosing our animal\nMaking a stand & eye parts\nPolypaint our sculpts\nExport all the required maps & files for Maya\nGroom in Xgen & render in Maya/Arnold\nColor Correction In Photoshop\n\n\nCOURSE PROJECTS:\nWe will start by customizing our Zbrush so we can work much faster and efficiently. Then we’ll use our ZSphere to block out the basic skeleton. Then after our proportions are in place we’ll start blocking our muscles. Then we will sculpt the skin & fat layer on top(without the fine details yet). After that we will do a quick zremesher on our model using polygroups & guides, this is not to say our model will be game ready, it's just for us to get decent typology(Manual retopology is always recommended). We’ll then sculpt a stand for our animal to help best present our art for our portfolio & model the eyes. Then we'll do quick UV’s in ZBrush(Again not production ready).Then we’ll pose our animal to a specific dynamic pose. Then we’ll sculpt some fine details(We’ll not be too concerned about the animal as it will be covered in fur). Then we’ll polypaint our sculpts using ZBrush spotlight (which we’ll also serve as guides for our groom). We’ll use the multimap exporter to export the required maps & files for maya. Then we’ll groom our animal in maya xgen then set up a quick scene for our renders with MtoA. Then lastly we’ll do some quick color correction for our render in Photoshop.\n\n\nIS THIS COURSE RIGHT FOR ME:\nI have designed this course for beginner sculptors, who want to sculpt anatomically correct animals in ZBrush but they struggle because they don't find a tutorial which is step by step, no fast forward, no skip and coming from a human & animal anatomy artist who’s been doing this for years.\nThe course is also for artists who want basic knowledge in grooming & rendering realistic animals in Maya.\n\n\nWHO IS NOT THE IDEAL STUDENT:\nThis course is not designed for absolute beginner Zbrush & Maya users.\n\n\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW OR HAVE FOR THE COURSE:\nI expect you to have some sort of basic ZBrush, Maya & Photoshop experience.\nYou should have Zbrush, Maya & Photoshop installed on your computer.\n\n\nJOIN ME NOW:\nSo if you want to sculpt realistic animals in ZBrush, then join me now, and take your skills to the next level. Hope to see you in the course.",

For a low price you will learn to both remake assets by staying faithful to the original design as well as put new twists on existing designs to make them fresh and exciting.\n\n\nAre you looking to work on remakes and reboots in the game or movie industry? Are you a fan who wants to create custom content using your favorite franchises? Are you interested in cosplay and creating detailed pieces for costumes? Are you interested in 3D-printing and creating figurines? Are you just interested in learning 3D modeling in a fun and intuitive way? Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro, I believe this course can benefit you by showing the refined techniques I use to remodel and redesign game assets, from very low-poly older assets to newer ones as well. This course has something for everyone.\n\n\nIn section one, you'll learn to take a Gamecube-era 3D model and recreate it with Zbrush sculpting, as well as a little poly-modeling in Max, by staying very close to the original design. You'll learn to sculpt the organic body as well as to sculpt convincing damaged metal, cloth, and even how to quickly texture these pieces in Zbrush for quick presentation to clients.\n\n\nIn section two I take a Playstation 2-era model and remodel it, mostly in Max but also doing some damage in Zbrush.\n\n\nIn section three I take a very low-poly model from Sonic Generations and recreate it while adding detail in choice parts.\n\n\nIn section four I take the iconic HEV suit from Half Life 2 and put a fresh spin on it, using Max and the CAD program Plasticity, so you can learn how to use the strengths of multiple programs and styles of modeling to detail and upgrade your models.\n\n\nIn section five, see how I take a newer asset of Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 2 Remake and use Zbrush and Max to give him a futuristic makeover.\n\n\nAs with all Arrimus 3D courses, new videos will continue to be added along with new sections, so you receive over thirty seven hours of content and then much more in the future.\n\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Remake, Resident Evil 4 Remake. Super Mario RPG Remake, Ocarina of Time 3D, Shadow of the Colossus, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, System Shock, Doom, and much much more. Remakes, reboots, remasters are hot and on the rise. And now with Nvidia’s RTX Remix it’s faster and easier than ever to insert your remade models into games.\n\n\nWhether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro, I believe this course can benefit you by showing the refined techniques I use to remodel and redesign game assets, from very low-poly older assets to newer ones as well.",

      "description": "A big problem that a lot of CG artists face, when trying to use or create different textures for their objects and assets is that when they apply that texture to that object, the results don't look right. They look as if the textures do not match the object correctly; the textures end up looking either kind of crooked or distorted, and ultimately seem as though they do not belong to that object. This is where experience with UVW Maps and Unwrapping can come to the rescue. An experienced 3D artist knows that they have to properly Unwrap that object, inspect and modify the polygons if required, and make sure they are ready to be hosting the new textures.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn all about the different processes, methods, tips and tricks of Unwrapping, and achieve complete mastery of how to work with UVW maps. So, this course is an excellent option for 3d artists who looking to take their skills to the next level and elevate their scenes with better texture and materials, which ultimately requires unwrapping skills. If you are working in the Gaming industry or as an architect, this course can be a game changer for you.",

Are you trying to implement it in your own projects but you’ve found that you can’t quite wrap your head around the basics? Does the term ‘forward kinematic’ fill you with dread? Let’s iron out those head-aches and turn this IK know-how from a fiddly mystery to a well refined rig.\nI can safely assure you that Inverse Kinematics are not difficult to understand or grasp. They can look and feel daunting because by design one bone is intended to control a chain. If it hasn't been set up correctly, it won't work properly. I'll show you how to mitigate these issues and let Blender (and other 3D applications) work with you!\nInverse Kinematics are best utilised in situations that have multiple, connected joints to one common ‘main’ joint. Common uses for IK rigs include limbs on both humans and animals, machinery parts and robotics.\nThis course will go through the basics of inverse kinematics including what exactly forward kinematics means. We’ll have a look at individual bone settings and what they do in terms of an IK chain before implementing IK into project based lectures at the end; notably an excavator and a robot!\nAre you ready? Enrol today, and cement your understanding of this otherwise elusive topic...",

Don't you wanna create a simulation like the one in the promo video?\nIn this course, we will create this simulation and this render!\nNow, take a journey through the world of FLIP simulations from zero to hero, we will start with the very basics explaining every parameter. For each parameter we will compare four simulations with four different values to be able to spot the function of the parameter, how it changes the simulation and how to use it to get the look what we want . After we finish the Helicopter crash in the water, we will use advanced techniques to simulate the explosive wave then mixing it with the crash to get this gorgeous result. After you finish this course, you will be able to do your own complex big scale simulation, simulate and control whitewater, and render a marvelous amazing scene that looks very realistic to enhance your showreel!\n\nBIG NOTE: In this course, Houdini 18 is used, but pretty everything in this course can be applied exactly in the same way in Houdini 20!\n\n\nBy the end of this course you will be able to :\n- Deal with any kind of flip simulations\n- Do your complex high-end big scale sim with secondary whitewater.\n- You will learn about every important parameter in the FLIP solver and whitewater solver and see many tests with different values to recognize how each parameter changes the look of the sim.\n- You will learn high quality meshing technique to achieve the best look of your sim.\n\n-You will get used to Houdini ocean tools then mix them with your crash effect to make the simulation happen in an infinite ocean.\n- You will learn how to render a perfect looking scene in multiple layers (render passes).\n- You will learn how to do compositing of your scene, ex...how to merge the render layers and use them to enhance the final outcome of your scene using Nuke.\n\n\nTotal duration: 6:43 Hours\n\n\n\nPar 1: Introduction to FLIP Solver\nIn this chapter we are gonna use the shelf tools for doing simple flip fluid sims of a sphere falling in the water discussing how the pipeline of the fluid sims work in the DOP network and some of the basic parameters in the solver.\nPart 2: Simulation On The Run\nIn this chapter where we will import our animation in Houdini, create our flip tank of the simulation and get everything ready for the sim , then we are going to do a lot of tests on different parameters to reach the result we want.\nWe are going to tweak our collision and simulation by controlling the powerful parameters of the solver .\n\n\nPart 3: Whitewater Simulation\nIt’s time to do a cool whitewater sim to enhance the look of our simulation and to add the beautiful foamy looking to our render.\nThis will involve a lot of tests of different parameters digging very deep into the different parameters that will help us modify our whitewater simulation.\n\n\nPart 4: Different Meshing Methods\nIn this chapter we are going to use a very advanced way to mesh our sim trying our best to conserve the small details.\n\n\nPart 5: Houdini ocean tools\nIn this section, we will master Houdini ocean tools and integrate it with our simulation to get a cool final result.\nPart 6: Rendering and final compositing\nWe are going to render the scene for compositing. This chapter will cover the principles of rendering fluid scenes and the management of our render passes to get the full benefit of them. We will begin by adding lights and making shaders, then finally, we are going to render different passes and composite them in Nuke.",

You’ll learn techniques like Modular Modeling, optimization techniques for Mobile/VR, trim sheet workflows, level art & composition in UE, rock sculpting in Zbrush, Modeling in Blender and so much more!\n\nBLENDER, SUBSTANCE, AND UNREAL ENGINE 4\nAll the modeling will be done in Blender3d & Zbrush, However, the techniques used are universal and can be replicated in any other 3d modeling package. The materials and textures are created using substance painter and a little bit of substance designer. Level art, lighting and composition will be done in Unreal Engine 4.\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to know to create the final results that you see in the images and trailers. Next to this, the same techniques can be applied to almost any type of environment. The key focus of this course is to create the environment in a very optimized way in order to make it run smoothly for mobile and VR.\n\n10 HOURS!\nThis course contains over 10 hours of content – You can follow along with every single step – This course does not contain any time lapses.\n\nThe course will start of with going over how to create a Blockout directly in Unreal so that we know the dimensions and composition of our scene.\nThen we will move on to our asset pipeline, where we will show how to create high and low poly models, bake them and do the texture creation.\nOnce this is done we will move on to the trim sheet creation. we will go over on how to create quick and efficient trims sheets that we can use in our level to enhance the quality with just a single texture.\n\nThen it is time to go back to Unreal Engine and start with the environment, lighting and, decoration setup.\nWe will spend a bit more time after that on the background assets and look and then finish off with the general polish of our scene.\n\nSKILL LEVEL - BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE\nThis game art tutorial is perfect for students who have some familiarity with a 3d Modeling tool like Blender, Substance Designer/Painter, and Unreal Engine – Everything in this tutorial will be explained in detail. However, if you have never touched any modeling or texturing tools before we recommend that you first watch an introduction tutorial of those programs (you can find many of these for free on YouTube or paid on this very website)\n\nTOOLS USED\nBlender3D\nSubstance 3D Designer and Substance 3D Painter\nUnreal Engine 4\nZbrush\nYOUR INSTRUCTOR\nNico Cluckers is an experienced 3D generalist with a history as Modeling Supervisor during the production of mobile and VR games, such as Buck and Hubris. He is currently active as a lecturer and freelancer.",

Whether you're a beginner or looking to improve your skills, this course guides you through the entire process, from modeling to rendering, in an easy-to-follow structure.\n\n\nWe begin with a focus on tools and essential skills. You’ll learn about Blender for modeling, Substance Painter for texturing, and Mixamo for rigging, ensuring you have a solid foundation to start building your character. Then, we’ll dive into creating a base blockout for your character, establishing form and proportions that will serve as the foundation for adding more details.\n\n\nNext, you’ll learn how to design costumes and props that complement your character, giving them depth and personality. As you move into high-resolution detailing, we’ll focus on refining anatomy and adding intricate features, resulting in a polished, professional-quality model. Hair creation follows, where you'll build the base shapes and then finalize the details, ensuring your character’s hair looks dynamic and realistic. You’ll also master UV mapping, allowing you to efficiently prepare your model for texturing without distortions.\n\n\nOnce the UV map is complete, you’ll export your character to Substance Painter for texturing. Here, you’ll apply colors, materials, and intricate details to bring your character to life. After refining textures with hand painting, you’ll import them back into Blender to set up shaders and run test renders, ensuring the materials look perfect in the final scene. To complete the course, you’ll rig your character in Mixamo, apply dynamic poses, and finalize it with a polished render in Blender. By the end, you’ll have a fully rigged, high-quality character ready for animation, games, or your portfolio.\n\n\nThis course will equip you with the knowledge and practical skills to create professional 3D characters, empowering you to take your modeling to the next level.",

      "description": "Hello my names Eddie and I would like to welcome you to my Blender course in which we will learn to 3D model this amazing classic 1947 series 1 Landrover. On this course we will start at a slow pace getting to know our way around Blender with a few lectures simply learning the basic functions and how to navigate in Blender and the basics of 3d modeling . I do believe that the best way to learn is by doing so we will soon dive into modeling in Blender, starting by positioning and scaling reference images Followed by 3D modeling our chassis. As we build our car we will pick up essential skills such as subdivision surface  modeling and using sculpture mode.\nWhen we have finished modeling our Landrover we will learn to UV map our surfaces and then export into Substance Painter where we will learn to create amazing super realistic 3D texturing. This is a 77 year old 4x4 on a muddy track so I don't want it to look brand new so I will show you how to use masks in substance painter to create that well used and well loved look.\nWhen we have finished in Substance Painter we will export back Into Blender where will create our muddy track using procedural textures. I will introduce you to a Addon within Blender called Blenderkit which will give you access to thousands off free assets and 3D textures which you can import into your scene  with simply a click of a mouse. Together we will create our super realistic environment learning how to populate our scene using grasses, trees and rocks using blenders own particle physics tool . when we are all done and you have finished Landrover and 3D environment I will show you how to light your scene and position your camera to make great 3D renderings and finish off by make our awesome looking 3D animations\nfinally I will show you how to use Blenders own video editing tools to edit your animation and add music.\nAt the end of this course you will have all the  skills you need to go ahead and create your own amazing looking  projects in blender and at the same time make amazing 3D textures using Substance painter to take your 3D Models to the next level.\nThanks for reading this and I will hopefully see you in lecture 1.",

      "description": "Create viral short-form 3D videos in Blender fast — from scratch and without complex setups.\n\n\nThis works even if you’re brand-new to 3D, not “technical,” or you’ve tried a Blender course before and felt overwhelmed.\n\n\nOpen Blender and it hits you: endless panels, hidden menus, a thousand buttons you “should” learn before you make anything.\nYou try a tutorial, then another… and somehow you still don’t have a finished video.\nMeanwhile, your ideas pile up in Notes while your feed fills with creators posting cinematic 3D shorts that you could have made.\n\n\nThe truth? Most tutorials teach Blender like a spaceship manual. You don’t need a manual — you need a creator-first pipeline that takes you from idea → build → animate → render → edit → publish without detours.\n\n\nMeet the course built for modern creators.\n\nProof it works: I learned Blender in under 7 days, and my first Blender YouTube Shorts upload hit 26,563 views in 24 hours. It was built using the exact workflow you’ll follow — Human Generator, Mixamo, BlenderKit & Sketchfab. Results will vary.\n\n\nBy the end of this online Blender course, you’ll have full clarity and control over a simple, repeatable workflow to produce viral short-form 3D — and your first finished, portfolio-ready post.\n\n\nSpecifically, you will learn…\n\n\nBLENDER 4.5 WITHOUT OVERWHELM — The essential navigation, creator-focused shortcuts, and a printable menu & shortcut cheat sheet (Lectures 4-6)\n\n\nFOLLOW A COMPLETE IDEA→POST WORKFLOW — Brainstorm in ChatGPT, build, animate, render, edit, caption & publish a finished short (Lectures 16-21)\n\n\nCREATE CHARACTERS IN MINUTES — Human Generator Ultimate for instant humans (style, clothing, hair), prepped for animation (Lecture 7, 8, 19)\n\n\nANIMATE IN MINUTES WITH MIXAMO — Apply curated motion clips, then refine timing with minimal keyframing (Lecture 8, 19)\n\n\nBUILD CINEMATIC SCENES QUICKLY — BlenderKit & Sketchfab sourcing, licensing, and assembling for striking environments (Lectures 9, 10, 18)\n\n\nMAKE SHOTS POP ON MOBILE — Camera rigs and lighting tricks that read beautifully on phones (Lectures 11, 12)\n\n\nEXPORT THAT LOOKS GREAT ON PHONE — Clear Eevee vs Cycles choices (speed vs quality) and export settings for TikTok/IG/Shorts (Lecture 13)\n\n\nEDIT & CAPTION FOR VIRAL IMPACT — Clean music/SFX/dialogue mix and styled captions in Adobe Premiere Pro (Lecture 14)\n\n\nAUTOMATE TITLES & HOOKS WITH A CUSTOM GPT — Set up a prompt-driven assistant that delivers niche-specific hooks, story beats & captions in seconds (Lecture 16-17)\n\n\nFINISH WITH CONFIDENCE — A polished, portfolio-ready short (Lectures 22)\n\nACCESS A CUSTOM CHATGPT FOR VIRAL IDEAS — Generates hooks, titles, scripts & guides using proven virality + storytelling frameworks (Lecture 17)\n\n\nWhy trust this Blender course?\nIt’s updated for Blender 4.5 and built from the ground up for creators, editors, designers, and marketers who want results — not theory. You’ll learn 3D modeling in Blender the smart way, 3D animation in Blender with practical shortcuts, and a workflow using Human Generator, Mixamo, BlenderKit & Sketchfab so you go from idea to finished short fast — without complex setups.\n\n\nWhat makes me (Vlad) credible to teach this topic?\n\n\nWith over 10 years of experience editing videos for YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok—and managing two of the biggest channels in their niches—I know what it takes to create content that performs. I’ve spent years fine-tuning a creative system that works across platforms and formats, including Shorts video editing, TikTok video editing, and video editing for Reels. The strategies and tools I’m about to share aren’t theory—they’re exactly what I’ve used to help creators go viral, build audiences, and grow real results.\n\n\nDon't believe me? Just read some of the raving student reviews for yourself:\n\"I really enjoyed the Master Viral 3D Short Form Content in Blender course! Right from the start, it provides useful materials, like a cheat sheet for Blender 4.5 menus and shortcuts, as well as guidance on installing essential add-ons such as BlenderKit and Sketchfab. This makes the workflow much faster from the beginning. I especially liked the dedicated lessons on creating characters with Human Generator, animating them in Mixamo, and quickly building environments using BlenderKit and Sketchfab. Everything is explained clearly, and even during the course, you can already create complete videos ready to share on social media\" - Udemy User\n\n\"He is a good teacher, he explains in a very understandable and CALM way\" - Opasina Abiodun\n\n\"Very nice and made me feel that making shorts in Blender can be easy.\" - Ambika A\n\n\n100% Money-Back Guarantee: If this course doesn’t completely surpass your expectations, Udemy will refund you within 30 days of enrolling.\n\n\nYou have ideas worth publishing.\n\n\nEnroll now and turn them into viral 3D shorts in Blender — fast, from scratch, and without complex setups.",

      "description": "In this course we will learn how to break down a piece of reference to a more manageable state we can work from. Once we understand what is required of us to complete the piece we will start creating the base of a ceiling rose followed by the outer trim sections of the ceiling rose.\nWhen creating the trim sections I will show you how to create both simple and complex modular tiling shapes which will add an extra level of detail and intricacy to the ceiling rose with very little effort. In module 2 we will be looking at the more detailed shapes. Using our broken down reference I will show you how to create each piece used to create the ceiling rose. We will start with the simpler shapes just using 3ds Max box modeling and deformation techniques and then move onto more complex shapes later on. Once we have our shapes completed we will add final adjustments and polish to each piece in ZBrush to give it the hand crafted plaster look we are aiming for.\nFinally, in module 3, we will take the parts we have made and kit bash them together to create the large shapes shown in the reference. After all shapes are complete we can start deforming them to fit the base ceiling rose we created in module one which will leave us with the completed model.\nFinally, we'll take the model into ZBrush to create a final singular mesh version using masking and deformation techniques and add damage to the model using a custom brush set.\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nAsh Thundercliffe has been in the games industry for 3 years now. He started his career teaching at the University of Derby on the Computer games Modeling and Animation Course.

      "description": "I am a Mechanical Engineer, and I love this profession because I enjoy engineering. I love to crack engineering behind every action taking place in the world. Specifically, in mechanical engineering, I love the design part. This is one of the initial steps in producing anything. I was utterly dependent on my professors for jobs, skills, and education at my UG. Later I learned that they are here in college only for your education, not for your job. They can guide you but you have to learn skills yourself if you want to make your career. If you want to be a design engineer and get a good job, you can't depend on professors because these advanced skills don't come under the college curriculum. It is not their responsibility to teach you these softwares.\nEveryone thinks that mechanical engineers get significantly lower salaries compared to other engineers. If you also feel the same, then I must say your approach is incorrect. You must work with the latest technologies & software to keep up with every profession. If you solely depend on core mechanical studies, then I'm sorry, but you will earn significantly less than others. Foreign Mechanical Engineers earns a lot more than Indian engineer. Do you ever think of why? Because they know how to work with the latest technologies.\nMechanical engineering is very vast, and we are the ones who can keep it updated. You should start learning new skills in the mechanical field. I got inspired by designers worldwide working on massive projects through LinkedIn, and because of that, I also began learning software from my first year of UG. Now I am trying to pass on this teaching skill to my juniors, classmates, and everyone. I am a teacher but you can call me a friend. I think that if you are learning something from your friend then definitely you will not forget that but if any teacher is teaching you then there is a high chance that you will not focus properly and you'll definitely forget that skill. So, here I am, a college student from the National Institute of Technology, Calicut and I want you to watch this course assuming that your friend is teaching you.\nThis is a full legit course on CAD Software right from basics. In this course, I demonstrated all the features of CAD software. SolidWorks is the most user-friendly software available for Computer-Aided Design. I tried to make this course as comprehensive as possible so that you all can learn the basic features of SolidWorks in time and practice all the questions that are uploaded in this course.\n===================================================================\nAbout this course:\nwith this course, you are liable for:\n- Full, free lifetime access to all the lectures of this course.\n- Lectures that will be added to this course in the future will also be free with this purchase.\n- Unconditional Udemy 30 days money-back guarantee - I am sure you would love the course though :)\nSo, overall with the help of this course, you can learn new CAD skills and add them to your resume and aim for high-paying jobs in mechanical engineering. I tried and I got it so you can also get it. All the best. :)\n===================================================================\nWhy my course?\n- As I said already, learning from a friend will make to remember this skill for all time. I am sure you all faced this challenge while preparing for exams in college.\n- I am 24 X 7 available to clear your doubts. You can mail me if you have any doubt.\n- This is the challenge that I have created for myself to teach all my juniors and help them choose the right career.\n- This is a recorded lecture (No screenshots), you can learn with me. You can also design with me if you think that will help you.\n- Lectures are short and concentrated but cover all the features available in Solidworks.\n===================================================================\nInstructor support\nWhenever you have a subject matter question you can post it in the Q&A forum or you can mail me directly on my mail ID and I will answer your questions as soon as possible. So, with the course, you not only get video lessons but also quick and responsive support from your friend.\n===================================================================\nSo this is it. Click on the \"Take this course\" button and help me in this challenge. Mark my words, you have to learn advanced technologies to sustain yourself in this fast-moving world and to earn more than a conventional mechanical engineer. Enhance your skill not only through this course but by doing projects in advanced fields like Metal additive manufacturing, Topology optimization, and many more.\nI wish you all the best for your future and feedback is most welcomed.\nThanks,\nHarsh Mundra.",

      "description": "Welcome to one of the most fundamental tools for a motion graphics artist: animating type.\nNo experience is needed to take this course and by the end of it you will be able to create, manipulate, and animate rendered type.\nWe start with the basics of creating text in Autodesk Maya and use the built-in animation tools for type that is great for beginners.\nIf you're a more advanced user or a beginner that feels comfortable after the initial animation lesson, we dive deeper in to the most advanced method of animating type in Maya with a relatively new toolset called MASH, which is Maya's motion graphics toolset.\nThe only trouble is there's one big obstacle you have to overcome to use MASH with type and I will show you how to overcome it.\nI also give you a Python script I wrote that I show you how to run it in Maya with the push of a button to overcome this otherwise frustrating obstacle to using MASH with type.\nWe will finish the course by lighting and rendering our images out of Maya and do the final color correction and compiling into a movie file in Adobe After Effects.\nI'm really excited to share these techniques with, see you in the course!\nWhat will you learn?\nCreate and control text in 3D\nAnimate a simple text animation\nAnimate an advanced text animation\nUnderstand the obstacles facing text animation in Maya and overcome them\nLight and render your scene\nLearn by doing real world projects!\nThroughout this entire course, you'll be working on text animation with a phrase of your choosing, or follow along with my phrase \"Keep Creating!\"\nWhat do you get when you enroll?\n3+ hours of easy-to-follow tutorials\nDownloadable project files for every step of the course\nPython script that will save you hours of work\nPremium support to help you as you take the course\nWhy learn from me?\nLucas Ridley is a professional 3D animator who has worked on Hollywood films such as Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One. His students love him, and we're sure you're going to enjoy this class.\nLucas breaks down the most complicated steps of animating in Autodesk Maya, so that you can easily start animating on your own!\nMy 30-day 100% money-back guarantee!\nWe want you to be happy. If there's any reason you aren't enjoying the course, and getting what you expected, we'll refund your money.\nI can't wait to see you in the course!\nCheers,\nLucas",

      "description": "Welcome to my course \" Take Whiteboard Animation Videos to NEXT level using Doodly \"\nHey, everyone! I just wanted to share with you something I’m really excited about that’s going to help you take your doodle animation videos to the next level.\nIn the course. I will show you how to create super-professional videos, using all the advanced tips and tricks that would take most people months—and maybe even years--to uncover on their own. I’m actually kind of embarrassed to admit, but even I learned things you could do with Doodly that I had no idea you could do.\nThese Tips Are Going to Help You Create Videos That Are\nMore Professional, More Visually Stimulating, and Far More Engaging to Your Prospects…\nMeaning, they’ll be shared more often, watched longer, and ultimately, they’re going to get you much better results.\nSo, let me tell you what you can expect from the course, this course teaching you the most advanced training methods you can use for creating absolutely incredible videos.\nAnother reason you’re going to love this course is that we devised all kinds of time-saving ways to do things using Doodly. With the course, you’re basically being given the opportunity to peek over her shoulder, so you can watch an expert doodler show you the best workarounds for stuff that very few people know about.\nSo let me tell you what you’ll get:- It consists of 25videos Divided into7modules that get progressively more advanced as you move forward in the course.\nModule 1 - Solid Foundation\nThe first module is an intro to get everyone up to speed and on the same page. After that, you’ll begin the asset management module. This module creates a solid foundation for what’s to come later. It’s where you’ll learn everything you need to know about managing assets and creating complex scenes--for example, by timing characters and props to appear in a video at just the right moment, so they correspond with your voiceover.\nModule 2 - Elements Module\nOnce you’ve finished that, you’re ready to move on to the backgrounds, sidebars, borders, and frames module. These elements are crucial for making your videos pop.\nSo in this module, you’ll learn how to make a background or logo appear in every scene. You’ll also learn fading techniques you can use to lighten or darken a background sky, for example. Plus, you’ll discover how to create borders, frames, and sidebars to make your videos way more visually appealing.\nModule 3 - Asset Sourcing\nThe next module is asset sourcing, where you’ll learn how to source and create your own graphics—even if you can’t draw a stick figure. We will teach you several ways—both free and paid—for finding characters, props, and even chalkboard images you can add to the Doodly assets you already have.\nModule 4 - Powerpoint/ Keynote Assets\nPlus, you’ll learn our super-simple method for creating literally hundreds of new Doodly assets using Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple's Keynote. You’ll even learn how you can create an asset from a hand-drawn image you scribbled on a piece of your own paper!\nModule 5 - Advanced Drawing Paths\nIn the 5th module, We teach you some really fun stuff you’ll want to use all the time in your Doodly videos. You’ll learn how you can control the way a drawing comes to life with advanced drawing paths.\nYou’ll also discover how to add color to your assets, how to crop characters, and how to work with layered drawings. Plus, we will show you how to add depth to scenes by adding drop shadows to text and images.\nModule 6 - Whiteboard Animation Module\nThen, it’s on to the animation module. Here’s where you’ll learn how you can make assets fade in and out, how to create rolling credits, and how to make objects grow, shrink, shatter, fly, or reveal themselves slowly, one piece at a time.\nModule 7 - Final Module\nFinally, you’ll be ready for the last module of the course. Here’s where you’ll learn how to create a square and vertical videos you can use on social media. You’re also going to learn how you can display a regular video within a Doodly video—and vice versa.\nPlus,\nwe will show you advanced tactics for working with audio. For example, you’ll discover how to prevent music from drowning out your voiceover, how you can add sound effects to your video, and how to shorten a music file so it fits your video--without sounding like it cuts off abruptly.\nSo that’s a brief overview of some of what’s in the Masterclass. It actually covers much more than that. And in case you’re wondering, we rely on Doodly for most of the stuff we teach in the course. When we have to use other software to create an effect, we use free software whenever possible.\nBottom line, this course is going to be really valuable to you. Not only is it going to help you create Doodly videos that are even better than the ones you’re creating now, but it’ll also save you an absolute ton of time.\nThink about it. You won’t have to bang your head against the wall, spending hours and hours trying to figure this stuff out—for a lot of people, that alone is going to make the course well worth your time.\nOK, so you’ve heard me say the course is great, but I’m sure you’re wondering what other people think about it.\nYou’ll be happy to hear that the course has gotten rave reviews from Doodly users just like you.\nA few of them were so excited about the opportunity to learn directly from us that they asked me if they could buy the course before I’d even made the course publicly accessible. I let them and so far, the feedback’s been amazing.\nBut the videos aren’t even the only thing you’re going to get with the course. The course also comes with a special bonus—15 additional files we created that you can use alongside Doodly to save you time. These files are the same ones we use throughout the course, and they’re designed to make it easier for you to work with scenes and assets.\nSo, when you replicate the things you’ve learned in the course, you won’t have to start from scratch. For example, when you’re designing scenes or altering characters, you’ll already have the tools we created, making it easier and faster for you to do advanced things with Doodly. Again, these are free bonuses that you’ll get when you access the Masterclass.\nSo why & for what you are waiting for this course Take Whiteboard Animation Videos to NEXT level using Doodly\nEnroll Now!!!!",

      "description": "Material Maker software\nMaterial Maker is a software that allows you to create realistic materials. It is a free tool that allows you to quickly create realistic textures with ergonomic features. The software is efficient with impressive possibilities to create PBR materials. It is possible to use many nodes to create textures. The library is very large, which allows you to create all types of PBR materials. These nodes, associated with each other, allow you to create a realistic material. Each node has a different function, they can be connected to each other to create a material. It is possible to create different textures quickly and efficiently with the software. Material Maker allows you to work with a 3D view, a 2D view, and a library of nodes to create textures. It is possible to change models and environments. There is also a mode to work with texture painting, and apply textures or colors directly with the brush on a 3D model that you have created.\n\n\nPBR material\nPBR material is a technique used to represent materials in 3D and how they appear in the real world with lighting effects. It aims to achieve realism by simulating physical properties. To obtain a realistic material, different information is needed that must be added together to create a realistic rendering. You can find a color map, a normal map, a height map, a roughness map, a metallic map, an ambient occlusion map or an emission map. You can use these materials in different 3D modeling software to apply them to models.\n\n\nWhy to use Material Maker\n- Ergonomic software\n- 3D view\n- 2D view\n- Large library of nodes\n- Different environments\n- Different models\n- Many maps available\n- Fast export\n\n\nTraining course\nIn this training you will learn Material Maker software from scratch. With a step by step course structure, you will learn how to create PBR textures using the software. Starting with the dashboard, environment management, use of nodes, links between nodes, rendering on models. You will learn how to create links between the different nodes to optimize materials. At the end of the training course, different trainings on PBR texture creations will allow you to apply the different features seen in the training course. At the end of the training, you will be able to create realistic materials for modeling software.",

      "description": "In the Scifi Ship Series, we'll sart by creating simple shapes via edge extrusion in Maya, as it's one of the easiest methods to create viable meshes. When creating meshes in Maya, the fewer tools you use, generally, is the better your end result because you end up focusing on the best aspects of the tools to create what you need. Edge loops for better subdivisions are paramount when working with models that are going to be more than just 'game ready' (low poly) and will help create cleaner beveling when the mesh smoothes as opposed to subdividing without edge loops. Once the mesh has been imported into ZBrush, proper usage of polygroups will assist in mirrored details and overall cleanliness. IMM (InsertMultiMesh) Brushes are vital to helping to add the 'greebles' and accessories to hard surfaces to add interest. LiveBoolean is a new tool that's paramount in creating inset cuts and booleaned shapes within the ZBrush subtools to add more futuristic details to parts of the sci-fi spaceship. When combining tools in ZBrush, like IMM brushes with LiveBooleans, the speed at which the model is populated with details is greatly decreased, which helps with tight deadlines in production. Add in using Slice Curves to add polygroups to a mesh with Curve Functions to create frame meshes that follow the seam of the polygroups precisely, and the end results are a model that looks thoroughly populated yet futuristically refined.\n\n\nMore about the Instructor:\nHaving 25 years of experience in the video game development/entertainment arenas, Stephen G. Wells is well versed in a variety of programs and production pipelines and strives to work as cleanly and efficiently as possible. Having done pretty much everything, he enjoys getting to share his knowledge and experience in the hopes that he can help students gain a better understanding and appreciation of what 3D computer art (in all its varying forms) has to offer.",

After a quick intro to the physical anatomy, you will learn how to use DynaMesh to create a base for the hand, and will learn how to use ZRemesher to create a usable topology.  From there, we'll jump into creating hands in a T-pose to use in the animation, before proceeding into modifying the pose to something a bit more aesthetic. Next, you'll be going in depth into the hand study, understanding what are the little tweaks that make a good hand sculpture; you'll also be given an understanding about hand expression, and how they can transmit emotion. Within ZBrush you'll learn how to use a correct workflow to sculpt useful models, not only a simple sketch. As we wrap things up, you'll be learning how to create a composite with ZBrush Render, Keyshot and Photoshop, to present the sculpt in social medias. This is a great start to understand the anatomy of the human body, so get your grip, and hold on tight for some good learning!\nMore about the Instructor:\nDaniel da Costa was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. He had his first contact with the software 3D Canvas at the age of 14. At 16 years old he moved to Joinville, Santa Catarina, and at the age of 18 started his journey into the world of 3D professionally.

SideFX adapted Houdini from the PRISMS suite of procedural generation software tools. Its exclusive attention to procedural generation distinguishes it from other 3D computer graphics software.\nHoudini is particularly suitable for visual effects artists with a technical background. It provides all the tools in 3D software but is better known for the VFX tools.\nBeginners using Houdini should have a learning curve of procedural design across the software’s features. The key to success with Houdini is his extensive knowledge of mathematics and algorithms. Therefore, technical Artists with a background in programming and mathematics will be able to learn Houdini more easily than others.\nArtists who successfully learn this software will find that Houdini allows to create many effects without any traditional artistic interaction. Teams will love working with Houdini as all parts of the project can be easily modified at any point in the development process.\nHoudini is a 3D animation software application developed by SideFX.

      "description": "Full Environment Creation in UE5 & Blender - In-Depth Course\nLearn how a professional environment artist works when creating environments for games. You’ll learn techniques like Modular Modeling, Procedural Texturing, Unique Texturing, Level Art & Composition, shader Creation, Lighting, Character Animations and so much more.\nBLENDER, SUBSTANCE, AND UNREAL ENGINE 5\nAll the modeling will be done in Blender3d, However, the techniques used are universal and can be replicated in any other 3d modeling package. The materials will be created using Substance Designer and previewed in marmoset toolbag 4. The environment will be built in the brand-new Unreal Engine 5 and the lighting will use the new Lumen system. We will also use the new modeling tools within Unreal. Next to this, we will also use Substance Painter to create unique textures and generate masks.\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to know to create the final results that you see in the images and trailers. Next to this, the same techniques can be applied to almost any type of environment.\n31+ HOURS!\nThis course contains over 31+ hours of content – You can follow along with every single step – The course does enclose a few small-time lapses, this is just to speed up very repetitive tasks, the rest is done in real-time.\nWe will start by going over our reference and then we dive right in and create a blockout of our level and set it up in UE5. Then we will first create all of our procedural materials and we will turn our blockout models into final models and also UV unwrap/texture them right away.\nOnce that is done we will export all the artwork to Unreal engine 5 and setup our level.\nWe will create advanced shaders to give us control over everything from vertex painting to dirt masks to parallax and next to this we will also create a basic landscape material.\nWe will be using the new modeling tools within UE5 to speed up our workflow and minimize the modular pieces we need to make.\nFinally we will do our scene lighting using the new Lumen system and we will do the color grading in Davinci Resolve.\nThen to bring our scene to life I will show you how you can quickly generate character animations using Mixamo and I will even show you how to manually animate a horse in blender.\nSKILL LEVEL\nThis game art tutorial is perfect for students who have some familiarity with a 3d Modeling tool like Blender, Substance Designer/Painter, and Unreal Engine – Everything in this tutorial will be explained in detail. However, if you have never touched any modeling or texturing tools before we recommend that you first watch an introduction tutorial of those programs (you can find many of these for free on YouTube or paid on this very website)\nTOOLS USED\nBlender3D\nSubstance 3D Designer and Substance 3D Painter\nUnreal Engine 5\nMarmoset Toolbag 4\nDavinci Resolve\nMixamo\nYOUR INSTRUCTOR\nEmiel Sleegers is a senior environment artist currently working in the AAA Game Industry. He’s worked on games like The Division 2 + DLC at Ubisoft, Forza Horizon 3 at Playground Games, and as a Freelancer on multiple projects as an Environment Artist and Material Artist.\nSOURCE FILES\nPlease note that this project does not come with any source files or extra content due to platform limitations.

      "description": "You want to learn how to make your own animations, and you want to do it now! That’s why you’re here, and I’m so excited to have you!\nI've been using Blender 3D for over a decade, and in that time I've learned that Blender is POWERFUL! The power of Blender comes from understanding the fundamentals , and I've spent years figuring out what parts of Blender are MOST ESSENTIAL for beginners to create their own content. I've taken years of learning and condensed it into a four hour course!\nIn this course, you will learn how to:\n-Use the creative process to plan your animation from start to finish\n-Create custom objects from scratch\n-Understand how to find non-copyrighted textures for your creations\n-Use textures to create stunning materials\n-Animate your scene\n-Give the \"final touch\" to your scene so it looks incredible\n-Add sounds and music to your animation\n-Export a finalized video that is ready to be posted online\nFrom start to finish, you'll have the tools you need to create and finalize your own animations! If you have any questions throughout the course feel free to message me! For now—\n\n\nLet’s get started! (Still deciding? There's a present for you at the bottom of the description!)\n\n\nThis course is so valuable! I had to spend years learning the very techniques I'll be showing you in this course because I didn't have someone to show them to me. I wish that I had had this course during my early days with Blender! I would have spent less time learning by trial and error and more time creating animations.\nNot only do you learn about creating the animation, you also will gain insight on how to start your project on the right foot by learning crucial steps to outlining your animation. You'll understand how to refine your idea for an animation and turn it into a video that is ready to be shared with your friends, family, subscribers and followers!\nThis course focuses on creating the highest quality content in the shortest amount of time. In my early days of animation, I found creating good textures to be particularly difficult, especially with Blender's complex system for creating materials—but after months of looking I finally had to just create my own \"recipe\" for outstanding textures, and you'll get to learn it WITHOUT wasting months looking!\nI also focus on creating a balance between quality and performance. Early on I didn't realize how quickly your computer can become overwhelmed while creating a scene to animate in. In fact, I had Blender crash a few times because even my high end rig copped out. But now I don't need a high end computer to create a great animation because a few of the tweaks I teach in this course!\nStill mulling it over? Well congratulations for making it to the bottom of the description, a place few people dare to venture! Unless you're like me and you skipped ahead. Either way, as a reward, I'd like to offer an insane discount! Why? Because I need your help and you need mine. I need you in my course so that I can learn how to make it better, and you need to learn quickly how to animate. In exchange for my discount, all I ask is two things: 1. Message me in Udemy and tell me how to make the course better and 2. Rate and review the course so that other potential students know what to expect.\nI can't wait to help you start creating your own amazing animations!",

The DataPool plugins can be used in your Vizrt scene designs in many various ways such as to incorporate real-time data or affect geometries and images within the design and much more.\nThis course will give you an introduction to the plugins and show you actual examples of how to use several of them. You'll learn what DataPool is, why you would want to use it.\nAfter watching the videos you will pick up the theory of the DataPool plugins and begin to incorporate more advanced functionality within your Vizrt scene designs.\nThe videos in this course will cover\nVizrt DataPool Introduction\nData Text Plugin\nViz Send Module\nData Position Plugin\nData Rotation Plugin\nData Scale Plugin\nCreating Bar Charts using Data Scale\nData Object Tracker\nPlugin Data Parameter\nPlugin Data Switch\nPlugin Data Selector\nPlugin Data Countdown Plugin\nMany of the DataPool plugins can be used together to further manipulate your scene designs. There are several example of combining the DataPool plugins to achieve a certain result. For example you'll learn how to use the Data Object Tracker and Data Parameter together to affect both a geometry object and a text layer.\nOnce you understand how the naming conventions work within DataPool you can begin to use more plugins to develop more complex scenes.\nWithin this training series you'll also learn about the Viz Send module, which is a free tool bundled with Vizrt that can help you test your DataPool scenes. The DataPool plugins are installed seperately from Vizrt Artist, so make sure you have the DataPool plugins installed on your Artist machine as well as your Engine machines. Each scene design begins with dragging the universal DataPool plugin into the scene settings. If you are unfamiliar with the scene settings and using DataPool, you will know what it is and how to use it after watching these videos. Though there are many ways to achieve your design objectives in Vizrt, the DataPool plugins, in some cases, may be easier to use than writing a script or using other plugins. They sometimes allow a streamlined way of accessing parameters and data within your scene designs.",

Therefore, there will be even more interesting cartoon characters, even more action and storytelling. And yes - it will be like elite wine - they will only get better over the years! The lecture of our new series of video tutorials on automatic animation in AE is already here. You will find them in the second section of our course. In this lectures I will tell you how to quickly and efficiently create animations using the capabilities provided by After Effects Expressions. Please write to me what questions you would like to consider in new lectures.\nI am pleased to present to you our second Udemy Course. And it will be a practical course in which we apply the knowledge obtained in our first theoretical course.\nIn first part of this course we will create animated music videos Using Adobe After Effects. I will show you in all details step-by-step the process of creating of funny cartoon man for animation. We will teach this man to move his arms and legs, blink, speak, and give him stylish clothes. In between I'll show you how you can use this character so that he tells about your website, your class on Skillshare or your channel on YouTube. And in the end we will give him some cool musical instrument and teach him to play this instrument.\nFor this work you will need the Adobe After Effects program of any available for you version. Or you can use our free educational version of After Effects. Creating these lessons, I was counting that you already have some familiarity with the basic principles of work in After Effects. But even if you do not have the slightest idea of how to work in After Effects - this is not such a big problem. In this case, you can simply learn our first class - Basic Animation in Adobe After Effects, and will get all the necessary knowledge for further work.\nIn the second part of our course we'll try “gaming technique” training – to transform study into an exciting game. It is simply amazing how many dedicated and talented people gathered at Udemy - I propose to use these talents to create our own Udemy Animation Studio. Let us all together make cartoons about what we're doing on Udemy and how wonderful it is - to live each day learning something new. Animation studio is good because everyone here can find application to his talent. If you are author and write stories, you can write scripts and dialogues for our cartoons. Artists can create characters for animation and scenery. Actors - to engage in voicing of characters, musicians - create musical accompaniment. And of course we’ll need animators, to breathe life into our characters.\nTo animate, in my opinion, may everybody. To teach everyone this absolutely necessary skill, we have created a series of exciting and easy to understand lessons on animation in the Adobe After Effects program, which will allow you to quickly and easily master the basic skills necessary to make animation, and begin to animate. We invite everybody to participate in the work of our animation studio - here everyone will find some occupation to his taste. Write to us at community section and offer your ideas, sign up for our courses, create your projects and let's make cartoons!\nAs practical project, I propose you make a little cartoon about the adventures of Winnie the Pooh and his friends. Or write the script of the cartoon, on which we later will make film. Or draw your own character for our movie, or some interesting scene or background. Or voice any character of our cartoon. You can use our models and footages, or make cartoon with your own characters. It is desirable that these cartoons reflect the main, as we see it, idea of our training: Learning is fun.",

That's why we will see how to get the most out of every attribute used.\n\n\nWhat I will learn?\nWe will start with the base color and a custom function allowing saturation, brightness, contrast and tint control.\nTo get the best cut from each model, we will see how to use the opacity mask, also known as \"Alpha\".\nBecause it's the one that brings out all the details, we will add the normal map and a parameter to control its intensity.\nAs important as the normal one, the Specular is the one that will bounce the light on your models. We will see how to combine it with fresnel to concentrate the bounce in the light direction.\nIt also controls roughness, which determines whether your model is dry or very wet.\nFor dark environments, a parameter to control the emissive is always useful.\nBeyond all the other attributes, subsurface is what will make your vegetation more realistic by allowing light to pass through your models. We will see how to implement it, with the ability to control its color and intensity independently.\nOnce the foliage options are in place, we will see how to add the required trunk features, which will automatically deactivate unnecessary options on this model type, such as subsurface.\nFor Speedtree only, we will see how to get the best out of billboards by implementing a custom function that can be activated with a simple checkbox.\nBecause not everyone uses Speedtree, we will see how to create an advanced wind for non-Speedtree assets. Of course, Speedtree wind will also be implemented, but only for .st format.\nAnd finally, because it's an option that can change everything, we will see how to make the perfect transition between the terrain and the foliage thanks to Runtime Virtual Texture and a Blending function.\n\n\nImportant note :\nThis course was created in version 5.2 and it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use THE SAME version!

They'll next learn to create, duplicate within a subtool, and modify their meshes to create several versions of individual items to create interest. They'll create separate component subtools in multiple files for later importing into the final scene. The transpose action line is an invaluable tool to help modify geometry quickly and easily to adjust to the required shapes. Also indisposable is the deformation palette with many key functions that assist in helping to quickly and efficiently create meshes in Zbrush. Creating multiple copies of subtool meshes within those same subtools is paramount in interacting multiple instances of geometry that will quickly 'fill out' spaces needing substance. Boolean operations will also play a deciding factor in taking simple geometry and 'hollowing out' more detailed areas for better atmosphere. Adding text, while using the text as actual booleans, will be important in adding script to the tombstones etc to help make a believable graveyard scene.",

By the end of this mega course, you will successfully be able to do film compositing and stand as an experienced Nuke Artist.\n\n\nThroughout this week I will equip you with everything you need to know effectively removing green or blue screen from the background of challenging shots. In big-budget productions, the green screen setup isn’t always perfect, and actors may not always stay within the designated green screen area. By the end of this week, you will have a strong grasp of how to handle even the toughest green or blue screen scenario. I will cover, creating a template for the green or blue screen removal process, getting familiar with keying tools in nuke, creating clean and precise matte, primary and secondary color spill removal process, hair detail preservation, automating luminance match of BG to FG, and removing tracking markers.\n\n\nThere will be a lot of theory you need to learn first before you can successfully composite a shot, and with anything worth learning there is a learning curve. But if you persist through you will have a great payoff and skillset at the end, and a great shot to show off that you created!\n\n\nNote: You will be required to download the project files if you want to follow along with this class. this course has been created with NukeX 13.2v5",

      "description": "After many requests, we have created a step-by-step walkthrough course designed to teach the process of creating Modular 3D-printed Miniatures.\nThis course is divided into four stages:\nThe first section will teach you how to take an existing model and assess the best places to cut the model for keying. Josh then walks you through separating a solid (dynameshed) model to convert it into a modular one.\nThe second section will teach you how to clean up a separated model and best prepare it for keying. Josh also walks you through this process, pointing out all the pitfalls you may run into and how to avoid them to ensure the best outcome possible.\nThe third section covers keying itself. In this section, you will learn the best practices to create keys that work for 3D-printed miniatures and how to exaggerate features to plan for a margin of error.\nIn the final section, Josh walks you through copying and altering existing keyed pieces (created during the third section) to create multiple alternate modular pieces that can be used with your new modular model.\n\n\nThis course assumes that you have taken one of our previous courses and/or are already familiar with the basics of zbrush. Unlike our beginner courses, we do not take the time to explain how to install and navigate zbrush, explain commonly used brushes, etc. We also assume you know how to get a model from zbrush to a 3D printer. (this process is also covered in all of our previous courses)\nWe will provide the model that is used in the course. However, using a model of your own making is also recommended.\nUnlike our previous courses, which focused on the students copying what Josh does during the video lessons, this course aims to teach the theory and practical application of creating keys and modular models. The goal of this course is to prepare you to apply our workflow in any of your own models while avoiding the pitfalls that we fell into as we discovered this process through trial and error.\nBecause of this, I strongly recommend watching each lesson without following along to absorb the concepts fully. Then, after you feel you understand the ideas being taught, go back and apply them to either your own models or the model we provide.\nBy the end of this course, you should have the knowledge and skill to create your own modular 3D printable miniatures with modular connections (keys) of professional quality. (this is the same workflow we use on the modular minis we sell.)",

This creative process will help student to unleash their creativity and  take their animation projects to the next level.\n\n\nThis tutorial will help you to create your own animations with Shape Layer. The Best part about Shape Layers is that they wont pixelate and can be rendered in any sizes. The other tool like Pen tool, Trim Path, Key Editor, Smart colors etc will also help in creating other new exciting animations.",

With more than 15 hours of content We will go over creating 4 different props completely from start to finish.\n\n\nWhat you will get:\n· 4 Complete Courses!\n· 53 FHD videos with over 15+ hours of content\n· All the resources files required to complete the course including the Models, Substance Painter Files, Textures, Alphas\n\n\nWe will go over the complete pipeline of creating a high-quality realistic prop, starting with modelling the prop in blender, texturing in Substance Painter and finally lighting and rendering a portfolio piece in blender.\n\n\nThis bundle has 4 different courses that are creating a Gramophone, creating Nintendo GameBoy, creating a Vintage Hall-Clock and creating a Guitar. This bundle will help you improve your 3D prop modelling and texturing skills massively as we go through each step together and learn many different techniques.\n\n\nAfter finishing the courses, you would easily be able to create the renders shown in the trailer and also create high quality props of your own.\n\n\nWe will start with modelling the prop in Blender, and we will learn different modelling techniques and learn a lot about different modifiers. After finishing the modelling, we will apply all the modifiers and UV unwrap our model for export.\nNext, we'll export our model to Substance Painter and begin the texturing process. You'll learn how to create realistic textures using various features in Substance, such as Smart Masks, Smart Materials, Generators etc. Across the different courses, you'll explore how to create a variety of materials like plastic, iron, wood, and glass, enhancing your texturing skills to help you achieve realistic textures for your props.\nOnce we are done texturing in Substance Painter, we’ll bring the model back into Blender for rendering. You'll learn how to set up materials, adjust lighting and camera for the perfect shot. We'll also cover how to use HDRIs for realistic scene lighting. At the end of each course, we’ll take portfolio-ready renders of each prop, showcasing your work in the best light.\nThis course is for everyone who has a basic understanding of Blender and Substance Painter and wants to upgrade their skills.",

As a lead artist, he had been responsible for creating a variety of assets both high poly and low poly for production using a wide range of software programs. His advice for students who want to make it in the industry is practice time management. He believes nothing is worse than missing a deadline/milestone as the project could literally get cancelled and you become unemployed. He believes in thinking of what you can do realistically, yet creatively, and do so in the amount of time given and give it 110%.\nCourse Info\nIn this course, you will learn how to build a professional futuristic vehicle. You will start out by 3d modeling in Maya using image planes references so that the vehicle will look good in all views. You will create the tires using instances of the threads which will allow you to work on one thread while affecting the other threads at the same time. You will construct the cockpit and the main hull area of the car using Maya's polygon editing tools, effectively applying loops where they are needed for a clean subdivision surface. You will then move on to building the under structure that will support the actual vehicle. You will build the axle, the wings, and add extra parts to the car to enhance the 3d model as a whole. Last, you will take the high res mesh inside Keyshot to add materials and create a nice rendered art piece for your portfolio.",

      "description": "Hello, welcome to this course,\nIn this course you will learn how to create amazing volumetric effects in Blender with the cycles render engine. Volumetric effects are a bit overlooked in blender since it is mostly used for smoke, fire, clouds, and mist effects. However there is a lot more you can do with this shader by combining procedural textures in blender. We are not going to make use of any texture maps whatsoever. Our effects in this course will be completely procedural.\nYou will also discover that the skills and techniques learned in this course will be a great help in creating beautiful volumetric effects which you can use in a wide variety of projects, such as science fiction, fantasy and abstract artworks and animations.\nThis course includes over 7 hours of video showing every step of the creation process for the Blender logo animation and the energy dimension animation that you see in the beginning of the intro lecture. So whether you’re interested in following the course all the way through or using this as a production guide for your own projects, this course is packed with information and a bunch of tips to create awesome volumetric sphere effects in blender cycles.\nSo i hope i have gotten you excited for this course and i can't wait to see what my fellow blender artists will create with the skills learned in this course.",

Please be understanding of my English pronunciation, which is far from perfect (as I found out, speaking English while doing something complex in 3D is quite challenging). Still, I believe it's better than having a course with no voice at all.\n\n\nThis course is designed for those who are already fairly proficient in Blender and Substance Painter and want to refine their skills, learn new modeling and texturing techniques, and understand the overall workflow. I tried to combine quick execution of simpler tasks with more detailed explanations of the more complex processes.\n\n\nTo start, we'll create a basic mesh and improve its shape using boolean operations and other tools. After that, we'll move on to model optimization and creating a high-poly model in ZBrush. You'll see the method I use for creating UV unwrapping for complex models.\n\n\nBefore texturing, I’ll show you an advanced baking technique in Marmoset, which will help you create a perfectly clean model with no seams or other imperfections.\n\n\nFinally, texturing—my favorite process—where I'll create realistic materials using anchor points and other tools.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy my course, and I’ll be happy to receive your feedback.\n\n\nEnjoy watching!",

It took my many years of  working on AAA projects to understand how to make a high quality asset  (Hint: it is not the tool).\nArtists use a secret language to  communicate their ideas and how to make anything look great, it doesn't  matter if you are working on Unreal Engine or painting on a piece of  paper.\nThis course is about that, to teach in a few hours what  took my years to understand. We will create a high quality asset using  multiple Unreal Engine 5's tools: modeling, texturing, materials,  physics simulation and texture manipulation. By using this tools, I will  teach you all the art principles that you can apply to create any type  of asset.\nWe will also go through new tools available on Unreal Engine 5.6 like UV Editor tools and Nanite Displacement from materials.\nBy  the end of this course you will be able to create high quality assets  for your game projects or if you are looking to join the AAA industry  use it as a portfolio piece to show it to a potential employer.",

The course starts with an explanation of how materials work in ZBrush, then explores the types of materials in three main sections: Standard Materials, Matcap Materials, and Redshift materials. The course also explains how the Material Mixer works and how you can use it to layer 2- 4 materials on top of each other and combine them in creative ways. The course emphasizes learning how the settings work and includes a breakdown of example materials. The example model is included in the class files so that you can follow along with each chapter. The skills you learn in this course will help you build better portfolio pieces that can highlight your sculpting skills and ZBrush knowledge.",

Through this analysis, you’ll gain a deep understanding of the creative decisions behind successful brand animations, learning how they use visual language, color schemes, and motion to create impact. Afterward, you will move on to crafting your own concept, developing a unique narrative that resonates with the brand’s voice, and refining your design choices to create a cohesive and compelling visual story.\n\n\nOnce the foundation is laid, you’ll dive into the design of visual elements, focusing on typography, iconography, and illustrations. With a strong focus on aesthetics and user experience, you’ll learn to balance composition and design to make your animations both beautiful and functional. Animating with professional techniques such as easing, timing, and fluid motion will become second nature as you perfect your craft, and advanced techniques like 3D motion and camera movements will add depth and complexity to your work.\n\n\nThe project encourages attention to detail, ensuring every movement feels natural and engaging, creating a seamless flow that enhances the overall viewer experience. You’ll also explore the use of sound design, understanding how audio enhances motion and reinforces the storytelling process.\n\n\nBy the end of this project, you’ll have a fully animated piece that showcases your ability to create sleek, professional motion graphics. This polished motion design will be perfect for your portfolio or future client work, demonstrating that you can not only create eye-catching visuals but also execute animations at a high level of quality and precision.

Whether you're an architect, student, or 3D artist, this course will empower you to understand how to use Blender for architectural design!\n\n\nOver the years working as an architect, and later as a project designer in distinguished firms in London, I have perfected utilising Blender for Architecture, ranging in scale from small pavilions, to buildings, and to whole masterplans. Why did I create this course? When I had a team to manage, I had to teach them Blender one on one, on the job, and I had to work overtime to then do my job! I thought, why not start creating courses with everything I've learned and share them with my co-workers, and perhaps also with other intersted students. Then I found out that I love teaching and now I am on a mission to show as many architects and designers the wonders that Blender can do for realising their designs.\n\n\nCourse Outline: Introduction to Blender for Architectural Design\nIn this introductory mini course, you'll learn how to use Blender for architectural design while designing a multi-storey residential building. Throughout the process, you'll gain insights into the following topics:\n● Creating architecture massings and mastering mesh geometry editing techniques.\n● Generating multi-floor buildings efficiently using modifiers for quick iterations.\n● Procedurally creating internal walls to enhance your architectural design process.\n● Utilizing Blender's annotation tools to easily sketch and annotate within the 3D viewport.\n● Designing facades that allow for flexible design changes.\n● Exploring rendering basics to generate hidden line images for effective presentations.\n\n\nCourse Benefits: What You'll Learn\nBy completing this course, you'll develop a solid foundation in several key areas:\n● Concept Architecture Models: Learn to create concept architectural models using Blender's powerful tools.\n● Procedural Workflows: Understand time-saving and user-friendly procedural workflows that streamline your design process.\n● 3D Sketching: Gain confidence in using Blender's annotation tools to sketch and visualize your ideas directly in the 3D viewport.\n● Effective Presentation: Acquire skills to present your concept work effectively, showcasing your design vision to others.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll be equipped to create stunning architectural concepts, optimize your workflow, and communicate your ideas with confidence.",

We'll examine the mesh and review references for the model and then we'll do a small exploration into matcaps and colors. We'll then begin to layer in a foundational skin tone before using the spray brush with an alpha to help create the imperfections usually found in skin. We'll use cavity masking to help us creating some shadowing and then the spray brush again to help give our demon head a five o'clock shadow! We mock up some ideas for eye coloration before finally adding a base color to the horns to contrast with the skin of the demon!\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nStephen Wells is an expert 3D modeler for characters, props, vehicles, weapons and environments and have created both high and low polygon assets for game productions.

      "description": "Do you like fantasy art and want to make weapons in 3D?\nThen I welcome you to Nexttut Education's Making a Fantasy Axe in Blender course.\n\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU LEARN FROM ME:\nMy name is Alejandro Aguilar, and I have been working in 3D art for about 7 years. I have worked on numerous projects, from mobile games to video production. My area of work focuses on understanding 3D at a technical level, so that I can then teach you in an easy-to-understand way.\n\n\nBENEFITS :\nBy the end of this course you will know how to,\nModel and sculpt the detail needed to create a game-ready hero asset.\nTexture in Substance Painter with detail.\n\n\nWHAT WILL I LEARN:\nSculpting and modelling\nTexturing for games\n\n\nCOURSE PROJECTS:\nWe will start by blocking out a model of the prop, with using basic modelling tools to get an idea of how we want to make the axe look. We’ll then take the axe into sculpting to make a high detailed mesh. From there, we will retopologize and unwrap a low poly mesh for texture baking. We’ll use the texture we backed, and go into Substance Painter to texture the prop, and make a final render\n\n\nIS THIS COURSE RIGHT FOR ME:\nI have designed this course for beginner to intermediate 3d modelling students, who want to model fantasy art for games but they struggle to get it because they don't find a tutorial which is step by step, no fast forward, no skip and coming from a production artist who has been doing this for years.\nThe course is also for artists who want to speed up their workflow in Blender and improve their skill in hard surface modelling.\n\n\nWHO IS NOT THE IDEAL STUDENT:\nThis course is not designed for absolute Blender beginners.\n\n\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW OR HAVE FOR THE COURSE:\nI expect you to have some sort of basic Blender experience.\nYou should have Blender 3.0 installed on your computer.\nYou should have the latest version of Substance Painter.\n\n\nJOIN ME NOW:\nSo if you want to model production ready weapons, then join me now, and take your skills to the next level. Hope to see you in the course.",

The previous course is a bit outdated, but most of the tools still function the same way.\nThis course has been made with Modo 12.\nIn this course you will learn a lot. You will learn how to import reference images. You will also learn how to use an external application called PureRef for using even more reference images. Then you will learn the basics of box modelling. And with a basic mesh created, you will sculpt it, refine your sculpt during the sculpting process and convert it to a regular mesh. Next you will learn how to do a basic unwrap of your model (uv-mapping), adjust your UV-map and find/fix errors.  I will lead you through the hair and fur materials and how to use the tools for sculpting the hair. Many methods for creating and placing fur will be discussed, including a method of exporting them to a game engine.\nYou will learn in depth about normal map baking. Including most of the pitfalls and how to fix things, if they don't work. You will learn the basics of colormanagement for baking maps. And bake an ambient occlusion map. Finally you will learn how to use the (very basic) painting tools in Modo, to create pbr maps and change the settings in Modo to export your low-poly model to for example Unity game engine.",

This course is designed to focus on what the student is going to need to know to start and finish any model they choose to undertake to create.The UI, and customization of same, will be explored as well the major creation methods and using sub-object functions (vertex, edge, polygon, element) to their best advantage. From using photo references, the student will be able to clearly and concisely model parts and refine details to create finished meshes.\nThey'll learn to use smoothing groups to best advantage when applying modifiers (turbo smooth) and why such smoothing groups are important. After completing the mesh, the student will then be exposed to UVs and the new unwrap features found in 3DS Max 2017 to facilitate the speed in which the meshes can be unwrapped and laid out for proper texture usage. Finally, the students will be taught  how to bake a simple ambient occlusion map quickly and easily to help give their meshes a more believable three dimensional quality so that they can then create the colours for the model as they see fit and blend into the AO to create a usable model.\nMore about the instructor:\nHaving 25 years of experience in the videogame development/entertainment arenas, I'm well versed in a variety of programs and production pipelines and strive to work as cleanly and efficiently as possible. Having done pretty much everything, I enjoy getting to share my knowledge and experience in the hopes that I can help students gain a better understanding and appreciation of what 3D computer art (in all its varying forms) has to offer.",

      "description": "Hello guys, it's Zerina here. Welcome to a new Blender course.\nRecently, I re-watched the Toy Story series again, and I was impressed with the movie quality that Pixar and Disney did back then. They needed a big team to create only one character; they worked for weeks, even months.\nSo I made the course to show you that in the next three to four hours, you will be able to achieve what they did back then, and you will do it yourself, thanks to Blender! I will help you understand and learn the concept of 3d, tools for modeling, and to model one of your favorite characters from the Toy Story!\nWe will create the famous Buzz Lightyear. He is one of the main characters in this film. And he is the main character in the upcoming science fiction adventure film produced by Pixar animation studios and Walt Disney Pictures called Lightyear.\n\n\nCourse Preview:\nI will start modeling by inserting the REFERENCE that I provided for you. Once I insert the photos, I will be able to begin modeling. Buzz Lightyear has many details, so I will divide the modeling into several parts.\nIn the first part, we will model the head, and the face to better view the other pieces. Modeling will not be complicated because I will use all the basics of modeling. In addition, I will use all the basic modifiers, and I will show you how to use them properly.\nWhen I finish modeling the head, I will start with the circle or the base for the helmet, and we will also begin modeling the upper part of the torso, which is attached to the area with the helmet.\nAfter I finish modeling the upper part of the torso, I will focus on the lower part that binds the arms and the part attached to the pelvis.\nWhen we finish modeling the torso, we will continue modeling the bottom part of the body, which is the pelvis, thigh, and the whole leg.\nI will also make details on the legs in the form of long vertical lines on both sides of the legs and one horizontal line on the thigh.\nUsing the same modeling principles, I will continue modeling the arms and hands, and also, we will add the same vertical lines on the arms as we did to the legs.\nWhen I finish modeling the arms and hands, I will model the backpack and the wings to finalize the character.\nOnce I finish modeling, I will add the materials; I am going to be applying all basic materials, so this part is going to be easy.\nAfter I applied the materials, the final step was to add the stickers to the character. Once the stickers are done, I will now be focusing on the final render settings, such as adjusting the camera, adding the light or HDRI in my case, playing with the color management, and changing our render engine to cycles.\n\n\nBy enrolling in this course you will also get :\n\n\n30 Days Money-Back Guarantee\nWhen you enroll in the course, you are fully protected by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.\nIf, for whatever reason, you're the rare student NOT making significant strides towards achieving results, let us know within 30 days, and we will return every dime of your investment.\nThis means you can try out the academy RISK-FREE, and you can cancel your subscription at any time.\nWorld-Class Support\nWe know better than anyone how learning Blender can be when you don't have somebody to ask for help. That's why at our academy you will benefit from our world-class support.\nAnything that is not clear or you stumbled upon a problem following the course, and you don't know how to solve it, you can ask a question on the platform directly below the video where you encountered the problem.\nWe personally review and answer all your questions, and our response time is 24 hours maximum, often responding in a couple of hours and sometimes even minutes. Please note this response time is during work days.\n\nSo what are we waiting for, guys? First, let's hop on to the videos!\nTO INFINITY AND BEYOND!",

You’ll learn techniques like Edit poly modeling with Zmodeler, Stylized texturing, Dramatic presentation, Clean technical optimization of props and so much more!Concept art created by Zachary Liao\n\n\nZbrush, 3ds Max, Substance Painter, and Marmoset Toolbag.\nAll the modeling and low poly will be done in Zbrush, however, the techniques used are universal and can be replicated in any other 3d modeling package. The textures will be created using Substance Painter and previewed in Marmoset Toolbag 3.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to know to create the final results that you see in the images and trailers. Next to this, the same techniques can be applied to almost any type of environment.\n\n\n9+ HOURS!\nWe will start by going over our reference and then we dive right in and create the base of the knife high poly with zmodeler. Then we will detail it, create our low poly and finish everything up in Zbrush. After that, we will continue to 3ds max to create the UV unwrap and smoothing groups.\n\n\nThen, we will bake in marmoset all the pieces separately to achieve a clean result. Next, we will proceed to Substance Painter where we will create stylized textures mostly using the output from the bakes. And lastly, we will do a cool presentation in marmoset for our portfolios using dramatic lighting to accentuate the shapes of our model!\n\n\nSKILL LEVEL\nthis course is targeted more towards intermediate artists who already have a basic understanding of the programs mentioned – Everything in this tutorial will be explained in detail.\nHowever, if you have never touched any modeling or texturing tools before we recommend that you first watch an introduction tutorial of those programs (you can find many of these for free on YouTube or paid on this very website)\n\n\nTOOLS USED\nZbrush\n3ds Max\nSubstance Painter\nMarmoset Toolbag 3\n\n\nYOUR INSTRUCTOR\nMario Stabile is a senior character artist and studio owner of Ophion Studios who are working in the AAA game industry.

      "description": "Hi Guys!\nWhether you're a motion designer or a professional animator, you have probably been offered projects in which you have to rig and animate a character from the front view.\nBut since you weren't familiar with the basics and principles of front-view animation, you turned down the projects.\nHowever, Don't worry anymore!\nIn this course, I'll show you how to rig and animate a character from the front view using a straightforward and practical method that doesn't require any plugins or scripts.\n\n\nI'll begin this course by covering some fundamental topics, such as preparing the character for rigging. Once that’s done, I’ll move on to rigging a character from the front view. You will learn how to animate properly and how different parts of the character are animated. And how to use the references to create the walk cycle. Next, you’ll learn how to create an infinite background and loop the animation.\n\n\nIn the next chapter, you'll learn how to create a run cycle for the character you've rigged before with the help of the reference.\n\n\nAnd the last chapter, you'll learn how to replace your character with a different one without having to redo any of your Rigging and animation work.\n\n\nPlease note that this course is intended for intermediate to advanced-level motion designers.\nSo, if you are still in the beginning, I highly recommend starting with my Motion Hero course before diving into this course.\n\n\nKnow that I will be around to help - if you get lost you can drop a post on the video 'Questions and Answers' below each video and I'll be sure to get back to you.\nWith the 30-day 100% money back guarantee, there is nothing holding you back from jumping in right now and trying the course out.\nGo ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!",

      "description": "Hello and welcome.\n\n\nIf you are a designer or developer who is interested in create pose-to-pose animations in a 3D environment with the possibilities to automate the process, this course is for you.\n\n\nThis course focuses on creating multiple Python scripts that will help us to read pose information from external sources like pictures and video and use it to create an animated armature.\nFor this, we will mainly use Blender as the 3D Editor and Python to create the scripts.\n\n\nWith Python, we will read JSON files that contains information about the positions of the limbs and time marks that can help us to identify keyframes.\n\n\nWith Blender, we will run the script to create an armature with an animation that recreate the poses from the original source.\n\n\nWe will also use Krita and Tensorflow to get the pose information that we will be using through the course.\n\n\nYou may like this course because it can help you save time when you want to create 3D animations.\n\n\nIn addition, you will have access to the content created during the course.\n\n\nI hope you find the content useful and that you can apply it to your personal projects.\n\n\nHave fun and happy learning.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn:\nBasic concepts about keyframe animations like keyframes and interpolation\nCreate a basic animation in Krita to then export the animation data to a json file\nUse Tensorflow JS with PoseNet to read the poses of a human body from a multimedia file\nCreate a Python script that reads the pose data to create animated armature to recreate the source material.\nExecute the script in the scripting section provided by Blender\n\n\nYou will require:\nYou must be familiar with scripting; however, anyone can follow it as each step is explained.\nBlender v 3 and above\nVisual Studio Code.

In this adventure, we will tell you how to model all the cars in the world, at what stages you can create a car for yourself. We will make models with and without a car. We will prepare all the Textures and materials. Next, we'll take the best light settings and the best camera angles and settings. We will make a very special scene for our model. And we will adjust the render settings for great rendering. From textures and materials to lighting, from lighting to camera settings and final rendering, you'll learn it all in this tutorial. At the end of the training, you will model and render all the cars in the world. When you complete the training from start to finish, you will have gained a great skill for yourself. You should follow every detail by seeing the lesson. This training is silent throughout. Just follow me and keep going. Don't forget to ask questions where you get stuck. Before starting the training, please note that the training is quiet and if you get stuck, you will ask me a question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout this learning...\nWe will do the modeling and rendering of the car named \"Bugatti Chiron Sport 2021\", one of the luxury car brands of the world, together with you.   Do not forget to ask me questions during the process, even at the slightest point. I'm going to break up car creation into parts. We will go according to a syllabus. But I want to mention something here ; This training is a very detailed training. It is a training that can take hundreds of time. So this training will be an updated training. It will take a long time to finish. During this process, I will include the completed stages in the training. The tutorial will start from modeling and end under rendering. During this process, please do not think that the training is over when there is no video left in the training. Note that I did that part then.I'm going to break up the car tutorial into sections. Here is our curriculum;\n\n\n- Car Modelling\n- Material Making\n- Light Settings\n- Camera Settings\n- Scene Setup for Car Render from Scratch\n- Render Settings\n\n\nFirst of all, we will do very detailed model and rendering processes in this course. The course is very detailed. And all the lessons in this course content are completely silent. You are asked to learn by following.Please note that all training is silent while taking the course.",

      "description": "Do you have problems modelling male anatomy, face and body?\nThen I welcome you to Blender Anatomy Course : Learn Male Human Anatomy course.\n\n\nAbout Me:\nMy name is Daniel da Costa and I have been a 3D character artist for about 10 years now. I have worked for tv commercials, movie agencies and 3D animation studios, currently I’m working as a freelance character artist and 3D tutor.\n\n\nBy The End Of  This Course, You Will Be Able To:\nYou'll be able to sculpt realistic anatomy using Blender and you’ll get a great sense of the human body construction from start to finish.\nYou will be able to sculpt anatomy with better accuracy than before.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\nSculpting the elements of the face\nSculpting the torso\nSculpting the arms and hands\nSculpting legs and feet\nBringing emotion for sculptures\nTaking great renders for presentation\n\n\nCourse Project Overview:\nWe will start with a sphere using our sculpt system. Then we will sculpt the elements of the face as an ear, nose, mouth and eyes. Then we will create the general blocking of the body. I will explain what you should watch for in an initial sculpting. Then we will make the torso and legs, starting the body from the bottom to the top. Then we will make the feet, arms and hands. After that we will work on the overall sculpt and we are gonna finish the body details and volumes as well as the hand gesture. Then all of it, we're gonna sculpt the head putting the knowledge learned in the first chapters on practice. After we finish the head, we are gonna create a render presentation.\n\n\nWho is This Course For?\nI have designed this course for intermediate 3d modelling students, who want to learn human anatomy because they want to become a 3d character artist.\n\n\nWho is Not The Ideal Student For This Course?\nThis course is not designed for absolute Blender beginners.\n\n\nWhat Are The Requirements Or Prerequisites For Taking This Course?\nI expect you to have some sort of basic blender experience.\nYou should have blender 3.2 installed on your computer.\n\n\nJoin Me Now:\nSo if you want to model realistic anatomy in blender, then join me now, and take your skills to the next level.

Are you ready to impress people with your new skills and abilities? Join me, and I will bestow upon you knowledge of good practices of modelling techniques and will grant you newfound expertise!\nWe look at both the bus and the truck separately, treating both vehicles as separate tutorials that utilise many of the same practices, allowing you to seal your understanding of them. We'll create the various different assets including the wheels,  seats, and wipers ready for both vehicles. We'll then move onto creating the actual vehicles. I'll show you highly productive ways of creating them so that you're not left fiddling with more vertices than you need to be; the workflow we adopt keeps raw topology to a minimum!\nWhen you have finished the course, you will have two complete models that you can develop further; you can either rig and animate them, or simply place them into still scenes of your choice! You will also have the information necessary to create vehicles and assets of your own.\nDid you know that it's possible to create detailed models like shown in the promotional video within a day? You're learning so it may take a little longer, but once you're done you should be able to significantly reduce your complex modelling times!\nI encourage  you to have a look at the preview lectures to get a feel for the pace and style of the course.

I am a self-taught Artist. And I love watching science documentaries and Sci-Fi movies!\n\n\nBy the end of this course:\nYou will be able to create procedural animations with CHOPs.\nYou will be able to create procedural grass wind in Houdini.\nYou will be able to create ground dust simulation in Houdini.\nYou will be able to create dynamics plants and vegetation simulation in Houdini.\nYou will be able work with confident in solaris.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn\nHoudini procedural animation workflow\nProcedural tree generation\nWorking with wire solver\nCreating custom velocities with volume\nScattering multiple objects\nProcedural grass wind\nTree rig for wire solver\nGround dust simulation\nWorking with solaris\nImporting instances in solaris\nRendering with Karma CPU\n\n\nCourse Projects:\nWe will start with importing helicopter model and we will use CHOPs to procedurally animate helicopter. And then we will import plants and vegetation and use wire solver to simulate plants we will be using volume velocities to create custom wind for plants and vegetation simulation. And then we will learn how to create procedural grass wind using VOPs. After we have animated grass and vegetation we will take a look at creating instances and scattering plants and vegetation in here we will use loops and copy stamping to add per instance animation timing variation. After that we will use Sidefx labs tree tool to procedurally generate bamboo trees and we will rig our procedurally generated tree for wire solver. And then we will use particles simulation to create grass blowing in the wind effect. And after that we will use pyro solver to create ground dust simulation. And then we will import all of our assets in to solaris for shading and rendering in here we will take a look at how we can import instances efficiently in to solaris and we will assign materials and render our final shot\n\n\nIs This Course Right For You:\nI have designed this course for intermediate Houdini students.\n\n\nWho Is Not The Ideal Student\nAbsolute beginners Houdini students.\n\n\nJOIN ME NOW:\nSo if you want to learn Houdini and want to create awesome Dynamic Vegetation and Wind Simulation, then join me now.

      "description": "3D Modelling food can be an exciting and rewarding experience. Due to the complexities in the organic form and texture of foods, it can look intimidating to render a realistic food.\nToday we are going to apply my best approaches to render realistic chips from scratch. The lessons are aimed to be short and beginner friendly and so you can get the best results as fast as possible.\nCGI food renders are used in many applications such as food product packaging, advertising, product launch, key visuals etc. Through CGI we get a very fine control over the key parameters for good imagery like lighting, shadows, camera angles, textures and styling. We can create desired variations in food. Blender being an open source and free software has all the required tools to produce appetizing and mouth watering food visuals. All the steps required for creating CGI food can easily be completed seamlessly inside of blender.\nWe will be using blender throughout the course, with lessons involving the core concepts of creating CGI food like displacement maps, geometry nodes, procedural texturing and shader creation, finally easy lighting and rendering. Lets learn these concepts in the easiest and quickest way!\nEnroll Now. Let’s get started!",

Concept art of the spaceship will be provided to use as reference while modeling, creating an immersive project environment that emulates a real world 3D artist's work task.\nThe course is divided into 2 major sections: the modeling phase, and the texturing phase. Modeling will take place in Blender and texturing will be handled in Substance Painter. Rendering images of the final asset can be done in either programs using Substance Painter's built-in renderer or Blender's Eevee or Cycles rendering solutions.\nAfter the end of the class, you'll have a stronger understanding of how game-ready art assets get made in the game industry. You'll also have something to put in your portfolio to showcase your knowledge of game asset creation.\nThe tools used in the class will be:\nBlender\nSubstance Painter\nWhile it would be helpful to know the basics of each program for following along the videos, there's a couple of things to do before getting started if you're brand new.

We'll initially use Dynamesh to create the foundational shapes before refining them and creating new polygroups within each subtool. We'll then extrude some of the polygroups to help create the plating on different parts of the mesh before using some alphas to create some smaller details over the model. We'll utilize the IMM brush particularly to add in elements to our Mech Head to finalize details. Lastly, we'll quickly drop the model into KeyShot for our final test renders.\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nStephen Wells is an expert 3D modeler for characters, props, vehicles, weapons and environments and have created both high and low polygon assets for game productions.

And then we will take a look at how we can use VOPs for creating procedural lightning fx for our project. And then will see how we create sword slash FX in SOPs. And then we will see how to create procedural rock growth animation in SOPs. And then we will use Houdini POP solver for creating sand particles. We want to emit particles when rocks start to grow from the ground. And then we will see how we can import our character into the scene that we have downloaded from mixamo. And then we will see how we can use Houdini Pyro Solver for creating Dust simulation. And after that we will use RBD Bullet solver for creating Debris simulation for our FX. And after that we will import all our FX layers into Solaris for rendering. We will use Karma XPU for rendering. And in Solaris we will see how we can create materials and assign materials. And we will finish our project by compositing into After Effects.\n\n\nIS THIS COURSE RIGHT FOR ME:\nI have designed this course for beginner fx artists who want to learn Houdini.\n\n\nWHO IS NOT THE IDEAL STUDENT:\nAnyone can learn houdini with this course.\n\n\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW OR HAVE FOR THE COURSE:\nI expect you to have some sort of basic knowledge of Houdini interface.\nYou should have Houdini 20.5 installed on your computer.\n\n\nJOIN ME NOW:\nSo if you want to learn Houdini and want to create procedural and dynamic FX, then join me now.

If you want to learn\nanimation from scratch, you can start right here with this course. I designed this course for\nbeginners, so if you've never heard of a keyframe or don't know what a timeline is, then this\ncourse is for you. This course is Animation 101. I also believe this course will be excellent for\nanyone with a vague idea of animation, someone who is new to animation and uses software\nto move elements but truly wants to understand the fundamental principles to take\nanimation to the next level.\nThese fundamental animation principles will prepare you for a career in animation. You'll learn\nstep by step how to create realistic and engaging motion; moreover, you'll understand why\ncertain specific animation techniques effectively bring objects to life. And most importantly,\nyou'll learn when to apply them to your work.\nIn this course, I use Clip Studio to teach you animation. You'll study classic animation, frame\nby frame, hand-drawn. It's the best way to learn animation principles. And don't worry if you\nthink you can't draw, we'll work with basic shapes to animate - to breathe life into these\nshapes.\nThis course starts by teaching you how to animate with just keyframes; it will guide you step by\nstep to animating a character jumping. I've structured each lesson to be neither confusing nor\noverwhelming. As I've made applying the principles very simple, you'll have the opportunity to\ntruly grasp the concepts without worrying about drawing skills, working with advanced\nsymbols, or complex structures.\nThe course progresses towards two final projects. These are significant animation projects in\nany school or university program. In these projects, you'll transition from keyframes to a\nsmooth, dynamic character animation. I want to ensure you feel confident to animate a\ncomplex character animation with many moving parts when we reach the final project.\nWhat's covered in this course:\nWhether you eventually want to work in 3D, motion graphics, or 2D animation, you'll need\nto know things like:\n• Transitions between keyframes\n• How to create a smooth transition,\n• Why you need to do it - and when you should apply it.\nYou'll also learn skills that will not only make you an animator but a truly proficient one - skills\nsuch as:\n• Timing and spacing\n• Stretching and squashing\n• Working in curved trajectories\n• Working with timelines\n• How to animate with anticipation, overshoot, and settle.",

      "description": "Creating a Medieval Town Environment – Using UE5 & Blender\nLearn how a professional environment artist works when creating environments for games. In this case, a medieval-style town environment using Blender & Unreal Engine 5, along with the help of nanite, Lumen, Zbrush, and various other software like substance designer & painter.\nBased on the amazing concept art of Vincent Lau\n\nBLENDER, SUBSTANCE, ZBRUSH, AND UNREAL ENGINE 5\nThis course will cover a very large number of topics, but the biggest topics are as follows:\nDoing project planning and creating proper blockout scenes.\nCreating modular buildings with high reusability.\nSculpting wood and concrete assets in Zbrush.\nUsing Nanite in UE5 along with slightly modified traditional workflows for higher quality models while still being able to use and modify them in other 3d software.\nCreating various tillable materials using substance 3d designer.\nCreating unique textures using Substance Painter.\nDoing lighting and post effects in unreal engine 5.\nAdding actual geometry displacement on our modular assets using the modeling tools in Unreal.\nDoing general level art in Unreal Engine.\nAnd so much more.\nThe general takeaway of this course is that in the end, you will have the knowledge of how to create exactly what you see in the images, and you can apply this knowledge to almost any type of environment.\n\n\n29+ HOURS!\nThis course contains over 29+ hours of content – You can follow along with every single step – This course has been done 100% in real-time except for a few time-lapses for very repetitive tasks.\n\nThis course has been divided up into easy-to-understand chapters. We will start the course off by planning our environment and creating our blockout assets.\nWe will then already Design the entire level in UE5.\nAfter this, we will first create all of our tillable materials using Substance 3D Designer.\nThen we will focus on taking our assets to final. In these stages, you will learn everything from modeling in blender, sculpting in Zbrush, uv-unwrapping in RizomUV, and texturing in Substance 3D Painter.\nWe will then focus on getting all of our final models and textures in Unreal Engine and implanting them in our scene.\nAfter this is done, we will start focusing on doing our first lighting pass, creating some additional assets, and taking our scene closer to final.\nFinally, we will finish up by creating some simple foliage, polishing up our scene and adding some external 3d assets, taking some final screenshots, and then this environment is completed.\n\n\nSKILL LEVEL\nThis game art tutorial is perfect for students who have familiarity with 3d Modeling tools and Unreal Engine – Everything in this tutorial will be explained in detail. However, if you have never touched any modeling, texturing, or engine tools before, we recommend that you first watch an introduction tutorial on those programs (you can find many of these for free on YouTube or paid on this very website)\n\n\nTOOLS USED\nUnreal Engine 5\nBlender\nSpeedTree\nRizomUV\nMarmoset Toolbag 4\nSubstance Designer\nSubstance Painter\nZbrush\nPlease note that most techniques used are universal, so they can be replicated in almost any 3D software like Maya & 3DS Max.\n\n\nYOUR INSTRUCTOR\nEmiel Sleegers is a lead environment artist and owner of FastTrack Tutorials. He’s worked on games like The Division 2 + DLC at Ubisoft, Forza Horizon 3 at Playground Games, and as a Freelancer on multiple projects as an Environment Artist and Material Artist.\n\n\nSOURCE FILES\nPlease note that this project does not come with any source files or extra content due to platform limitations. If you want all source files & extra content like un-timelapsed footage please look us up on ArtStation, Gumroad or FlippedNormals",

We should find a studio to write down an advertisement script for us, and produce our animated advertisement movie.\nHere is the good news: If you are a Unity Developer, you do not have to spend thousands of dollars for this purpose. You can use Unity's Timeline and Animator, with some free tools and packages you can easily produce your advertisement movie.\nFor this purpose, during the course we will use only free assets and packages and we will finish a 3D cartoon animation from scratch. We will design a thirty seconds fun cartoony scene from the opening title to final rendered animation.\nFirst, we will start to finding the inspiration for our animation\nWe will write down a short script in two column scenario format and design an animation storyboard\nNext step will be writing down our bucket list and putting together all the assets and packages we need\nWe will setup our Unity development environment and make it ready for animation production\nI will show you how to design and decorate your very first animation scene\nI will show you how to import and use premade animations and integrate them to your project\nI will show you how you can animate different body parts of 3D rigged characters\nWe will also animate different objects in our scene to reach a high-quality final product\nWe will use timeline to manage our cameras, animations and audio\nFinally, we will add post processing effects and will be rendering our 30 seconds cartoony animation\nTogether we will dive in to the Unity’s real time rendering revolution which will affect multibillion-dollar animation industry soon. Under the instruction of a 20 years experienced instructor (who is lecturing at the well-known universities and developing game/animation projects in professional level) you will have the chance to become one of the pioneers of new generation animation developers.",

In this way, we can quickly and easily reach the final result, in this case in only about one hour\nIn the second part of the tutorial, which is completely step-by-step, we stick to the reference photo that we will bring to life and turn into animation\nI will show you how to use the photo not only as a reference but also how to use some of the textures to speed up the process, get closer to the reference, and get a realistic result faster and easier\nIn addition to the tutorial, I will share with you the final .blend files as well as the 2 assets packs that we use in the tutorial\nIn the tutorial, we will talk about modeling, texturing, lighting, composition, post-processing…\nI will show you how to use a reference photo to create 3D models and how to use it as a texture\nWe will also use several modifiers and talk to the camera, color correction, use the blender compositor, and more\nThis is the workflow I've learned in 5 years of experience in Blender and I'm glad to share it with you",

And by doing that you’ll also learn the fundamentals of working with Cinema 4D, and with 3D in general.\nWe learn best by doing, so this is a hands-on, project-based course.\nWe're going to work through 4 fun projects from start to finish. We will create everything within Cinema 4D and won't use and pre-made elements.\nWe will use a procedural workflow that doesn’t require modeling. That means that all settings remain editable and we can change the entire look by just adjusting a few sliders. It makes the whole process of creating and experimenting fun, flexible and powerful.\nThe design elements we’ll create are well-suited for either a 3D or a 2D workflow.\nWe’ll cover the fundamental concepts in the first project. And then we’ll build upon what we learned in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th projects.\nWe’ll reiterate the most important aspects for a deeper understanding and add new skills and techniques as we progress.\n\n\nHere’s a glimpse of what we’ll cover\n• Working with parametric objects\n• Exploring how geometry and complexity affect the appearance of objects\n• Working with deformers\n• Looking at how displacement works and how to optimize for best result\n• Working with the noise shader\n• Making complex shaders by using the layer shader\n• Lighting a scene with 3-point lighting\n• Working with cameras\n• Creating materials\n• Rendering with the Physical and the Standard Renderer\n• Making a seamless loop animation\n• Color grading and post-effects in Adobe After Effects\n\n\nUdemy offers a 30-day 100% money-back guarantee. So if you for any reason at all find that the course wasn’t for you, you can get a full refund.\nHowever, I think, and hope, you’ll find this to be an efficient and fun training to get started with Cinema 4D.\n\n\nGo ahead and enroll, and I’ll see you in the course.\n\n\nJesper",

In Substance painter you will be able to create realistic looking materials with ease.\nIn chapter 3 We go deeper into the creation of the model. creating more challenging shapes so your models will look more realistic and creating materials from scratch. This way you can start thinking about materials in a different light and start looking for ways to create textures and materials you never had thought about before.\nChapter 4+5 Are made for each-other. With the creation of the chair, you will get an understanding about shapes and recreating more intricate models. Now that our chair model is done you will learn how to reuse certain parts of the model so we safe loads of time and create a ''set'' of models that look good together.\n\n\nFREE UPDATE!!!\nchapter 6+7 and chapter Extra's are new updates just for you!\nChapter 6+7 Are designed to speed up your process and create multiple 3D models from the same kind with a different look.\nChapter Extra's Covers topics that will heighten your production speed and quality, but are better served separate so you can find them back.",

      "description": "Here we go again, but this time the course is bigger, better, and there’s a whole lot of new stuff, including a full interior. My past car modeling training has been studied by designers from industry giants like Hyundai, Volvo, Kia, and Ford, as well as from top gaming and film companies all over the world. And now I’ve taken those techniques and made them even better.\nIn this step-by-step course we’ll tackle an amazing car design by professional designer Lee Rosario, and I’ll show you new ways to solve even the trickiest hard surface challenges with ease as we build this awesome car together from the first vertex to the final renders. So join me in this car creation journey, and learn tons of techniques for hard surface modeling, shading, rendering, and compositing, all inside the free open source 3D software, Blender.\n\n\nThe Guide Mesh Technique - Updated!\nSubsurface modeling is an essential mesh modeling workflow for hard surface artists, but it can quickly become a headache when adding details or cutouts to your model. Any modifications can easily ruin a curved surface, making the entire process frustrating and time-consuming.\nIn this course, I’ll show you a completely non-destructive technique I developed that avoids these problems entirely, so you can maintain perfect curves without any hassle and achieve a quality comparable to class A surfaces without using nurbs. This workflow has also been significantly upgraded since my last course, making it easier and better than ever, and bringing us to the final evolution of what I call the Guide Mesh Technique.\n\n\nA Workflow Like No Other\nThe Guide Mesh technique allows you to focus entirely on perfecting the curvatures of your model using a separate mesh, without worrying about all the details complicating the topology. This will speed up your workflow and guarantee perfect reflections on your final panels, even after adding in all the cutouts and separations between them.\nThis workflow also gives you total control over achieving perfect topology in the end, but also offers a great deal of freedom where even bad topology will end up looking flawless. And there are tricks you can pull off with this that you just simply can’t do any other way.\n\n\nAdvanced Modeling Techniques\nYou’ll learn about countless other modeling techniques and tools in this course as well, like how insanely powerful Blender’s modifiers can be for complex modeling tasks. Modifiers are essential to an efficient and non-destructive workflow, and I’ll show you a ton of different and unique ways to use them and combine them.\nAnd with so many different parts of a car to model, we’ll need to approach different challenges using different modeling techniques, so you’ll gain a thorough understanding of the thought process and how using the right tools the right way can save you a lot of time and effort.\n\nCore Modeling Principles\nNot only will you learn about advanced techniques that take the quality of your models to the next level, but we’ll also dive deep into learning the core principles behind subsurface modeling and polygon modeling in general. Good modeling begins with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals like topology, efficiency, and what tools are best for the job.\nOn top of that, you’ll learn about the thought process behind each step of the modeling process. Visualizing how the model should look in the end and being able to simplify complex modeling challenges each step of the way are all critical to an effective workflow.\n\n\nFully Customizable Shaders\nAfter all the hard work that goes into the model, the next step is setting it up for renders you can be proud of. Getting the final render looking just right can bring out the best in your model and truly reflect your skills as a 3D artist, and this begins with the perfect shaders. Using Blender’s powerful Shader Editor, we’ll create fully customizable shaders including realistic car paint with metallic flakes, a fully procedural carbon fiber, fabric, leather, and more.\nJust like the modeling process, these complex shaders will be built step-by-step and you’ll learn the reasoning and logic behind every move, helping you gain a strong proficiency in shader development so you can apply these newfound skills to all of your own projects as well.\n\n\nRigging and Animation\nOnce the model is complete, we’ll set it up with a basic rig to pose it for rendering. We’ll rig the wheels so they can spin and turn, and we’ll even rig the doors so they can open and close, giving us more options to customize the final look. We’ll also animate the tires and the environment to set up motion blur for the final renders, really bringing the model to life. You’ll learn about parenting, constraints, keyframes, using the Graph Editor, and how to set up motion blur to get the perfect action shot.\n\n\nThe Final Renders\nFinally we’ll dive into all the elements that make a great render you can show off, including setting up lighting and an environment, getting the perfect camera angle, using Blender’s compositing nodes to make the final shot really pop, and even using Blender’s paint tools to add the final post processing to complete your renders. And with plenty of room for customization, and several environments and lighting setups included in the training, you’ll be able to make the results your own.\n\n\nPlus Extras!\nI’ve also included extra stand-alone chapters on the Guide Mesh technique, teaching you everything you need to know about this extremely useful workflow, without having to dig through the course for it. These “Full Guide to the Guide Mesh” chapters will go over the theory behind the technique, all the rules for using it, plus a chapter full of tips and unique tricks for it. All of this information is also outlined in a PDF for you, so you have a quick reference to all of this for your own projects.\nAll necessary project files are included in the course too, such as blueprints, reference images, and textures, and it also includes the final car model. And it’s a big course, so it also made sense to include some Easter Eggs as a fun break along the journey!\n\n\nNeed a Commercial License?\nThis product is for personal use only and may not be used for any commercial purposes. If you intend to apply this training to commercial work or use it to teach others, you must obtain a commercial or enterprise license. Contact me for more information.\n\n\nSubtitles in 12 Languages\nThis course is in English and includes English subtitles. The course also includes automatic translations for 11 other languages, including French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.\n\n\nKeep in Touch!\nIf you get stuck and need help at any point in the project, or even if you just want to share your progress, you can keep in touch with me in the Q&A section.",

The curriculum is carefully crafted so you can master 3ds Max quickly and yet seamlessly.\n\n\nThe curriculum overview\n\n\nYou will learn a lot of things in this course. There is just too much to cover in this short description. For more detailed information, you can check the curriculum section. But, just to give you a quick overview of what you will learn. There are a total of 13 chapters in this course outside the introduction chapter.\n\n\nIn the first chapter, you will be introduced to 3ds Max's UI. You will learn different ways to navigate the viewport and utilize the display settings. In the second chapter, you will learn basic object operations such as how to create objects, and how to modify them. You will also learn object selection, object transformation, and so on. In the third chapter, we will focus on scene management. You will learn how to use the \"Scene explorer\". Then using layers, groups, etc.\n\n\nStarting from the fourth chapter, we will focus on 3D modeling. In this chapter, you’ll learn polygonal modeling techniques related to each of the sub-object types. We will cover sub-object selection techniques. Then we will also discuss 3D modeling concepts such as \"Normal direction\" and \"Backface culling\", etc. At the end of this chapter, we will have a project modeling a table lamp product called \"Atollo\".\n\n\nIn chapter five, we will focus on precision modeling techniques. We will start with the basics of measurement units. Learn different snapping features, and then learn various tools for aligning objects, and so on. There are 3 projects in this chapter. First, we will model a stool called \"Tamtam\". Then we model a side table product called \"Etna\". And on the last project, we will model another side table product called \"Lack\".\n\n\nNext, in chapter six, we're going to build a kitchen counter product called \"Werk\". We'll cover everything from setting up the references. Then modeling the base frame, then the panels, and so on. Until we have a finished model.\n\n\nIn chapter 7, we will focus on spline-based modeling techniques. You will learn the basics such as creating, selecting, and converting spline vertices. Then we move on to learn various techniques of spline editing. After that, you will learn how to turn splines into 3D models. There are a total of 7 projects in this chapter alone. First, you will model a simple S letter logo. Then in the next project model a circular classic ornament. And then model a tileable 3D pattern. Then, you will model a vase product called \"Echasse\". Then you will create a crown molding object. In the next project, you will model a table lamp product called \"Diana\". And then finally you will create a roman column.\n\n\nIn chapter 8, we will focus on subdivision modeling techniques which are very useful for creating organic-like objects. And then learn compound-based modeling techniques, which basically combine existing 3D objects to create new ones. There are 3 projects in this chapter. The first project is creating a teacup model. Then the second project is creating a washbasin. In the third project, you will create a stool product called \"Alma\".\n\n\nChapter 9 is a project chapter. In this chapter, we will build a chair product called \"Papilio Shell\" using subdivision, compound-based modeling techniques, and other related techniques that we have discussed earlier.\n\n\nStarting from chapter 10, we will shift our focus from 3d modeling to look development. In this chapter you will learn the basics of rendering, and how to use the physical material. We are also going to cover different methods of environment lighting. At the end of this chapter, we will apply what we've learned to add lighting and materials to the chair product that we modeled before in the previous chapter.\n\n\nIn chapter 11, we will focus on texturing and basic UV mapping techniques. You will learn different types of textures, from procedural textures, image textures, PBR textures, Substance textures, etc. At the end of this chapter, you will do another project. You will add material and PBR textures onto the kitchen table product that we have modeled in the earlier chapter.\n\n\nChapter 12 focuses on the nitty-gritty of UV unwrapping techniques. After learning the tools provided, we will explore different approaches to unwrap 3D objects. From the automatic method, projection method, peel seams method, and so on. In this chapter, we will have 2 projects. The first is creating a low poly barrel. And second is creating a product packaging.\n\n\nIn chapter 13, we will have the last project related to look development, which is creating a chair product called \"San Marco\". Because each part of the model is different, we will use different UV unwrapping techniques that best suit the model's part. Here is the result of the final project.\n\n\nThe outcome\n\n\nAfter completing the course, in sha Allah, you will have a solid foundation on how to use 3ds Max. You'll gain a significant amount of 3D modeling and look development skills. Not to mention you will understand a lot of important concepts around 3D computer graphics. I hope you find this course interesting and beneficial.",

It doesn’t necessarily have to occupy the “lower third” of the screen, but that's where it gets its name. They might seem trivial, but their necessity is clear when they're used poorly or missing altogether which can confuse the audience.\nWhen might be a good time to use lower thirds? If you’re filming a documentary or any other interview-type program, keeping track of all of the subjects can get confusing without lower thirds.\nIf the show, company, or film has a certain tone or aesthetic, it’s good to keep the lower third design \"on brand.\" All of the elements of the lower third should work together to add to the visuals, not distract from them.\n\nELEMENTS OF A LOWER THIRD\nTypography\nShapes and Logos\nColor\nSize and Position\nAnimation Style\n\nYou will learn from this course :\n1. How to create Lower Thirds in After Effects\n2. How to make an animation with keyframe\n3. How to use the expression for animation control\n4. How to create value and color controller\n5. How to create Text Animation in After Effects\n6. Bast to advanced use of the shape layer\n\nIn this course we'll cover :\nLower Thirds Animation\nMotion Graphics\nText animation.\nUse of shape layer\nColor controller\nValue controller\nUsing of effects\nSmooth Animation\nGraph Editor\nPie charts Animation\n\nI have work you through all the steps to create lower thirds, text animate with keyframe, use graph editor to make the animation smoother, and color and add text. I also show you to create a single layer to control everything from an infographic screen, such as color control, animation control, value control, etc.\nWhat are you waiting for?

Especially for a beginner, The problem comes when they want to arrange Topology. The famous problem is when they find a Shading issue on the model because N-GON and TRIANGLE, also when they want to control POLE position to avoid Topology Issue. The problem (Shading Issue) also comes when they want to add DETAIL for the model. Not only that, The problem also comes when they find out the face FLOW is not going in the direction they want (With knowing how to control face flow direction they can EASILY MODIFY model) .\nWith all these problems many modelers have a DREAM to avoid it and control it. With control it, they can modeling anything without thinking about the Topology issue. Also with know how to control Topology they can avoid PAINFUL TASK (Fix shading Issues, edit the model’s shape, Unwrapped UVs, rig and animate).\n\nNow if you modeler who have a DREAM to control Topology and Avoid Topology Issue, Now with this Course your DREAM will come true.\n\n\nThis course is Design for...\n- Beginners want to know how to handle Topology.\n\n- Modeler Work with SubD Modeling.\n\n- Anyone who wants to learn how to handle Topology.\n\n- Anyone who wants to learn how to create Clean Topology.\n\n- Have a Basic understanding of SubD Modeling.\n\n- Know how to use Basic 3D Model tools.\n\n- Modeling course (This course only teaches you how to achieve Clean Topology)\n\n\n\nWhen you Finish taking this Course you Should be able to\n\n- Remove Triangle and N-Gon from your Topology.\n\n- Control Edge flow (Face flow) from your Topology.\n\n- Control Pole from your Topology.\n\n- Use Bevel to handle your Topology.\n\n- Have the flexibility to add and remove Face from your Topology.\n\n\nYou'll get easy to follow step by step tutorial.

And show you how to use it in rigging and collision and give you wide idea about using gradient in different operations in Houdini also We will go in depth with matrices and learn cool techniques using the matrix: it is the “Frame of Reference” you must know this magic secret about matrix. If you have many questions about Quaternion parameter, So we will dive into this concept and answer all questions with cool projects and we will see how to create quaternion field to effect particles motion and if you don’t know what is the Vector 4, we will have cool project about using vector 4 inside the wire solver dynamics. And I will show you how it to build your own cloth simulation from scratch, this part will give wide idea about how the dynamic solvers work and what is the constraint , gravity , and how the collision is calculated ….. and many other math topics.

The only issue with Midjourney is that you can’t animate the amazing images you create…That is where this course comes in!\n\nBy utilising the additional tools and techniques within the Adobe Suite we will be able to animate the amazing AI images that Midjourney creates with a subtle yet realistic camera move. If you don’t have access to Midjourney then that is fine! I will be supplying my image for you or you can use one of the many other free ai image generators shown in the second video of this course! This course is reliant on the use of Photoshop and After Effects. You can get a free trial of Adobe photoshop and After Effects and there will be a lesson and links highlighting this.\nThe prerequisites for this course are as follows: You will need an internet connection, an email address, Photoshop and After Effects. As mentioned above you can obtain free trials of both photoshop and After Effects.\n\nCourse outline\n\n01 - Accessing course software and materials (A quick overview of the software used and the AI image generators available, both free and subscription based)\n02 - Generating our image in Midjourney – (This session will walk you through the process of creating our image. I will be using Midjourney but the skills are interchangeable with the other mentioned AI art generators)\n03 - Preparing the image in Photoshop (A key part of this process is preparing our AI image ready for animation, in this session I will walk you through that process step-by-step)\n\n04 - Animating in After Effects (This session will take you through thee process of executing the final animation of our AI image)\n\nClass Project (Assignment) – (This lesson will walk you through the class project that you have been tasked with, summarising the skills and techniques learnt in the course.)\n\nAs mentioned above in the course outline, the course will finish with a really fun assignment where you will have the opportunity to practice the skills that you have learnt in this course!

      "description": "I think animation is one of the great art forms. When people hear the word \"animation\" thoughts of great Disney animators can come to mind. This can intimidate people into thinking that animation is not possible for them to learn. I'm here to tell you that you CAN learn to animate and it is really not as hard as you might think. I made this course to try and dispel that myth because I believe anyone can learn to animate. You might say, \"But I can't draw!\" Not everyone who animates needs to know how to draw. In fact, some of the most entertaining animations I've seen are made with stick figures or bouncing balls. Let me show you the tools to get you started on making your own animations.\nWhy Rough Animator? As a professional independent animator, I have used most of the 2D animation packages over the years. Rough Animator is my personal software of choice right now. It is powerful and feature rich enough for me to accomplish professional level animated projects. Its minimalist interface makes it easy to learn and use. Are there more robust software packages available? Sure. Will Rough Animator get your project done with the same level of quality? You bet.\nThis course is for anyone that wants to get into animation. It's for someone wanting to pick up animation as a hobby. And it's for those illustrators that want to add animation as a new skill. I tried to keep the length of this course compact, so you can start animating in under two hours. The lessons are set up in a way so that you can quickly revisit a topic for a refresher using the provided \"Course Overview\" PDF.",

      "description": "If you have tried to learn blender, then you know how hard it can be. There are so many menus and buttons, panels and modes you can use that it becomes confusing and feels overwhelming. That’s why I have created this course. My name is Hunter and I am a graphic and motion designer based in Australia. I added Blender to my tool belt about three years ago because of its popularity in for 3D Illustration. But soon found Blender had some other uses like detailed product mockups.\n\n\nIn this course, we will focus on 3D illustration and getting up set up in Blender for success. By the end of this course, you will have the foundations like modelling, texturing and shading ready to tackle some more difficult projects.\n\n\n1. Introduction\nThis course kicks off with an introduction. I will get you settled into the course and run over some basic requirements for learning Blender. You will also get access to workings files to help when you get stuck.\n\n\n2. Getting Started\nChapter two will focus on the basics of Blender. We will take a look at the interface and how to navigate inside the software using shortcuts. We will also learn how to move, rotate and scale objects.\n\n\n3. Modelling Basics\nChapter three will take a look at edit mode for modelling, and we will start to model out some basic shapes like walls and windows. This chapter will also start introducing modifiers, a no destructive way of editing your models.\n\n\n4. Modelling\nChapter Four will help solidify your modelling knowledge by showing you different techniques. We will start to model different objects like a table, chair, couch, desk accessories and more. We will also take a quick look into simulation to create objects like a cushion.\n\n\n5. UVs, Textures and Shading\nChapter Five will look at adding colours and textures to your objects. We will take a look at the shader editor and make some basic materials. We will also learn how to add textures to our objects using shader nodes and different images. You will also learn how to UV unwrap objects, so you don’t get stretching in your textures.\n\n\n6. Lights, Camera, Render\nThe last chapter, Chapter 6, will complete the process with lighting, setting up the camera and rendering.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have created your own 3D render. Now Blender has a steep learning curve, and it is mainly due to how much the software has to offer. Blender is also a very keyboard shortcut-heavy software, so I have included a Keyboard shortcut cheat sheet to help you in your journey.\n\n\nI will also answer any questions throughout the course and update and add new lessons to help you understand the software.\n\n\nIf you think this course is for you, then enrol today, and join me to learn 3D Illustration in Blender.",

This course has 3 different, fun and progressively increasing in difficulty sculpts.\n\n\nWe will start with learning a bit about blender so we can navigate and have basic knowledge needed for starting to sculpt.\nSo even if you are using blender for first time you should be able to follow the course without a problem.\n\n\nNext we will start learning about sculpting tools, brushes, options which will make our sculpting easier. Then we will use everything we learned to make a simple but fun pumpkin that at the end we can carve. This way we can make learning a bit more unique and fun.\nFrom pumpkin we will jump right in to making a creature / pet / pokemon resembling character that is harder then previous sculpt but something that we can do together ! Keeping learning a bit as a challenge and staying on our toes.\n\n\nAfter beating our second sculpt we will be ready to tackle something even more difficult, our first human like character. This character is inspired by chibi style games. But when we will be done with this sculpt I will show you how you can turn it in to game ready character with a small animation.\n\n\nOn this character we will learn sculpting, retopology, seaming, UVs, texturing, rigging, weightpainting, animation.\n\n\nOf all of this sounds amazing I can't wait to see you at the course !",

      "description": "In this class, you're going to learn the basics of creating some natural parts of worlds. It's not everything you need to create a world, that would be way too long but it's a great start. You'll be using Blender, the completely free and open-source program. I know World Generation sounds intimidating but I promise you this class starts from the beginning if your just getting started. If you're not, just skip the interface lesson and jump straight to the good stuff.\nWhat's even more amazing is that this class will require almost no slow modeling. That's what I call it when you manually move vertices around. You'll be using Blender's built-in capabilities to generate unique models, scenes, and animations.\nYou're going to first learn how to create rocky terrain by learning how to create a snowy mountain range.\nThe second thing you're going to learn is how to create a cloud backdrop from scratch. You'll never have to download a background if you don't want to with this technique. You'll be able to light your scenes and create realistic surroundings with this skill. It's perfect if you've just learned how to create something like a mountain range, hint hint.\nMountains and clouds aren't the only things in worlds though, next you'll learn how to create grass, and this time you'll also learn how to animate it by making it blow in the wind.",

      "description": "With Blendshape Creation in Maya, instructor Chad Robert Morgan gives us a detailed look on how to use blendshapes, including how to create blendshapes nodes, adding new targets, and how to create targets. We highlight common pitfalls to avoid that can break your blendshapes, and tips for making your blendshape workflow more efficient and easy to edit. We will see how we can combine blendshapes with skinclusters to combine joint animation with blendshapes, as well as how to ensure the correct order of your inputs so they will work correctly.\nWe also look at an optional method using Mudbox to create blendshapes as sculpt layers and link it with Maya using OneClick. We use the Paint Blendshape Weights tool to paint out the influence of a blendshape and use it to split one target into multiple blendshapes. Learn pro tips like using wrap deformers to create mirror shapes and extra Maya tools found in Bonus Tools from Autodesk to create corrective blendshapes. See the updates from the new tools found in Maya 2016, which will allow us to create blendshapes without target meshes. Lastly, we learn how to export our blendshapes from Maya via FBX and import the blendshapes and the animation into Unreal 4.\n\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nChad Robert Morgan started his career at LucasArts where, as a newbie to the industry, was fortunate enough to work with some very talented mentors who taught him how to use Maya. Since then, Chad has been trying to pay it forward by sharing what he has learned, first by giving lectures at Autodesk Master Classes, then publishing an article in 3D World magazine, posting tutorials on YouTube, and finally teaming up with 3dmotive. Working at LucasArts, Chad worked on the games Obi-wan, Starfighter, and Gladius. Chad has also worked for ReelFX on the direct-to-dvd movie G.I. Joe – Valor vs. Venom, and then moved on to Double Helix where he worked for ten years on such titles like Strider, Killer Instinct, Front Mission : Evolved, and Silent Hill : Homecoming. Chad is currently a freelance technical artist, working with clients such as Whitemoon Dreams, as well as developing his own independent game and video titles under his own company, Spectral Ink Productions.",

Now he is currently working as an environment artist in Ubisoft. He contributed to creating AAA games such as Forza Horizon 3 and The Division 2. His all time favorite game is The Last of Us and that video game is what inspired him to want to work in the game industry. His advice for beginner artists is to focus on one aspect of gaming that they are passionate about, stick to it and get better at it. His hobbies include anything related to games or films, whether it be working on personal projects, freelance work or going out for movies.\nCourse Info\nThe purpose of this course is to show you how professional game props are created in AAA game studios.\nWe will go over in-depth on how to create a high poly and low poly asset inside Blender. We will then create the uv’s of our low poly dagger and make everything as optimal as possible so that we can go into marmoset toolbag where we will be creating texture maps for our asset. We will go through the process of baking our asset and I will show you how to fix any baking issues that might occur so you will know how to solve problems for your own future projects. After we create a wonderful clean bake, we will take our maps into substance painter where we will be creating our final texture. We will cover multiple things inside substance like creating normal map details, creating base materials and revolutionary techniques to add amazing details quickly and accurately. Once we are happy with our texture, I will show you how to create impressive image renders that you can use for your own work that can be represented in your portfolio.\nLots of people want to be successful in game asset creation but they are not willing to invest in education and make sacrifices in order to do what is necessary to hit their goals. Don’t let this be you. I know you will enjoy this course and you will learn a lot from it. Come and join me at Victory3D.",

Do custom properties, driver modifiers or the graph editors fill you dismay? Fear not, for I am here to alleviate your rigging struggles!\nRigging is the process where you take multiple animatable 'parts' of an overall object (such as a vehicle for example) into simplistic and easy to control toggles, switches or sliders. A part of this is using armatures with bones, but that’s only half the workflow. More advanced rigs can easily have tens, hundreds or even thousands of bones! An animator will have a tough time animating all those so apart of a rigging task is finding ways to make animating all those bones as easy, straight-forward and as hassle free as practically possible.\nIt is important to understand the needs and requirements for the project, because you do not want to make your rigs too simplistic, nor too complicated. Understanding what changes throughout an animated project, at what intervals and how will assist you greatly when creating rigs.\nTo introduce you to rigging, we begin the course by looking at all the basic theory and many of the tools that you have at your disposal. Because constraints are a huge part of rigging, we look at what most of them do. We also take a look at some of the theory, what armatures and drivers are, and some of the tools at your disposal. By the time you've completed this simple course, you'll be ready for a more detailed and intense rigging courses!\nAre you ready to have a go at rigging? Enrol today, and you’ll soon be up to speed!",

We'll transform your fantasies into real objects, harnessing nodes to create your future masterpieces. You'll learn to express your love for what you create with your own hands through the possibilities Houdini offers. After completing this course, you'll be able to develop a scene you've imagined, using almoust 100% procedural modeling – simplifying your creative process and reducing project time.\nSince this course is geared towards beginners, I've strived to avoid complex concepts and minimize the use of VEX code in favor of VOPs. We'll primarily work with attributes, Copy to points, Boolean, and only a small amount of simple VEX code. For rendering, we'll be using Karma CPU.\nOur focus will be on the main scene object – Thopter, but we'll also pay attention to the other elements. My goal is to immerse you in the world of Houdini using the most straightforward language possible. I've also tried to create an unconventional scene to make the learning process more engaging. By teaching you to create this scene, I aim to help you unleash your creativity and overcome any fear that the software might limit your ideas.",

Now that we have our high poly and our low poly - in this tutorial we will go over on how to properly unwrap our weapon and utilize the most space so that we have the highest resolution possible. After that we will set-up our scene ready for making in marmoset and export all our models. Then we will move to Marmoset Toolbag 3 and start by baking all our texture maps and fix any baking bugs. After that we will move into substance painter where we will set-up our scene and start adding more normal map details like screws, text etc. Once that is done and it is looking good we will create the base colors of our prop and go over on how to archive good material definition. Then we will first start working on the top of our asset, setting up color changes, edge scratches and overall dirtiness. When everything is looking good we will move the the base of our weapon which is made of an different material so we will also need to add different details to that. We will be mostly adding things like edge highlights, dirt, roughness changes and more. Finally when we are happy with our texture we will set-up a nice scene in Marmoset Toolbag 3 and present the weapon at portfolio quality.\n\n\nMore about the Instructor:\nEmiel Sleegers is a 21 years old originally from The Netherlands. He is currently located in the UK. He is a 3D environment artist working in the game industry. He's worked for companies like Playground Games and Ubisoft with so far one announced title on his name named: Forza Horizon 3, with another title on the way.

      "description": "Blender Geometry Nodes Alien Worlds – Tentacles, Terrain & Lighting Masterclass\n\nStruggling to turn Geometry Nodes into full cinematic scenes? What if you could build alien terrain, animate creatures, and master lighting—all procedurally, inside Blender?\nLet me introduce you to Josh—a fellow Blender nerd who has spent the last few years crafting surreal sci-fi landscapes, looping animations, and some of the most hypnotic renders I have seen come out of Geometry Nodes. He pushes aesthetics as much as technique. His stuff moves, glows, and breathes like it is alive—and now he has turned that entire creative process into one beast of a course.\nIn this Blender tutorial and full project-based course, Josh walks you through creating an alien world with Geometry Nodes. You will build an entire alien cave scene inside Blender 4.4, start to finish. No sculpting, no brushes—just nodes, shaders, procedural animation, and lighting wizardry that gives your scenes depth and emotion.\nWhether you are building for games, animation, Instagram reels, or just want to deepen your procedural workflow, this course is designed to walk you through each step while keeping things weird, stylized, and cinematic.\nWhat You Will Learn\nProcedural Terrain Generation – Use Geometry Nodes to carve alien ridges, caves, and layered landscapes using mesh displacements and noise fields.\nAnimated Tentacle Creation – Build fully procedural tentacles with looping motion, organic shape variation, and pulsing animation effects.\nStylized Shader Design – Create glowing, bioluminescent materials using emission, texture mapping, and layered colour gradients.\nLighting & Fog Effects – Add cinematic atmosphere with volume fog, emission-based glow, and clever use of colour contrast and depth falloff.\nRendering Workflows – Learn how to render your scenes in Cycles or Eevee, with clean, stylized results and tips for post-processing.\nCamera Animation & Motion – Set up subtle looping camera movement to give your scenes rhythm, life, and visual interest.\nHow the Course Works\nWe start with a blank scene—and build it all from the ground up.\nWhether you are looking for a stylized Blender tutorial, a Geometry Nodes course, or a Blender 4.4 project to level up your skills, this Blender geometry node course is for you. Every chapter focuses on a specific part of the pipeline: terrain, tentacles, shaders, fog, animation, and finally rendering. It is designed so that you understand why each node setup works—not just where to plug things in. You can follow along exactly or remix things as you go.\nBy the end, you will not only have a fully animated alien loop—you will have the knowledge and assets to make 10 more just like it.\nThis is not just a tutorial. It is a creative toolkit.\nIncluded Assets\nFull Blender project files\nCustom Geometry Node groups (terrain + tentacles)\nShader and lighting preset packs\nRender-ready scene with post-processing examples\nWhy This Course Stands Out\n· Let’s face it—most node tutorials either melt your brain or give you five minutes of spaghetti with no story. This is the antidote.\n· Perfect for those searching for a Blender 4.4 tutorial or wanting to create animation loops using procedural workflows.\n· Josh breaks down every part of the process with clear thinking, clean node setups, and cinematic results.\n· You will actually enjoy learning Geometry Nodes—and more importantly, you will use what you learn.\nThis course is about more than technique. It is about building something visually unforgettable—on your terms, in your style, using a toolkit that grows with you.\nWhether you want to build weird alien planets, eerie motion graphics, or animated caves with tentacles for your next music video—you will leave this course with the power to make it happen.\nUntil next time, happy modelling everyone!\nJosh – 3D Tudor",

By learning about these topics, we will be able to automate an entire scene using a single A4 page worth of code and our trusty run script button.\nWe will learn about how variables can help control the parameters in our lines of code and how we can use for loops to iterate and control all of the objects in our scene.\nWhen we have built up our confidence in using loops and variables we will challenge ourselves by creating a script that allows us to generate a city landscape. Randomizing the landscape every time the script is run.\nAs this is still classed as a beginner course we also cover some useful tips on improving your workflow as a programmer in Blender. Covering how to utilize the python interactive console as well as the online API documentation.\nWe hope that you enjoy this class on using python script in Blender.",

In this adventure, we will tell you how to model all the cars in the world, at what stages you can create a car for yourself. We will make models with and without a car. We will prepare all the Textures and materials. Next, we'll take the best light settings and the best camera angles and settings. We will make a very special scene for our model. And we will adjust the render settings for great rendering. From textures and materials to lighting, from lighting to camera settings and final rendering, you'll learn it all in this tutorial. At the end of the training, you will model and render all the cars in the world. When you complete the training from start to finish, you will have gained a great skill for yourself. You should follow every detail by seeing the lesson. This training is silent throughout. Just follow me and keep going. Don't forget to ask questions where you get stuck. Before starting the training, please note that the training is quiet and if you get stuck, you will ask me a question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout this learning...\nWe will do the modeling and rendering of the car named \"Porsche 911\", one of the luxury car brands of the world, together with you.   Do not forget to ask me questions during the process, even at the slightest point. I'm going to break up car creation into parts. We will go according to a syllabus. But I want to mention something here ; This training is a very detailed training. It is a training that can take hundreds of time. So this training will be an updated training. It will take a long time to finish. During this process, I will include the completed stages in the training. The tutorial will start from modeling and end under rendering. During this process, please do not think that the training is over when there is no video left in the training. Note that I did that part then.I'm going to break up the car tutorial into sections. Here is our curriculum;\n\n\n- Car Modelling\n- Material Making\n- Light Settings\n- Camera Settings\n- Scene Setup for Car Render from Scratch\n- Render Settings\n\n\nFirst of all, we will do very detailed model and rendering processes in this course.

      "description": "Lesson 1 - Introduction\nIn first introductory lesson, students will know a little about Blender. Some inspirations are shown to students and then they will know a little about the journey onwards. The main focus of this course is on introducing students with;\nOSM Add On and M Tree Add On of Blender\nTopographic Maps with and without real world map data\nConverting AutoCAD to Blender with multiple methods\nRendering a forest and city with and without OSM Add On\nLesson 2 - Hot Keys\n#AulaGEO Keyboard shortcuts and hot keys are one of the most important part of Blender as there are regular updates observed in Blender so with each upgrade the user interface changes a little, therefore, hot keys are a must to know in order to increase the work flow and efficiency. In lesson 2, complete details of hot keys will be shared, moreover, the PDF file is attached along with video for ease of access. #AulaGEO\nLesson 3 – Blender OSM\nTo get real world data in blender, open street map data is used. In order to get the desired data, Blender OSM add on must be installed and activated. In lesson 3, complete details of downloading and installing methods will be shared, moreover, the add on is attached along with video for ease of access.\nLesson 4 – AutoCAD to Blender Conversion\nIn lesson 4, in depth details of blender importable formats will be provided. Moreover, two methods will be taught for importing AutoCAD files to Blender. Some Add On needs to be activated in order to successfully import a few extension files.\nBLENDER MODELING\nLesson 5 – Height Maps\nHeight maps are very important when it comes to fetch real world map data in Blender. In lesson 5, students will learn how to access and download height maps from official, free and reliable sources. These height maps will be used to make 3D landscape in lesson 6 and lesson 8.\nLesson 6 – 3D Landscape using height maps\nIn lesson 6, students will learn how to create a 3D landscape using height maps accessed and downloaded in lesson 5.\nIt is a complete exercise. If a student follows this exercise completely, he will be able to create a 3D landscape including texturing, lightening and rendering techniques.\nLesson 7 – Topographic Maps (Self-Generated Landscape)\nIn lesson 7, students will learn how to create topographic maps similar to one that were shown in lesson 4 which were in AutoCAD. In this exercise, students will learn to create a topographic map based on assumed or self-generated landscape.\nLesson 8 – Topographic Maps (Real World Height Map)\nIn lesson 8, students will learn how to create topographic maps similar to one that were shown in lesson 4 which were in AutoCAD. In this exercise, students will learn to create a topographic map based real world map data using height maps accessed and downloaded in lesson 5.\nLesson 9 – Buildings Textures\nIn final project (Lesson 12), students will learn how to render a city using real world map data with the help of Blender OSM add on. An important part of city rendering is assigning building material, therefore, in this lesson, students will learn how to access and download copy right free high resolution textures that can be used for personal practice or commercial projects. Three different free as well as paid websites will be shared from where students can get the required building textures.\nBLENDER MODELING\nLesson 10 – OSM Data to Blender\nIn final project (Lesson 12), students will learn how to render a city using real world map data with the help of Blender OSM add on. It is very important for students to understand the working principal and limitations of free Blender OSM add on, therefore, in this lesson students will learn how to select real world map data and import in blender in multiple steps like Terrain, Image Overlay and 3D buildings import.\nLesson 11 – Final Project 1\nIn final project 1, students will learn how to render a forest landscape right from scratch without using any real world data or Blender OSM add on, however, students will learn how to use MTree add on and HDR environments. Furthermore, students will learn how to access a source having variety of HDR files completely free and CC0 licensed that can be used for personal practice and commercial projects.\nLesson 12 – Final Project 2\nIn final project 2, students will learn how to render a city landscape right from scratch using the real world map data using Blender OSM add on. In order to save time first all buildings will be assigned a specific material afterwards; students will learn how to add another building material to multiple buildings using duplicate methods. It will be up to students, they can duplicate same method repeatedly by adding as many more building materials as required to make scene more realistic. Concepts like rendering and HDR environment taught in final project 1 will not be repeated to save time.",

We will start by setting up  the reference plane for the in-game speed, followed by blocking all the main  poses with appealing shapes that can be read from any angle of view. From there, we will start to work with the  timing to make those poses fit on the correct frames, and progressive. We  will then add in-betweens as we continue to adjust the timing. It is going to be a progressive refining  process, and we will be moving around a lot between the animation controllers  as we refine the motion. We will also  work with some variation in speed, dynamic arcs, follow through, and how to  correct address the feeling of weight for the character. During this final polish stages, we will  begin working on the core of the body, and edit that as we begin to edit and  tweak the motion of the secondary elements. To wrap things up, we will be covering a quick trick to make the animation look  more organic by using animation layers on certain parts of the character.\n(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)\nMore about the Instructor:\nThiago is a freelance character artist an animator currently located in Paris,  France.

      "description": "Welcome to my course on Hand-Painted Texturing in Blender!\n\n\nNot all 3d artists have the 2d art skills necessary to pull off stylized hand-painted textures often seen in games and sometimes film. So I created this course to try and help bridge the gap. My hope is that upon completion of this course you have a greater understanding of how to think and utilize color and build confidence while painting. Getting good at it will still take practice, though!\n\n\nWhat this course covers:\n\n\nModeling\nThe first few sections we tackle modeling the sword. We'll keep things low poly. There is no law against going higher poly, but traditionally lower poly stuff is what gets the hand-painted look. Although, I must admit, I don't know what the reason for this is.\n\n\nUV Unwrapping\nUV Unwrapping and Editing is up next. This is usually a sore spot for 3d artists out there. It really isn't very much fun. Fortunately, with an addon (TexTools) it eases it a little. Plus lower poly stuff tends to be a bit easier to unwrap.\n\n\nPainting Fundamentals\nFor the people that have little to no experience painting there is a crash course on painting. I explain what value, hue, and saturation are, and how you use them. Then we'll finish with a painting demo to hopefully wrap it all together.\n\n\nTexture Painting\nFrom there we'll finish off painting the sword. I tried to use minimal editing, but there is some because painting can be very time consuming and I didn't want to waste your time.",

When installing the program, please kindly choose the 2020 version.\nWelcome to the Twinmotion course for interior designers. This course will teach you how to create perfect photorealistic visualizations in real time in the best rendering program.\n\n\nIf you work in programs such as Sketchup Archicad Revit 3Dmax Cinema 4D or other 3D modeling applications, you would like to present your projects in the form of photorealistic renderings or 3D VR presentations, this course will teach you not only the use of visualization tools but also the tricks used by professionals.\n\n\nMy name is Adam Kściczyk. I am an active architect, a member of the Chamber of Architects of the Republic of Poland and the Association of Polish Architects.\n\n\nIn parallel with running a design studio, for many years I have been organizing stationary training courses, workshops in the field of 3D modeling and visualization of architecture, interiors, furniture and gardens. Sharing my experience and practical knowledge gives me great satisfaction - I feel as if I am passing on secret codes that are used in computer games to acquire a new type of skills or move to the next stage.\n\n\nI understand very well what it's like to be a beginner. While studying at the Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning of the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, I started my adventure with 3D software.\n\n\nI am sure that after completing the course you will be able to successfully create excellent 3D graphics from your own designs.\n\n\nWe will be designing the interior of a small apartment. At the beginning, we will navigate in the virtual world of Twinmotion, then we will edit materials, we will arrange furniture and interior design elements. We will illuminate the scene with daylight and artificial light, set up cameras, compose and frame the image. And finally, the most important point of the program, we will render great photorealistic visualizations\n\n\nHowever, as I mentioned before, rendering in Twinmotion is generated in real time - like in computer games, therefore you will observe the changes on a regular basis\n\n\nAs an architect, I use these techniques on a daily basis. During the course, I will provide you with practical knowledge resulting from my professional experience - you will learn secret codes :)\n\n\nI am well aware that when launching the program for the first time, the multitude of functions, tools and settings can be stunning - that's why I prepared this course for people like you who are just taking their first steps in creating 3D graphics and want to learn the best visualization program.\n\n\nThank you for your interest in this course. See you at the first lecture !",

      "description": "In this Environment Creation Course you will learn the techniques behind AAA level creation for games using Unreal Engine 5. We will create an environment from scratch and step by step we will build a game ready environment.\n\n\nMany people think that level creation is just drag and dropping assets. This is why many people end up with environments that don't look good and they don't know why. After this course you will know what makes an environment look good and how you can apply the same formula to every environment you create in the future.\n\n\nThis course is different from other environment creation courses where instead of showing you how to do something I show you the why and the fundamentals behind art theory so you can learn a new skillset and apply that to any type of environment you wish to create be it in games, movies or any other form of visual art.\n\n\nBy the end of this course you will understand the art fundation that is behind the environment creation process and leave with a skillset that will help you along your whole career as a 3D artist.\n\n\nWe will create an environment in Unreal Engine 5 from scratch using free available assets to illustrate the process of creating a level in UE5. You will start by creating the blockout applying design principles and understanding how to make a good composition and how lightning the environment will affect the design from very early on.\n\n\nFrom there you will slowly start decorating the environment and apply different principles in art like color harmony, color balance, lightning, design principles and many more fundamentals.",

      "description": "Creating a metro train interior in Unreal Engine 5\nLearn how a professional environment artist works when creating interior environments for games. You’ll learn techniques like high poly modeling, using UE5 Nanite, Procedural and unique texturing, level art, Lighting and Post Effects (Using the new Lumen System), creating advertisements, and other stickers.\nMAYA, SUBSTANCE, AND UNREAL ENGINE 5\nAll the modeling will be done in Maya, However, the techniques used are universal and can be replicated in any other 3d modeling package. The materials will be created using Substance Designer and previewed in Marmoset Toolbag 4. The environment will be built in the brand-new Unreal Engine 5 and we will be using the new Nanite and Lumen systems, Adverts will be created in Photoshop and we will be using substance painter for unique textures and mask creation.\nIn this course, you will learn everything you need to know to create the results that you see in the images and trailers. Next to this, the same techniques can be applied to almost any type of environment.\n18+ HOURS!\nThis course contains over 19 hours and 50 minutes of content – You can follow along with every single step – The course does enclose a few small-time lapses, this is just to speed up very repetitive tasks, the rest is done in real-time. However, due to popular requests, we have also included the un-time lapsed footage without audio.\nWe will start by going over our reference, then we will dive right in and start by creating a blockout (to make sure all our pieces fit together), and then we will be turning this blockout into high poly models. Thanks to the new nanite system we do not have to create low poly models.\nAfter this, we will go over how to create simple but flexible procedural materials and unique textures. We will UV-Unwrap all our models and export them to UE5 in which we will set them up, create our shaders and build our level.\nWe will then move on to creating our advertisements and stickers in photoshop and apply them to our level.\nFinally, we will do the final lighting and post-effect pass on our scene and we will show you how to properly polish the scene to final.\nSKILL LEVEL\nThis game art tutorial is perfect for students who have some familiarity with a 3d Modeling tool like Maya, Substance Designer/Painter, photoshop, and Unreal Engine – Everything in this tutorial will be explained in detail. However, if you have never touched any modeling or texturing tools before we recommend that you first watch an introduction tutorial of those programs (you can find many of these for free on YouTube or paid on this very website)\nTOOLS USED\nMaya 2022\nSubstance 3D Designer and Substance 3D Painter\nPhotoshop\nUnreal Engine 5\nMarmoset Toolbag 4 (optional)\nYOUR INSTRUCTOR\nEmiel Sleegers is a senior environment artist currently working in the AAA Game Industry. He’s worked on games like The Division 2 + DLC at Ubisoft, Forza Horizon 3 at Playground Games, and as a Freelancer on multiple projects as an Environment Artist and Material Artist.\nCHAPTER SORTING\nThere’s a total of 53 videos split into easy-to-digest chapters.\nAll the videos will have logical naming and are numbered to make it easy to find exactly the ones you want to follow.\n*All videos come in 1080p with clean audio. please see the trailer for a general idea of the audio and video quality*",

      "description": "This course will teach you various techniques you can use to create 2D and 3D animations with After Effects right from the scratch. With Adobe After Effects you could easily create various Motion Graphics and Visual Effects compositions that can be used in a wide range of applications- including video editing, filmmaking, post production, animation and motion graphics. There are various software that can allow you to build such compositions, but with After effects you get a far better control over anything and everything. When you are creating an Animation, you need to constantly improvise your work and fine tune every single entity over and over again. You can control a very wide range of properties and effects very easily that you will be learning in this course. The same level of control cannot be achieved by using any web builder tool where you just drag and drop everything with very minimal control over properties and effects.\nI have made this course in very simple and easy to learn series of practical exercises, where you would be learning a range of animation techniques in significantly less time. You can also practice along with the course, and edit the provided compositions in resources. You can combine a set of compositions to build almost any kind of presentation video or animation. You can also use any image, vector and videos to create an effect. In this course you will be learning following variety of animation techniques:\nSimple 2D Animation\nPuppet Tool\n3D Lightning\nAnimated Video Opener\nAnimated Travel Map\nShape Fill Infographics\n3D Animation\nRotating Earth",

More specifically, I recorded (for now) the process of creating 6 assets from start to finish.\n\nEach lesson lasts on average about 30 minutes and shows the entire process of creating individual assets, from modeling, texturing, unwrapping... so the tutorial is suitable for beginners as well.\n\n\nSo, in this tutorial I will show you how to create an asset package that you can later save in asst browser or for example sell on BlenderMarket or another platform.\n\nAll objects are modeled and textured from real photos to look as realistic as possible, and in the tutorial I will show you how to create multiple shaders from a single photo to get as much detail as possible.\n\nIn addition to texturing, of course, we will talk a lot about modeling.\nI will show you how to quickly model using shortcut keys and modifiers in Blender and much more.\n\n\nWith the tutorial you also get all the resources needed to follow the tutorial as well as the Industrial Decoration Asset package.",

I am sorry for this guys and grateful for your understanding***\n\n\nThis is a complete and extensive step by step demonstration course that will show you all steps involved in creating, rigging and animating a character in blender from start to finish. After this course, you would have learnt valuable workflows which will help improve your productivity in blender.\nTopics covered include:\n1. Modelling a character in blender\nHere, we will setup the reference image and model everything from the head and the hands to the trousers and the shoes.\n\n\n2. Creating an advanced character rig in blender\nAt this stage, we will create the deformation bones, forward kinematic bones and inverse kinematic bones. we will also rig the eyes, create shape keys and set up drivers for shape keys, create custom bone shapes, create controllers and add a user interface for the controllers.\n\n\n3. Texturing a character in blender\nHere, we will be adding seams, UV unwrapping our model and texturing it. We will be sculpting and baking normal maps, creating specular and bump map, adding subsurface scattering and rigging normal maps.\n\n\n4. Creating particle hair in blender\nWe will texture the scalp of our hair and then use blenders powerful particle system to make the hair and beard of our character.\n\n\n5. Making a pose library\nWe will create an animators best friend which is a pose library to make our rigging life a lot easier.\n\n\n6. Animation in blender\nIn the climax of this course we will be animating our character. we will do some weight painting after which we setup our audio and add markers for our vowels and consonants. we will do lip syncing, create the general motion of our character and then we will render our animation. We will also light up our model.\nThis course will help you hone your blending skills and i hope you enjoy it.",

Starting with setting up our scene properly and blocking out our geometry. Then, step by step, we will start adding more details so our model is appealing to the viewers eye.\nShading is the most important part as soon as it comes to photorealism, this is going to be the most difficult part, but as everything in life, practice and time makes the dream work! So we are going to take a deep look into surface imperfections, procedural shading and displacement maps.\nLast but not least we start working with different render layers. This is the most important part if you want to get into compositing or get the best out of your renders - it is going to take your images to the next level!\nOnce you mastered modelling, shading and compositing you will be able to create stunning images and animations!\nDon't hesitate to ask questions, everybody needs help from time to time and I'm always there to help you out!",

      "description": "Welcome to one of the most complete and inspiring Blender courses ever created — “Tesla Cybertruck: From Start to Finish.”\n\n\nMy name is Marwan Hussein, and I’m a 3D artist with over 15 years of experience in the 3D field. I’ve always loved creating cars — there’s something exciting and deeply satisfying about bringing such powerful machines to life in Blender. Over the years, I’ve shared my passion with thousands of students around the world who wanted to take their 3D skills to a professional level.\n\n\nIn this course, I decided to recreate the Tesla Cybertruck — one of the most futuristic and unique vehicle designs in history. Its bold shape, sharp edges, and industrial character make it a true challenge, and that’s exactly why it’s the perfect project for learning Blender in depth.\n\n\nWe’ll start completely from scratch, setting up reference images and preparing the project. Then, you’ll dive deep into the modeling section, which forms the core of the course. This part is rich, detailed, and challenging — but incredibly rewarding. You’ll learn powerful new modeling techniques to speed up your workflow, solve surface shading problems, and achieve clean, complex geometry with confidence. You’ll also discover time-saving shortcuts, creative uses of modifiers, and professional tips that will make your modeling more efficient and precise than ever before.\n\n\nOnce the modeling is done, we’ll move to rigging, one of my favorite parts of the process. You’ll learn how to bring the truck to life — rigging the front and rear tires, setting up realistic suspension behavior, and adding a functional back-door mechanism. We’ll also customize bone shapes and constraints so the rig stays clean, clear, and ready for animation. You’ll gain the knowledge to animate the truck yourself or hand it off seamlessly to any animator.\n\n\nThen comes the materials section, where we’ll dive into the Shader Editor to create all the materials from scratch — car paint, glass, plastic, lights, and metal. You’ll learn to build realistic surfaces that react beautifully to lighting, making your final render stand out.\n\n\nWhen it’s time to render, we’ll explore both Cycles and Eevee. You’ll learn to create two professional-quality environments for your truck, set up lighting, and produce stunning cinematic renders. You’ll also master post-processing inside the Compositor to give your scene that final polish and realism that separates professionals from beginners.\n\n\nEvery section of this course is carefully structured to guide you step-by-step, ensuring you understand not just how to do something, but why it works.

      "description": "Do you find it challenging to sculpt believable creature, intricate details, and dynamic poses in ZBrush? This course will equip you with the skills to overcome these obstacles and create stunning creature designs.\n\nAbout Me:\nMy name is Mahdi Khouei, and I have been a 3D character artist for a decade now. I have worked in VFX and the game industry, as well as 3D printing. Currently, I’m working as a freelance 3D character artist.\n\n\nBy the End Of This Course, You Will Be Able To:\nSculpt highly detailed and believable creature anatomy in ZBrush.\nCreate dynamic and engaging creature poses for compelling storytelling.\nPresent your creature in cinematic quality renders using Marmoset Toolbag.\n\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\nSculpting Detailed Creature\nSculpting Leather Details\nSculpting Hair for Characters\nSculpting Detailed Metal Armor\nCreating Dynamic Character Poses\nCharacter Rendering and Presentation\n\nCourse Project Overview:\nIn this course, we will begin with a base mesh and sculpt the creature's overall form. We will then block out the creature's assets and any cloth elements. Following this, we will refine the design, making minor concept adjustments as needed, and proceed to develop the high-poly sculpt. After establishing the high-poly, we will refine the creature's body proportions and anatomy, and add detailed skin features. Finally, we will pose the character, decimate the mesh for optimization, and conclude by setting up lighting and creating a final render presentation.\n\n\nWho is This Course For?\nThis course is designed for intermediate 3D artists and character artists. Specifically, it will benefit those who want to improve their sculpting skills and learn character modeling.\n\n\nWho is Not The Ideal Student For This Course?\nThis course is not designed for absolute Zbrush beginners.\n\nWhat Are The Requirements Or Prerequisites For Taking This Course?\nA basic understanding of the ZBrush interface and sculpting tools is required. You should be comfortable with navigation, basic brushes, and basic sculpting techniques.\nFamiliarity with fundamental anatomy principles is recommended. This includes knowledge of basic skeletal structure and major muscle groups.\na basic understanding of Marmoset Toolbag is helpful for the rendering and presentation section of the course.\n\n\nJoin Me Now:\nIf you've always wanted to create stunning creatures in ZBrush but felt unsure where to start, this course provides the guidance and techniques you need. Take the leap and invest in your creative potential – you won't regret it!",

      "description": "Welcome to Creating 3D Animations, Game Asset & Avatar Chatbot with AI course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to create captivating 3D models using advanced AI technologies. This course will give you a whole new perspective about the future of 3D modeling and game design. You will be fascinated by how far artificial intelligence has advanced in the past couple of years to the point where you can write a simple text prompt to produce high quality 3D models and even more exciting you can also animate those 3D models using AI. In the introduction session, you will learn about AI applications in 3D animations and understand how it can help 3D animators to automate the process of creating and animating 3D models. Then, we are going to start the project section. Firstly, you will learn to create 3D models from text using several AI tools like Tripo AI, Avaturn, Luma AI, Sloyd AI, and MasterPiece X. The process will be very simple, all you need to do is to write the prompt describing how the 3D model should look like, then in less than a minute AI will generate the 3D model. In the next section, you will learn to convert 2D images to hyper realistic 3D models using AI tools like Meshy AI, Alpha 3D, Leia Pix. Afterward, in the third project section, you will learn to animate 3D models using several AI tools like Anything World, Krikey AI, and Charmed AI. After that, you will also learn to create 3D game assets using several AI tools like Layer AI, Scenario, and Game Generator. Meanwhile, in the fifth section, you will perform motion capture using Deep Motion. Then, you will also learn to build virtual reality using Skybox AI. In the last section, you will build a 3D avatar chatbot that has the capability of talking to your web visitor. Then, you will also integrate the 3D avatar chatbot to your website. Can you imagine, you are able to add a super realistic 3D digital human avatar to answer questions from your customers on your website. Well, this is definitely much better compared to regular chatbots that communicate through text messaging systems. At the end of the course, we are going to talk about several important aspects that we need to pay close attention to when creating 3D animations using AI, such as realistic physics and dynamics, cross platform integration, file format compatibility, and context alignment.\nFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we utilize generative AI for creating 3D animations? Well there are many reasons why and let me answer it from the perspective of 3D animators and game designers, firstly, finding new ideas and design inspirations can be very time consuming. In addition to that, the process of transforming those ideas into 3D models can be quite challenging. Generative AI can help you to automate and speed up the process without reducing the quality of the 3D models. Can you imagine how long it will take you to do 3D modeling, sculpting, rigging, and adding animation to the 3D models? Well, that process is going to take a while. Therefore, outsourcing some part of the work to AI will certainly be a good idea and it will help you to be more productive.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn about AI applications in 3D animations and game assets creation\nLearn how to create 3D models using Luma AI, Tripo AI, Sloyd AI, and MasterPiece X\nLearn how to transform yourself into 3D avatar using Ready Player Me and Avaturn\nLearn how to convert 2D image to 3D model using Meshy AI and Alpha 3D\nLearn how to convert 2D image to 3D animation using Leia Pix\nLearn how to animate 3D models using MasterPiece X, Charmed AI, and Anything World\nLearn how to create 3D animation video using Krikey AI\nLearn how to create cartoon animation with Leonardo AI & Hailuo AI\nLearn how to create game assets with Layer AI, Scenario, and Game Generator\nLearn how to perform motion capture using Deep Motion\nLearn how to build virtual reality using Skybox AI\nLearn how to build 3D avatar chatbot using Chattier and integrate the chatbot to website",
