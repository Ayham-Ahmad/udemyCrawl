      "description": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\nFor example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the results to identify cats in other images. They do this without any prior knowledge about cats, e.g., that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. Instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the learning material that they process.\nAn ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.\nIn common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called 'edges'. Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. ANNs have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\nIn this Course you learn multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network by using Scikit learn & Keras  libraries and Python.You learn how to classify datasets by MLP Classifier to find the correct classes for them. Next you go further. You will learn how to forecast time series model by using neural network in Keras  environment.\n\nIn the first section you learn how to use python and sklearn MLPclassifier to forecast output of different datasets.\n\nLogic Gates\nVehicles Datasets\nGenerated Datasets\nIn second section you can forecast output of different datasets using Keras library\nRandom datasets\nForecast International Airline passengers\nLos Angeles temperature forecasting\n___________________________________________________________________________\nImportant information before you enroll:\nIn case you find the course useless for your career, don't forget you are covered by a 30 day money back guarantee, full refund, no questions asked!\nOnce enrolled, you have unlimited, lifetime access to the course!\nYou will have instant and free access to any updates I'll add to the course.\nYou will give you my full support regarding any issues or suggestions related to the course.\nCheck out the curriculum and FREE PREVIEW lectures for a quick insight.\n___________________________________________________________________________\nIt's time to take Action!\nClick the \"Take This Course\" button at the top right now!\n...Don't waste time!

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Deep Learning for AI: Build, Train & Deploy Neural Networks course by Uplatz.\n\n\nDeep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that focuses on using multi-layered artificial neural networks to automatically learn complex patterns and representations from data. Deep learning enables computers to learn and make intelligent decisions by automatically discovering the representations needed for tasks such as classification, prediction, and more—all by processing data through layers of artificial neurons.\nDeep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on using artificial neural networks with many layers (hence “deep”) to learn complex patterns directly from data. It has revolutionized how we approach problems in image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more. Below is an overview covering how deep learning works, its key features, the tools and technologies used, its benefits, and the career opportunities it presents.\n\n\nSome of its key features are:\n\n\nNeural Networks at its Core\nDeep learning models are built on neural networks that consist of multiple layers (hence \"deep\") of interconnected nodes or neurons. These layers process input data step-by-step, each extracting increasingly abstract features.\nLearning Hierarchies of Features\nThe initial layers might capture simple patterns (like edges in an image), while deeper layers build on these to recognize more complex patterns (like shapes or even specific objects).\nAutomatic Feature Extraction\nUnlike traditional machine learning, where features are manually engineered, deep learning models learn to extract and combine features directly from raw data, which is particularly useful when dealing with large and unstructured datasets.\nApplications\nThis approach is highly effective in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other domains, often achieving state-of-the-art results.\n\n\nHow Deep Learning Works\nNeural Network Architecture\nDeep learning models are built on neural networks that consist of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer.\nInput Layer: Receives raw data (e.g., images, text, audio).\nHidden Layers: Each layer extracts and transforms features; early layers might learn simple features (edges, colors), while later layers learn more abstract concepts (objects, sentiments).\nOutput Layer: Produces the final prediction or classification.\nLearning Process\nForward Propagation: Data is passed through the network layer-by-layer where each neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs, adds a bias, and applies a non-linear activation function.\nLoss Function: The model’s output is compared to the true value using a loss (or cost) function, quantifying the error.\nBackpropagation: The error is propagated backward through the network to update the weights using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent.\nIteration: This process is repeated (across many epochs) until the model’s predictions improve and the loss is minimized.\nActivation Functions\nNon-linear functions (like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh) enable the network to learn complex, non-linear relationships in data.\n\n\nKey Features of Deep Learning\nHierarchical Feature Learning\nAutomatically learns multiple levels of representation, from low-level features to high-level concepts, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.\nEnd-to-End Learning\nDeep learning models can be trained directly on raw data, processing and learning all necessary features in one integrated process.\nScalability\nThey perform exceptionally well when provided with large amounts of data, and their performance generally improves as more data is available.\nAdaptability\nCapable of handling a wide range of data types including images, text, and audio, making them versatile for various applications.\nRobustness to Noise\nWith proper training and architectures, deep learning models can be resilient to noisy or incomplete data.\n\n\nTools and Technologies used in Deep Learning\n\n\nProgramming Languages\nPython: The dominant language due to its simplicity and extensive ecosystem of libraries.\nOther languages like R and Julia are also used in certain cases.\n\n\nFrameworks and Libraries\nTensorFlow: Developed by Google, it offers flexibility and scalability for both research and production.\nPyTorch: Developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab, it is favored for its dynamic computational graph and ease of use in research.\nKeras: A high-level API that can run on top of TensorFlow or Theano, simplifying model building.\nCaffe, MXNet, Theano: Other frameworks that have been popular in various contexts.\n\n\nSupporting Libraries\nNumPy and Pandas: For numerical operations and data manipulation.\nMatplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.\n\n\nHardware Accelerators\nGPUs (Graphics Processing Units): Essential for handling the large-scale computations required by deep learning.\nTPUs (Tensor Processing Units): Specialized hardware by Google for accelerating deep learning workloads.\n\n\nCloud Platforms\nServices such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure provide scalable resources and managed services for deep learning tasks.\n\n\nBenefits of Deep Learning\n\n\nState-of-the-Art Performance\nDeep learning models have achieved superior performance in tasks like image classification, object detection, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\nReduction in Manual Feature Engineering\nThe automatic feature extraction process minimizes the need for domain expertise in feature selection.\nVersatility Across Domains\nApplicable in numerous fields such as healthcare (e.g., medical imaging analysis), autonomous vehicles, finance (e.g., fraud detection), and entertainment (e.g., recommendation systems).\nContinuous Improvement\nWith access to more data and advanced hardware, deep learning models can be continuously improved to achieve better accuracy and efficiency.\nInnovation Driver\nDeep learning is at the heart of many cutting-edge technologies and has spurred breakthroughs in various industries, driving innovation and new product development.\nDeep learning stands at the forefront of artificial intelligence, offering powerful tools for solving complex problems by automatically learning rich feature representations from large datasets. Its unique ability to handle diverse data types and perform end-to-end learning has led to groundbreaking applications across many sectors. For those interested in technology and innovation, mastering deep learning not only opens up diverse career opportunities but also provides a pathway to contribute to the next wave of AI advancements.\nWhether you are looking to work as a deep learning engineer, data scientist, or AI researcher, the skills and knowledge gained in deep learning can set you apart in a competitive job market and empower you to develop transformative solutions across various industries.\n\n\nDeep Learning - Course Curriculum\n\n\nModule 1: Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks\n• Introduction to Deep Learning Concepts\n– Why Deep Learning?\n– Key areas and future scope\n• Basics of Neural Networks\n– Neurons, layers, and weights\n– Activation functions\n• Understanding Neural Network Operations\n– Forward Propagation\n– Backward Propagation\n• Activation Functions\n– ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh\n– Impact on model learning\n• Optimization Fundamentals\n– Loss functions\n– Gradient Descent\n• Vanishing Gradient Problem\n– Vanishing vs. Exploding Gradient\n– Solutions overview\n• Introduction to Deep Learning Frameworks\n– Keras, TensorFlow basics\n– Installation and setup\n\n\nModule 2: Building and Training Neural Networks with Keras\n• Creating a Keras Model\n– Model setup and layers\n– Sequential API basics\n• Compiling and Fitting Models\n– Specifying loss functions and optimizers\n– Model fitting and epochs\n• Building a Simple ANN in Keras\n– ANN structure\n– Training process\n• Understanding Model Accuracy Metrics\n– Accuracy vs. Precision\n– Loss functions review\n• Multi-layer Neural Networks\n– Adding layers\n– Model capacity basics\n• Using Keras for Regression Models\n– Model creation\n– Regression use cases\n• Using Keras for Classification Models\n– Setting up classification models\n– Evaluation metrics for classification\n\n\nModule 3: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n• Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks\n– Image processing basics\n– CNN layers overview\n• Building a CNN Model\n– Convolutional layers\n– Pooling and activation functions\n• Training and Testing CNN Models\n– Model fitting and validation\n– Evaluating CNN performance\n• Regularization in CNNs\n– Dropout\n– Preventing overfitting\n• Transfer Learning Concepts\n– Basics of transfer learning\n– Popular pre-trained models\n• Image Classification Project\n– Preparing datasets\n– Training and evaluating\n• Fine-Tuning CNN Models\n– Hyperparameter tuning\n– Model validation techniques\n\n\nModule 4: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n• Introduction to RNNs\n– Sequential data processing\n– RNN structure\n• Types of RNNs: LSTM and GRU\n– When to use LSTM vs. GRU\n– Applications\n• Building a Basic RNN Model\n– Simple RNN structure\n– Hands-on coding\n• Time Series Forecasting with RNN\n– Preprocessing time series data\n– Training and evaluating\n• Using LSTM for Text Generation\n– Text preprocessing\n– Training with sequential data\n• Sentiment Analysis Project\n– Data collection and processing\n– Model evaluation\n• Fine-Tuning RNN Models\n– Early stopping and validation\n– Regularization techniques\n\n\nModule 5: Advanced Deep Learning Concepts and NLP\n• Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing\n– Text processing basics\n– Word embeddings\n• Tokenization and Word Embeddings\n– Tokenization methods\n– Word2Vec and GloVe\n• Building a Text Classification Model\n– Sequential data preparation\n– Training the model\n• Transformer Networks in NLP\n– Self-attention mechanism\n– Use cases for Transformers\n• Building a Transformer-based NLP Model\n– Model setup and training\n– Text classification example\n• Evaluating NLP Models\n– Accuracy and F1 Score\n– Confusion matrix for text data\n• Fine-Tuning NLP Models\n– Transfer learning for NLP\n– Regularization techniques\n\n\nModule 6: Model Deployment and Use Cases\n• Introduction to Model Deployment\n– Deployment options\n– Docker and cloud platforms overview\n• Using TensorFlow for Deployment\n– Setting up TensorFlow Serving\n– Making predictions on a deployed model\n• Exploring Deep Learning Libraries: PyTorch vs. TensorFlow\n– TensorFlow features\n– PyTorch basics\n• Building Models in PyTorch\n– Building neural networks\n– Training in PyTorch\n• Deploying on Cloud Platforms\n– Setting up cloud environments\n– Model deployment steps\n• Real-world Deep Learning Use Cases\n– Applications in healthcare, finance, and IoT\n– Case studies\n• Advanced Model Tuning Techniques\n– Hyperparameter tuning\n– Cross-validation\n• Scaling Deep Learning Models\n– Distributed training\n– Data parallelism\n• Final Deep Learning Project\n– End-to-end project involving data preprocessing, training, and evaluation\n– Project planning and execution\n• Review and Next Steps\n– Summary of key concepts\n– Further resources",

      "description": "Welcome to Building Fire & Smoke Detection with OpenCV course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a fire and smoke detection system using OpenCV, Keras, and convolutional neural networks. The detection system will also be equipped with an alarm that will ring whenever fire or smoke is detected. This course is a perfect combination between object detection and computer vision, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills by building projects with real world applications. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of a fire and smoke detection system, such as getting to know its use cases, technologies that will be used, and some technical challenges. Then, in the next session, you will learn how fire and smoke detection systems work. This section will cover data collection, preprocessing, model training, model deployment, and fire or smoke detection. Before starting the project, we will download fire and smoke datasets from Kaggle, the data will contain hundreds or even thousands of images where fire or smoke present, we will use those data to train our detection model. Once everything is ready, we will enter the project section. In the first section, you will be guided step by step on how to build a fire detection system using OpenCV and Keras. Then, in the second project section, you will build a smoke detection system using OpenCV and convolutional neural networks. Once those detection systems have been built, we will also create a notification system to alert people whenever fire or smoke is detected, to make it even more complete, we will integrate an alarm system that will go off as soon as fire or smoke is detected. Even more exciting, we will use a text to speech library to create customized sound for the alarm. Finally, at the end of the course, we will be conducting testing on the fire and smoke detection system. There will be two testing objectives that we will be mainly focusing on, those are performance testing where we will evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the fire and smoke detection system under different conditions and alarm testing where we will assess the reliability and effectiveness of the alarm system in promptly alerting users to potential fire or smoke incidents.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build a fire and smoke detection system? Well, here is my answer: Fire and smoke detection systems are critical for safeguarding lives and property, as they provide early warnings of potential hazards, allowing for timely evacuation and intervention. Additionally, these systems can help mitigate the devastating effects of fires by enabling prompt response and containment measures. Moreover, in environments where human monitoring is impractical or hazardous, such as industrial facilities or remote areas, automated fire and smoke detection systems are indispensable for ensuring safety and security. Furthermore, by developing our own fire and smoke detection system, we gain valuable insights into the underlying principles of computer vision and machine learning, empowering us to tackle a wide range of real-world challenges in this field.\nBelow are things that we can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of fire and smoke detection system, such as getting to know its use cases, technical limitations, and technologies that will be used\nLearn how fire and smoke detection systems work.

Throughout my entire career, I use data to do analysis, build models and solve key business problems.\nWhen I learn online, I often ran into two issues:\nThe course offers in-depth knowledge, but it doesn't have very broad coverage. In reality, we don't need to be experts for everything. But it will give us a huge advantage if we know the basics for a lot of things.\nThe course focuses too much on the technical side. I find a lot of the courses focus entirely on either coding like how to write python codes, or stats like the math behind different kinds of ML models. And there are very few courses that link data analysis, modeling and coding together to solve real world problems.\nIn this course, I want to fulfill these gaps by offering a very broad coverage of data science, statistics, modeling and coding, and using case studies to connect data, coding, and stats together. That’s exactly what we do in the real world, in our day to day work. The best talents I observe in Paypal, Google and Chime are the ones who are really good at connecting these dots together to solve complicated problems.\n\n\nAt the end of this course, we will go through two major projects together with different focus areas. We will apply the knowledge we learned before (statistics, analytics, SQL, Python and modeling) to solve these two cases. The details of these two cases are shown below:\nNashville housing analysis\nTLDR: Nashville housing is booming, we have some data about the house prices, house details and seller information. How can we use these to perform analysis and give business advice?\nFocus Area: Analytics and SQL\nSubscription business model analysis\nTLDR: We launched the subscription service 2 years ago. As the VP of analytics, we want to provide an update to our CEO including the business performance, where the opportunities and next step suggestions. We will use data to support our story.\nFocus Area: Analytics, Modeling, Python and SQL\n\n\nI hope this course can help set you ready for your future success.

      "description": "Welcome to Building Agentic AI and Autonomous Agent with Python & Groq course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn how to build cutting edge AI agents that are fully autonomous and able to make their own decisions without being directed by humans. This course is a perfect combination between Python and AI agents, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in system automation. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of agentic AI, such as getting to know its use cases, its workflow, and the difference between regular AI and agentic AI. Then, in the next section, you will learn about the basic concepts of prompt engineering and context engineering, specifically you will learn how to design effective prompts, structure context, and guide your AI agents toward producing accurate results. Afterwards, we will start the project. Firstly we are going to build AI research assistants and report generator agents using Groq and Llama. This will be a truly agentic system, it will use the ReAct framework, meaning it will think step by step, perform reasoning, take actions autonomously, and reflect before the next move. It will also be able to perform real time web searches using Exa, gather insights, and generate professional reports without being told exactly what steps to take. Then, in the second project, we are going to build AI procurements & risk control agents using Openrouter and DeepSeek. This will include multi agent autonomous collaboration. A Procurement Manager Agent will create a procurement plan, and then a Risk Analyst Agent will autonomously review the plan. These two agents will interact, debate, and refine the plan together without human intervention, ensuring both cost effectiveness and risk mitigation. Following that, in the third project, we are going to build AI business proposals negotiator agents using Mistral AI and Mailjet. This agent will consist of three fully autonomous agents, a legal agent, a benchmark agent, and a negotiation agent. They will review proposals, benchmark against competitors, and negotiate terms. The Negotiation Agent will also send counter offer emails autonomously using Mailjet. In the fourth project, we are going to build an AI pricing optimization agent using Groq and Gemma. This AI agent will help us to autonomously discover and optimize product prices. Firstly, it will perform a web search to gather market price ranges. Then, two autonomous agents will debate, one will argue for setting a higher price, while the other will argue for a lower price. They will continue their discussion until they reach an optimal price agreement and all of these happen without human direction. Lastly, at the end of the course, for the fifth project, we are going to build an AI hiring and talent management agent using Gemini and Mailjet. This agent will act as a fully autonomous HR manager. It will generate job descriptions, analyze submitted resumes, and rank candidates. In addition, the agent will also send invitation emails via Mailjet, draft technical interview questions, and even schedule and send meeting links.\nFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we build autonomous AI agents? Well, here is my answer, autonomous AI agents can help us to automate repetitive tasks, reducing the need for constant human involvement. They also help to enhance efficiency and productivity by performing complex workflows and ensuring tasks are completed on time.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of agentic AI, such as getting to know its use cases, how it works, and the difference between regular AI and agentic AI\nLearn how to build AI research assistant and report generator agent using Groq and Llama\nLearn how to build AI procurement and risk control agent using Open Router and DeepSeek\nLearn how to build AI business proposal negotiator agent using Mistral and Mailjet\nLearn how to build AI pricing optimization agent using Groq and Gemma\nLearn how to build AI hiring and talent management agent using Gemini and Mailjet\nLearn about prompt engineering and context engineering\nLearn how to create function to interact with Llama and set up Groq API\nLearn how to design and implement ReAct prompting\nLearn how to create function to generate research report\nLearn how to create function to interact with DeepSeek and set up Open Router API\nLearn how to build AI procurement manager agent and AI risk analyst agent\nLearn how to create functions to send email and extract text from PDF\nLearn how to create functions to interact with Mistral AI\nLearn how to create AI legal agent, AI benchmark agent, and AI negotiation agent\nLearn how to create functions to perform web search and interact with LLM\nLearn how to create multi agent system using Groq and Gemma\nLearn how to create AI agents capable of automatically generating job description and meeting link\nLearn how to create AI agents capable of analyzing resumes, writing technical interview questions, and drafting email\nLearn how to create autonomous HR manager agent",

        "No programming experience required. Just be enthusiastic about Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Deep Learning"
      ],
      "description": "Hi There!\n\n\nHello and welcome to my new course Deep Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). This course is divided into two halves. In the first half we will deal with Deep Learning and Neural Networks and in the second half on top of that, we will continue with Generative Adversarial Networks or GAN or we can call it as 'gan'. So lets see what are the topics that are included in each module. At first, the Deep Learning one..\n\n\nAs you already know the artificial intelligence domain is divided broadly into deep learning and machine learning. In-fact deep learning is machine learning itself but Deep learning with its deep neural networks and algorithms try to learn high-level features from data without human intervention. That makes deep learning the base of all future self intelligent systems.\n\n\nI am starting from the very basic things to learn like learning the programming language basics and other supporting libraries at first and proceed with the core topic.\n\n\nLet's see what are the interesting topics included in this course. At first we will have an introductory theory session about Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Artificial Neurons based Deep Learning and Neural Networks.\n\n\nAfter that, we are ready to proceed with preparing our computer for python coding by downloading and installing the anaconda package and will check and see if everything is installed fine. We will be using the browser based IDE called Jupyter notebook for our further coding exercises.\n\n\nI know some of you may not be coming from a python based programming background. The next few sessions and examples will help you get the basic python programming skill to proceed with the sessions included in this course. The topics include Python assignment, flow-control, functions List and Tuples, Dictionaries, Functions etc.\n\n\nThen we will start with learning the basics of the Python Numpy library which is used to adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of classes and functions. Then we will learn the basics of matplotlib library which is a plotting library for Python for corresponding numerical expressions in NumPy. And finally the pandas library which is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.\n\n\nAfter the basics, we will then install the deep learning libraries theano, tensorflow and the API for dealing with these called as Keras. We will be writing all our future codes in keras.\n\n\nThen before we jump into deep learning, we will have an elaborate theory session about the basic Basic Structure of an Artificial Neuron and how they are combined to form an artificial Neural Network. Then we will see what exactly is an activation function, different types of most popular activation functions and the different scenarios we have to use each of them.\n\n\nAfter that we will see about the loss function, the different types of popular loss functions and the different scenarios we have to use each of them.\n\n\nLike the Activation and loss functions, we have optimizers which will optimize the neural network based on the training feedback. We will also see the details about most popular optimizers and how to decide in which scenarios we have to use each of them.\n\n\nThen finally we will discuss about the most popular deep learning neural network types and their basic structure and use cases.\n\n\nFurther the course is divided into exactly two halves. The first half is about creating deep learning multi-layer neural network models for text based dataset and the second half about creating convolutional neural networks for image based dataset.\n\n\nIn Text based simple feed forward multi-layer neural network model we will start with a regression model to predict house prices of King County USA. The first step will be to Fetch and Load Dataset from the kaggle website into our program.\n\n\nThen as the second step, we will do an EDA or an Exploratory Data Analysis of the loaded data and we will then prepare the data for giving it into our deep learning model. Then we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model.\n\n\nOnce we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib.\n\n\nFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction of the king county real estate price using our deep learning model and evaluate the results.\n\n\nThat was a text based regression model. Now we will proceed with a text based binary classification model. We will be using a derived version of Heart Disease Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our aim is to predict if a person will be having heart disease or not from the learning achieved from this dataset. The same steps repeat here also.\n\n\nThe first step will be to Fetch and Load Dataset into our program.\n\n\nThen as the second step, we will do an EDA or an Exploratory Data Analysis of the loaded data and we will then prepare the data for giving it into our deep learning model. Then we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model.\n\n\nOnce we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib.\n\n\nFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction for heart disease using our deep learning model and evaluate the results.\n\n\nAfter the text based binary classification model. Now we will proceed with a text based multi class classification model. We will be using the Red Wine Quality Data Set from the kaggle website. Our aim is to predict the multiple categories in which a redwine sample can be placed from the learning achieved from this dataset. The same steps repeat here also.\n\n\nThe first step will be to Fetch and Load Dataset into our program.\n\n\nThen as the second step, we will do an EDA or an Exploratory Data Analysis of the loaded data and we will then prepare the data for giving it into our deep learning model. Then we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model.\n\n\nOnce we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib.\n\n\nFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction for wine quality with a new set of data and then evaluate the categorical results.\n\n\nWe may be spending much time, resources and efforts to train a deep learning model. We will learn about the techniques to save an already trained model. This process is called serialization. We will at first serialize a model. Then later load it in another program and do the prediction without having to repeat the training.\n\n\nThat was about text based data. We will now proceed with image based data. In the preliminary session we will have an introduction to Digital Image Basics in which we learn about the composition and structure of a digital image.\n\n\nThen we will learn about Basic Image Processing using Keras Functions. There are many classes and functions that help with pre processing an image in the Keras library api. We will learn about the most popular and useful functions one by one.\n\n\nAnother important and useful image processing function in keras is Image Augmentation in which slightly different versions of images are automatically created during training. We will learn about single image augmentation, augmentation of images within a directory structure and also data frame image augmentation.\n\n\nThen another theory session about the basics of a Convolutional neural network or CNN. We will learn how the basic CNN layers like convolution layer, the pooling layer and the fully connected layer works.\n\n\nThere are concepts like Stride Padding and Flattening in convolution for image processing. We will learn them also one by one.\n\n\nNow we are all set to start with our CNN Model. We will be designing a model that can classify 5 different types of flowers if provided with an image of a flower in any of these categories. We will be at first downloading the dataset from the kaggle website. Then the first step will be to Fetch and Load this Dataset from our computer into our program.\n\n\nThen as the second step, we have to split this dataset manually for training and then later testing the model. We will arrange them into training and testing folders with each class labelled in separate folders.\n\n\nThen we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model. Once we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib.\n\n\nFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction for five different types of flowers with a new set of image data and then evaluate the categorical results.\n\n\nThere are many techniques which we can use to improve the quality of a model. Especially an image based model. The most popular techniques are doing dropout regularization of the model.\n\n\nThe next technique is doing the optimization and adjustment of the padding and also the filters in the convolution layers.\n\n\nAnd finally optimization using image augmentation. We will tweak different augmentation options in this session.\n\n\nDoing these optimization techniques manually one by one and comparing results is a very tedious task. So we will be using a technique called Hyper parameter tuning in which the keras library itself will switch different optimization techniques that we specify and will report and compare the results without we having to interfere in it.\n\n\nEven though these techniques and creation of a model from the scratch is fun. Its very time consuming and may take ages if you are planning to design a large model. In this situation a technique called transfer learning can help us.\n\n\nWe will take the world renounced, state of the art, most popular pre-trained deep learning models designed by experts and we will transfer the learning into our model so that we can make use of the architecture of that model into our custom model that we are building.\n\n\nThe popular state of the art model architectures that we are going to use are the VGG16, VGG19 designed by deep learning experts from the University of Oxford and also ResNet50 created in  ImageNet challenge to address the vanishing gradient problem.\n\n\nWe will at first download these models using keras and will try simple predictions using these pre-trained models. Later we will try the network training for our flower dataset itself using the VGG16. we will make few changes in the model to incorporate our dataset into it. Since the network architecture is not that simple, in our computer it will take a lot of time to complete the training.\n\n\nSo instead of CPU, we have to use a GPU to enhance parallel processing. We will be using a cloud based Free GPU service provied by goggle called Google Colab. At first we will try training with VGG16 in google colab. We will prepare, zip and upload the dataset into google colab. Then we will extract it using linux comands and then do the training. The training is almost ten times faster compared to the local computer. Once we have the trained model we will serialize the model and will do the prediction.\n\n\nThe same procedure will be repeated for VGG19 and also for ResNet.\n\n\nAnd after having enough knowledge about Deep Learning, we will then move on with our Generative Adversarial Network or GAN\n\n\nAt first we will have an introduction to GAN. We will discuss about the the basic things inside the GAN, the two different types of networks called the Generator and the Discriminator. And then we will attempt to do a simple Transpose Convolution using a grayscale image.\n\n\nTranspose convolution is the opposite of the convolution operation that we had in Deep Learning and in the next session, we will once again have a thorough discussion about the Generator and the Discriminator mechanism inside a GAN. After that we will try to implement a Fully Connected, simple GAN using MNIST dataset. We will have a step by step approach in creating this fully connected GAN or fully connected GAN.\nAt first we will be loading the MNIST dataset. Then we will proceed with defining the Generator function. Once we have the Generator function, we will then define the Discriminator function. And then we will combine this Generator and Discriminator models for our fully connected GAN so that we will have a composite model. And then this model will be compiled so that it can be used for training. After the compilation, we will proceed with training. We will train the discriminator at first and then we will proceed with the generator training. We will also define functions so that during the training of this fully connected gan, we will save the log at regular intervals and also we will plot the graph. Along with the graph,the image generated after each batch of training. And once the training is complete, we will\nsee how it performed. We will see the generated images by this fully connected GAN and also we will save this model\nso that we can use it for future image generation without having to train it again. We will see how we can do that.\n\n\nOnce we completed the fully connected GAN, we will then proceed with a more advanced Deep Convoluted GAN or DCGAN. For DCGAN also, we will discuss what is a DCGAN. What's the difference between DCGAN with a Fully Connected GAN. Then we will try to implement the Deep Convolution GAN or DCGAN At first we will define the Generator function then we will define the Discriminator function. After that we will combine this generator and discriminator models and we will have a composite model. We will then compile this model. Once the compilation is complete, we will proceed with training the model. Since deep convoluted GAN or DCGAN is complex than a fully connected GAN, it will take much time in training it.\nSo we will move the training from our local computer to our Google Colab using GPU. we will train the model and we will use that to generate the MNIST hand written digits.\n\n\nWe will use this same deep convolution GAN with other dataset also like the MNIST Fashion dataset. We will train the model using GPU and we will generate images. Then we will have the MNIST hand written digits and also the MNIST Fashion dataset are all simple grayscale images.\n\n\nWe will try with color images also. We will be having the CIFAR-10 dataset. We will define the generator at first. Because its a color dataset, we need to adjust the model. So we will define the generator, then we will define the discriminator once again. Then we will proceed with training using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The training will be done using Google Colab GPU and then we will try to generate images using that trained model.\n\n\nThen we will have a brief discussion about Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks or Conditional GAN. We will compare the normal Vanilla GAN with Conditional GAN. What's the difference between a normal GAN and a Conditional GAN. And then we will proceed with implementing the Conditional GAN, which is a bit different from our normal GAN. We will at first define the basic generator function and then we will have a Label Embedding for this generator. Then we will define the basic discriminator function and also we will have the label embedding for this discriminator function. Then we will combine this generator and discriminator. We will combine and we will compile. After that, we will proceed with\ntraining the GAN model using our local computer. And we will try to display the generated images. And then we will use the same code, upload it to google colab and do the training with google Colab. And that was for the MNIST hand written digits dataset. We will then proceed with training the Conditional GAN using the MNIST Fashion dataset. The same dataset that we used for our fully connected and also deep convoluted GAN. Once we completed  the training, we will try to generate images using the conditional GAN for our Fashion MNIST dataset. And in the next session, we will discuss about the other popular types of GAN and also I will provide you with a git repository which was shared by a deep learning and machine learning expert. I will share that link so that you can try those exercises by yourself and also I will teach you how you can fork that repository into your personal git repository so that you can try the code, change the code\nand see how it performs.\n\n\nAnd that's all about the topics which are currently included in this quick course. The code, images, models and weights used in this course has been uploaded and shared in a folder. I will include the link to download them in the last session or the resource section of this course. You are free to use the code in your projects with no questions asked.\n\n\nAlso after completing this course, you will be provided with a course completion certificate which will add value to your portfolio.\n\n\nSo that's all for now, see you soon in the class room. Happy learning and have a great time.",

Later, IBM extended Db2 to include other operating systems like OS/2, UNIX, MS Windows servers, Linux, and PDAs.  Db2 is designed to store, analyse and retrieve data from relational databases efficiently. Beyond relational databases, Db2 also supports object-oriented features and non-relational data like XML using Db2\nMicrosoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications—which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network.\nSQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle is a comprehensive environment that helps you quickly migrate Oracle databases to SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure Synapse Analytics. By using SSMA for Oracle, you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate database objects to SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure Synapse Analytics, and then migrate data to SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure Synapse Analytics. Note that you cannot migrate SYS and SYSTEM Oracle schemas.\nThese days lot of customers are looking to save on their technology costs.

      "description": "Hello there,\nWelcome to the “Data Science and Machine Learning Fundamentals [Theory Only]” course.\nTheorical Course for Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning to understand the logic of Data Science algorithms\n\n\n\nMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.\nYou can develop the foundational skills you need to advance to building neural networks and creating more complex functions through the Python and R programming languages. Machine learning helps you stay ahead of new trends, technologies, and applications in this field.\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data.\nMachine learning is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\nIt’s hard to imagine our lives without machine learning. Predictive texting, email filtering, and virtual personal assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and the iPhone’s Siri, are all technologies that function based on machine learning algorithms and mathematical models. Python, machine learning, python programming, machine learning python, python for beginners, data science.\n\nPython instructors on OAK Academy specialize in everything from software development to data analysis, and are known for their effective, friendly instruction for students of all levels.\n\nWhether you work in machine learning or finance, or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed upon the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that has resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing a variety of different tools for programmers suited for many different tasks.\n\n\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods\nDo you know data science needs will create 11.5 million job openings by 2026?\nDo you know the average salary is $100.000 for data science careers!\n\nData Science Careers Are Shaping The Future\nData science experts are needed in almost every field, from government security to dating apps. Millions of businesses and government departments rely on big data to succeed and better serve their customers. So data science careers are in high demand.\nIf you want to learn one of the employer’s most request skills?\nIf you are curious about Data Science and looking to start your self-learning journey into the world of data with Python?\nIf you are an experienced developer and looking for a landing in Data Science!\nIn all cases, you are at the right place!\nWe've designed for you “Machine Learning & Data Science with Python & Kaggle | A-Z” a straightforward course for Python Programming Language and Machine Learning.\nIn the course, you will enter the world of Data science and machine learning with theory. Only by learning the theories will you grasp the logic of algorithms. You will understand why you do what you do and say hello to the magical world of data science\nThroughout the course, we will teach you how to use Python to analyze data, create beautiful visualizations, and use powerful machine learning python algorithms.\nThis Machine Learning course is for everyone!\nIf you don’t have any previous experience, not a problem! This course is expertly designed to teach everyone from complete beginners, right through to professionals ( as a refresher).\n\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\n\n\nWhy we use a Python programming language in Machine learning?\nPython is a general-purpose, high-level, and multi-purpose programming language. The best thing about Python is, it supports a lot of today’s technology including vast libraries for Twitter, data mining, scientific calculations, designing, back-end server for websites, engineering simulations, artificial learning, augmented reality and what not! Also, it supports all kinds of App development.\n\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning a-z is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\n\nDoes Machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning data science without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it\n\n\nWhat is the best language for machine learning?\nPython is the most used language in machine learning using python. Engineers writing machine learning systems often use Jupyter Notebooks and Python together. Jupyter Notebooks is a web application that allows experimentation by creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and more. Machine learning involves trial and error to see which hyperparameters and feature engineering choices work best. It's useful to have a development environment such as Python so that you don't need to compile and package code before running it each time. Python is not the only language choice for machine learning. Tensorflow is a popular framework for developing neural networks and offers a C++ API. There is a complete machine learning framework for C# called ML. NET. Scala or Java are sometimes used with Apache Spark to build machine learning systems that ingest massive data sets.\n\nWhat are the different types of machine learning?\nMachine learning is generally divided between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. In supervised machine learning, we train machine learning models on labeled data. For example, an algorithm meant to detect spam might ingest thousands of email addresses labeled 'spam' or 'not spam.' That trained model could then identify new spam emails even from data it's never seen. In unsupervised learning, a machine learning model looks for patterns in unstructured data. One type of unsupervised learning is clustering. In this example, a model could identify similar movies by studying their scripts or cast, then group the movies together into genres. This unsupervised model was not trained to know which genre a movie belongs to. Rather, it learned the genres by studying the attributes of the movies themselves. There are many techniques available within.\n\nIs Machine learning a good career?\nMachine learning python is one of the fastest-growing and popular computer science careers today. Constantly growing and evolving, you can apply machine learning to a variety of industries, from shipping and fulfillment to medical sciences. Machine learning engineers work to create artificial intelligence that can better identify patterns and solve problems. The machine learning discipline frequently deals with cutting-edge, disruptive technologies. However, because it has become a popular career choice, it can also be competitive. Aspiring machine learning engineers can differentiate themselves from the competition through certifications, boot camps, code repository submissions, and hands-on experience.\n\nWhat is the difference between machine learning and artifical intelligence?\nMachine learning is a smaller subset of the broader spectrum of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence describes any \"intelligent machine\" that can derive information and make decisions, machine learning describes a method by which it can do so. Through machine learning, applications can derive knowledge without the user explicitly giving out the information. This is one of the first and early steps toward \"true artificial intelligence\" and is extremely useful for numerous practical applications. In machine learning applications, an AI is fed sets of information. It learns from these sets of information about what to expect and what to predict. But it still has limitations. A machine learning engineer must ensure that the AI is fed the right information and can use its logic to analyze that information correctly.\n\nWhat skills should a machine learning engineer know?\nA python machine learning engineer will need to be an extremely competent programmer with in-depth knowledge of computer science, mathematics, data science, and artificial intelligence theory. Machine learning engineers must be able to dig deep into complex applications and their programming. As with other disciplines, there are entry-level machine learning engineers and machine learning engineers with high-level expertise. Python and R are two of the most popular languages within the machine learning field.\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

      "description": "More and more evidence has demonstrated that graph representation learning especially graph neural networks (GNNs) has tremendously facilitated computational tasks on graphs including both node-focused and graph-focused tasks. The revolutionary advances brought by GNNs have also immensely contributed to the depth and breadth of the adoption of graph representation learning in real-world applications. For the classical application domains of graph representation learning such as recommender systems and social network analysis, GNNs result in state-of-the-art performance and bring them into new frontiers. Meanwhile, new application domains of GNNs have been continuously emerging such as combinational optimization, physics, and healthcare. These wide applications of GNNs enable diverse contributions and perspectives from disparate disciplines and make this research field truly interdisciplinary.\nIn this course, I will start by talking about basic graph data representation and concepts like node data, edge types, adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix etc. Next, we will talk about broad kinds of graph learning tasks and discuss basic operations needed in a GNN: filtering and pooling. Further, we will discuss details of different types of graph filtering (i.e., neighborhood aggregation) methods. These include graph convolutional networks, graph attention networks, confidence GCNs, Syntactic GCNs and the general message passing neural network framework. Next, we will talk about three main types of graph pooling methods: Topology based pooling, Global pooling and Hierarchical pooling. Within each of these three types of graph pooling methods, we will discuss popular methods. For example, in topology pooling we will talk about Normalized Cut and Graclus mainly. In Global pooling, we will talk about Set2Set and SortPool. In Hierarchical pooling, we will talk about diffPool, gPool and SAGPool. Next, we will talk about three unsupervised graph neural network architectures: GraphSAGE, Graph auto-encoders and Deep Graph InfoMax. Lastly, we will talk about some applications of GNNs for NLP including semantic role labeling, event detection, multiple event extraction, neural machine translation, document timestamping and relation extraction.",

Python was developed upon the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that has resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing a variety of different tools for programmers suited for many different tasks.\nDo you know data science needs will create 11.5 million job openings by 2026?\nDo you know the average salary is $100.000 for data science careers!\n\nData Science Careers Are Shaping The Future\nData science experts are needed in almost every field, from government security to dating apps. Millions of businesses and government departments rely on big data to succeed and better serve their customers. So data science careers are in high demand.\nIf you want to learn one of the employer’s most request skills?\nIf you are curious about Data Science and looking to start your self-learning journey into the world of data with Python?\nIf you are an experienced developer and looking for a landing in Data Science!\nIn all cases, you are at the right place!\nWe've designed for you “Machine Learning & Data Science with Python & Kaggle | A-Z” a straightforward course for Python Programming Language and Machine Learning.\nIn the course, you will have down-to-earth way explanations with projects.

This course is expertly designed to teach everyone from complete beginners, right through to professionals ( as a refresher).\n\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\n\n\nWhy we use a Python programming language in Machine learning?\nPython is a general-purpose, high-level, and multi-purpose programming language. The best thing about Python is, it supports a lot of today’s technology including vast libraries for Twitter, data mining, scientific calculations, designing, back-end server for websites, engineering simulations, artificial learning, augmented reality and what not! Also, it supports all kinds of App development.\n\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning a-z is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\n\nDoes Machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning data science without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it\n\n\nWhat is the best language for machine learning?\nPython is the most used language in machine learning using python. Engineers writing machine learning systems often use Jupyter Notebooks and Python together. Jupyter Notebooks is a web application that allows experimentation by creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and more. Machine learning involves trial and error to see which hyperparameters and feature engineering choices work best. It's useful to have a development environment such as Python so that you don't need to compile and package code before running it each time. Python is not the only language choice for machine learning. Tensorflow is a popular framework for developing neural networks and offers a C++ API. There is a complete machine learning framework for C# called ML. NET. Scala or Java are sometimes used with Apache Spark to build machine learning systems that ingest massive data sets.\n\nWhat are the different types of machine learning?\nMachine learning is generally divided between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. In supervised machine learning, we train machine learning models on labeled data. For example, an algorithm meant to detect spam might ingest thousands of email addresses labeled 'spam' or 'not spam.' That trained model could then identify new spam emails even from data it's never seen. In unsupervised learning, a machine learning model looks for patterns in unstructured data. One type of unsupervised learning is clustering. In this example, a model could identify similar movies by studying their scripts or cast, then group the movies together into genres. This unsupervised model was not trained to know which genre a movie belongs to. Rather, it learned the genres by studying the attributes of the movies themselves. There are many techniques available within.\n\nIs Machine learning a good career?\nMachine learning python is one of the fastest-growing and popular computer science careers today. Constantly growing and evolving, you can apply machine learning to a variety of industries, from shipping and fulfillment to medical sciences. Machine learning engineers work to create artificial intelligence that can better identify patterns and solve problems. The machine learning discipline frequently deals with cutting-edge, disruptive technologies. However, because it has become a popular career choice, it can also be competitive. Aspiring machine learning engineers can differentiate themselves from the competition through certifications, boot camps, code repository submissions, and hands-on experience.\n\nWhat is the difference between machine learning and artifical intelligence?\nMachine learning is a smaller subset of the broader spectrum of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence describes any \"intelligent machine\" that can derive information and make decisions, machine learning describes a method by which it can do so. Through machine learning, applications can derive knowledge without the user explicitly giving out the information. This is one of the first and early steps toward \"true artificial intelligence\" and is extremely useful for numerous practical applications. In machine learning applications, an AI is fed sets of information. It learns from these sets of information about what to expect and what to predict. But it still has limitations. A machine learning engineer must ensure that the AI is fed the right information and can use its logic to analyze that information correctly.\n\nWhat skills should a machine learning engineer know?\nA python machine learning engineer will need to be an extremely competent programmer with in-depth knowledge of computer science, mathematics, data science, and artificial intelligence theory. Machine learning engineers must be able to dig deep into complex applications and their programming. As with other disciplines, there are entry-level machine learning engineers and machine learning engineers with high-level expertise. Python and R are two of the most popular languages within the machine learning field.\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

I am also happy to tell you that I will be constantly available to support your learning and answer questions.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\n\n\nWhat is machine learning used for?\nMachine learning is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.\n\n\nDoes machine learning require coding?\nIt's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it. An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systems.\n\n\nWhat is the best language for machine learning?\nPython is the most used language in machine learning. Engineers writing machine learning systems often use Jupyter Notebooks and Python together. Jupyter Notebooks is a web application that allows experimentation by creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and more. Machine learning involves trial and error to see which hyperparameters and feature engineering choices work best. It's useful to have a development environment such as Python so that you don't need to compile and package code before running it each time. Python is not the only language choice for machine learning. Tensorflow is a popular framework for developing neural networks and offers a C++ API. There is a machine learning framework for C# called ML. NET. Scala or Java are sometimes used with Apache Spark to build machine learning systems that ingest massive data sets. You may find yourself using many different languages in machine learning, but Python is a good place to start.\n\n\nWhat are the different types of machine learning?\nMachine learning is generally divided between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. In supervised machine learning, we train machine learning models on labeled data. For example, an algorithm meant to detect spam might ingest thousands of email addresses labeled 'spam' or 'not spam.' That trained model could then identify new spam emails even from data it's never seen. In unsupervised learning, a machine learning model looks for patterns in unstructured data. One type of unsupervised learning is clustering. In this example, a model could identify similar movies by studying their scripts or cast, then group the movies together into genres. This unsupervised model was not trained to know which genre a movie belongs to. Rather, it learned the genres by studying the attributes of the movies themselves. There are many techniques available within these two types of machine learning, for example: deep learning, reinforcement learning, and more.\n\n\nIs machine learning a good career?\nMachine learning is one of the fastest-growing and popular computer science careers today. Constantly growing and evolving, you can apply machine learning to a variety of industries, from shipping and fulfillment to medical sciences. Machine learning engineers work to create artificial intelligence that can better identify patterns and solve problems. The machine learning discipline frequently deals with cutting-edge, disruptive technologies. However, because it has become a popular career choice, it can also be competitive. Aspiring machine learning engineers can differentiate themselves from the competition through certifications, boot camps, code repository submissions, and hands-on experience.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between machine learning and artifical intelligence?\nMachine learning is a smaller subset of the broader spectrum of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence describes any \"intelligent machine\" that can derive information and make decisions, machine learning describes a method by which it can do so. Through machine learning, applications can derive knowledge without the user explicitly giving out the information. This is one of the first and early steps toward \"true artificial intelligence\" and is extremely useful for numerous practical applications. In machine learning applications, an AI is fed sets of information. It learns from these sets of information about what to expect and what to predict. But it still has limitations. A machine learning engineer must ensure that the AI is fed the right information and can use its logic to analyze that information correctly.\n\n\nWhat skills should a machine learning engineer know?\nA machine learning engineer will need to be an extremely competent programmer with in-depth knowledge of computer science, mathematics, data science, and artificial intelligence theory. Machine learning engineers must be able to dig deep into complex applications and their programming. As with other disciplines, there are entry-level machine learning engineers and machine learning engineers with high-level expertise. Python and R are two of the most popular languages within the machine learning field.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

One environment (blue) is running the current application version and one environment (green) is running the new application version.  ( You will be given Hint of the answer)\n\n\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nBlue-green deployment is a technique used in software deployment, including ML model deployment, to minimize downtime and reduce the risk of releasing faulty or unstable versions. It involves maintaining two identical production environments, referred to as the blue environment (existing/live version) and the green environment (new version). Here's a detailed explanation of blue-green deployment and its benefits for ML model deployment:\n\n\nConcept of Blue-Green Deployment:\nBlue Environment: The blue environment represents the current production environment, which is serving the live ML model and actively handling user requests.\nGreen Environment: The green environment is an identical replica of the blue environment. It hosts the new version of the ML model that undergoes testing and validation before going live.\nDeployment Process: The deployment process involves the following steps:\nInitially, user traffic is routed to the blue environment.\nThe green environment is prepared with the updated ML model and dependencies.\nOnce the green environment is ready, traffic is shifted from the blue to the green environment.\nThe green environment becomes the new live environment, and the blue environment is kept as a backup.\nIf any issues are detected in the green environment, traffic can be quickly reverted back to the blue environment.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of Blue-Green Deployment for ML Model Deployment:\nReduced Downtime: Blue-green deployment minimizes downtime as the switch between environments is instant. Users experience uninterrupted service, and any issues in the green environment can be resolved without affecting the live model in the blue environment.\nRollback Capability: The blue environment serves as a rollback option. If any problems arise after the switch, traffic can be reverted back to the stable blue environment, ensuring a quick recovery.\nTesting and Validation: The green environment allows thorough testing, validation, and performance evaluation of the new ML model without impacting user experience. This ensures that the new version is stable, performs as expected, and meets the required quality standards.\nExample Use Cases and Code:\n\n\nA/B Testing: Blue-green deployment enables A/B testing where the green environment hosts a new ML model variant, and user traffic is split between the blue and green environments to compare performance and user satisfaction metrics.\nModel Evaluation and Comparison: Blue-green deployment facilitates evaluating and comparing the performance of different ML models or versions by deploying them in the green environment and measuring their metrics against the stable blue environment.\n\n\n# Sample Deployment Script using Blue-Green Deployment\n# Assumption: Using Kubernetes for deployment\n\n\n# Deploy blue environment (current stable version)\nkubectl apply -f blue_deployment.yaml\nkubectl apply -f blue_service.yaml\n\n\n# Validate blue environment\n# Run tests, monitor performance, ensure stability\n\n\n# Prepare green environment with new ML model version\nkubectl apply -f green_deployment.yaml\nkubectl apply -f green_service.yaml\n\n\n# Validate green environment (testing, evaluation, monitoring)\n# Perform tests, compare metrics with blue environment\n\n\n# Switch traffic from blue to green environment\nkubectl apply -f traffic_switch.yaml\n\n\n# Monitor green environment, measure performance, user satisfaction\n# Resolve any issues detected in the green environment\n\n\n# If issues persist in the green environment, switch traffic back to blue\nkubectl apply -f traffic_switch_back.yaml\n\n\nPlease note that the provided example is a simplified representation, and the actual implementation of blue-green deployment may vary based on your specific deployment platform and tools used.\n*****************************************  End of Explanation *************************",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the TensorFlow Interview Questions & Answers course by Uplatz.\n\n\nUplatz provides this course on TensorFlow Interview Questions. You will learn the most frequently asked questions in TensorFlow engineer job interviews.\nAs per the leading job sites, the average salary for TensorFlow jobs is $148,000. Thus Deep Learning engineers with sound knowledge of TensorFlow command premium salaries, hence it's a good area to be already in or to aspire for.\n\n\nWhat is TensorFlow\nTensorFlow is a powerful data flow oriented machine learning library created by the Brain Team of Google and made open source in 2015. It is designed to be easy to use and widely applicable to both numeric and neural network oriented problems as well as other domains. TensorFlow is a low-level toolkit for doing complicated math and it targets researchers who know what they’re doing to build experimental learning architectures, to play around with them and to turn them into running software.\nGenerally, it can think of as a programming system in which you represent computations as graphs. Nodes in the graph represent math operations, and the edges represent multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. Thus TensorFlow is an open source deep learning library that is based on the concept of data flow graphs for building models. It allows you to create large-scale neural networks with many layers.\n\n\nTensors and TensorFlow\nTensors are nothing but a de facto for representing the data in deep learning. Tensors are just multidimensional arrays, that allows you to represent data having higher dimensions. In general, Deep Learning you deal with high dimensional data sets where dimensions refer to different features present in the data set. In fact, the name “TensorFlow” has been derived from the operations which neural networks perform on tensors. It’s literally a flow of tensors.\nIn TensorFlow, the term tensor refers to the representation of data as multi-dimensional array whereas the term flow refers to the series of operations that one performs on tensors. The overall process of writing a TensorFlow program involves two steps:\nBuilding a Computational Graph\nRunning a Computational Graph\nTensorFlow bundles together Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and algorithms. It uses Python as a convenient front-end and runs it efficiently in optimized C++. TensorFlow allows developers to create a graph of computations to perform. Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation and each connection represents data. Hence, instead of dealing with low-details like figuring out proper ways to hitch the output of one function to the input of another, the developer can focus on the overall logic of the application.",

      "description": "Welcome to Imbalanced Classification Master Class in Python.\nClassification predictive modeling is the task of assigning a label to an example. Imbalanced classification is those classification tasks where the distribution of examples across the classes is not equal. Typically the class distribution is severely skewed so that for each example in the minority class, there may be one hundred or even one thousand examples in the majority class. Practical imbalanced classification requires the use of a suite of specialized techniques, data preparation techniques, learning algorithms, and performance metrics.\nLet's discuss what you'll learn in this course.\nThe challenge and intuitions for imbalanced classification datasets.\nHow to choose an appropriate performance metric for evaluating models for imbalanced classification.\nHow to appropriately stratify an imbalanced dataset when splitting into train and test sets and when using k-fold cross-validation.\nHow to use data sampling algorithms like SMOTE to transform the training dataset for an imbalanced dataset when fitting a range of standard machine learning models.\nHow algorithms from the field of cost-sensitive learning can be used for imbalanced classification.\nHow to use modified versions of standard algorithms like SVM and decision trees to take the class weighting into account.\nHow to tune the threshold when interpreting predicted probabilities as class labels.\nHow to calibrate probabilities predicted by nonlinear algorithms that are not fit using a probabilistic framework.\nHow to use algorithms from the field of outlier detection and anomaly detection for imbalanced classification.\nHow to use modified ensemble algorithms that have been modified to take the class distribution into account during training.\nHow to systematically work through an imbalanced classification predictive modeling project.\nThis course was created to be completed linearly, from start to finish. That being said, if you know the basics and need help with a specific method or type of problem, then you can flip straight to that section and get started. This course was designed for you to completed on your laptop or desktop, on the screen, not on a tablet.\nMy hope is that you have the course open right next to your editor and run the examples as you read about them. This course is not intended to be completed passively or be placed in a folder as a reference text. It is a playbook, a workbook, and a guidebook intended for you to learn by doing and then apply your new understanding with working Python examples. To get the most out of the course, I would recommend playing with the examples in each tutorial. Extend them, break them, then fix them.\nThanks for you interest in Imbalanced Classification Master Class in Python.\nNow let's get started!",

Access free GPUs and a huge repository of community-published data & code.\nKaggle is a platform where data scientists can compete in machine learning challenges. These challenges can be anything from predicting housing prices to detecting cancer cells. Kaggle has a massive community of data scientists who are always willing to help others with their data science problems. In addition to the competitions, Kaggle also has many tutorials and resources that can help you get started in machine learning.\nIf you are an aspiring data scientist, Kaggle is the best way to get started. Many companies will give offers to those who rank highly in their competitions. In fact, Kaggle may become your full-time job if you can hit one of their high rankings.\n\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.\n\n\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\n\n\nIs Kaggle good for beginners?\nDespite the differences between Kaggle and typical data science, Kaggle can still be a great learning tool for beginners. Each competition is self-contained. You don't need to scope your own project and collect data, which frees you up to focus on other skills.\n\n\nHow does Kaggle work?\nEvery competition on Kaggle has a dataset associated with it and a goal you must reach (i.e., predict housing prices or detect cancer cells). You can access the data as often as possible and build your prediction model.\nThis ensures that everyone is starting from the same point when competing against one another, so there are no advantages given to those with more computational power than others trying to solve the problem.\nCompetitions are separated into different categories depending on their complexity level, how long they take, whether or not prize money is involved, etc., so users with varying experience levels can compete against each other in the same arena.\n\n\nWhat type of skills do you need to compete on Kaggle?\nYou should be comfortable with data analysis and machine learning if you're looking to get involved in competitions.\nData science is a very broad term that can be interpreted in many ways depending on who you talk to. But suppose we're talking specifically about competitive data science like what you see on Kaggle. In that case, it's about solving problems or gaining insights from data.\nIt doesn't necessarily involve machine learning, but you will need to understand the basics of machine learning to get started. There are no coding prerequisites either, though I would recommend having some programming experience in Python or R beforehand.\nThat being said, if competitive data science sounds interesting to you and you want to get started right away, we have a course for that on Duomly!\n\n\nHow does one enter a competition on Kaggle?\nThe sign-up process for entering a competition is very straightforward: Most competitions ask competitors to submit code that meets specific criteria at the end of each challenge. However, there may be times when they want competitors to explain what algorithms they used or provide input about how things work.\n\n\nWhat are some Kaggle competitions I could consider solving?\nSuppose you want to solve one of their business-related challenges. In that case, you'll need to have a good understanding of machine learning and what models work well with certain types of data. Suppose you want to do one of their custom competition. You'll need to have a background in computer science to code in the language associated with the problem.\n\n\nHow do Kaggle competitions make money?\nMany companies on Kaggle are looking for solutions, so there is always a prize attached to each competition. If your solution is strong enough, you can win a lot of money!\nSome of these competitions are just for fun or learning purposes but still award winners with cash or merchandise prizes.\n\n\nWhat tools should I use to compete on Kaggle?\nThe most important tool that competitors rely on every day is the Python programming language. It's used by over 60% of all data scientists, so it has an extremely large community behind it. It's also extremely robust and has many different packages available for data manipulation, preprocessing, exploration to get you started.\nTensorFlow is another popular tool that machine learning enthusiasts use to solve Kaggle competitions. It allows quick prototyping of models to get the best possible results. Several other tools are used in addition to Python and Tensorflow, such as R (a statistical programming language), Git (version control), and Bash (command-line interface). Still, I'll let you research those on your own!\n\n\nWhat is the main benefit of using Kaggle to solve problems?\nKaggle aims to give you the tools necessary to become a world-class data scientist. They provide you with access to real data in real-time so you can practice solving problems similar to what companies face around the world.\n\n\nWho would be interested in using Kaggle?\nWith many tutorials and datasets readily available, Machine Learning enthusiasts would be very interested in Kaggle.\nIt is an excellent place to learn more about machine learning, practice what they've learned, and compete with other data scientists. This will help them become better at their craft.\nData analysts that want to use machine learning in their work can refer to Kaggle when choosing tools to improve the performance of business-related tasks such as forecasting sales numbers or predicting customer behavior.\nIn addition, businesses who are looking for third-party solutions can benefit from Kaggle's extensive list of companies offering the service they need.\nIf you need machine learning services, don't hesitate to contact us. We have a team of experts who can help you with your needs.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between machine learning and artifical intelligence?\nMachine learning is a smaller subset of the broader spectrum of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence describes any \"intelligent machine\" that can derive information and make decisions, machine learning describes a method by which it can do so. Through machine learning, applications can derive knowledge without the user explicitly giving out the information. This is one of the first and early steps toward \"true artificial intelligence\" and is extremely useful for numerous practical applications. In machine learning applications, an AI is fed sets of information. It learns from these sets of information about what to expect and what to predict. But it still has limitations. A machine learning engineer must ensure that the AI is fed the right information and can use its logic to analyze that information correctly.\n\n\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\n\n\nHow long does it take to become a data scientist?\nThis answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.\n\n\nHow can I learn data science on my own?\nIt is possible to learn data science on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Oak Academy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.\n\n\n\n\nWhat skills should a data scientist know?\nA data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings, data scientists require knowledge of visualizations. Data visualizations allow them to share complex data in an accessible manner.\n\n\n\n\nVIs data science a good career?\nThe demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. Data science is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds. If this sounds like a great work environment, then it might be a promising career for you.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise.\n\n\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you with the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nIf you are ready to learn\n\n\nNow Dive into; \" Generative AI with Heart Attack Prediction Kaggle Project\nMaster in Data Science and Use Gen AI tools to predict heart attacks using Kaggle datasets and ChatGPT-4o's super power \" course.\nSee you in the course!",

Much thought goes into the selection of the assets for a Learning Path, and this is done through a complete understanding of the requirements to achieve a goal.\nDeep learning is the next step to a more advanced implementation of Machine Learning. Deep Learning allows you to solve problems where traditional Machine Learning methods might perform poorly: detecting and extracting objects from images, extracting meaning from text, and predicting outcomes based on complex dependencies, to name a few.\nIn this practical Learning Path, you will build Deep Learning applications with real-world datasets and Python. Beginning with a step by step approach, right from building your neural nets to reinforcement learning and working with different Deep Learning applications such as computer Vision and voice and image recognition, this course will be your guide in getting started with Deep Learning concepts.\nMoving further with simple and practical solutions provided, we will cover a whole range of practical, real-world projects that will help customers learn how to implement their skills to solve everyday problems.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll apply Deep Learning concepts and use Python to solve challenging tasks with real-world datasets.\nKey Features\nGet started with Deep Learning and build complex models layer by layer, with increasing complexity, in no time.\nA hands-on guide covering common as well as not-so-common problems in deep learning using Python.\nExplore the practical essence of Deep Learning in a relatively short amount of time by working on practical, real-world use cases.\nAuthor Bios\nRadhika Datar has more than 6 years' experience in Software Development and Content Writing. She is well versed with frameworks such as Python, PHP, and Java and regularly provides training on them. She has been working with Educba and Eduonix as a Training Consultant since June 2016 and has been an Academic writer with TutorialsPoint since Sept 2015.\n\n\nJakub Konczyk has enjoyed and done programming professionally since 1995. He is a Python and Django expert and has been involved in building complex systems since 2006. He loves to simplify and teach programming subjects and share it with others. He first discovered Machine Learning when he was trying to predict the real estate prices in one of the early stage start-ups he was involved in.

Apparently yes!!!\nThis course will help you to combine popular problem-solving technique called \"is/is not\" with Artificial Intelligence in order to quickly identify the problem.\nWe will use data coming from four similar Machines.  We will process it through the Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm k-means. Once you get intuition understanding how this system work You will be amazed to see how easy and versatile the concept is. In our project you will see that helped by Artificial Intelligence Human eye will easily spot the problem.\nCourse will also exploit different other methods of Anomaly Detection. Probably the most interesting one is to use Deep Learning Autoencoders models built with help of H2O Platform in R.\nUsing collected data and Expert Knowledge for Process Control with AI:\nIn this course we will build and demo-try entire multi-variables process supervision system. Process Expert should select dataset coming from the ideally working process. Deep Learning model will be fit to that specific pattern. This model can be used to monitor the process as the new data is coming in. Anomaly in the process then can be easily detected by the process operators.\n\nReady for Production:\nAnother great value from the Course is the possibility to learn using ShinyApp. This tool will help you to instantly deploy your data project in no time!!! In fact all examples we will study will be ready to be deployed in real scenario!\n\nAdditionally:\n\nYou will learn R by practicing re-using provided material. More over you can easily retain and reuse the knowledge from the course - all lectures with code are available as downloadable html files.  You will get useful knowledge on Version Control to be super organized and productive.\nFinally:\nJoin this course to know how to take advantage and use Artificial Intelligence in Problem Solving",

Data: Measurable units of information gathered or captured from activity of people, places and things.\n2. Specific Questions: Seeking to understand a phenomenon, natural, social or other, can we formulate specific questions for which an answer posed in terms of patterns observed, tested and or modeled in data is appropriate.\n3. Interdisciplinary Activities: Formulating a question, assessing the appropriateness of the data and findings used to find an answer require understanding of the specific subject area. Deciding on the appropriateness of models and inferences made from models based on the data at hand requires understanding of statistical and computational methods\n\n\nWhy Data Science?\nThe granularity, size and accessibility data, comprising both physical, social, commercial and political spheres has exploded in the last decade or more.\nAccording to Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and I quote:\n“I keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians and Data Scientist”\n“The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades, not only at the professional level but even at the educational level for elementary school kids, for high school kids, for college kids.”\n\n\n************ ************Course Organization **************************\nSection 1: Setting up Anaconda and Editor/Libraries\nSection 2: Learning about Data Science Lifecycle and Methodologies\nSection 3: Learning about Data preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, transformation of data\nSection 4: Some machine learning models: Linear/Logistic Regression\nSection 5: Project 1: Hotel Booking Prediction System\nSection 6: Project 2: Natural Language Processing\nSection 7: Project 3: Artificial Intelligence\nSection 8: Farewell",

This is exactly why Pandas is the most popular Python library in data science and why data scientists at Google, Facebook, JP Morgan, and nearly every other major company that analyzes data use Pandas.\n\n\nIf you want to learn how to efficiently utilize Pandas to manipulate, transform, and merge your data for preparation of visualization, statistical analysis, or machine learning, then this course is for you.\n\n\nHere’s what you can expect when you enrolled in the course:\n\n\nLearn how to Work with Excel data, CSV datasets.\nLearn how to Handling missing data.\nLearn how to read and work with JSON format, HTML files, PICKLE dataset, and  SQL-based database.\nLearn how to select data from the dataset.\nLearn how to sort a pandas DataFrame and filtering rows of a pandas DataFrame.\nLearn how to apply multiple filter criteria to a pandas DataFrame.\nLearn how to using string methods in pandas.\nLearn how to change the datatype of a pandas series.\nLearn how to modifying a pandas DataFrame.\nLearn how to indexing and renaming columns, and removing columns in and from pandas DataFrame.\nLearn how to working with date and time series data.\nLearn how to applying a function to a pandas series or DataFrame.\nLearn how to merging and concatenating multiple DataFrames into one.\nLearn how to control plot aesthetics.\nLearn how to choose the colours for plots.\nLearn how to plot categorical data.\nLearn how to plot with Data-Aware Grids.\nPerforming exploratory analysis with Python’s Pandas library can help you do a lot, but it does have its downsides. And this course helps you beat them head-on:\n\n\n1. Pandas has a steep learning curve: As you dive deeper into the Pandas library, the learning slope becomes steeper and steeper. This course guides beginners and intermediate users smoothly into every aspect of Pandas.\n\n\n2. Inadequate documentation: Without proper documentation, it’s difficult to learn a new library. When it comes to advanced functions, Pandas documentation is rarely helpful. This course helps you grasp advanced Pandas techniques easily and saves you time in searching for help.\n\n\nAfter this course, you will feel comfortable delving into complex and heterogeneous datasets knowing with absolute confidence that you can produce a useful result for the next stage of Exploratory analysis.\n\n\nHere’s a closer look at the curriculum:\nLoading and creating Pandas DataFrames\nDisplaying your data with basic plots, and 1D, 2D and multidimensional visualizations.\nWorking with Different Kinds of Datasets\nData Selection\nManipulating, Transforming, and Reshaping Data.\nVisualizing Data Like a Pro\nMerging Pandas DataFrames\nLastly, this course is packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life examples. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get some hands-on practice with Pandas too.",

      "description": "Welcome to Computer Vision Bootcamp: Building Face Recognition with OpenCV course. This is a comprehensive projects based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a face recognition system, emotion detection system, age detection system, and eye tracking system using OpenCV. This course is a perfect combination between computer vision and image processing. This course will equip you with essential skills in feature extraction and pattern recognition, enabling you to develop complex facial recognition systems. In the introduction session, you will learn about the basic fundamentals of facial recognition, such as getting to know its use cases, technologies that will be used, and its limitations. Then, in the next session, you will learn how facial recognition technology works. This section will cover data collection, preprocessing, model training, feature extraction, and face matching. Afterward, we will start the project section, in the first section, we will build facial recognition for the identity verification system. Firstly, we are going to prepare the training data. It consists of several information like name, photo, age, and gender. Then, the data will be used to train the facial recognition model and it will enable the model to verify if you are the same person as the stored data based on the facial structure analysis. In addition, the model will also be able to make a decision, if the face matched then the model will print, access granted, however if the face did not match, then, the model will print, access denied. Meanwhile, in the second project section, we will build an emotion detection system using OpenCV. In this case, we will obtain a dataset from Kaggle and use that data to train the model to be able to detect emotion and facial expression. Then, in the third project section, we will build an age detection system using OpenCV. We will use a dataset containing photos of people from various ages and use it to train the model to predict someone’s age based on their facial structure. In the fourth project section, we will build an eye tracking system that can be utilized to analyze movements of a student's eyes to monitor their gaze patterns during an online exam. In addition, the model will also be able to notify the teacher if suspicious behavior is detected. This technology can potentially help teachers and college professors to maintain the academic integrity in their online class.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build facial recognition systems? Well, here is my answer: facial recognition systems play a pivotal role in supporting security measures across various sectors, including banking, government, and corporate environments. By accurately identifying individuals based on unique facial features, these systems provide a robust means of access control, ensuring only authorized personnel can gain entry to restricted areas or sensitive information. Moreover, in the digital world, facial recognition serves as a powerful tool for identity verification and authentication, safeguarding online accounts, transactions, and personal data from unauthorized access or fraudulent activities. Its ability to verify identity in real time offers unparalleled security and convenience, mitigating risks associated with traditional authentication methods like passwords or PINs, which are susceptible to theft or exploitation. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, the adoption of facial recognition technology remains paramount in safeguarding assets, maintaining trust, and upholding the integrity of digital ecosystems\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basics fundamentals of facial recognition technology, such as getting to know its use cases, technologies used, and limitations\nLearn how facial recognition systems work.

      "description": "Recent Course Review:\n\"Great course! The things that Mike taught are practical and can be applied in the real world immediately.\"  -- Ricky Valencia\nWelcome to A Comprehensive Guide to NLTK in Python: Volume 1\n\nThis is the very FIRST course in a series of courses that will focus on NLTK.\nNatural Language ToolKit (NLTK) is a comprehensive Python library for natural language processing and text analytics.\n\nNote: This isn't a modeling building course. This course is laser focused on a very specific part of natural language processing called tokenization.\nThis is the first part in a series of courses crafted to help you master NLP. This course  will cover the basics of tokenizing text and using WordNet\nTokenization is a method of breaking up a piece of text into many pieces, such as sentences and words, and  is an essential first step for recipes in the later courses. WordNet is a dictionary designed  for programmatic access by natural language processing systems.\nNLTK was originally created in 2001 as part of a computational linguistics course in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania\nWe will take Natural Language Processing — or NLP for short — in a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles.\nAt the other extreme, NLP involves \"understanding\" complete human utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful responses to them.\nTechnologies based on NLP are becoming increasingly widespread. For example, phones and handheld computers support predictive text and handwriting recognition; web search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured text; machine translation allows us to retrieve texts written in Chinese and read them in Spanish; text analysis enables us to detect sentiment in tweets and blogs.\nA Jupyter notebook is a web app that allows you to write and annotate Python code interactively. It's a great way to experiment, do research, and share what you are working on.\nIn this course all of the tutorials will be created using jupyter notebooks. In the preview lessons we install Python. Check them out. They are completely free.\nBy providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more sophisticated access to stored information, language processing has come to play a central role in the multilingual information society.\nThanks for your interest in A Comprehensive Guide to NLTK in Python: Volume 1",

A common dimensionality reduction technique based on feature importance is the Recursive Feature Elimination.\nModel interpretation helps us to correctly analyze and interpret the results of a model. A common approach for calculating model interpretation is the SHAP technique.\nWith this course, you are going to learn:\nHow to calculate feature importance according to a model\nSHAP technique for calculating feature importance according to every model\nRecursive Feature Elimination for dimensionality reduction, with and without the use of cross-validation\nAll the lessons of this course start with a brief introduction and end with a practical example in Python programming language and its powerful scikit-learn library. The environment that will be used is Jupyter, which is a standard in the data science industry.

      "description": "Linear regression is the primary workhorse in statistics and data science. Its high degree of flexibility allows it to model very different problems. We will review the theory, and we will concentrate on the R applications using real world data (R is a free statistical software used heavily in the industry and academia). We will understand how to build a real model, how to interpret it, and the computational technical details behind it. The goal is to provide the student the computational knowledge necessary to work in the industry, and do applied research, using lineal modelling techniques. Some basic knowledge in statistics and R is recommended, but not necessary. The course complexity increases as it progresses: we review basic R and statistics concepts, we then transition into the linear model explaining the computational, mathematical and R methods available. We then move into much more advanced models: dealing with multilevel hierarchical models, and we finally concentrate on nonlinear regression. We also leverage several of the latest R packages, and latest research.  We focus on typical business situations you will face as a data scientist/statistical analyst, and we provide many of the typical questions you will face interviewing for a job position. The course has lots of code examples, real datasets, quizzes, and video. The video duration is 4 hours, but the user is expected to take at least 5 extra hours working on the examples, data , and code provided. After completing this course, the user is expected to be fully proficient with these techniques in an industry/business context. All code and data available at Github.",

So it will earn you a lot of money and will bring a great change in your resume.\n\n\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\n\n\nWhat is Python?\nPython is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.\n\n\nWhat is Python good for?\nPython is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.\nThe language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets). Look at the table of contents for The Python Standard Library to get an idea of what’s available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also available. Consult the Python Package Index to find packages of interest to you.\n\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\n\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.\n\n\nWhy should you enroll in this course?\nOne reason: Muharrem Aydın.

      "description": "Keras is an (Open source Neural Network library written in Python) Deep Learning library for fast, efficient training of Deep Learning models. It is a minimal, highly modular framework that runs on both CPUs and GPUs, and allows you to put your ideas into action in the shortest possible time. Because it is lightweight and very easy to use, Keras has gained quite a lot of popularity in a very short time.\n\nThis comprehensive 3-in-1 course takes a step-by-step practical approach to implement fast and efficient Deep Learning models: Projects on Image Processing, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning. Initially, you’ll learn backpropagation, install and configure Keras and understand callbacks and for customizing the process. You’ll build, train, and run fully-connected, Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. You’ll also solve Supervised and Unsupervised learning problems using images, text and time series. Moving further, you’ll use concepts, intuitive understating and applications of Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks. Finally, you’ll build projects on Image Processing, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning and build cutting-edge Deep Learning models in a simple, easy to understand way.\nTowards the end of this course, you'll get to grips with the basics of Keras to implement fast and efficient Deep Learning models: Projects on Image Processing, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Deep Learning with Keras, covers implementing deep learning neural networks with Python. Keras is a high-level neural network library written in Python and runs on top of either Theano or TensorFlow. It is a minimal, highly modular framework that runs on both CPUs and GPUs, and allows you to put your ideas into action in the shortest possible time. This course will help you get started with the basics of Keras, in a highly practical manner.\nThe second course, Advanced Deep Learning with Keras, covers Deep learning with one of it's most popular frameworks: Keras. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to deep learning. We start by presenting some famous success stories and a brief recap of the most common concepts found in machine learning. Then, we introduce neural networks and the optimization techniques to train them. We’ll show you how to get ready with Keras API to start training deep learning models, both on CPU and on GPU. Then, we present two types of neural architecture: convolutional and recurrent neural networks. First, we present a well-known use case of deep learning: recommender systems, where we try to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" that a user would give to an item. Then, we introduce an interesting subject called style transfer. Deep learning has this ability to transform images based on a set of inputs, so we’ll morph an image with a style image to combine them into a very realistic result. In the third section, we present techniques to train on very small datasets. This comprises transfer learning, data augmentation, and hyperparameter search, to avoid overfitting and to preserve the generalization property of the network. Finally, we complete this course by what Yann LeCun, Director at Facebook, considered as the biggest breakthrough in Machine Learning of the last decade: Generative Adversarial Networks. These networks are amazingly good at capturing the underlying distribution of a set of images to generate new images.\nThe third course, Keras Deep Learning Projects, covers Projects on Image Processing, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning. This course will show you how to leverage the power of Keras to build and train high performance, high accuracy deep learning models, by implementing practical projects in real-world domains. Spanning over three hours, this course will help you master even the most advanced concepts in deep learning and how to implement them with Keras. You will train CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks using real-world training datasets. These datasets will be from domains such as Image Processing and Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning and more. By the end of this highly practical course, you will be well-versed with deep learning and its implementation with Keras. By the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge you need to train your own deep learning models to solve different kinds of problems.\nTowards the end of this course, you'll get to grips with the basics of Keras to implement fast and efficient Deep Learning models: Projects on Image Processing, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning.\nAbout the Authors\nAntonio Gulli is a software executive and business leader with a passion for establishing and managing global technological talent, innovation, and execution.

The principle of GIGO (“garbage in, garbage out”) applies here dramatically well. Build a model with appropriate distributions that clearly reflect the statistical nature of your variables and you will end up with a robust model to withstand reality testing. Build a model with lousily chosen distributions and your model will be as weak and questionable as any of your input variables.\nThis course starts by introducing a decision tree as a structure to help decide on multiple distributions. The world of statistical distribution functions is endless. @RISK uses some 97 different distribution functions to choose from. And this is not the end of it, since you can create, as we will show, your own distributions.",

Login Module\nIn this module, the admin will enter the password to enter into the system. The the python code will check if the entered password is correct or not. If it is correct, it will open the next form. We will use python if condition and user defined functions to check login.\n\n\n2. Training Module\nIn this module, the admin will use haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file to detect the human face shown in the webcam. The camera is capture is created using OpenCv. The captured image contverted to gray scale and Cascade Classifier algorithm will detect any face available in the captured image. If face is available, it will automatically create a directory and store the faces in 1.png, 2.png.... like that till the given number for training. If the face is not detected, then the system will not save the image file.\n\n\n3. Attendance Module\nThe member will show their face in the web cam. Now the system will create a LBPHFaceRecognizer model using cv2 library and this model will be trained using the existing dataset we already created image and label set. Then this model will predict with the web cam face and if the person is there in the trained database, it will record the attendance for the person. The attendance will be recorded only if the person is showing their face first time in the current date. If the person is showing their face more than one time, the system will not record the attendance. If a new person is showing their face, it will show unknown person message.\n\n\n4. Reports Module\nIn the reports module, the system will show the attendance records of all the day. The admin can select a particular date from the date select control, the system will show the attendance for the selected date.\n\n\nBy doing this course, you will learn how to create a complete python GUI project using face recognition of OpenCV Library and use LBPHFaceRecognizer model. You will also learn how to create database, tables and insert records from the user interface. You will learn how to generate reports from the database and how to connect GUI and python code.\n\n\nThank you for your interest in this course...\n\n\nI will see you in the course...",

The purpose of this course is to equip you with the newest methods that are applied in\nMachine Learning by Using Microsoft Excel. It will introduce you to a different way of thinking about\ndata science and machine learning. This is a good way to start a career in Machine Learning since you\nwill understand some initial concepts and gain some hands-on experience on it. I am extremely happy\nshare with you everything that I know about Machine Learning with Excel. I promise you it is going to be\nworth it and you will gain a valuable set of knowledge and skills by attending this course.\nThis is the only course in Udemy where Machine Learning is applied in Microsoft Excel. The reason why\nwe chose to go with Excel is because we know that many of you are already familiar with it. We will start\nfrom ground zero and together we will continuously develop new skills from the beginning to the end of\nthis course. In this course together we will implement a complete data science project from start to\nfinish using Credit Risk Data. For this course we have data for around 40,000 consumers and a lot of\ncharacteristics about them such as: their level of education, their age, their marital status, where they\nlive, if they own a home, and other useful details. We will get our hands dirty with these data and\nexplore them in depth and you can practice all this on your own too. Moreover, you will gain access to\nvaluable resources such as lectures, homework, quizzes, slides as well as some literature review in\nregard to the modelling approaches. Let’s go ahead now and see how the course structure looks like!",

Even though they don't want to go deep with all those mathematical complexities, they are still interested to learn what's going on behind the scenes at least in a shallow Layman's perspective way.\n\n\nIn this course, we are focusing mainly on the second kind of learners.\n\n\nThat's why this is a special kind of course. Here we discuss the basics of Machine learning and the Mathematics of Statistical Regression which powers almost all of the the Machine Learning Algorithms.\n\n\nWe will have exercises for regression in both manual plain mathematical calculations and then compare the results with the ones we got using ready-made python functions.\n\n\nHere is the list of contents that are included in this course.\n\n\nIn the first session, we will set-up the computer for doing the basic machine learning python exercises in your computer. We will install anaconda, the python framework. Then we will discuss about the components included in it. For manual method, a spreadsheet program like MS Excel is enough.\n\n\nBefore we proceed for those who are new to python, we have included few sessions in which we will learn the very basics of python programming language. We will learn Assignment, Flow control, Lists and Tuples, Dictionaries and Functions in python. We will also have a quick peek of the Python library called Numpy which is used for doing matrix calculations which is very useful for machine learning and also we will have an overview of Matplotlib which is a plotting library in python used for drawing graphs.\n\n\nIn the third session, we will discuss the basics of machine learning and different types of data.\n\n\nIn the next session we will learn a statistics technique called Central Tendency Analysis which finds out a most suitable single central value that attempts to describe a set of data and its behaviour. In statistics, the three common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. We will find mean, median, and mode using both manual calculation method and also using python functions.\n\n\nAfter that we will try the statistics techniques called variance and standard deviation. Variance of a dataset measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average or central value. The Standard Deviation is a measure of how much these spread out numbers are. We will at first try the variance and standard deviation manually using plain mathematical calculations. After that, we will implement a python program to find both these values for the same dataset and we will verify the results.\n\n\nThen comes a simple yet very useful technique called percentile. In statistics, a percentile is a score below which a given percentage of scores in a distribution falls. For easy understanding, we will try an example with manual calculation of percentile using raw data set at first and later we will do it with the help of python functions. We will then double-check the results\n\n\nAfter that we will learn about distributions. It describes the grouping or the density of the samples in a dataset. There are two types. Normal Distribution where probability of x is highest at centre and lowest in the ends whereas in Uniform Distribution probability of x is constant. We will try both these distributions using visualization of data. We will do the calculation using manual calculation methods and also using python language.\n\n\nThere is a value called z score or standard score in statistics which helps us to determine where the value lies in the distribution. For z score also at first we will try calculation using python functions. Later the z score will be calculated with manual methods and will compare the results.\n\n\nThose were the case of a single valued dataset. That is the dataset containing only a single column of data. For multi-variable dataset, we have to calculate the regression or the relation between the columns of data. At first we will visualize the data, analyse its form and structure using a scatter plot graph.\n\n\nThen as the first type of regression analysis we will start with an introduction to simple Linear Regression. At first we will manually find the co-efficient of correlation using manual calculation and will store the results. After that we will find the slope equation using the obtained results. And then using the slope equation, we will predict future values. This prediction is the basic and important feature of all Machine Learning Systems. Where we give the input variable and the system will predict the output variable value.\n\n\nThen we will repeat all these using Python Numpy library Methods and will do the future value prediction and later will compare the results. We will also discuss the scenarios which we can consider as a strong Linear Regression or weak Linear Regression.\n\n\nThen we will see another type of regression analysis technique called as Polynomial Linear Regression which is best suited for finding the relation between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y.\n\n\nThe regression line in the graph will be a straight line with slope for Simple Linear Regression and for Polynomial Linear Regression, it will be a curve.\n\n\nIn the coming sessions, we will have a brief introduction about polynomial linear regression and the visualization of the modified dataset with x and y values. Using python we will then find the polynomial regression co-efficient value, the r2 value and also we will do future value prediction using python numpy library.\n\n\nThen we will repeat the same using the plain old manual calculation method. At first we have to manually find the Standard Deviation components. Then later we will substitute these SD components in the equation to find a, b and c values. using these a,b,c values we will then find the final polynomial regression equation. This equation will enable us to do a manual prediction for future values.\n\n\nAnd after that, here comes the Multiple regression. Here in this regression we can consider multiple number of independent x variables and one independent y variable. We will have an introduction about this type of regression. We will make necessary changes to our dataset to match the multiple regression requirement.\n\n\nSince our dataset is getting more complex by the introduction of multiple independent variable columns, it may not be able to be managed by using a plain array for the dataset. We will use a csv or comma separated values file to save the dataset. We will have an exercise to read data from a csv file and save the data in corresponding data-frames. Once we have the data imported to our python program, we will do a visualization using a new library called seaborn which is a derivative of the scikitlearn library.\n\n\nUsing the python numpy and scikitlearn library, multiple regression can be done very easily. Just use the method and pass in the required parameters. Rest will be done by the python library itself. We will find the regression object and then using that we can do prediction for future values.\n\n\nBut with manual calculation, things will start getting complex. Its a lengthy calculation which needs to be done in multiple steps. In the first step we will have an introduction about the equations that we are going to use in the manual method and also we will find the mean values. Then in the second step we will find the components that are required to find the a,b and c values. Then in the third step, we will find the a,b and c values. And in the final step, using a,b,c values we will find the multiple regression equation and using this equation we will do future value prediction of our dataset. We will also try to get the value of the co-efficient of regression.\n\n\nThat's all about the popular regression methods that are included in the course. Now we can go ahead with a very important topic in data preparation for machine learning. Many machine learning algorithms love to have input values which are scaled to a standard range. We will learn a technique called data normalization or standardization in which all the different ranges of data values will be scaled down to fit within a range of 0 to 1. This will improve the performance of the algorithms very much compared to a non scaled dataset.\n\n\nFor normalization also, just like the regression examples, we will at first try the normalization using python code which will be very easy to generate values. Then later we will repeat this with plain old school type of mathematical calculations.\n\n\nIn the final session, we will discuss more resources which you can follow for going further from the point that we have already learned.\n\n\nThat's all about the topics which are currently included in this quick course. The code, notepad and jupyter notebook files used in this course has been uploaded and shared in a folder. I will include the link to download them in the last session or the resource section of this course. You are free to use the code in your projects with no questions asked.\n\n\nAlso after completing this course, you will be provided with a course completion certificate which will add value to your portfolio.\nSo that's all for now, see you soon in the class room. Happy learning and have a great time.",

      "description": "The most common question you’ll be asked in your career as a data scientist is: What was/is/will be the effect of X? In many roles, it’s the only question you’ll be asked. So it makes sense to learn how to answer it well.\nThis course teaches you how to identify these “treatment effects” or \"causal effects\". It teaches you how to think about identifying causal relationships from first principles. You'll learn to ask:\nWhat does the data say by itself?\nWhat do I know about the world that the data doesn’t know?\nWhat happens when I combine that knowledge with the data?\nThis course teaches you how to approach these three questions, starting with a blank page. It teaches you to combine your knowledge of how the world works with data to find novel solutions to thorny data analysis problems.\nThis course doesn't teach a \"cookbook\" of methods or some fixed procedure. It teaches you to think through identification problems step-by-step from first principles.\nAs for specifics:\nThis course takes you through various weak assumptions that bound the treatment effect—oftentimes, the relevant question is just: “Is the treatment effect positive?”—and stronger assumptions that pin the treatment effect down to a single value. We learn what the data alone—without any assumptions—tells us about treatment effects, and what we can learn from common assumptions, like:\nRandom treatment assignment (Experimentation)\nConditional independence assumptions (Inverse propensity weighting or regression analysis)\nExclusion restrictions (Instrumental variable assumptions)\nRepeated Measurement assumptions\nParallel Trends (Difference-in-difference)\nAnd many assumptions you will probably not see in other courses, like:\nMonotone instrumental variables\nMonotone confounding\nMonotone treatment selection\nMonotone treatment response\nMonotone trends\n(Why do they all include “monotone” in the name? The answer to that question is beyond the scope of this course.)\nLectures include lecture notes, which make it easy to review the math step by step. The course also includes quizzes and assignments to practice using and applying the material.\nMy background: I have a PhD in Economics from the University of Wisconsin — Madison and have worked primarily in the tech industry. I’m currently a Principal Data Scientist, working mainly on demand modeling and experimentation analysis problems—both examples of treatment effect estimation! I am from sunny San Diego, California, USA.\nI hope you’ll try the Preview courses and enroll in the full course! I’m always available for Q/A.\n-Zach",

The importance of data lies in the fact that it allows us to look at our history and predict the future.\nData Science is the field that deals with collecting, sorting, organizing and also analyzing huge amounts of data. This data is then used to understand the current and future trends. This field borrows techniques and theories from across multiple fields such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, etc. It also aids other domains such as machine learning, data mining, databases and visualization.\nData Scientists are gaining importance and are also earning higher salaries, which means this is the right time to become a data scientist. While, it might seem easy, sorting data, these scientists are responsible for writing important algorithms and programs to help sort and analyze the data – and this isn’t an easy task.\nHowever, we’ve done everything we can to make it as simple as possible. In this beginner course to data visualization, you’ll get started with important concepts of data science.

In general, AI technology is evolving and is eventually going to be used to help build structures on other planets.\n\nThis course will cover the basics of how to use Apache's OpenNLP to implement the above and also simplify things so you will realize that developing your own AI is not as complicated as it seems.\n\n\nWhile developing AI is popular in Python, Java is still being actually used by many businesses for developing AI as much as in Python. This course has been specially made for those who are too lazy to learn Python and would like to utilize their existing skill in Java and harness all the strengths and benefits of Java and love optimization and high performance.\n\n\nWarning:\nThis course does not cover data science at the moment since the course is currently focused on implementation rather than theory.",

For all that and more, all you have to do is watch. I am aware of the new artificial intelligence that will make our lives easier and I am honored to compile it for you. Keeping up with the incredible change of technology, actually following it is an important step. Artificial Intelligence has once become an all-encompassing term for application software as it performs complex tasks that require human input, such as communicating with customers online or playing chess. The term is often used interchangeably with sub-branches such as machine learning and deep learning. However, these are different concepts. For example, machine learning focuses on building systems that learn or improve performance based on the data consumed.

Unfortunately, much as we would like to, it is not possible for us at Loonycorn to respond to individual questions from students:-(\nWe're super small and self-funded with only 2-3 people developing technical video content. Our mission is to make high-quality courses available at super low prices.\nThe only way to keep our prices this low is to *NOT offer additional technical support over email or in-person*. The truth is, direct support is hugely expensive and just does not scale.\nWe understand that this is not ideal and that a lot of students might benefit from this additional support. Hiring resources for additional support would make our offering much more expensive, thus defeating our original purpose.\nIt is a hard trade-off.\nThank you for your patience and understanding!",

      "description": "(More E-Content will be added on regular basis).\nQuiz Topics covered in this course\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.\nHow does AI work?\nAs the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular.\nIn general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.\nAI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.\nLearning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.\n\n\nA guide to artificial intelligence\n4 main types of artificial intelligence: Explained\n7 key benefits of AI for business\nCriteria for success in AI: Industry best practices\nReasoning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.\nSelf-correction processes. This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.\nWhy is artificial intelligence important?\nAI is important because it can give enterprises insights into their operations that they may not have been aware of previously and because, in some cases, AI can perform tasks better than humans. Particularly when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks like analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors.\nThis has helped fuel an explosion in efficiency and opened the door to entirely new business opportunities for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, it would have been hard to imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis, but today Uber has become one of the largest companies in the world by doing just that. It utilizes sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict when people are likely to need rides in certain areas, which helps proactively get drivers on the road before they're needed. As another example, Google has become one of the largest players for a range of online services by using machine learning to understand how people use their services and then improving them. In 2017, the company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, pronounced that Google would operate as an \"AI first\" company.\nToday's largest and most successful enterprises have used AI to improve their operations and gain advantage on their competitors.\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence?\nArtificial neural networks and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are quickly evolving, primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes predictions more accurately than humanly possible.\nWhile the huge volume of data being created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications that use machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. As of this writing, the primary disadvantage of using AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data that AI programming requires.\nAdvantages\nGood at detail-oriented jobs;\nReduced time for data-heavy tasks;\nDelivers consistent results; and\nAI-powered virtual agents are always available.\nDisadvantages\nExpensive;\nRequires deep technical expertise;\nLimited supply of qualified workers to build AI tools;\nOnly knows what it's been shown; and\nLack of ability to generalize from one task to another.\n\n\nYOU WILL LEARN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, DEEP LEARNING, MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE THROUGH TESTS AND TUTORIALS, ALL MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS ARE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND LOGIC BASED, THESE QUESTIONS WILL INCREASE YOUR SKILL TO SOLVE APTITUDE QUESTIONS ALSO THEY WILL  BE HELPFUL FOR YOUR EXAM PREPARATION, ALSO LIFETIME SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE IS THERE FOR ANY QUERIES, SO WHAT YOU ARE WAITING FOR, DO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR COURSE AND GET A PRACTICE DONE.\n\n\nYOU WILL LEARN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, DEEP LEARNING, MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE THROUGH TESTS AND TUTORIALS, ALL MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS ARE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND LOGIC BASED, THESE QUESTIONS WILL INCREASE YOUR SKILL TO SOLVE APTITUDE QUESTIONS ALSO THEY WILL  BE HELPFUL FOR YOUR EXAM PREPARATION, ALSO LIFETIME SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE IS THERE FOR ANY QUERIES, SO WHAT YOU ARE WAITING FOR, DO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR COURSE AND GET A PRACTICE DONE.\nTHESE QUESTIONS WILL INCREASE YOUR SKILL TO SOLVE APTITUDE QUESTIONS ALSO THEY WILL  BE HELPFUL FOR YOUR EXAM PREPARATION, ALSO LIFETIME SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE IS THERE FOR ANY QUERIES, SO WHAT YOU ARE WAITING FOR, DO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR COURSE AND GET A PRACTICE DONE.\nYOU WILL LEARN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, DEEP LEARNING, MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE THROUGH TESTS AND TUTORIALS, ALL MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS ARE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND LOGIC BASED",

      "description": "In recent years, we've seen a resurgence in AI, or artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\nMachine learning has led to some amazing results, like being able to analyze medical images and predict diseases on-par with human experts.\nGoogle's AlphaGo program was able to beat a world champion in the strategy game go using deep reinforcement learning.\nMachine learning is even being used to program self driving cars, which is going to change the automotive industry forever. Imagine a world with drastically reduced car accidents, simply by removing the element of human error.\nGoogle famously announced that they are now \"machine learning first\", and companies like NVIDIA and Amazon have followed suit, and this is what's going to drive innovation in the coming years.\nMachine learning is embedded into all sorts of different products, and it's used in many industries, like finance, online advertising, medicine, and robotics.\nIt is a widely applicable tool that will benefit you no matter what industry you're in, and it will also open up a ton of career opportunities once you get good.\nMachine learning also raises some philosophical questions. Are we building a machine that can think? What does it mean to be conscious? Will computers one day take over the world?\nThis course is all about ensemble methods.\nIn particular, we will study the Random Forest and AdaBoost algorithms in detail.\nTo motivate our discussion, we will learn about an important topic in statistical learning, the bias-variance trade-off. We will then study the bootstrap technique and bagging as methods for reducing both bias and variance simultaneously.\nAll the materials for this course are FREE. You can download and install Python, NumPy, and SciPy with simple commands on Windows, Linux, or Mac.\nThis course focuses on \"how to build and understand\", not just \"how to use\". Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It's not about \"remembering facts\", it's about \"seeing for yourself\" via experimentation. It will teach you how to visualize what's happening in the model internally. If you want more than just a superficial look at machine learning models, this course is for you.",

      "description": "Allow me to be forthright on this: We all are inclined to pick that long and broad course.  I call them 'little by little, everything to the middle' courses. Those courses are indeed good and have their place in the portfolio. However, in our limited time they do not get finished and sometimes they are too broad to guide you to create something real and useful. And that is a fact backed by statistics of almost any online learning platform.\nHere is my recomendation for you today: Why not to learn once for yourself, and not for a future hope or prospect? Why not to let data science do something for you right away, right now? Stop a moment please and do think about this!\nWelcome to 'Python Real World Data Science Mega Project: Car Buyer App'\nThis course is, where your data science knowledge will evolve into a practical programming skill that creates solutions for real-world. You will create an application, that will recommend your next car, saving you time and effort while contributing to your personal finances. That is the most practical result you can get from a course.\nThis will be achieved utilizing a comprehensive approach, so we will go through each and every step of problem solving in data science. From exploring the real world to definition of the problem that will ultimately end up in a strategy to solve it. We will carefully craft the implementation with many real life scenarios and examples and when we come up with a solution, we still will not stop.\nWe will look for ways to exploit our results for other useful products. In the meantime, we will continue to revise our strategy and implementation to perfect our results.\nThroughout the course you will experience, how 'being able to extract the data you want from web, analyzing it the way you want, and the synergy you can create by these two steps' is an invaluable capability for a data scientist. We will use SCRAPY (framework) to extract data from popular car sites around the world and develop our data science application mainly using PANDAS (library).\nThis course is within the framework of a series to master web-scraping and Scrapy from basic skills to advanced concepts, from deep insights on the tools to the most practical real-life data science example utilizing web scraping on this platform, a depth and perspective unique to this course series that collectively have gathered more than 10000 students in months.\nLet me tell you forthright: The approach depicted, implemented and taught here is unique to this course. In other words, you can not compare this course with others, because the focus, the implementation and the end results will be different.\nHere, you will learn while you create a high-value backend application that you can practically use and benefit.  So it is not only about learning how a tool works but also how it is applied in data science context in real-life.\nFinally, a good course is the one that will make you capable and motivated to go further in that field, it will increase your self-confidence to tackle the real-world issues. This uniquely structured and implemented project-based-course exactly aims and does that.\nJoin and create a complete end to end data science project, and all of this with no risk, thanks to Udemy's guarantee policy.\nBe sure to watch the course video on this very landing page.\nSee you in the lectures!\n\n\nVery Respectfully,\nTarkan Aguner",

Actually, these were the question I had in mind when I designed the curriculum of this course. As you can see below, the curriculum is divided into three main sections. Although this course doesn't have a focus on the basic concepts of statistics, some of the most important concepts are covered in the first section of the course.\nThe two other sections have their focus on the initial and the exploratory data analysis phases respectively. Initial data analysis (or IDA for short) is where we clean and shape the data into a form suitable for the planned methods. This is also where we make sure the data makes sense from a statistical point of view. In the IDA section I present tools and methods that will help you figure out if the data was collected properly and if it is worthy of being analyzed.\nOn the other hand, the exploratory data analysis (EDA) section offers techniques to find out if the data can answer your analytical questions, or in other words, if the data has a relevant story to tell. This will spare you from investing time and effort into a project that will not deliver the results you hoped for. In an ideal case the results of EDA may confirm that the planned analysis is worth it and that there are insights to be gained from that dataset and project.\nIf you are interested in statistical methods and R tools that help you bridge the gap between data collection and the confirmatory data analysis (CDA), then this program is for you.

      "description": "Welcome to Macroeconomic Analysis: Investigating Inflation Trend with R course. This is a comprehensive data analysis course where you will be guided step by step on how to perform complex data analysis and visualisation on inflation data using R programming language. This course is a perfect combination of macroeconomics and statistics as you will learn all things about inflation from both perspectives. In the introduction session, you will learn basic fundamentals of R programming language, such as getting to know its use cases and features that R has but Python does not have. Then, continue by learning the basic fundamentals of macroeconomics and inflation, using case study examples to understand inflation better as well as getting to know factors that cause inflation. Afterward, you will also learn how to calculate inflation rate and interest rate as well as understanding the relationship between both of them, especially why in most cases raising the interest rate can help to lower the inflation rate. Before starting the project, you will be guided step by step on how to set up all necessary tools, such as installing R programming language and R Studio which is the IDE that will be used in our project. Meanwhile, for the data source, we are going to get our datasets from Kaggle which is one of the largest data science learning platforms that has a lot of datasets that can be downloaded for free. In the project section, you are going to be conducting analysis and visualisation on two different datasets from Kaggle. At the end of the project, you are also going to learn how to deliver data insights and summaries which highlight all your findings during the project. Last but not least, at the end of the course, we will also go over several solutions that can be implemented to lower inflation rate like effective monetary policy, cutting of unnecessary government spending, and fiscal responsibility.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves these questions. Why should we learn about inflation? Why should we analyze inflation data using the R programming language? Well, let me ask you this question first, have you ever asked yourself, why a cup of coffee that cost two dollars five years ago but now the same product with the same quality costs three dollars? Or maybe why a gaming desk cost you a hundred dollars three years ago but today the same product from the same brand costs you two hundred dollars. Well, those are a few examples of inflation in real life where your cash today is no longer as valuable as it used to be a couple years ago and you might be wondering why? Well inflation reduces a currency’s purchasing power as what we discussed in the previous example where two dollars could buy you a cup of coffee five years ago but today you need three dollars. There are many factors out there that can potentially cause inflation however the most common factor is the oversupply of cash where there is more cash in the circulation than the actual demand. Let me give you an example, let’s say there is an island with population of a thousand people and there are only a hundred coins in the circulation, obviously in this case, the coin is very valuable as they are a thousand people who want to get those coins but there are only a hundred coins available but what if I told you the island’s ministry of treasury decided to create nine hundred more coins, so now there are a thousand coins in the circulation, obviously, now the value of one coin is definitely not as valuable as it used to be. Hence, what we are going to do in this course is to use data to investigate inflation patterns as well as forecast the inflation rate in the future based on the historical data.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from the course:\nLearn basic fundamentals of macroeconomics and inflation, such as getting to know factors that cause inflation and example of inflation in real life\nLearn basic fundamentals of R programming language and getting to know its use cases\nLearn how to calculate inflation and interest rate\nLearn how high interest impacts the market from several perspectives, such as cost of borrowing, consumer spending, real estate market and stock market\nLearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\nLearn how to upload and import data to RStudio Cloud\nLearn how to clean data and remove all NA values from dataset using R\nLearn how to find countries with highest inflation rate using R\nLearn how to visualize inflation data for a specific country using scatter plot in R\nInvestigate inflation trend in 2008 economic crisis using R\nLearn how to compare inflation between two countries using R\nLearn how to forecast future inflation using R\nLearn how to find correlation between inflation and interest rate, then, visualise the correlation using scatter plot\nLearn how to find correlation between inflation and unemployment rate, then, visualise the correlation using scatter plot\nLearn several policies that can be implemented to lower inflation rate\nLearn how to analyse commodity prices using R\nLearn how to find correlation between energy price and food price",

Apache Spark has emerged as the most important and promising Machine Learning tool and currently a stronger challenger of the Hadoop ecosystem. In this course, you’ll learn about the major branches of AI and get familiar with several core models of Deep Learning in its natural way.\n\nThis comprehensive 3-in-1 course is a fast-paced guide to implementing practical hands-on examples, streamlining Deep Learning with Apache Spark. You’ll begin by exploring Deep Learning Neural Networks using some of the most popular industrial Deep Learning frameworks. You’ll apply built-in Machine Learning libraries within Spark, also explore libraries that are compatible with TensorFlow and Keras. Next, you’ll create a deep network with multiple layers to perform computer vision and improve cybersecurity with Deep Reinforcement Learning. Finally, you’ll use a generative adversarial network for training and create highly distributed algorithms using Spark.\nBy the end of this course, you'll develop fast, efficient distributed Deep Learning models with Apache Spark.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Deep Learning with Apache Spark, covers deploying efficient deep learning models with Apache Spark. The tutorial begins by explaining the fundamentals of Apache Spark and deep learning. You will set up a Spark environment to perform deep learning and learn about the different types of neural net and the principles of distributed modeling (model- and data-parallelism, and more). You will then implement deep learning models (such as CNN, RNN, LTSMs) on Spark, acquire hands-on experience of what it takes, and get a general feeling for the complexity we are dealing with. You will also see how you can use libraries such as Deeplearning4j to perform deep learning on a distributed CPU and GPU setup. By the end of this course, you'll have gained experience by implementing models for applications such as object recognition, text analysis, and voice recognition. You will even have designed human expert games.\nThe second course, Apache Spark Deep Learning Recipes, covers over 35 recipes that streamline eep learning with Apache Spark. This video course starts offs by explaining the process of developing a neural network from scratch using deep learning libraries such as Tensorflow or Keras. It focuses on the pain points of convolution neural networks. We’ll predict fire department calls with Spark ML and Apple stock market cost with LSTM. We’ll walk you through the steps to classify chatbot conversation data for escalation. By the end of the video course, you'll have all the basic knowledge about apache spark.\nThe third course, Mastering Deep Learning using Apache Spark, covers designing Deep Learning models to edge industrial-grade apps. You’ll begin with building deep learning networks to deal with speech data and explore tricks to solve NLP problems and classify video frames using RNN and LSTMs. You’ll also learn to implement the anomaly detection model that leverages reinforcement learning techniques to improve cybersecurity. Moving on, you’ll explore some more advanced topics by performing prediction classification on image data using the GAN encoder and decoder. Then you’ll configure Spark to use multiple workers and CPUs to distribute your Neural Network training. Finally, you’ll track progress, solve the most common problems in your neural network, and debug your models that run within the distributed Spark engine.\nBy the end of this course, you'll develop fast, efficient distributed Deep Learning models with Apache Spark.\nAbout the Authors\n● Tomasz Lelek is a Software Engineer, programming mostly in Java and Scala.

      "description": "Welcome to Detecting Fake News with Machine Learning course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a fake news detection system using feature engineering, logistic regression, and other models. This course is a perfect combination between Python and machine learning, making it an ideal opportunity to enhance your data science skills. The course will be mainly focusing on three major aspects, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the fake news dataset from multiple angles, the second one is predictive modeling where you will learn how to build fake news detection system using big data, and the third one is to mitigate potential biases from the fake news detection models. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of fake news detection models, such as getting to know ethical considerations and common challenges. Then, in the next session, we are going to have a case study where you will learn how to implement feature engineering on a simple dataset to predict if a news is real or fake. In the case study you will specifically learn how to identify the presence of specific words which are frequently used in fake news and calculate the probability of a news article is fake based on the track record of the news publisher. Afterward, you will also learn about several factors that contribute to the widespread of fake news & misinformation, for examples like confirmation bias, social media echo chamber, and clickbait incentives. Once you have learnt all necessary knowledge about the fake news detection model, we will begin the project. Firstly you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. In addition to that, you will also learn how to find and download fake news dataset from Kaggle, Once, everything is ready, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section The project will be consisted of three main parts, the first part is the data analysis and visualization where you will explore the dataset from various angles, in the second part, you will learn step by step on how to build a fake news detection system using logistic regression and feature engineering, meanwhile, in the third part, you will learn how to evaluate the model’s accuracy. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will learn how to mitigate potential bias in fake news detection systems by diversifying training data and conducting fairness audits.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build fake news detection systems? Well, here is my answer. In the past couple of years, we have witnessed a significant increase in the number of people using social media and, consequently, an exponential growth in the volume of news and information shared online. While this presents incredible opportunities for communication, however, this surge in information sharing has come at a cost, the rapid spread of unverified, misleading, or completely fabricated news stories. These stories can sway public opinion, incite fear, and even have political and social consequences. In a world where information is power, the ability to distinguish between accurate reporting and deceptive content is very valuable. Last but not least, knowing how to build a complex machine learning model can potentially open a lot of opportunities.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of fake news detection model\nCase study: applying feature engineering to predict if a news title is real or fake\nLearn factors that contribute to the widespread of fake news & misinformation\nLearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\nLearn how to clean dataset by removing missing rows and duplicate values\nLearn how to perform news source credibility\nLearn how to detect keywords associated with fake news\nLearn how to perform news title and length analysis\nLearn how to detect sensationalism in fake news\nLearn how to detect emotion in fake new with NLP\nLearn how to build fake news detection model with feature engineering\nLearn how to build fake news detection model with logistic regression\nLearn how to build fake news detection model with Random Forest\nLearn how to evaluate fake news detection model with confusion matrix\nLearn how to perform fairness audit with demographic parity difference\nLearn how to mitigate potential bias in fake news detection",

We will go beyond the use of the API which will allow you to continue your journey in machine learning and/or differentiable programming with more confidence.\n\n\nThis course is divided into three parts.\n\n\nIn the first part, we will implement (in Python, from scratch) our own differentiable programming framework, which will be very similar to PyTorch. This will allow you to understand how PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc. work. Then, we will focus on PyTorch and see the basic tensor operations, the calculation of gradients and the use of graphics cards (GPUs).\n\n\nIn the second part, we will focus on gradient descent algorithms (essential for training neural networks). We will implement the simulator of a ballistic problem and see how to use the power of PyTorch to solve an optimization problem (this pedagogical problem can be easily extended to real problems, such as fluid mechanics simulations, for those who wish). We will also see how to use optimizers and how to combine them with schedulers to make them even more efficient.\n\n\nFinally, we will tackle neural networks. We will solve an image classification problem, first with an MLP, and then with a CNN.\n\n\nIf this program enchants you, don't wait any longer!",

      "description": "Creating reports is a standard task in the modern working environment. Pretty much every office worker has to do it from time to time, some of us even daily.\nTherefore it makes perfect sense to be an expert at it. This can save you a lot of time, make your manager happy and you can be of great help to your colleagues.\nTherefore I will demonstrate in this course how you can use Python and the main package ReportLab to easily create reports and to even automate the process for fast reporting of multiple similar data files.\nOur target output file type will be the pdf which anybody of us knows and uses regularly.\nThe portable document format, or PDF, is the standard for document sharing since decades. Its cross platform compatibility, the ease of printing and the variety of written and visual content it can handle, make the pdf one of the most important document formats.\nReading a PDF is easy as it gets, however, generating a PDF document can get complicated.  Text editing software and many interactive apps are able to generate PDFs – data analysis software usually makes great use of this feature too. On the user's side, PDF generation is just a matter of some mouse clicks. However, in the background the PDF document is written in the PostScript language.\nIf you are working on your own applications, or if you create a data analysis with a programming language such as Python, then figuring out PDF generation is not as straight forward. You would need an interpreter which translates your code to PostScript and then a PDF document is generated. Sometimes, this process relies on additional software.\nIf you use python the ReportLab package could be the right tool for you. ReportLab lets you directly create documents in PDF format without any intervening steps. This means that your applications can generate reports very fast, sometimes much faster than stand alone report writing software. A great advantage, especially when you want to automate the process. Besides text, ReportLab also handles charts, graphs, data tables, model outputs – basically anything you can produce with python.\nIn order to follow along with this course the only skill you need is some beginner level python. So if you know how to install and import packages, handle lists, and how to write simple loops and functions, then you will have no problem keeping up with the course.\nDo not worry if your understanding of python is still not at its fullest - I will make an effort in guiding you through the lectures step by step from setting up your working environment, performing a simple data analysis and writing the code for the actual PDF report generation and automation.\nAlright I hope you will take this chance to bring your reporting skills to the next level!",

      "description": "In today’s competitive world everybody is looking for ways to innovate and make use of new technologies. Web scraping (also called web data extraction or data scraping) provides a solution for those who want to get access to structured web data in an automated fashion. Web scraping is useful if the public website you want to get data from doesn’t have an API, or it does but provides only limited access to the data.\nWeb scraping is the process of collecting structured web data in an automated fashion. It’s also called web data extraction. Some of the main use cases of web scraping include price monitoring, price intelligence, news monitoring, lead generation, and market research among many others.\nIn general, web data extraction is used by people and businesses who want to make use of the vast amount of publicly available web data to make smarter decisions.\nIf you’ve ever copied and pasted information from a website, you’ve performed the same function as any web scraper, only on a microscopic, manual scale. Unlike the mundane, mind-numbing process of manually extracting data, web scraping uses intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet’s seemingly endless frontier.  In this course we are going to extract data using Python and a Python module called Beautiful Soup.",

Which solution will meet these requirements?\n\n\nA. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.\nB. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.\nC. Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.\nD. Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nThe requirements specify the need for routing requests to multiple target groups based on the URL in the request, offloading TLS processing, and preserving the user's IP address for logging.\nLet's evaluate each option:\n* A. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.\n* Application Load Balancer (ALB): Operates at Layer 7 (application layer), which is essential for URL-based routing (path-based or host-based).\n* HTTPS listener: This fulfills the requirement for all traffic to use HTTPS and for TLS processing to be offloaded to the load balancer. ALBs can terminate TLS.\n* Path-based routing rules: This directly addresses the need to route requests based on the URL. ALBs are capable of advanced routing based on URL paths, host headers, HTTP methods, and more.\n* X-Forwarded-For request header: When an ALB processes a request, it adds or appends to the `X-Forwarded-For` header to preserve the client's original IP address. This allows the web server to log the user's true IP, meeting the security logging requirement.\n* This option perfectly aligns with all specified requirements.\n* B. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.\n* While ALBs support HTTPS listeners and X-Forwarded-For, the question specifies routing based on the *URL*, which often implies the path component rather than just the domain (host). Host-based routing is typically used for different domain names. More importantly, you generally don't need an HTTPS listener *for each domain* on an ALB if using Server Name Indication (SNI), as multiple certificates can be associated with a single HTTPS listener. Path-based routing (Option A) is more precise for \"based on the URL\".\n* C. Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.\n* Network Load Balancer (NLB): Operates at Layer 4 (transport layer). NLBs *do not* support path-based or host-based routing rules, as these are Layer 7 features. This immediately makes the option unsuitable for routing based on the URL.\n* While NLBs can handle TLS listeners and preserve client IP addresses (by default), their lack of Layer 7 routing capabilities fails a critical requirement.\n* D. Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.\n* Similar to option C, this option involves a Network Load Balancer. As NLBs operate at Layer 4, they cannot perform Layer 7 routing like host-based or path-based routing. Therefore, this option fails to meet the requirement for URL-based routing.\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only solution that fully satisfies all the stated requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nThe Cloud Infrastructure Team at Nexus Innovations is designing a new service requiring end-to-end encryption with mutual TLS between the client and backend, which must not be decrypted by any intermediate components, using gRPC over TCP port 443, hosted on an Amazon EKS cluster configured with Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to handle thousands of simultaneous connections. Which solution will meet these requirements?\n\n\nA. Install the AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes. Using that controller, configure a Network Load Balancer with a TCP listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the IP addresses of the backend service Pods.\nB. Install the AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes. Using that controller, configure an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the IP addresses of the backend service Pods.\nC. Create a target group. Add the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group as a target Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the target group.\nD. Create a target group. Add the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group as a target. Create a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the target group.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nThe core requirement is that \"The traffic must not be decrypted between the client and the backend of the service,\" and that \"mutual TLS for two-way authentication\" is required. This explicitly mandates TLS passthrough, meaning the load balancer should not terminate the TLS connection.\nLet's analyze the options:\n* A. Install the AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes. Using that controller, configure a Network Load Balancer with a TCP listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the IP addresses of the backend service Pods.\n* Network Load Balancer (NLB) with a TCP listener: An NLB operating with a TCP listener at Layer 4 simply forwards TCP packets without inspecting or decrypting the payload. This enables true TLS passthrough, where the entire TLS handshake (including mutual TLS) occurs directly between the client and the backend Pod. This satisfies the \"no decryption between client and backend\" and \"mutual TLS\" requirements.\n* AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes: This is the recommended way to integrate AWS Load Balancers with Amazon EKS. It allows the NLB to automatically discover and target the IP addresses of Kubernetes Pods, ensuring dynamic scaling with the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. This meets the scalability and EKS integration requirements.\n* gRPC over TCP port 443: Since NLB passes through raw TCP traffic, it is compatible with gRPC over TCP.\n* B. Install the AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes. Using that controller, configure an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the IP addresses of the backend service Pods.\n* Application Load Balancer (ALB) with an HTTPS listener: An ALB operates at Layer 7 and performs TLS termination by default when configured with an HTTPS listener. This means the ALB decrypts the traffic before forwarding it to the backend. This directly violates the requirement that \"The traffic must not be decrypted between the client and the backend.\" While ALB can support mTLS, it does so by terminating mTLS at the ALB, not passing it through end-to-end to the backend.\n* C. Create a target group. Add the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group as a target. Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the target group.\n* Application Load Balancer (ALB) with an HTTPS listener: As explained for Option B, an ALB performs TLS termination, violating the \"no decryption\" requirement.\n* Targeting the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group: This method targets the EC2 instances (nodes) themselves rather than the specific Kubernetes Pods. While possible, it's less direct and efficient for EKS deployments, especially when using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale individual pods. The AWS Load Balancer Controller dynamically targeting pod IPs is the preferred method for EKS.\n* D. Create a target group. Add the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group as a target. Create a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the target group.\n* Network Load Balancer (NLB) with a TLS listener: While NLB can have a TLS listener, an NLB TLS listener *terminates* TLS at the NLB. This is different from a TCP listener, which provides passthrough. Since TLS is terminated at the NLB, it violates the \"no decryption between client and backend\" requirement. For true TLS passthrough, a TCP listener is required.\n* Targeting the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group: Similar to Option C, this is not the most optimal way to integrate with dynamic EKS Pod scaling.\nTherefore, Option A is the only solution that satisfies all the specified requirements, particularly the critical need for end-to-end encryption and mutual TLS without decryption at the load balancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nThe SmartConnect Team at VendingVista Corp manages a global vending machine inventory application in us-east-1, running on an Amazon ECS cluster with an Application Load Balancer, which must be accessed only through AWS Global Accelerator, not directly over the internet. Which solution will meet these requirements?\n\n\nA. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Attach an internet gateway without adding routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port.\nB. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port.\nC. Configure the ALB in a public subnet of the VPAttach an internet gateway. Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the accelerator's IP addresses on the ALB listener port.\nD. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Attach an internet gateway. Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the accelerator's IP addresses on the ALB listener port.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nThe question requires the application to be accessible *only* through AWS Global Accelerator and *not* through a direct connection over the internet to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) endpoint. This implies that the ALB should not have a public IP address or be directly routable from the internet.\nLet's analyze each option:\n* A. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Attach an internet gateway without adding routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port.\n* ALB in a private subnet: This is crucial. Placing the ALB in a private subnet ensures it does not have a public IP address and cannot be directly accessed from the internet. This meets the requirement of preventing direct internet access.\n* Attach an internet gateway without adding routes in the subnet route tables: This is the correct pattern for using AWS Global Accelerator with an internal (private) endpoint. The VPC needs an Internet Gateway (IGW) attached to signify its capability to handle internet traffic. However, *the specific subnet's route table should NOT have a route to the IGW*. This keeps the subnet private, ensuring the ALB is not directly routable from the internet. Global Accelerator uses the AWS backbone to deliver traffic to the internal ALB, bypassing the need for a direct public route for the ALB itself.\n* Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint: This is a standard and necessary step to integrate the ALB with Global Accelerator.\n* Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port: While seemingly broad, for an ALB in a private subnet with no direct internet routing, the *only* way \"inbound traffic from the internet\" can reach it is through a service like Global Accelerator. If Global Accelerator is configured to preserve client IP addresses, the traffic will appear to originate from the client's public IPs, which are \"from the internet\". Therefore, this security group configuration, combined with the private subnet setup, ensures that legitimate traffic delivered by Global Accelerator can reach the ALB, while direct public access is prevented by the network configuration.\n* B. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port.\n* This option is missing the critical step of attaching an Internet Gateway to the VPC. Even for an internal ALB endpoint, the VPC must have an IGW attached for Global Accelerator to be able to route traffic to it. Without an IGW, the VPC is isolated from the internet.\n* C. Configure the ALB in a public subnet of the VPAttach an internet gateway. Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the accelerator's IP addresses on the ALB listener port.\n* ALB in a public subnet with routes to IGW: This directly violates the requirement that the application must *not* be accessible through a direct connection over the internet to the ALB endpoint. If the ALB is in a public subnet, it can be directly accessed from the internet, even if its security group tries to restrict access.\n* D. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Attach an internet gateway. Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the accelerator's IP addresses on the ALB listener port.\n* Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway: This step converts the \"private subnet\" into a public subnet by providing it with a route to the Internet Gateway. This means the ALB could then be directly accessible from the internet, which violates the core requirement of preventing direct internet access to the ALB endpoint. While the security group rule restricting to \"accelerator's IP addresses\" is a good security practice, the underlying network configuration negates the primary security goal.\nConclusion:\nOption A correctly implements the recommended AWS architecture for using Global Accelerator with an internal (private) Application Load Balancer to ensure that the application is accessible *only* via Global Accelerator, preventing direct internet access to the ALB itself. The key elements are the ALB in a private subnet, the VPC having an IGW attached, and critically, the subnet's route table *not* having a direct route to the IGW. This setup forces all internet-originated traffic through Global Accelerator.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Choose Our Certification Exam Prep Courses?\nWhen it comes to passing your certification exam—whether it’s AWS, Microsoft, or Oracle—quality training makes all the difference.

Functioning as a language model integration framework, LangChain's applications align closely with those of language models, spanning document analysis, summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\n\n\nWhat is an LLM?\nA Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on a vast amount of text data. It’s designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives.\nIn this course, I will be using LLMs such as Llama 2 7B and Mistral 7B.\n\n\nWhat is LCEL?\nLangChain Expression Language (LCEL) emerges as a declarative method within the LangChain framework, enabling effortless composition of chains. From its inception, LCEL prioritizes seamless transition from prototypes to production, accommodating a spectrum of complexities, from straightforward \"prompt + LLM\" sequences to intricate chains comprising hundreds of steps. Noteworthy features encompass streaming support for optimal time-to-first-token, asynchronous capabilities for versatile API usage, and optimized parallel execution for reduced latency. LCEL further offers configurations for retries, fallbacks, and access to intermediate results, enhancing reliability and debugging.\n\n\nIn this course you learn\n- Langchain Basics\n- Langchain Expression Language\n- Chains\n- Memory\n- Agents and Tools\n- RAG etc\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nIn this course I won't be using Open Ai API instead I would be using Open source models from hugging face and i will be using windows, kaggle",

      "description": "Exam PL-200: Microsoft Power Platform Functional Consultant\n\n\n80+% Student Passed Exam After Only Studying These Questions. Pass yours, enroll now!\n\n\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nAs part of the Digital Transformation team at Nexus Solutions, you are managing their Microsoft Dataverse instance for prospect tracking. They currently use a business process flow called Prospect Lead Funnel for their Prospect entity. After adding a new 'Lead Type' field to the Prospect entity, you've developed several new business process flows to align with different lead types. Users should be able to switch between these new flows but must be prevented from using the old Prospect Lead Funnel. What are two possible ways to configure the solution to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n\nA. Remove all of the privileges for BPF\nB. Use a business rule to prevent users from switching to BPF\nC. Deactivate BPF\nD. Change the display order of the business process flows to move BPFA to the bottom of the list.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: A C\nExplanation:\nThe goal is to prevent users from using BPFA for Prospect records, while allowing them to use newly configured business process flows based on a selected category.\nLet's evaluate each option:\n* A. Remove all of the privileges for BPF (Correct):\n* Rationale: Business Process Flows are secured using security roles. Users require 'Read' privilege on the 'Business Process Flow' entity for specific BPFs to see and interact with them. By modifying the security roles assigned to users and removing their 'Read' privilege for the BPFA, they will no longer be able to see or select BPFA from the \"Change Process\" dialog or when creating new records. This effectively prevents them from using it.\n* C. Deactivate BPF (Correct):\n* Rationale: Deactivating a Business Process Flow makes it unavailable for selection and use. An inactive BPF cannot be applied to new records, nor can users switch to it for existing records (though existing records might still show the deactivated BPF, users won't be able to progress or switch to it effectively). Since the question states that new BPFs are created and that users \"must not use BPFA,\" deactivating BPFA is a direct and effective way to remove it from active use and selection, allowing the new BPFs to take over the prospect management process based on the category.\n* B. Use a business rule to prevent users from switching to BPF (Incorrect):\n* Rationale: Business rules are primarily designed to apply form logic, validate data, and control field properties (like visibility, requirement, or default values) within an entity form. They do not have the capability to control the selection or switching of business process flows from the \"Change Process\" dialog or at the point of record creation. Their scope is limited to the fields on the form itself.\n* D. Change the display order of the business process flows to move BPFA to the bottom of the list (Incorrect):\n* Rationale: Changing the display order only affects the default BPF shown or the sequence in which BPFs appear in the selection list. While it makes BPFA less prominent, it does not prevent a user from explicitly scrolling down and selecting it. The requirement is that users \"must not use BPFA,\" implying an absolute prevention, which reordering does not achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nThe Sales team at Contoso Inc requires a new data view that is accessible to all users, but company policy strictly forbids the use of custom code for any solutions; where should you create this view?\n\n\nA. List view of the entity\nB. Microsoft Visual Studio\nC. Templates area\nD. Maker portal\n\n\nCorrect Answer: D\nExplanation:\nThe question asks where to create a view that is accessible to all users in an organization without using custom code. This describes the creation of a public or system view.\n1. Maker Portal (D): This is the correct answer. The Power Apps Maker Portal is the modern, central interface for building and customizing all components of the Power Platform, including Dataverse tables and their associated views. A functional consultant would use the Maker Portal to navigate to the specific table (entity) and create a new public view. This is a standard configuration task that does not involve writing code.\n2. List view of the entity (A): This is incorrect. From a list view within a model-driven app, a user can create *personal* views for their own use. However, creating a *public* view that is visible to everyone requires customization permissions and is done through the backend customization tools, not directly from the end-user list view interface.\n3. Microsoft Visual Studio (B): This is incorrect. Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing custom code (like C# plugins or client-side JavaScript). The question explicitly states that the organization does not permit custom code. Creating a view is a configuration task, not a coding task.\n4. Templates area (C): This is incorrect. There is no specific \"Templates area\" in Power Platform for creating views. You can create document templates (Word, Excel), but not view templates in the way implied.\nTherefore, the Maker Portal is the designated and appropriate tool for a functional consultant to create and manage system views for an entire organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nThe learning provider, FutureSkills Academy, operates a Power Apps portal for its paid courses and now wants to add a catalog of free courses. To ensure a seamless experience, these free courses must be automatically visible to every user immediately after they sign in. How should you configure the default portal permissions to achieve this?\n\n\nA. Create a Students web role and set the Authenticated Users Role option to true. Assign the web role to each registered user.\nB. Create an entity for managing free courses. Create entity permission records to provide access to entity records for free courses and assign the entity permissions to users when they register on the portal for the first time.\nC. Create an entity for managing free courses. Create a Students web role and set the Authenticated Users role option to true. Create appropriate entity permissions to access the free course entity records and assign the entity permissions to the web role.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nThis question tests your knowledge of how to configure security and permissions in Power Apps portals. The key requirement is to make free courses *automatically* available to *all* students after they sign in.\n1. Web Roles: In Power Apps portals, access is controlled through web roles. A special setting, \"Authenticated Users Role,\" allows you to designate one web role as the default for any user who successfully signs in. This meets the \"automatically available to all students\" requirement without any manual intervention.\n2. Entity Permissions: Web roles by themselves don't grant access to Dataverse data. To see records (like free courses), you need to create Entity Permissions. These permissions define the level of access (Read, Write, Create, etc.) a user has to a specific table's records.\n3. Connecting Roles and Permissions: Entity Permissions are not assigned directly to users. Instead, they are associated with web roles. A user receives permissions based on the web roles they are assigned.\nLet's analyze the options based on this:\n* Option A is incorrect. While it correctly identifies the \"Authenticated Users Role,\" it includes the unnecessary and incorrect step of manually assigning this role to each user. A role set as the \"Authenticated Users Role\" is applied automatically. Furthermore, it omits the crucial step of creating and associating entity permissions, so the role would grant no access to course data.\n* Option B is incorrect. It describes assigning entity permissions directly to users. This is not how portal security works; entity permissions must be associated with web roles.\n* Option C is correct. It describes the complete and correct procedure. You create a web role and set it as the \"Authenticated Users Role\" to ensure all logged-in students get it automatically. Then, you create the necessary entity permissions to allow access to the free courses and associate these permissions with that web role. This is the standard and most efficient way to implement the requirement.\nWhy Choose Our Certification Exam Prep Courses?\nWhen it comes to passing your certification exam—whether it’s AWS, Microsoft, or Oracle—quality training makes all the difference.

      "description": "This comprehensive course will take you on a journey into the world of Bayesian statistics, one of the most powerful and intuitive frameworks for reasoning under uncertainty. Using real data and hands-on coding in R, you'll learn how to build, evaluate, and interpret Bayesian models using cutting-edge tools like brms and Stan.\nWhether you're a data scientist aiming to deepen your statistical toolkit, a social scientist wanting to model complex effects, or a beginner curious about Bayesian reasoning, this course is designed to bring clarity, confidence, and capability to your analysis.\nWe begin by reshaping how you think about probability. Rather than treating it as a long-run frequency, you’ll learn to think of probability as a degree of belief—a perspective that naturally leads to Bayesian reasoning. Through intuitive explanations and code-based demonstrations, we’ll explore how prior beliefs can be updated using new data to form posterior conclusions.\nFrom there, we move into core computational methods that allow modern Bayesian analysis to scale. You’ll master Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling—starting with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and moving toward Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and NUTS, the algorithms that power modern Bayesian engines like Stan.\nBut theory alone isn’t enough.\nThat’s why this course is packed with practical, real-world applications using the powerful and user-friendly brms package in R—a front-end to Stan that lets you fit sophisticated models using familiar R syntax. You'll build Bayesian linear regressions, simulate data, check assumptions, and interpret your results like a pro.\nFor those ready to go deeper, we’ll open the hood and dive into writing models directly in Stan, giving you complete control over model structure, likelihoods, and priors. You’ll explore everything from simple linear models to non-linear growth curves and hierarchical structures.\nWe’ll also equip you with the tools needed for model validation and selection, including posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Expected Log Predictive Density (ELPD). You’ll learn how to diagnose convergence issues, identify divergent transitions, and follow a principled Bayesian workflow from model formulation to decision-making.\n\n\nBy the End of This Course, You Will:\nBe able to think like a Bayesian, incorporating prior knowledge and updating beliefs using data\nConfidently use MCMC methods to fit and diagnose Bayesian models\nPerform Bayesian regression analysis using brms, and know when and how to customize models using Stan\nUnderstand how to simulate from priors and posteriors, check model fit, and communicate uncertainty clearly\nApply a principled Bayesian workflow to real-world data problems, from data exploration to final model validation",

      "description": "Welcome to my new course 'Deep Learning from the Scratch using Python and Keras'.\n\n\nAs you already know the artificial intelligence domain is divided broadly into deep learning and machine learning. In-fact deep learning is machine learning itself but Deep learning with its deep neural networks and algorithms try to learn high-level features from data without human intervention. That makes deep learning the base of all future self intelligent systems.\n\n\nAnd in this course, I am starting from the very basic things to learn like learning the programming language basics and other supporting libraries at first and proceed with the core topic.\n\n\nLet's see what are the interesting topics included in this course. At first we will have an introductory theory session about Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Artificial Neurons based Deep Learning and Neural Networks.\n\n\nAfter that, we are ready to proceed with preparing our computer for python coding by downloading and installing the anaconda package and will check and see if everything is installed fine. We will be using the browser based IDE called Jupyter notebook for our further coding exercises.\n\n\nI know some of you may not be coming from a python based programming background. The next few sessions and examples will help you get the basic python programming skill to proceed with the sessions included in this course. The topics include Python assignment, flow-control, functions List and Tuples, Dictionaries, Functions etc.\n\n\nThen we will start with learning the basics of the Python Numpy library which is used to adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of classes and functions. Then we will learn the basics of matplotlib library which is a plotting library for Python for corresponding numerical expressions in NumPy. And finally the pandas library which is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.\n\n\nAfter the basics, we will then install the deep learning libraries theano, tensorflow and the API for dealing with these called as Keras. We will be writing all our future codes in keras.\n\n\nThen before we jump into deep learning, we will have an elaborate theory session about the basic Basic Structure of an Artificial Neuron and how they are combined to form an artificial Neural Network. Then we will see what exactly is an activation function, different types of most popular activation functions and the different scenarios we have to use each of them.\n\n\nAfter that we will see about the loss function, the different types of popular loss functions and the different scenarios we have to use each of them.\n\n\nLike the Activation and loss functions, we have optimizers which will optimize the neural network based on the training feedback. We will also see the details about most popular optimizers and how to decide in which scenarios we have to use each of them.\n\n\nThen finally we will discuss about the most popular deep learning neural network types and their basic structure and use cases.\n\n\nFurther the course is divided into exactly two halves. The first half is about creating deep learning multi-layer neural network models for text based dataset and the second half about creating convolutional neural networks for image based dataset.\n\n\nIn Text based simple feed forward multi-layer neural network model we will start with a regression model to predict house prices of King County USA. The first step will be to Fetch and Load Dataset from the kaggle website into our program.\n\n\nThen as the second step, we will do an EDA or an Exploratory Data Analysis of the loaded data and we will then prepare the data for giving it into our deep learning model. Then we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model.\n\n\nOnce we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib.\n\n\nFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction of the king county real estate price using our deep learning model and evaluate the results.\n\n\nThat was a text based regression model. Now we will proceed with a text based binary classification model. We will be using a derived version of Heart Disease Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our aim is to predict if a person will be having heart disease or not from the learning achieved from this dataset. The same steps repeat here also.\n\n\nThe first step will be to Fetch and Load Dataset into our program.\n\n\nThen as the second step, we will do an EDA or an Exploratory Data Analysis of the loaded data and we will then prepare the data for giving it into our deep learning model. Then we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model.\n\n\nOnce we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib.\n\n\nFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction for heart disease using our deep learning model and evaluate the results.\n\n\nAfter the text based binary classification model. Now we will proceed with a text based multi class classification model. We will be using the Red Wine Quality Data Set from the kaggle website. Our aim is to predict the multiple categories in which a redwine sample can be placed from the learning achieved from this dataset. The same steps repeat here also.\n\n\nThe first step will be to Fetch and Load Dataset into our program.\n\n\nThen as the second step, we will do an EDA or an Exploratory Data Analysis of the loaded data and we will then prepare the data for giving it into our deep learning model. Then we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model.\n\n\nOnce we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib.\n\n\nFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction for wine quality with a new set of data and then evaluate the categorical results.\n\n\nWe may be spending much time, resources and efforts to train a deep learning model. We will learn about the techniques to save an already trained model. This process is called serialization. We will at first serialize a model. Then later load it in another program and do the prediction without having to repeat the training.\n\n\nThat was about text based data. We will now proceed with image based data. In the preliminary session we will have an introduction to Digital Image Basics in which we learn about the composition and structure of a digital image.\n\n\nThen we will learn about Basic Image Processing using Keras Functions. There are many classes and functions that help with pre processing an image in the Keras library api. We will learn about the most popular and useful functions one by one.\n\n\nAnother important and useful image processing function in keras is Image Augmentation in which slightly different versions of images are automatically created during training. We will learn about single image augmentation, augmentation of images within a directory structure and also data frame image augmentation.\n\n\nThen another theory session about the basics of a Convolutional neural network or CNN. We will learn how the basic CNN layers like convolution layer, the pooling layer and the fully connected layer works.\n\n\nThere are concepts like Stride Padding and Flattening in convolution for image processing. We will learn them also one by one.\n\n\nNow we are all set to start with our CNN Model. We will be designing a model that can classify 5 different types of flowers if provided with an image of a flower in any of these categories. We will be at first downloading the dataset from the kaggle website. Then the first step will be to Fetch and Load this Dataset from our computer into our program.\n\n\nThen as the second step, we have to split this dataset manually for training and then later testing the model. We will arrange them into training and testing folders with each class labelled in separate folders.\n\n\nThen we will define the Keras Deep Learning Model. Once we define the model, we will then compile the model and later we will fit our dataset into the compiled model and wait for the training to complete. After training, the training history and metrics like accuracy, loss etc can be evaluated and visualized using matplotlib.\n\n\nFinally we have our already trained model. We will try doing a prediction for five different types of flowers with a new set of image data and then evaluate the categorical results.\n\n\nThere are many techniques which we can use to improve the quality of a model. Especially an image based model. The most popular techniques are doing dropout regularization of the model.\n\n\nThe next technique is doing the optimization and adjustment of the padding and also the filters in the convolution layers.\n\n\nAnd finally optimization using image augmentation. We will tweak different augmentation options in this session.\n\n\nDoing these optimization techniques manually one by one and comparing results is a very tedious task. So we will be using a technique called Hyper parameter tuning in which the keras library itself will switch different optimization techniques that we specify and will report and compare the results without we having to interfere in it.\n\n\nEven though these techniques and creation of a model from the scratch is fun. Its very time consuming and may take ages if you are planning to design a large model. In this situation a technique called transfer learning can help us.\n\n\nWe will take the world renounced, state of the art, most popular pre-trained deep learning models designed by experts and we will transfer the learning into our model so that we can make use of the architecture of that model into our custom model that we are building.\n\n\nThe popular state of the art model architectures that we are going to use are the VGG16, VGG19 designed by deep learning experts from the University of Oxford and also ResNet50 created in  ImageNet challenge to address the vanishing gradient problem.\n\n\nWe will at first download these models using keras and will try simple predictions using these pre-trained models. Later we will try the network training for our flower dataset itself using the VGG16. we will make few changes in the model to incorporate our dataset into it. Since the network architecture is not that simple, in our computer it will take a lot of time to complete the training.\n\n\nSo instead of CPU, we have to use a GPU to enhance parallel processing. We will be using a cloud based Free GPU service provied by goggle called Google Colab. At first we will try training with VGG16 in google colab. We will prepare, zip and upload the dataset into google colab. Then we will extract it using linux comands and then do the training. The training is almost ten times faster compared to the local computer. Once we have the trained model we will serialize the model and will do the prediction.\n\n\nThe same procedure will be repeated for VGG19 and also for ResNet.\n\n\nAnd that's all about the topics which are currently included in this quick course. The code, images, models and weights used in this course has been uploaded and shared in a folder. I will include the link to download them in the last session or the resource section of this course. You are free to use the code in your projects with no questions asked.\n\n\nAlso after completing this course, you will be provided with a course completion certificate which will add value to your portfolio.\n\n\nSo that's all for now, see you soon in the class room. Happy learning and have a great time.",

      "description": "Though designing neural networks is a sought-after skill, it is not easy to master. With Keras, you can apply complex machine learning algorithms with minimum code.\nApplied Deep Learning with Keras starts by taking you through the basics of machine learning and Python all the way to gaining an in-depth understanding of applying Keras to develop efficient deep learning solutions. To help you grasp the difference between machine and deep learning, the course guides you on how to build a logistic regression model, first with scikit-learn and then with Keras. You will delve into Keras and its many models by creating prediction models for various real-world scenarios, such as disease prediction and customer churning. You’ll gain knowledge on how to evaluate, optimize, and improve your models to achieve maximum information. Next, you’ll learn to evaluate your model by cross-validating it using Keras Wrapper and scikit-learn. Following this, you’ll proceed to understand how to apply L1, L2, and dropout regularization techniques to improve the accuracy of your model. To help maintain accuracy, you’ll get to grips with applying techniques including null accuracy, precision, and AUC-ROC score techniques for fine tuning your model.\nBy the end of this course, you will have the skills you need to use Keras when building high-level deep neural networks.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRitesh Bhagwat has a master's degree in applied mathematics with a specialization in computer science.

      "description": "Extra Fundamentals of R is an extension of the Udemy course Essential Fundamentals of R. Extra Fundamentals of R introduces additional topics of interest and relevance utilizing many specific R-scripted examples. These broad topics include:\n(1) Details on using Base, GGPlot and Lattice graphics;\n(2) An introduction to programming and simulation in R; and\n(3) Character and string processing in R.\nAll materials, scripts, slides, documentation and anything used or viewed in any one of the video lessons is provided with the course. The course is useful for both R-novices, as well as to intermediate R users. Rather than focus on specific and narrow R-supported skill sets, the course paints a broad canvas illustrating many specific examples in three domains that any R user would find useful. The course is a natural extension of the more basic Udemy course, Essential Fundamentals of R and is highly recommended for those students, as well as for other new students (and for practicing professionals) interested in the three domains enumerated above.\nBase, GGplot and Lattice (or \"trellis) graphics are the three principal graphics systems in R. They each operate under different \"rules\" and each present useful and often brilliant graphics displays. However, each of these three graphics systems are generally designed and used for different domains or applications.\nThere are many different programming and simulation scenarios that can be modeled with R. This course provides a good sense for some of the potential simulation applications through the presentation of 'down-to-earth,' practical domains or tasks that are supported. The examples are based on common and interesting 'real-world' tasks: (1) simulating a game of coin-tossing; (2) returning Top-Hats checked into a restaurant to their rightful owners; (3) collecting baseball cards and state quarters for profit: (4) validating whether so-called \"streaky\" behavior, such as have a string of good-hitting behavior in consecutive baseball games, is really unusual from a statistical point of view; (4) estimating the number of taxicabs in a newly-visited city; and (5) estimating arrival times for Sam and Annie at the Empire State Building (\"Sleepless in Seattle\").\nR is likely best known for the ability to process numerical data, but R also has quite extensive capabilities to process non-quantitative text (or character) and string variables. R also has very good facilities for implementing powerful \"regular expression\" natural-language functions. An R user is bested served with an understanding of how these text (or character) and string processing capabilities \"work.\"\nMost sessions present \"hands-on\" material that make use of many extended examples of R functions, applications, and packages for a variety of common purposes. RStudio, a popular, open source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing and using R applications, is utilized in the program, supplemented with R-based direct scripts (e.g. 'command-line prompts') when necessary.",

      "description": "Hi there,\n\nWelcome to \"Generative AI & ChatGPT Mastery for Data Science and Python\" course.\nMaster Generative AI, ChatGPT and Prompt Engineering for Data Science and Python from scratch with hands-on projects\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we interact with technology, and mastering AI tools has become essential for anyone looking to stay ahead in the digital age.\n\n\nIn today's data-driven world, the ability to analyze data, draw meaningful insights, and apply machine learning algorithms is more crucial than ever. This course is designed to guide you through every step of that journey, from the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to mastering advanced machine learning algorithms, all while leveraging the power of ChatGPT-4o.\n\n\nData science application is an in-demand skill in many industries worldwide — including finance, transportation, education, manufacturing, human resources, and banking. Explore data science courses with Python, statistics, machine learning, and more to grow your knowledge. Get data science training if you’re into research, statistics, and analytics.\n\n\nMachine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information about whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat.\n\n\nA machine learning course teaches you the technology and concepts behind predictive text, virtual assistants, and artificial intelligence. You can develop the foundational skills you need to advance to building neural networks and creating more complex functions through the Python and R programming languages.\n\n\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction.\nPython instructors at OAK Academy specialize in everything from software development to data analysis and are known for their effective, friendly instruction for students of all levels.\nWhether you work in machine learning or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python, python programming, python examples, python example, python hands-on, pycharm python, python pycharm, python with examples, python: learn python with real python hands-on examples, learn python, real python\nPython's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed upon the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that has resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing a variety of different tools for programmers suited for many different tasks.\n\n\nWhat This Course Offers:\nIn this course, you will gain a deep understanding of the entire data analysis and machine learning pipeline. Whether you are new to the field or looking to expand your existing knowledge, our hands-on approach will equip you with the skills you need to tackle real-world data challenges.\nYou’ll begin by diving into the fundamentals of EDA, where you’ll learn how to explore, visualize, and interpret datasets.

Pass yours, enroll now!\n\n\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nThe Sales AI Development Team at OmniSales Solutions is building a new sales system analyzing video and text from their public website, and they must monitor it for equitable results across all user locations and backgrounds. Which two Responsible AI principles guide this monitoring requirement? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\n\nA. transparency\nB. fairness\nC. inclusiveness\nD. reliability and safety\nE. privacy and security\n\n\nCorrect Answer: B C\nExplanation:\nThe question asks which two Responsible AI principles provide guidance for monitoring a sales system to ensure it provides \"equitable results regardless of the user's location or background.\"\nLet's analyze the options in the context of this requirement:\n* A. Transparency: This principle focuses on making AI systems understandable and explainable. While transparency is crucial for *how* you monitor (i.e., understanding why certain results are produced), it doesn't directly define the *goal* of monitoring for equitable outcomes based on user characteristics.\n* B. Fairness: This principle ensures that AI systems treat all people equitably and do not discriminate against certain groups or individuals. Monitoring for \"equitable results regardless of the user's location or background\" directly aligns with the principle of fairness, aiming to detect and mitigate biases related to these attributes.\n* C. Inclusiveness: This principle emphasizes designing AI systems that empower and engage people from all backgrounds, considering diverse human characteristics and experiences. Ensuring results are equitable for users from different locations and backgrounds is a core aspect of inclusiveness, making sure the system works well for a broad and diverse user base.\n* D. Reliability and safety: This principle focuses on ensuring AI systems perform consistently, predictably, and safely, and are robust to errors or attacks. While important for any system, it does not directly address the social impact concerning equitable outcomes based on user demographics or location.\n* E. Privacy and security: This principle relates to protecting user data and ensuring the system's security. It is vital for data governance but is not directly related to ensuring \"equitable results\" in terms of non-discrimination based on user characteristics.\nBoth Fairness and Inclusiveness directly address the core requirement of ensuring equitable results regardless of user location or background. Fairness focuses on avoiding discrimination and bias, while Inclusiveness ensures the system is designed to work for and benefit a diverse set of users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nOmniCorp's AI Solutions Team needs to develop a customer support chatbot that supports casual conversation, leverages a comprehensive knowledge base, works across multiple languages, performs sentiment analysis on user queries, and automatically routes messages to the most appropriate language model. What components should be integrated into this chatbot?\n\n\nA. QnA Maker, Language Understanding, and Dispatch\nB. Translator, Speech, and Dispatch\nC. Language Understanding, Text Analytics, and QnA Maker\nD. Text Analytics, Translator, and Dispatch\n\n\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nTo build a chatbot that meets the specified requirements, you need to integrate specific Azure AI services:\n1. Supports chit-chat, knowledge base, and multilingual models:\n* QnA Maker (now part of Azure AI Language): This service is specifically designed to create conversational layers over your data (knowledge base) and handle FAQs, which includes capabilities for \"chit-chat\" (common greetings, small talk, etc.).\n* Language Understanding (LUIS - now part of Conversational Language Understanding within Azure AI Language): LUIS is used for natural language understanding, allowing your bot to interpret user intents and extract entities. Both QnA Maker and LUIS support building multilingual models, meaning you can train and deploy models in various languages.\n2. Performs sentiment analysis on user messages:\n* Text Analytics (now part of Azure AI Language): This service provides advanced natural language processing features, including sentiment analysis, which determines the positive, negative, or neutral sentiment of user input. This directly addresses the requirement for sentiment analysis.\n3. Selects the best language model automatically:\n* When integrating QnA Maker and Language Understanding (LUIS) into a single bot, the bot needs a mechanism to determine whether a user's utterance should be handled by the knowledge base (QnA Maker) or by the intent recognition model (LUIS). While Dispatch is a tool specifically designed to create a dispatcher LUIS model for routing between multiple LUIS apps and QnA KBs, the basic routing logic can also be implemented within the bot's code itself. The presence of both Language Understanding and QnA Maker in Option C provides the underlying \"language models\" that can be selected between.\nWhy Option C is the correct choice:\n* QnA Maker: Directly addresses \"chit-chat\" and \"knowledge base.\"\n* Text Analytics: Directly addresses \"sentiment analysis.\"\n* Language Understanding: Addresses the core NLU for more complex interactions beyond FAQs and supports \"multilingual models.\" The \"automatic model selection\" can be handled by the bot's logic interacting with these two primary NLU services.\nWhy other options are less suitable:\n* A. QnA Maker, Language Understanding, and Dispatch: This option lacks a dedicated service for \"sentiment analysis.\" While LUIS can sometimes provide basic sentiment, Text Analytics is the specific and comprehensive service for this requirement.\n* B. Translator, Speech, and Dispatch: This option completely misses the requirements for \"chit-chat,\" \"knowledge base,\" and \"sentiment analysis.\" Translator is for language translation, and Speech is for converting speech to text or vice-versa, neither of which are core to the stated NLU requirements.\n* D. Text Analytics, Translator, and Dispatch: This option misses the critical component for \"chit-chat\" and \"knowledge base,\" which is QnA Maker.\nTherefore, Option C provides the most comprehensive set of services to meet all the stated requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nThe Finance Automation Team at ExpensePro Inc. aims to shorten the time employees spend logging English receipts for expense reports. To minimize development effort, you need to extract top-level details like the vendor and transaction total from these receipts. Which Azure service should you use?\n\n\nA. Custom Vision\nB. Personalizer\nC. Form Recognizer\nD. Computer Vision\n\n\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nThe problem requires extracting specific, structured information (vendor, transaction total) from receipts with minimal development effort.\nLet's evaluate the given Azure services:\n* A. Custom Vision: This service is used for building custom image classification or object detection models. It helps in identifying specific objects or classifying images based on custom tags. While it could potentially be used to *identify* a receipt, it is not designed for *extracting structured data* like vendor names or transaction totals from within the receipt itself. This would require significant custom development to parse and interpret the text.\n* B. Personalizer: This is an AI service that helps in delivering personalized experiences by learning user behaviors and recommending relevant content or actions. It has no relevance to document processing or data extraction from receipts.\n* C. Form Recognizer (now Azure AI Document Intelligence): This service is purpose-built for intelligent document processing. It includes pre-built models specifically for common document types such as receipts, invoices, and business cards. These pre-built models can automatically extract key fields like vendor name, transaction total, date, and line items with high accuracy and minimal configuration. This perfectly aligns with the requirement to extract top-level information from receipts and minimize development effort.\n* D. Computer Vision: This service provides general image analysis capabilities, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), object detection, and image description. While it can extract *all* text from a receipt using OCR, it does not inherently understand the *meaning* or *structure* of the text (e.g., distinguishing a vendor name from a product name, or identifying the total amount). To get structured data like vendor and total, you would need to write extensive custom code to parse and interpret the raw OCR text, which contradicts the \"minimize development effort\" constraint.\nTherefore, Form Recognizer (Azure AI Document Intelligence) is the most appropriate service as it offers pre-built receipt models that can directly extract the required information with minimal development.\nWhy Choose Our Certification Exam Prep Courses?\nWhen it comes to passing your certification exam—whether it’s AWS, Microsoft, or Oracle—quality training makes all the difference.

Companies that understand this will soon have a competitive advantage over those who are slow to jump on the artificial intelligence bandwagon. As a result, developers with Machine Learning and Deep Learning skills are increasingly in demand and have gold on their hands.\n\n\nIn this course, we will see how to take advantage of a raw dataset, without any labels. In particular, we will focus exclusively on Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders and see how they can be trained in an unsupervised way, making them particularly attractive in the era of Big Data.\n\n\nThis course, taught using the Python programming language, requires basic programming skills. If you don't have the required foundation, I recommend that you brush up on your skills by taking a crash course in programming. Also, it is best to have basic knowledge of optimization (we will use gradient optimization) and machine learning.\n\n\nConcepts covered:\nAutoencoders and their implementation in Python\nVariational Autoencoders and their implementations in Python\nUnsupervised Learning\nGenerative models\nPyTorch through practice\nThe implementation of a scientific ML paper (Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes)\n\n\nDon't wait any longer before jumping into the world of unsupervised Machine Learning!",

It is designed to give beginners a quick practical introduction to machine learning by doing hands-on labs using python and JupyterLab. I know some beginners just want to know what machine learning is without too much dry theory and wasting time on data cleaning. So, in this course, we will skip data cleaning. All datasets is highly simplified already cleaned, so that you can just jump to machine learning directly.\nMachine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.\nScikit-learn (also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of indentations to signify code-blocks. It is also the language of choice for machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nJupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. Inside JupyterLab, we can create multiple notebooks. Each notebook for every machine learning project.\nIn this introductory course, we will cover very simplified machine learning by using python and scikit-learn to do predictions.  And we will perform machine learning all using the web-based interface workspace also known as Jupyter Lab.  I have chosen Jupyter Lab for its simplicity compared to Anaconda which can be complicated for beginners. Using Jupyter Lab, installation of any python modules can be easily done using python's native package manager called pip. It simplifies the user experience a lot as compared to Anaconda.\n\n\nFeatures of this course:\nsimplicity and minimalistic, direct to the point\ndesigned with absolute beginners in mind\nquick and fast intro to machine learning using Linear Regression\ndata cleaning is omitted as all datasets has been cleaned\nfor those who want a fast and quick way to get a taste of machine learning\nall tools (Jupyter Lab)  used are completely free\nintroduction to kaggle for further studies\n\n\nLearning objectives:\nAt the end of this course, you will:\nHave a very good taste of what machine learning is all about\nBe equipped with the fundamental skillsets of Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook, and\nReady to undertake more advanced topics in Machine Learning\n\n\nEnroll now and I will see you inside!",

      "description": "Machine learning is a field of computer science that deals with the problem of finding mathematical and statistical functions that best explain the relationship between input data, output data, and other inputs (external) to a system. Machine learning has some uses in areas such as detection, recommendation systems, fraud detection, machine translation, visual recognition, and the development of autonomous robotic systems.\nFinally, practice here the best Machine Learning MCQ Questions, that checks your basic knowledge of Machine Learning.\nFrom below you can learn some basic things of Machine Learning that helps you to pass this exam.\n\n\nMachine Learning is getting computers to program themselves. If programming is automation, then machine learning is automating the process of automation.\nWriting software is the bottleneck, we don’t have enough good developers. Let the data do the work instead of people. Machine learning is the way to make programming scalable.\nTraditional Programming: Data and program is run on the computer to produce the output.\nMachine Learning: Data and output is run on the computer to create a program. This program can be used in traditional programming.\nMachine learning is like farming or gardening. Seeds is the algorithms, nutrients is the data, the gardner is you and plants is the programs.\nApplications of Machine Learning\nSample applications of machine learning:\nWeb search: ranking page based on what you are most likely to click on.\nComputational biology: rational design drugs in the computer based on past experiments.\nFinance: decide who to send what credit card offers to. Evaluation of risk on credit offers. How to decide where to invest money.\nE-commerce: Predicting customer churn. Whether or not a transaction is fraudulent.\nSpace exploration: space probes and radio astronomy.\nRobotics: how to handle uncertainty in new environments. Autonomous. Self-driving car.\nInformation extraction: Ask questions over databases across the web.\nSocial networks: Data on relationships and preferences. Machine learning to extract value from data.\nDebugging: Use in computer science problems like debugging. Labor intensive process. Could suggest where the bug could be.\nKey Elements of Machine Learning\nThere are tens of thousands of machine learning algorithms and hundreds of new algorithms are developed every year.\nEvery machine learning algorithm has three components:\nRepresentation: how to represent knowledge. Examples include decision trees, sets of rules, instances, graphical models, neural networks, support vector machines, model ensembles and others.\nEvaluation: the way to evaluate candidate programs (hypotheses). Examples include accuracy, prediction and recall, squared error, likelihood, posterior probability, cost, margin, entropy k-L divergence and others.\nOptimization: the way candidate programs are generated known as the search process. For example combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, constrained optimization.\nAll machine learning algorithms are combinations of these three components. A framework for understanding all algorithms.\nTypes of Learning\nThere are four types of machine learning:\nSupervised learning: (also called inductive learning) Training data includes desired outputs. This is spam this is not, learning is supervised.\nUnsupervised learning: Training data does not include desired outputs. Example is clustering. It is hard to tell what is good learning and what is not.\nSemi-supervised learning: Training data includes a few desired outputs.\nReinforcement learning: Rewards from a sequence of actions. AI types like it, it is the most ambitious type of learning.\nSupervised learning is the most mature, the most studied and the type of learning used by most machine learning algorithms. Learning with supervision is much easier than learning without supervision.\nInductive Learning is where we are given examples of a function in the form of data (x) and the output of the function (f(x)). The goal of inductive learning is to learn the function for new data (x).\nClassification: when the function being learned is discrete.\nRegression: when the function being learned is continuous.\nProbability Estimation: when the output of the function is a probability.\nMachine Learning in Practice\nMachine learning algorithms are only a very small part of using machine learning in practice as a data analyst or data scientist. In practice, the process often looks like:\nStart Loop\nUnderstand the domain, prior knowledge and goals. Talk to domain experts. Often the goals are very unclear. You often have more things to try then you can possibly implement.\nData integration, selection, cleaning and pre-processing. This is often the most time consuming part. It is important to have high quality data. The more data you have, the more it sucks because the data is dirty. Garbage in, garbage out.\nLearning models. The fun part. This part is very mature. The tools are general.\nInterpreting results. Sometimes it does not matter how the model works as long it delivers results. Other domains require that the model is understandable. You will be challenged by human experts.\nConsolidating and deploying discovered knowledge. The majority of projects that are successful in the lab are not used in practice. It is very hard to get something used.\nEnd Loop\nIt is not a one-short process, it is a cycle. You need to run the loop until you get a result that you can use in practice. Also, the data can change, requiring a new loop.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Generative AI Fundamentals course by Uplatz.\n\n\nGenerative AI, also known as genAI, is a powerful and exciting field of artificial intelligence focused on creating new content, unlike many other AI systems that primarily analyze or interpret existing data. It can produce diverse outputs like:\nText: Poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, emails, letters, etc.\nImages: Photorealistic portraits, landscapes, abstract art, 3D models, etc.\nAudio: Music in various styles, sound effects, speech, etc.\nVideo: Realistic simulations, stylized animations, etc.\n\n\nHow Generative AI works\nImagine generative AI as a highly creative artist trained on massive amounts of data (text, images, etc.). This training allows it to:\nLearn patterns and relationships within the data. For example, how words typically combine in sentences, how light interacts with objects to create an image, or how musical notes sequence to form melodies.\nDevelop statistical models that capture these patterns. These models act like internal \"recipes\" for generating new content.\nReceive prompts or inputs from users, which guide the creative process. This could be a text description, a sketch, or even just a style preference.\nUse its models and the provided prompts to generate entirely new creations that resemble the training data but are not simply copies.\n\n\nDifferent techniques used in generative AI\n\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Two AI models compete, one creating new content, the other trying to distinguish it from real data. This competition refines the generative model's ability to create realistic outputs.\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs): Encode data into a latent space, allowing for manipulation and generation of new data points within that space.\nTransformers: Powerful neural network architectures adept at understanding and generating text, code, and other sequential data.\n\n\nKey points to remember\nGenerative AI is still under development, but it's rapidly evolving with amazing potential.\nWhile highly creative, it's crucial to remember it's still a machine and the ethical implications of its outputs need careful consideration.\nIt's a powerful tool for various applications like art, design, drug discovery, and more.\n\n\nGenerative AI Fundamentals - Course Curriculum\n\n\nIntroduction to Generative AI\nWhat is Generative AI?\nJourney of Generative AI\nHow does Generative AI works?\nApplications of generative AI in different sectors and industries\n\n\nIntroduction to Large Language Models (LLM)\nWhat is LLM?\nHow do large language models work?\nGeneral Architecture of Large Language Model\nWhat can a language model do?\nWhat are the challenges and limitations of LLM?\nLLM in the AI landscape\nLLM use cases/Application\n\n\nGenerative AI: Prompt Engineering Basics\nWhat is prompt Engineering?\nRelevance of prompt engineering in generative AI models\nCreating prompts and explore examples of impactful prompts\nCommonly used tools for prompt engineering to aid with prompt engineering\n\n\nIntroduction to Responsible AI\nWhat is Responsible AI?\nWhy it's important?\nHow Google implements responsible AI in their products?\nGoogle's 7 AI principles\n\n\nGenerative AI: Impact, Considerations, and Ethical Issues\nLimitations of generative AI and the related concerns\nIdentify the ethical issues, concerns, and misuses associated with generative AI\nConsiderations for the responsible use of generative AI\nEconomic and social impact of generative AI",

      "description": "** Mike's courses are popular with many of our clients.\" Josh Gordon, Developer Advocate, Google **\n\"This is well developed with an appropriate level of animation and illustration.\" - Bruce\n\"Very good course for somebody who already has pretty good foundation in machine learning.\" - Il-Hyung Cho\nWelcome to Hands-On Keras for Machine Learning Engineers. This course is your guide to deep learning in Python with Keras. You will discover the Keras Python library for deep learning and how to use it to develop and evaluate deep learning models.\nThere are two top numerical platforms for developing deep learning models, they are Theano developed by the University of Montreal and TensorFlow developed at Google. Both were developed for use in Python and both can be leveraged by the super simple to use Keras library. Keras wraps the numerical computing complexity of Theano and TensorFlow providing a concise API that we will use to develop our own neural network and deep learning models. Keras has become the gold standard in the applied space for rapid prototyping deep learning models.\nMy name is Mike West and I'm a machine learning engineer in the applied space. I've worked or consulted with over 50 companies and just finished a project with Microsoft. I've published over 50 courses and this is 55 on Udemy. If you're interested in learning what the real-world is really like then you're in good hands.\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is for developers, machine learning engineers and data scientists that want to learn how to get the most out of Keras. You do not need to be a machine learning expert, but it would be helpful if you knew how to navigate a small machine learning problem using SciKit-Learn. Basic concepts like cross-validation and one hot encoding used in lessons and projects are described, but only brieﬂy. With all of this in mind, this is an entry level course on the Keras library.\nWhat are you going to Learn?\nHow to develop and evaluate neural network models end-to-end.\nHow to use more advanced techniques required for developing state-of-the-art deep learning models.\nHow to build larger models for image and text data.\nHow to use advanced image augmentation techniques in order to lift model performance.\nHow to get help with deep learning in Python.\nThe anatomy of a Keras model.\nEvaluate the Performance of a deep learning Keras model.\nBuild end-to end regression and classification models in Keras.\nHow to use checkpointing to save the best model run.\nHow to reduce overﬁtting With Dropout Regularization.\nHow to enhance performance with Learning Rate Schedules.\nWork through a crash course on Convolutional Neural Networks.\nThis course is a hands on-guide. It is a playbook and a workbook intended for you to learn by doing and then apply your new understanding to your own deep learning Keras models. To get the most out of the course, I would recommend working through all the examples in each tutorial. If you watch this course like a movie you'll get little out of it.\nIn the applied space machine learning is programming and programming is a hands on-sport.\nThank you for your interest in Hands-On Keras for Machine Learning Engineers.\nLet's get started!",

The course covers the fundamental concepts of regression analysis and binary logistic classification, including how to evaluate models and interpret results. The course also covers tree-based models for binary and multinomial classification.\n\n\nThe course begins with an introduction to machine learning, where students will gain an understanding of what machine learning is, the different types of machine learning, and the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. This is followed by an overview of the basics of supervised learning, including how to learn, the different types of regression, and the conditions that must be met to use regression models in machine learning versus classical statistics.\n\n\nThe course then delves into regression analysis in detail, covering the different types of regression models and how to use Minitab to evaluate them. This includes a thorough explanation of statistically significant predictors, multicollinearity, and how to handle regression models that include categorical predictors, including additive and interaction effects. Students will also learn how to make predictions for new observations using confidence intervals and prediction intervals.\n\n\nNext, the course moves onto model building, where students will learn how to handle regression equations with \"wrong\" predictors and use stepwise regression to find optimal models in Minitab. This includes an overview of how to evaluate models and interpret results.\n\n\nThe course then shifts to binary logistic regression, which is used for binary classification. Students will learn how to evaluate binary classification models, including good fit metrics such as the ROC curve and AUC. They will also use Minitab to analyze a heart failure dataset using binary logistic regression.\n\n\nThe course then covers classification trees, including an overview of node splitting methods such as splitting by misclassification rate, Gini impurity, and entropy. Students will learn how to predict class for a node and evaluate the goodness of the model using misclassification costs, ROC curve, Gain chart, and Lift chart for both binary and multinomial classification.\n\n\nFinally, the course covers the concept and use of predefined prior probabilities and input misclassification costs, and how to build a tree using Minitab. Throughout the course, students will gain hands-on experience applying the concepts learned in real-world scenarios.\n\n\nOverall, this course provides a thorough understanding of machine learning basics using Minitab, with a focus on supervised learning, regression analysis, and classification. Upon completion of this course, students will have the knowledge and skills to apply supervised machine learning techniques to real-world data problems.",

      "description": "In this Word2Vec tutorial, you will learn how to train a Word2Vec Python model and use it to semantically suggest names based on one or even two given names.\n\n\nThis Word2Vec tutorial is meant to highlight the interesting, substantive parts of building a word2vec Python model with TensorFlow.\n\n\nWord2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce Word Embeddings. Embedding vectors created using the Word2vec algorithm have many advantages compared to earlier algorithms such as latent semantic analysis.\n\n\nWord embedding is one of the most popular representation of document vocabulary. It is capable of capturing context of a word in a document, semantic and syntactic similarity, relation with other words, etc. Word Embeddings are vector representations of a particular word.\n\n\nThe best way to understand an algorithm is to implement it. So, in this course you will learn Word Embeddings by implementing it in the Python library, TensorFlow.\n\n\nWord2Vec is one of the most popular techniques to learn word embeddings using shallow neural network. Word2vec is a particularly computationally-efficient predictive model for learning word embeddings from raw text.\n\n\nIn this Word2Vec tutorial, you will learn The idea behind Word2Vec:\nTake a 3 layer neural network. (1 input layer + 1 hidden layer + 1 output layer)\nFeed it a word and train it to predict its neighbouring word.\nRemove the last (output layer) and keep the input and hidden layer.\nNow, input a word from within the vocabulary. The output given at the hidden layer is the ‘word embedding’ of the input word.\n\n\nIn this Word2Vec tutorial we are going to do all steps of building and training a Word2vec Python model (including pre-processing, tokenizing, batching, structuring the Word2Vec Python model and of course training it) using Python TensorFlow. Finally, we are going to use our trained Word2Vec Python model to semantically suggest names based on one or even two given names.\n\n\nLet's start!",

It is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, and researchers.\nKey Strengths in the Context of Data Science, AI & ML:\nVast Ecosystem: R boasts a rich collection of packages (over 18,000+) contributed by the community, covering a broad spectrum of data analysis and machine learning tasks.\nData Visualization: R's powerful visualization libraries (like ggplot2) create publication-quality plots and interactive graphics, aiding in data exploration and communication of insights.\nStatistical Power: R's foundation in statistics provides a strong base for data analysis, hypothesis testing, and modeling.\nReproducibility: R encourages reproducible research through its literate programming capabilities (R Markdown), making it easier to document and share the entire analysis process.\nData Science\nConcept: Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves various techniques, including data mining, statistics, machine learning, and visualization.\nR's Role in Data Science: R provides a robust environment for data science tasks. Its extensive libraries (like dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2) enable data cleaning, manipulation, exploration, and visualization. R's statistical capabilities make it ideal for hypothesis testing, modeling, and drawing inferences from data.\nData Manipulation and Cleaning: R excels at data manipulation and cleaning, using packages like dplyr, tidyr, and data.table. These tools help in transforming and preparing data for analysis.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): R provides extensive tools for EDA, allowing users to summarize datasets, detect outliers, and identify trends. Functions in base R along with packages like ggplot2 are commonly used for this purpose.\nStatistical Analysis: R was built for statistics, so it offers a wide array of functions for hypothesis testing, regression analysis, ANOVA, and more. Packages like stats, MASS, and lmtest are frequently used for statistical modeling.\nData Visualization: R is renowned for its data visualization capabilities. ggplot2 is a powerful package for creating complex, multi-layered graphics. Other packages like lattice and plotly allow for interactive visualizations.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nConcept: AI is a broad field of computer science that aims to create intelligent agents capable of mimicking human-like cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.\nR's Role in AI: While R isn't the primary language for core AI development (like Python or C++), it plays a vital role in AI research and applications. R's statistical and machine learning libraries (like caret, randomForest) facilitate building predictive models, evaluating their performance, and interpreting results.\nStatistical Learning: R supports various statistical learning methods, which are foundational for AI. Libraries like caret and mlr provide tools for building and evaluating statistical models.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP): While Python is more popular for NLP, R has packages like tm and quanteda for text mining and processing tasks. These can be used for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and other NLP tasks.\nComputer Vision: R can be used for basic computer vision tasks through packages like EBImage. However, for more complex tasks, Python is generally preferred due to its more extensive libraries.\nIntegration with Python: For AI tasks where Python’s libraries are more advanced, R can be integrated with Python through the reticulate package, allowing users to leverage Python’s AI capabilities while staying within the R environment.\nMachine Learning (ML)\nConcept: ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that enable systems to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed.\nR's Role in Machine Learning: R shines in the machine learning domain. It offers a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, etc.) and tools for model building, evaluation, and tuning. Packages like caret simplify the process of training and comparing various models.\nModel Development: R offers several packages for building machine learning models, such as randomForest, xgboost, and caret. These tools help in creating models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines.\nModel Evaluation: R provides robust tools for evaluating model performance, including cross-validation, ROC curves, and other metrics. The caret package is particularly useful for this purpose.\nFeature Engineering: R’s data manipulation packages, like dplyr and caret, are used for feature engineering, which involves creating new features from raw data to improve model performance.\nDeep Learning: While Python dominates deep learning, R has packages like keras and tensorflow that provide an interface to TensorFlow, allowing users to build deep learning models within R.\nDeployment: R can be used to deploy models into production environments. The plumber package, for example, can turn R scripts into RESTful APIs, enabling the integration of R models into applications.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Machine Learning with R - Course Curriculum\n\n\n1.

This lack of transparency makes it hard to trust and explain AI decisions in real-world applications such as healthcare, finance, or business.\nThis course introduces you to the foundations of Explainable and Interpretable AI (XAI), focusing on practical, model-agnostic interpretation methods. You’ll start with the basics of explainability and why it matters. From there, you’ll explore two of the most widely used techniques: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). These tools help reveal how features contribute to predictions, making complex models easier to understand.\nYou will then apply these methods in Python through hands-on examples. Working with datasets such as housing prices, text classification, and medical predictions, you’ll see how interpretation methods provide insights into models like Random Forests and neural networks. Along the way, you’ll also learn about additional libraries, including PDP, ELI5, Skater, and Captum, which broaden your toolkit for interpreting models across different contexts.\nThe course concludes with a recap section, where you revisit SHAP, LIME, and other methods to reinforce your understanding and compare their strengths.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge and skills to interpret machine learning models, explain their outputs to stakeholders, and build AI systems that are not only accurate but also transparent and trustworthy.",

But to most, they remain a \"black box.\" While many can use an API, very few possess the rare and valuable skill of understanding how these incredible models work from the inside out.\nWhat if you could peel back the curtain? What if you could build a powerful, modern Large Language Model, not just by tweaking a few lines of code, but by writing it from the ground up, line by line?\nThis course is not another high-level overview. It's a deep, hands-on engineering journey to code a complete LLM—specifically, the highly efficient and powerful Mistral 7B architecture—from scratch in PyTorch. We bridge the gap between abstract theory and practical, production-grade code. You won't just learn what Grouped-Query Attention is; you'll implement it. You won't just read about the KV Cache; you'll build it to accelerate your model's inference.\nWe believe the best way to achieve true mastery is by building. Starting with the foundational concepts that led to the transformer revolution, we will guide you step-by-step through every critical component. Finally, you'll take your custom-built model and learn to deploy it for real-world use with the industry-standard, high-performance vLLM Inference Engine on Runpod.\nAfter completing this course, you will have moved from an LLM user to an LLM architect. You will possess the first-principles knowledge that separates the experts from the crowd and empowers you to build, debug, and innovate at the cutting edge of AI.\nYou will learn to build and understand:\nThe Origins of LLMs: The evolution from RNNs to the Attention mechanism that started it all.\nThe Transformer, Demystified: A deep dive into why the Transformer architecture works and the critical differences between training and inference.\nThe Mistral 7B Blueprint: How to architect a complete Large Language Model, replicating the global structure of a state-of-the-art model.\nCore Mechanics from Scratch:\nTokenization: Turning raw text into a format your model can understand.\nRotary Positional Encoding (RoPE): Implementing the modern technique for injecting positional awareness.\nGrouped-Query Attention (GQA): Coding the innovation that makes models like Mistral so efficient.\nSliding Window Attention (SWA): Implementing the attention variant that allows for processing much longer sequences.\nThe KV Cache: Building the essential component for lightning-fast text generation during inference.\nEnd-to-End Model Construction: Assembling all the pieces—from individual attention heads to full Transformer Blocks—into a functional LLM in PyTorch.\nBringing Your Model to Life: Implementing the logic for text generation to see your model create coherent language.\nProduction-Grade Deployment: A practical guide to deploying your custom model using the blazingly fast vLLM engine on the Runpod cloud platform.\nIf you are a developer, ML engineer, or researcher ready to go beyond the API and truly understand the technology that is changing the world, this course was designed for you.

      "description": "Traditional Machine Learning projects use numeric and textual data stored in conventional databases. Developing intelligent applications based on purely text data is extremely challenging? Why is it so? In the first place, the available text data in this world is millions of times more than the numeric data available to us in the conventional databases. So, the question is can we extract some useful information from this huge corpus of text data - which can run into several terabytes or rather petabytes. The moment you talk about these sizes for the data, the whole perspective of machine learning changes. In the traditional databases, the number of columns is quite low and thus the number of features for machine learning too is very small - generally goes in tens and at the most few hundreds, max. In NLP applications, as there are no columns like structured databases, each word in the text corpus becomes a probable candidate to be considered as a feature for model training. It is impossible to train a model with millions of features. So, to develop ML applications, the first and the major requirement is to reduce this features count by reducing the vocabulary. The other major requirement is to convert the text data into binary format as our dumb machine understand only binaries. That is where the NLP learning becomes distinct from model development on structured databases. Once the text data is pre-processed to get a minimal number of features that represent the entire text corpus, the rest of the model development process remains same as the traditional one - popularly known as Good Old Fashioned AI.\nIn this course, you will learn many text pre-processing techniques to make the huge text datasets ready for machine learning. You will learn many text-preprocessing techniques such as stemming, lemmatization, removing stop words, position-of-speech (POS) tagging, bag-of-words, and tf-idf.\nYou will then learn to apply the traditional statistics based algorithms for training the models. You will develop five industry standard real-life NLP applications. These applications would cover a wide span of NLP domain. You will learn binary and multi-class classifications. You will use both supervised and unsupervised learning. You will learn to use unsupervised clustering on text data. You will use LDA (LatentDirichletAllocation) algorithm for clustering. You will use support vector machines for classifying text.\nOn the business side, you will learn sentiment analysis, classifying research articles, ranking hotels based on customer reviews, news summarization, topic modeling and a quick start to Natural Language Understanding (NLU).\nThis course helps in getting a quick start on NLP and mastering several NLP techniques through a very practical approach. Each lesson has code to practice that makes your learning easy and quick.",

      "description": "Machine learning is continuously growing in popularity, and for good reason. Companies that are able to make proper use of machine learning can solve complex problems that otherwise proved very difficult with standard software development.\nHowever, building good machine learning models is not always easy, and it's very important to have a solid foundation so that if/when you encounter problems with models on the job, you understand what steps to take to fix them.\nThat's why this course focuses on always introducing every model that we cover first with the theoretical background of how the model works, so that you can build a proper intuition around its behaviour. Then we'll have the practical component, where we'll implement the machine learning model and use it on actual data. This way you gain both hands-on, as well as a solid theoretical foundation, of how the different machine learning models work, and you'll be able to use this knowledge to better chose and fix models, depending on the situation.\nIn this course we'll cover many different types of machine learning aspects.\nWe'll start with going through a sample machine learning project from idea to developing a final working model. We'll learn many important techniques around data preparation, cleaning, feature engineering, optimizaiton and learning techniques, and much more.\nOnce we've gone through the whole machine learning project we'll then dive deeper into several different areas of machine learning, to better understand each task, and how each of the models we can use to solve these tasks work, and then also using each model and understanding how we can tune all the parameters we learned about in the theory components.\nThese different areas that we'll dive deeper in to are:\n- Classification\n- Regression\n- Ensembles\n- Dimensionality Reduction\n- Unsupervised Learning\n\n\nAt the end of this course you should have a solid foundation of machine learning knowledge. You'll be able to build out machine learning solutions to different types of problems you'll come across, and be ready to start applying machine learning on the job or in technical interviews.",

      "description": "Ensemble methods offer a powerful way to improve prediction accuracy by combining in a clever way predictions from many individual predictors. In this course, you will learn how to use ensemble methods to improve accuracy in classification and regression problems.\nWhen using Predictive Analytics to solve actual problems, besides models and algorithms there are many other practical considerations that must be considered like which features should I use, how many features are enough, should I create new features, how to combine features to give the same underlying information, which hyper-parameters should I use? We explore topics that will help you answer such questions.\nArtificial Neural Networks are models loosely based on how neural networks work in a living being. These models have a long history in the Artificial Intelligence community with ups and downs in popularity. Nowadays, because of the increase in computational power, improved methods, and software enhancements, they are popular again and are the basis for advanced approaches such as Deep Learning. This course introduces the use of Deep Learning models for Predictive Analytics using the powerful TensorFlow library.\nAbout the Author :\nAlvaro Fuentes is a Data Scientist with an M.S. in Quantitative Economics and a M.S. in Applied Mathematics with more than 10 years of experience in analytical roles. He worked in the Central Bank of Guatemala as an Economic Analyst, building models for economic and financial data. He founded Quant Company to provide consulting and training services in Data Science topics and has been a consultant for many projects in fields such as; Business, Education, Psychology and Mass Media. He also has taught many (online and in-site) courses to students from around the world in topics like Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, R programming and Python.\nAlvaro Fuentes is a big Python fan and has been working with Python for about 4 years and uses it routinely for analyzing data and producing predictions. He also has used it in a couple of software projects. He is also a big R fan, and doesn't like the controversy between what is the “best” R or Python, he uses them both. He is also very interested in the Spark approach to Big Data, and likes the way it simplifies complicated things. He is not a software engineer or a developer but is generally interested in web technologies.\nHe also has technical skills in R programming, Spark, SQL (PostgreSQL), MS Excel, machine learning, statistical analysis, econometrics, mathematical modeling.\nPredictive Analytics is a topic in which he has both professional and teaching experience.

      "description": "Build 2 complete projects start to finish -- with each step explained thoroughly by instructor Nimish Narang from Mammoth Interactive.\nHands-On Neural Networks: Build Machine Learning Models was funded by a #1 project on Kickstarter\n\nNimish is our cross-platform developer and has created over 20 other courses specializing in machine learning, Java, Android, SpriteKit, iOS and Core Image for Mammoth Interactive. When he's not developing, Nimish likes to play guitar, go to the gym and laze around at the beach.\n\nProject #1 -- Learn to construct a model for credit card fraud detection. Our model will take in a list of transactions, some fraudulent and some legitimate. It will output the percentage at which it can calculate fraudulence and legitimacy, how accurate it is. We will also modify the model so that it output whether a specific transaction is fraudulent or legitimate if we pass them in one by one.\n\nWe will explore a dataset so that you fully understand it, and we will work on it. It's actually pretty hard to find a dataset of fraudulent/legitimate credit card transactions, but we at Mammoth Interactive have found everything for you and curated a step by step curriculum so that you can build alongside us.\n\nWe will manipulate the dataset so that it will be easy to feed into our model. We will build a computational graph with nodes and functions to run input through the mini neural network.\n\nMachine Learning Projects Using Tensorflow -- Mammoth Interactive\n\nProject #2 -- Learn to build a simple stock market prediction model that will predict whether the price stock will go up or down the next morning based on the amount of volume exchange for a given day\n\nAny kind of global event can completely affect how stock prices fluctuate. As such we will build a simple model that only take in the volume exchange for a particular day and will only be used for day trading -- choosing whether to buy or sell at the end of the day. It is short term prediction.\n\nWe will NOT build a huge neural network that takes in thousands of data points and hours to train. We will build a simple model for you to expand upon. You will learn how to go through building a Tensorflow project and how you would get started with a stock prediction task.\n\nYou will get a solid base that you can expand upon. We will take previous stock data from the Investing site. Included are 8 CSV sheets for you to use to train and test your model for four different stocks.\nEnroll now in Hands-On Neural Networks: Build Machine Learning Models with Mammoth Interactive",

Pass yours, enroll now!\n\n\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nThe Document Processing team at LexCorp Legal is tasked with building an AI application using large language models (LLMs) that can read legal documents and extract their key points. Which solution meets these requirements?\nA. Build an automatic named entity recognition system.\nB. Create a recommendation engine.\nC. Develop a summarization chatbot.\nD. Develop a multi-language translation system.\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nThe law firm's requirement is to \"read legal documents and extract key points from the documents.\" This task directly aligns with the definition and capability of text summarization.\n\n\n*   A. Build an automatic named entity recognition system: Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies and classifies specific entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and monetary values. While useful for legal documents to extract specific data points, it does not \"extract key points\" in the sense of summarizing the main ideas or arguments of an entire document. NER focuses on discrete entities, not the overall essence or summary of the content.\n*   B. Create a recommendation engine: A recommendation engine suggests items (e.g., products, movies, articles) to users based on their preferences or behavior. This is completely unrelated to reading documents and extracting their core information.\n*   C. Develop a summarization chatbot: Summarization is the process of condensing a larger text into a shorter one, preserving the most important information and meaning. A summarization chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can read lengthy legal documents and provide concise summaries that highlight the essential points. This perfectly matches the requirement to \"extract key points.\" LLMs are highly proficient at various summarization techniques (extractive or abstractive).\n*   D. Develop a multi-language translation system: A translation system converts text from one language to another. This is not related to extracting key points from documents, as the problem statement implies working within a single language context (legal documents, without mentioning cross-language needs).\n\n\nTherefore, developing a summarization chatbot is the most appropriate solution to meet the requirement of reading legal documents and extracting key points using LLMs.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nAt GeneSight Analytics, the Bio-ML Solutions Team is tasked with classifying human genes into 20 distinct categories based on their characteristics, requiring an ML algorithm that allows for clear documentation of how its internal workings influence the final classification. Which ML algorithm meets these requirements?\nA. Decision trees\nB. Linear regression\nC. Logistic regression\nD. Neural networks\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nThe problem requires an ML algorithm that can classify human genes into 20 categories (multi-class classification) and, crucially, allows documenting \"how the inner mechanism of the model affects the output.\" This second requirement points to the need for a highly interpretable or explainable model.\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A. Decision trees: Decision trees are well-suited for both classification (including multi-class problems) and interpretability. They create a series of rules based on the input features, leading to a specific classification. The \"tree\" structure can be visualized and followed, allowing a clear understanding of which gene characteristics (features) at each \"node\" lead to a specific gene category. This inherent transparency directly addresses the need to document how the model's inner mechanism influences the output.\n*   B. Linear regression: Linear regression is used for predicting continuous values (regression problems), not for classifying into discrete categories. Therefore, it is not suitable for this classification task.\n*   C. Logistic regression: Logistic regression is primarily used for binary classification. While it can be extended for multi-class classification (e.g., One-vs-Rest or Multinomial Logistic Regression), its interpretability, though present through feature coefficients, does not offer the same intuitive, rule-based transparency as a decision tree. It would be harder to \"document how the inner mechanism... affects the output\" in a step-by-step, human-readable rule set compared to a decision tree.\n*   D. Neural networks: Neural networks are powerful for multi-class classification and can achieve high accuracy. However, they are typically considered \"black box\" models. Understanding or documenting their \"inner mechanism\" (the weights and activations across multiple layers) in an intuitive way that explains *how* inputs lead to outputs is very challenging without specialized post-hoc explainability techniques. They do not inherently provide the transparency required by the question.\nBased on the dual requirements of multi-class classification and high interpretability/transparency of the model's decision-making process, Decision Trees are the most appropriate choice.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nThe Supply Chain Optimization Team at QuantifyCorp uses ML models for quarterly demand forecasts to optimize operations. Their AI practitioner is preparing a report on these trained ML models for company stakeholders, focusing on transparency and explainability. What should their AI practitioner include in this report to effectively meet the transparency and explainability requirements?\nA. Code for model training\nB. Partial dependence plots (PDPs)\nC. Sample data for training\nD. Model convergence tables\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation:\nThe question asks what an AI practitioner should include in a report to provide transparency and explainability of trained ML models (used for forecasting) to company stakeholders.\n*   A. Code for model training: While the training code is crucial for reproducibility and auditing by technical personnel, it does not directly offer transparency or explainability to non-technical company stakeholders regarding *how* the model makes its predictions or *why* certain forecasts are generated. Stakeholders typically need high-level, interpretable insights, not programming code.\n*   B. Partial dependence plots (PDPs): Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are a powerful model-agnostic explainability technique. They show the marginal effect of one or two features on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model, holding all other features constant. This allows stakeholders to visualize and understand the relationship between specific input variables (e.g., marketing spend, historical sales, economic indicators) and the model's forecasts. PDPs directly address the need for transparency by showing *how* the model behaves and explainability by illustrating the *impact* of features on predictions in an interpretable graphical format, without requiring deep technical knowledge of the model's internal mechanics. This is highly valuable for decision-makers who need to trust and act on the forecasts.\n*   C. Sample data for training: Providing sample training data offers insight into what kind of data the model was exposed to. However, it does not explain the *logic* or *relationships* the model learned from that data to make predictions. It doesn't tell stakeholders *why* a particular forecast was made based on current inputs.\n*   D. Model convergence tables: Model convergence tables are technical outputs from the training process, indicating whether the model successfully learned and reached a stable solution (e.g., showing loss reduction over iterations). These are primarily for the AI practitioner to assess training quality and stability. They do not provide any direct insights into the model's decision-making process or how specific features influence predictions, which are crucial for stakeholder transparency and explainability.\nTherefore, Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are the most appropriate choice for meeting the transparency and explainability requirements for company stakeholders regarding ML model forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Choose Our Certification Exam Prep Courses?\nWhen it comes to passing your certification exam—whether it’s AWS, Microsoft, or Oracle—quality training makes all the difference.

      "description": "Want to learn how to build a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch without drowning in jargon? This course walks you through it step by step.\nFirst, we break the model into its two main players. The generator takes random numbers and tries to turn them into believable images. The discriminator looks at both real and fake pictures and guesses which is which. They train together like friendly rivals, each round makes the generator better at faking and the discriminator sharper at spotting fakes.\nNext, we talk about how they learn. You’ll see the basic “real vs fake” loss used in vanilla GANs, plus newer options like Wasserstein loss that often keep training steady. To measure progress, we swap confusing loss curves for a clearer score called Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Lower FID means your images look more like the real thing, and we’ll show you exactly how to compute it.\nFinally, we put everything into code. Using Python and TensorFlow 2, you’ll write a clean training loop, run it on a GPU, and add simple tricks, like label smoothing and spectral normalization, that help the model learn faster and avoid weird artifacts. We start with MNIST digits, but the code is written so you can plug in any image set (pets, landscapes, medical scans) without major changes.",

This can result in an increased liquidity of the organizations cash reserves, decrease of working capital and improved customer satisfaction by decreasing the backlog of orders. In the domain of machine learning, there’s a specific collection of methods and techniques particularly well suited for predicting the value of a dependent variable according to time, ARIMA is one of the important technique.\nLSTM is the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used in deep learning for its optimized architecture to easily capture the pattern in sequential data. The benefit of this type of network is that it can learn and remember over long sequences and does not rely on pre-specified window lagged observation as input. The scalecast library hosts a TensorFlow LSTM that can easily be employed for time series forecasting tasks. The package was designed to take a lot of the headache out of implementing time series forecasts. It employs TensorFlow under-the-hood.\nSome of the features are:\nLag, trend, and seasonality selection\nHyperparameter tuning using grid search and time series\nTransformations\nScikit models\nARIMA\nLSTM\nMultivariate\n- Assignment",

This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to conduct sentiment analysis and emotional detection on customer review and twitter post datasets using TextBlob, Natural Language Toolkit, and BERT models. This course is a perfect combination between theory and hands-on application, providing you with practical skills to extract valuable insights from textual data. This course will be mainly focusing on two major objectives, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the customer review and twitter post datasets from multiple perspectives, meanwhile the second objective is sentiment analysis where you will learn to detect emotions and bias from customer reviews and twitter posts. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of sentiment analysis, such as getting to know its practical applications and models that will be used in our projects. Then, in the next session, we are going to have a case study where you will learn how sentiment analysis actually works. We are going to use customer reviews dataset to perform feature extraction and make predictions if a review is more likely to be positive, negative, or neutral. Afterward, you will also learn about several factors that contribute to bias in customer reviews, for examples like algorithmic amplification, emotional bias, and financial incentives. After learning all necessary knowledge about sentiment analysis, we will begin the project. Firstly you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. In addition to that, you will also learn how to find and download customer reviews and twitter post dataset from Kaggle. Once everything is all set, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section. The project will consist of two main parts, in the first part, you will learn step by step on how to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews dataset, you will extensively learn how to make accurate predictions whether the review indicates customer’s satisfaction or dissatisfaction based on the training data. Meanwhile, in the second part you will be guided step by step on how to perform sentiment analysis on twitter posts dataset, specifically you will analyse the emotional aspect of the tweets using Natural Language Toolkit.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we learn sentiment analysis? Well, there are many reasons why, but here is my answer, with the rise of E-commerce and businesses starting to expand their market online, as a result, more and more customers are starting to purchase products online and after purchasing the product, most likely they will also leave reviews telling their opinions about the product. In addition to that, sometimes they also have meaningful discussions about a specific product on social media. However, not a lot of people realize that those customer reviews and social media posts can potentially be transformed into valuable insights for the business, for instance, by evaluating the complaints from the customers in the review section, the company will be able to make better business decisions and improve the quality of their products based on their customer suggestions.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of sentiment analysis and its practical applications\nCase study: applying sentiment analysis on customer review dataset and predict if a review is more likely to be positive, negative or neutral\nLearn factors that contribute to bias in customer reviews\nLearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\nLearn how to clean dataset by removing missing rows and duplicate values\nLearn how to find correlation between customer ratings and sentiment\nLearn how to identify keywords that are frequently used in positive and negative customer reviews\nLearn how to analyse emotional aspect of customer reviews using EmoLex\nLearn how to perform sentiment analysis on customer review data using TextBlob\nLearn how to analyse emotional aspect of tweets using NRCLex\nLearn how to perform sentiment analysis on twitter post data using VADER\nLearn how to predict sentiment of a tweet using BERT\nLearn how to predict sentiment of a tweet using Multinomial Naive Bayes\nLearn how to set up Google Colab IDE",

      "description": "THE COURSE IS PROVIDING THE ADVANCED CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM.\nCourse contents will be updated on regular basis. Simplified Education should reach to all corners of the world, is our prime objective.\nThis course is specially developed for Computer savvy people who are keen interested in playing and experimenting with huge data. Arranging and classifying the data sequentially also reviewing the data for required output.\nA great opportunity is waiting for you such people. Since the demand for data scientists has increased drastically and Digital mapping data is used everywhere in everything therefore a smart work was in demand such as utility of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in Advanced Digital Mapping, This technology mostly works on cloud computing hence, the experts are in demand. This course will provide you brief introduction to applications of data science, programming, deep learning in Advanced digital mapping technology\n\n\nWhat ArcGIS is a geographical information system (GIS) software that allows handling and analysing geographic information by visualising geographical statistics through layer building maps like climate data or trade flows. It’s used by a whole host of academic institutions and departments, both in the humanities and sciences, to develop and illustrate groundbreaking research. Further, it is used by several governments and private/commercial institutions worldwide.\nThe system has the capacity to create geographical information accessible throughout a company, institution, privately or publicly on the internet. Therefore, the software essentially works as a platform whereby geographical information can be linked, shared and analysed\nHow Does it Work?\nLike many GIS software, ArcGIS creates maps that require categories organised as layers. Each layer is registered spatially so that when they’re overlaid one on top of another, the program lines them up properly to create a complex data map. The base layer is almost always a geographical map, pulled out of a range of sources depending upon the visualisation needed (satellite, road map, etc). This program has a lot of them available to users and also contains live feed layers including traffic details.\nThe first three layers are called feature or vector layers, each containing individual functions distinguished through the platform. These are:\npoints (like landmarks, buildings)\nlines (like roads and other 1D schemata)\npolygons (like political information and geographical census, called 2D data)\nraster images (a base vector layer like an aerial picture)\nData can be correlated with at least one of these spatial layers and can be both mapped and analysed, be it through features like demographic changes, or via data tables.\nHowever, what sets this method apart from its competitors is the complex platform through this mapping and data can be performed. Therefore, it’s a vast-reaching program subject to the latest improvements and updates. It is currently available on Microsoft Windows desktops, although the online program is accessible on many operating systems. As it operates as a platform, users should not wade through pages of information and data; resources are available to decrease and extract specific information from much bigger geographical datasets. In sum, it’s a one-stop solution to data management and analysis as filtered through map construction. Anyone with a basic computer proficiency and an interest in map-making can learn ArcGIS in just 2 weeks\nComplex Graphics and Data\nIt allows you to create stunning visual maps and models rapidly, such as three-dimensional renderings and population flow maps. Using a drag-and-drop function, spreadsheets of data could be loaded immediately on the cloud and visualized. There’s also a good mapping tool that suggests the best styles, classifications, and colors to fit your data.\nImagery is offered in high-resolution, obtained from both the recent and historic sources worldwide, allowing for the building of historical maps as well as recent demographic data and information observations. Surface phenomena, like elevation, temperature, rainfall and so on, can also be fully integrated into such visual maps and models with amazing tools for surface analysis.\nWhere is it Used?\nAs an industry-leading platform, the package of applications and tools central to this program is used by a majority of companies, institutions, and departments dealing with geographical information analysis. Yet the ease of its interface has also seen its worth jump in media and journalistic use as well.\nArcGIS comes with a strong reputation and history. This simple fact makes it to a staple piece of software for different companies dealing in geographical information systems. In particular, it’s used by state and local governments across the world, including in the USA\nTypes of Software\nThis software comes in many different incarnations, in the standard desktop package to some completely web-based program. The desktop package includes the base package to publish and manage information and data, also giving access to the online and “Enterprise” options. The online version includes lots of functions needed to make web apps and web maps using geographical information. There is a gallery of base maps and styles to select from and also a whole host of data piles to visualise.\nAll these topics explained in this course...\nHence, we request to all the technical students to get advantage of this course\nDo subscribe for the other courses offered by Global Education Foundation",

These are Qualitative methods and Quantitative methods.\n\n\nQualitative forecasting techniques are often subjective in nature and require judgment on the part of experts.\n\n\nQuantitative forecasting techniques make formal use of historical data and a forecasting model. The model formally summarizes patterns in the data and expresses a statistical relationship between previous (Tn-1), and current values (Tn), of the variable.\nIn other words, the forecasting model is used to extrapolate past and current behavior into the future. That's what we'll be learning in this course.\n\n\nRegardless of your objective, this course is oriented to provide you with the basic foundations and knowledge, as well as a practical application, in the study of time series.\n\n\nStudents will find valuable resources, in addition to the video lessons, it has a large number of laboratories, which will allow you to apply in a practical way the concepts described in each lecture.\n\n\nThe labs are written in two of the most important languages in data science. These are python and r.",

      "description": "These modules are intended to help you develop data science and machine learning skills in Python. The 12 modules have video tutorials for each exercise with solutions for each exercise. One of the unique things about these modules is that you work on basic elements and then test your knowledge with real data exercises with a heat transfer design project. You will see your Python code have a real impact by designing the materials for a new product.\nOne of the best ways to start or review a programming language is to work on a project. These exercises are designed to teach data science Python programming skills. Data science applications are found across almost all industries where raw data is transformed into actionable information that drives scientific discovery, business innovations, and development. This project is to determine the thermal conductivity of several materials. Thermal conductivity is how well a material conducts or insulates against heat transfer. The specific heat transfer project shows how to apply data science to solve an important problems with methods that are applicable to many different applications.\nObjective: Collect and analyze data from the TCLab to determine the thermal conductivity of three materials (metal, plastic, and cardboard) that are placed between two temperature sensors. Create a digital twin that predicts heat transfer and temperature.\nTo make the problem more applicable to a real situation, suppose that you are designing a next-generation cell phone. The battery and processor on the cell phone generate a lot of heat. You want to make sure that the material between them will prevent over-heating of the battery by the processor. This study will help you answer questions about material properties for predicting the temperature of the battery and processor.\nTopics\nThere are 12 lessons to help you with the objective of learning data science in Python. The first thing that you will need is to install Python to open and run the IPython notebook files in Jupyter. There are additional instructions on how to install Python and manage modules. Any Python distribution or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can be used (IDLE, Spyder, PyCharm, and others) but Jupyter notebook or VSCode is required to open and run the IPython notebook (.ipynb) files. All of the IPython notebook (.ipynb) files can be downloaded. Don't forget to unzip the folder (extract the archive) and copy it to a convenient location before starting.\nOverview\nData Import and Export\nData Analysis\nVisualize Data\nPrepare (Cleanse, Scale, Divide) Data\nRegression\nFeatures\nClassification\nInterpolation\nSolve Equations\nDifferential Equations\nTime Series\nThey give the skills needed to work on the final project. In the final project, metal coins, plastic, and cardboard are inserted in between the two heaters so that there is a conduction path for heat between the two sensors. The temperature difference and temperature levels are affected by the ability of the material to conduct heat from heater 1 and temperature sensor T1 to the other temperature sensor T2.\nYou may not always know how to solve the problems initially or how to construct the algorithms. You may not know the function that you need or the name of the property associated with an object. This is by design. You are to search out the information that you might need using help resources, online resources, textbooks, etc.\nYou will be assessed not only on the ability of the program to give the correct output, but also on good programming practices such as ease of use, code readability and simplicity, modular programming, and adequate, useful comments. Just remember that comments, indentation, and modular programming can really help you and others when reviewing your code.\nTemperature Control Lab\nThe projects are a review of all course material with real data from temperature sensors in the Temperature Control Lab (TCLab). The temperatures are adjusted with heaters that are adjusted with the TCLab. If you do not have a TCLab module, use the digital twin simulator by replacing TCLab() with TCLabModel().",

Moving discussion a step further, we shall discuss Important Statistical Techniques like:\nProbability\nProbability Distributions-Binomial, Poisson & Normal Distribution\nRegression Analysis\nCorrelation Analysis\nIndex Numbers\nMeasures of Central Tendency & Dispersion\nStatistical Data Analysis\nBeing a branch of science, Statistics incorporates data acquisition, data interpretation, and data validation, and statistical data analysis is the approach of conducting various statistical operations, i.e. thorough quantitative research that attempts to quantify data and employs some sorts of statistical analysis. Here, quantitative data typically includes descriptive data like survey data and observational data. In the context of business applications, it is a very crucial technique for business intelligence organizations that need to operate with large data volumes. The basic goal of statistical data analysis is to identify trends, for example, in the retailing business, this method can be approached to uncover patterns in unstructured and semi-structured consumer data that can be used for making more powerful decisions for enhancing customer experience and progressing sales. Apart from that, statistical data analysis has various applications in the field of statistical analysis of market research, business intelligence(BI), data analytics in big data, machine learning and deep learning, and financial and economical analysis.\nBasics Steps for Statistical Data Analysis:In order to analyze any problem with the use of statistical data analysis comprises four basic steps:\n1. Defining the problem\nThe precise and actuarial definition of the problem is imperative for achieving accurate data concerning it. It becomes extremely difficult to collect data without knowing the exact definition/address of the problem.\n2. Accumulating the data\nAfter addressing the specific problem, designing multiple ways in order to accumulate data is an important task under statistical data analysis. Data can be collected from the actual sources or can be obtained by observation and experimental research studies, conducted to get new data.\nIn an experimental study, the important variable is identified according to the defined problem, then one or more elements in the study are controlled for getting data regarding how these elements affect other variables.\nIn an observational study, no trial is executed for controlling or impacting the important variable. For example, a conducted surrey is the examples or a common type of observational study.\n3. Analyzing the data:Under statistical data analysis, the analyzing methods are divided into two categories;\nExploratory methods, this method is deployed for determining what the data is revealing by using simple arithmetic and easy-drawing graphs/description in order to summarize data.\nConfirmatory methods, this method adopts concept and ideas from probability theory for trying to answer particular problems.\nProbability is extremely imperative in decision-making as it gives a procedure for estimating, representing, and explaining the possibilities associated with forthcoming events.\n4. Reporting the outcomes:By inferences, an estimate or test that claims to be the characteristics of a population can be derived from a sample, these results could be reported in the form of a table, a graph or a set of percentages. Since only a small portion of data has been investigated, therefore the reported result can depict some uncertainties by implementing probability statements and intervals of values. With the help of statistical data analysis, experts could forecast and anticipate future aspects from data. By understanding the information available and utilizing it effectively may lead to adequate decision-making. (Source)\n\n\nThe statistical data analysis furnishes sense to the meaningless numbers and thereby giving life to lifeless data. Therefore, it is imperative for a researcher to have adequate knowledge about statistics and statistical methods to perform any research study. This will assist in conducting an appropriate and well-designed study preeminently to accurate and reliable results. Also, results and inferences are explicit only and only if proper statistical tests are practised.",

      "description": "Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) is a method by which the amount of the PCR product can be determined, in real-time, and is very useful for investigating gene expression. The qPCR method is sometimes also referred to as real-time PCR or depending on the application, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (both of which are abbreviated to RT-PCR, which can be rather confusing). The main advantage of real-time PCR over PCR is that real-time PCR allows you to determine the initial number of copies of template DNA (the amplification target sequence) with accuracy and high sensitivity over a wide dynamic range. Real-time PCR results can either be qualitative (the presence or absence of a sequence) or quantitative (copy number). Quantitative real-time PCR is thus also known as qPCR analysis. In research laboratories, qPCR assays are widely used for the quantitative measurement of gene copy number (gene dosage) in transformed cell lines or the presence of mutant genes. In combination with reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), qPCR assays can be used to precisely quantitate changes in gene expression, for example, an increase or decrease in expression in response to different environmental conditions or drug treatment, by measuring changes in cellular mRNA levels. This course is on real-time PCR, definition, concept, and types of DNA detection directly using DNA binding dye or indirectly using specific fluorescent dye. What is the suitable method for each experiment? How can we perform the qPCR program? Troubleshooting in qPCR. Data analysis of qPCR output.",

Numerous techniques and algorithms were developed and proved their efficiencies in addressing business issues and bringing value to companies. Take fraud detection, recommendation systems or autonomous vehicles, etc. as examples.\nHowever, most of the developed machine learning models do not go to production! Among others, this is due to one major reason: Machine Learning models are not classical software. The existing frameworks and methodologies that work for classical software proved to be inadequate with Machine Learning models. Hence, new paradigms and concepts should be brought to handle the specificities of Machine Learning Algorithms.\nThis course is addressed to Data professionals (Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers and Software Engineers) as well as to everyone who want to understand the lifecycle of a Machine Learning model from experimentation to production. In this course, wa re going to see the best practices and recommended ways to put machine learning models into production. This will allow us also to see how we can leverage the power of MLOps to deploy Machine Learning at scale.

      "description": "Welcome to Detecting Car Speed & Empty Parking Spot with Pytorch & CNN course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build a cutting edge car speed detection system and empty parking spot finder using OpenCV, Convolutional Neural Network, and Pytorch. This course is a perfect combination between computer vision and motion detection, making it an ideal opportunity for you to practice your programming skills while integrating advanced computer vision technologies into traffic management and also open doors for future innovations in urban transportation. In the introduction session, you will learn about computer vision applications in traffic management, such as getting to know its use cases, technologies that will be used, and some technical limitations. Then, in the next session, you learn how the car speed detection system works? This section will cover vehicle detection, trajectory estimation, speed calculation, and speed limit check. In addition, you will also learn how empty parking lot detection systems work. This section will cover the full process from data collection to parking occupancy classification. Before starting the project, we will download a training dataset from Kaggle, the dataset contains hundreds or even thousands of images of occupied parking lots and unoccupied parking lots. We will use this dataset to train the model to be able to distinguish which parking lot has been occupied and which ones have not been occupied by cars. Once everything is ready, we will start the project section, in the first section, you will be guided step by step on how to build a vehicle speed detection system using OpenCV and Pytorch. In addition to that, we will also set a speed limit, so, whenever there is a car exceeding the speed limit, the system will immediately send you a notification and issue a speeding ticket. Meanwhile, in the second project, you will build an empty parking lot detection system using OpenCV and Convolutional Neural Network. Once we have built those detection systems, we will be conducting testing to make sure that they have been fully functioning and all programming logics have been implemented correctly.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question: why should we build a car detection system and empty parking lot detection system? Well, here is my answer, regarding the speed detection system, its implementation can significantly aid law enforcement agencies in enforcing speed limits and enhancing road safety. By accurately detecting and recording vehicle speeds, law enforcement officers can effectively identify and address instances of speeding, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and promoting safer driving behaviors. Moreover, the data collected by the speed detection system can serve as valuable evidence in prosecuting traffic violations, ensuring accountability and deterrence among drivers.On the other hand, the empty parking lot detection system offers numerous benefits to individuals and communities. By providing real-time information on available parking spaces, this system helps to reduce time wasted searching for parking, particularly in densely populated urban areas.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn about computer vision applications in traffic management, such as getting to know its use cases, technical limitations, and technologies that will be used\nLearn how a car speed detection system works.

      "description": "Linear Algebra is one of the essential foundations for anyone who wants to work in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Whether manipulating large datasets, building predictive models, or implementing Machine Learning algorithms, a solid understanding of this mathematical field is indispensable. This course is designed to provide an intuitive and practical approach to the most important concepts, combining theory and Python implementations to ensure you learn by applying.\nThe course is divided into six sections, each covering a fundamental aspect of Linear Algebra. We begin with an introduction to core concepts, explaining the importance of this discipline and how it connects to Data Science and Machine Learning. Here, we cover elements like scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors, along with setting up the necessary Python libraries. We also explore data representation and how linear systems are used to solve mathematical problems.\nIn the second section, we dive deeper into vectors—their properties and applications. Vectors are fundamental components in data manipulation, feature scaling, and even defining the multidimensional spaces used in predictive models. You’ll learn about norms, unit vectors, orthogonal and orthonormal vectors, and visualize these structures intuitively through graphs.\nNext, we explore matrices, which are widely used to represent data and process large volumes of information. We’ll cover key matrix properties, norms, transposition, inversion, and essential decompositions for diverse applications. These concepts are critical for neural networks, linear regressions, and dimensionality reduction techniques.\nThe fourth section focuses on operations involving vectors and matrices. We’ll study matrix multiplication, dot and cross products, reduction operations, and the cosine rule—essential tools for calculating data similarity and efficiently manipulating mathematical structures.\nThen, we tackle linear transformations, a key concept for many advanced Machine Learning applications. We’ll examine how matrices enable operations like reflection, scaling, rotation, and shearing, while introducing eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and matrix decompositions. Techniques like Eigendecomposition, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are explored here—indispensable tools for data compression and redundancy removal in learning models.\nFinally, the sixth section is entirely dedicated to practical applications of Linear Algebra in Data Science and AI. We’ll implement linear systems, explore how neural networks leverage these mathematical concepts, dive deeper into Eigendecomposition and SVD, and apply PCA for analysis and dimensionality reduction. We’ll also work with techniques to measure similarity in structured data, ensuring you can use this knowledge to solve real-world problems. The section concludes with exercises to reinforce your learning.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a strong command of Linear Algebra applied to Data Science and Machine Learning—mastering not just the theory but also its implementation in Python. If you aim to build a rigorous mathematical foundation for professional work in AI and data, this course is an essential step in your journey.",

Even if you have tried before but had a hard time understanding the theory,  I guarantee you that this course will give you a thorough understanding of quantum computing. Only the practical stuff are going to be used.\nThis course is not about the typical quantum algorithms which need thousand of qubits, but rather, quantum machine learning algorithms which can be used today.\nIt consists of three sections:\nFirst, the theory, which is the most important one.\nSecond, the quantum bayesian networks, which span from random number generation to probabilistic modeling.\nFinally, quantum neural networks, using both qiskit and pytorch, will be the heart of this lecture.\nThe Quantum Neural Networks are going to be shown with both qiskit and pytorch. The biggest advantage of this lecture is that, the pytorch version of quantum neural networks are going to be constructed using qutrits (rather than qubits), which in my experience, push the boundaries of QML to new heights.\nSo, are you ready to crack the code of machine learning with quantum computers?",

Specifically, we will be looking at uniform cost search where we shall introduce weights to the edges and then shall modify this algorithm by applying estimates to it. We shall also look at hill climbing algorithm which is has a different perspective of searching the desired goal.\n\n\nWe will then look at how we can apply the concepts learnt into a new perspective of problem solving where if we have multiple available solutions then the algorithm should be able to find out which among them is the best solution.\n\n\nWe shall look at game playing where we will see show zero sum games work and how we can optimize these games by pruning a partial game tree. We shall first look at the working of a procedure called max-min algorithm and then in order to optimize this procedure, we shall apply pruning to it.

      "description": "Welcome to Python for Biostatistics: Analyzing Infectious Diseases Data course. This is a comprehensive project-based course where you will learn step by step on how to perform complex analysis and visualization on infectious diseases datasets. This course is a perfect combination between biostatistics and Python, equipping you with the tools and techniques to tackle real-world challenges in public health. The course will be mainly concentrating on three major aspects, the first one is data analysis where you will explore the infectious diseases data from multiple perspectives, the second one is time series forecasting where you will be guided step by step on how to forecast the spread of infectious diseases using STL model, and the third one is public health policy where you will learn how to make a data driven public health policy based on epidemiological modeling. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of biostatistics, such as getting to know more about challenges that we commonly face when analyzing biostatistics data and statistical models that we will use, for instance STL which stands for seasonal trend decomposition. Then, you will continue by learning how to calculate infectious disease transmission using Kermack-McKendrick equation, this is a very important concept that you need to understand before getting into the coding session. Afterward, you will also learn several factors that can potentially accelerate the spread of infectious diseases, such as population density, healthcare accessibility, and antigenic variation. Once you have learnt all necessary information about biostatistics, we will start the project. Firstly, you will be guided step by step on how to set up Google Colab IDE. Not only that, you will also learn how to find and download infectious diseases dataset from Kaggle. Once, everything is ready, we will enter the main section of the course which is the project section The project will be consisted of three main parts, the first part is to conduct exploratory data analysis, the second part is to build forecasting model to predict the spread of the diseases in the future using time series model, meanwhile the third part is to perform epidemiological modelling and use the result to develop a public health policy to slow down the spread of the infectious disease.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves: why should we learn biostatistics, particularly infectious diseases analysis? Well, there are many reasons why, firstly, if you are interested in working in the public health or healthcare industry, having biostatistics knowledge would be very beneficial and help you to level up your career. In addition to that, you will also learn a lot of valuable skill sets that can be implemented in other projects, for example, time series decomposition can be used to forecast stock, real estate, commodity, and cryptocurrency markets. Last but not least, this course will also train you to be a better public health policy maker as you will extensively learn how to make data driven decisions and take other external factors into consideration.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of biostatistics and infectious disease analysis\nLearn how to calculate infectious disease transmission rate using SIR model\nLearn several factors that accelerate the spread of infectious disease, such as population density, herd immunity, and antigenic variation\nLearn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle\nLearn how to clean dataset by removing missing rows and duplicate values\nLearn how to detect potential outliers using Z score method\nLearn how to find correlation between population and disease rate\nLearn how to analyze infected patient demographics\nLearn how to map infectious disease per county using heatmap\nLearn how to analyze infectious disease yearly trend\nLearn how to perform confidence interval analysis\nLearn how to forecast infectious disease rate using time series decomposition model\nLearn how to do epidemiological modeling using SIR model\nLearn how to perform public health policy evaluation",

      "description": "In statistics, Logistic Regression, or logit regression, or logit model is a regression model where the dependent variable (DV) is categorical. This article covers the case of a binary dependent variable—that is, where the output can take only two values, \"0\" and \"1\", which represent outcomes such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. Cases where the dependent variable has more than two outcome categories may be analysed in multinomial logistic regression, or, if the multiple categories are ordered, in ordinal logistic regression. In the terminology of economics, logistic regression is an example of a qualitative response/discrete choice model.\nLogistic Regression was developed by statistician David Cox in 1958. The binary logistic model is used to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor (or independent) variables (features). It allows one to say that the presence of a risk factor increases the odds of a given outcome by a specific factor.\n\n\nPolynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in X. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of X and the corresponding conditional mean of Y. denoted E(y |x), and has been used to describe nonlinear phenomena such as the growth rate of tissues, the distribution of carbon isotopes in lake sediments, and the progression of disease epidemics. Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, Polynomial Regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.\nThe predictors resulting from the polynomial expansion of the \"baseline\" predictors are known as interaction features. Such predictors/features are also used in classification settings.\nIn this Course you learn Polynomial Regression & Logistic Regression You learn how to estimate  output of nonlinear system by Polynomial Regressions to find the possible future output Next you go further  You will learn how to classify output of model by using Logistic Regression\nIn the first section you learn how to use python to estimate output of your system. In this section you can estimate output of:\n\nNonlinear Sine Function\nPython Dataset\nTemperature and CO2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Second section you learn how to use python to classify output of your system with nonlinear structure .In this section you can estimate output of:\nClassify Blobs\nClassify IRIS Flowers\nClassify Handwritten Digits\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nImportant information before you enroll:\nIn case you find the course useless for your career, don't forget you are covered by a 30 day money back guarantee, full refund, no questions asked!\nOnce enrolled, you have unlimited, lifetime access to the course!\nYou will have instant and free access to any updates I'll add to the course.\nYou will give you my full support regarding any issues or suggestions related to the course.\nCheck out the curriculum and FREE PREVIEW lectures for a quick insight.\n___________________________________________________________________________\nIt's time to take Action!\nClick the \"Take This Course\" button at the top right now!\n...Don't waste time!

      "description": "This course focuses on the foundational concepts of reinforcement learning. Instead of diving into complex neural network-based models, we stick to the mathematical and logical basics that are used across most reinforcement learning algorithms. If you're new to the subject or trying to get a clear understanding of the core principles behind RL, this course is a good starting point.\nWe begin by explaining what reinforcement learning actually is, and how agents, environments, actions, states, rewards, and policies fit into the picture. Then we cover Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound—two useful strategies for learning under uncertainty.\nA large part of the course is dedicated to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which provide the structure for many RL problems. You’ll learn the components of an MDP, see how value functions are computed, and work through them using Python.\nWe also look at dynamic programming methods, including policy evaluation and value iteration, and how they are implemented step-by-step. Then we move to model-free approaches like Monte Carlo, SARSA, and Q-learning. All of these are explained with hands-on coding examples using environments like Blackjack, Taxi, Frozen Lake, and Cliff Walking.\nThis course is suitable for anyone who wants a clearer understanding of how RL works under the hood. Basic Python is helpful, but you don’t need any machine learning background to follow along.",

      "description": "PySpark Interview Questions and Answers Preparation Practice Test | Freshers to Experienced\nWelcome to the ultimate PySpark Interview Questions Practice Test course! Are you preparing for a job interview that requires expertise in PySpark? Do you want to solidify your understanding of PySpark concepts and boost your confidence before facing real interview scenarios? Look no further! This comprehensive practice test course is designed to help you ace your PySpark interviews with ease.\nWith PySpark becoming increasingly popular in the realm of big data processing and analysis, mastering its concepts is crucial for anyone aspiring to work in data engineering, data science, or analytics roles. This course covers six key sections, each meticulously crafted to cover a wide range of PySpark topics:\nPySpark Basics: This section delves into the fundamentals of PySpark, covering everything from its installation and setup to understanding RDDs, DataFrames, SQL operations, and MLlib for machine learning tasks.\nData Manipulation in PySpark: Here, you'll explore various data manipulation techniques in PySpark, including reading and writing data, transformations, actions, filtering, aggregations, and joins.\nPySpark Performance Optimization: Learn how to optimize the performance of your PySpark jobs by understanding lazy evaluation, partitioning, caching, broadcast variables, accumulators, and tuning techniques.\nPySpark Streaming: Dive into the world of real-time data processing with PySpark Streaming. Explore DStreams, window operations, stateful transformations, and integration with external systems like Kafka and Flume.\nPySpark Machine Learning: Discover how to leverage PySpark's MLlib for machine learning tasks. This section covers feature extraction, model training and evaluation, pipelines, cross-validation, and integration with other Python ML libraries.\nAdvanced PySpark Concepts: Take your PySpark skills to the next level with advanced topics such as UDFs, window functions, broadcast joins, integration with Hadoop, Hive, and HBase.\nBut that's not all! In addition to comprehensive coverage of PySpark concepts, this course offers a plethora of practice test questions in each section. These interview-style questions are designed to challenge your understanding of PySpark and help you assess your readiness for real-world interviews. With over [insert number] practice questions, you'll have ample opportunities to test your knowledge and identify areas for improvement.\nHere are sample practice test questions along with options and detailed explanations:\nQuestion: What is the primary difference between RDDs and DataFrames in PySpark?\nA) RDDs support schema inference, while DataFrames do not.\nB) DataFrames provide a higher-level API and optimizations than RDDs.\nC) RDDs offer better performance for complex transformations.\nD) DataFrames are immutable, while RDDs are mutable.\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) DataFrames provide a higher-level API and optimizations than RDDs. RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) are the fundamental data structure in PySpark, offering low-level API for distributed data processing. On the other hand, DataFrames provide a more structured and convenient API for working with structured data, akin to working with tables in a relational database. DataFrames also come with built-in optimizations such as query optimization and execution planning, making them more efficient for data manipulation and analysis tasks.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a transformation operation in PySpark?\nA) map\nB) filter\nC) collect\nD) reduceByKey\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) collect. In PySpark, map, filter, and reduceByKey are examples of transformation operations that transform one RDD or DataFrame into another. However, collect is an action operation, not a transformation. collect is used to retrieve all the elements of an RDD or DataFrame and bring them back to the driver program. It should be used with caution, especially with large datasets, as it collects all the data into memory on the driver node, which can lead to out-of-memory errors.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of caching in PySpark?\nA) To permanently store data in memory for faster access\nB) To reduce the overhead of recomputing RDDs or DataFrames\nC) To distribute data across multiple nodes in the cluster\nD) To convert RDDs into DataFrames\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) To reduce the overhead of recomputing RDDs or DataFrames. Caching in PySpark allows you to persist RDDs or DataFrames in memory across multiple operations so that they can be reused efficiently without recomputation. This can significantly improve the performance of iterative algorithms or when the same RDD or DataFrame is used multiple times in a computation pipeline. However, it's important to use caching judiciously, considering the available memory and the frequency of reuse, to avoid excessive memory consumption and potential performance degradation.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a window operation in PySpark Streaming?\nA) window\nB) reduceByKeyAndWindow\nC) countByWindow\nD) mapWithState\nExplanation: The correct answer is D) mapWithState. In PySpark Streaming, window, reduceByKeyAndWindow, and countByWindow are examples of window operations used for processing data streams over a sliding window of time. These operations allow you to perform computations on data within specified time windows, enabling tasks such as aggregations or windowed joins. On the other hand, mapWithState is used for maintaining arbitrary state across batches in PySpark Streaming, typically for stateful stream processing applications.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of a broadcast variable in PySpark?\nA) To store global variables on each worker node\nB) To broadcast data to all worker nodes for efficient joins\nC) To distribute computation across multiple nodes\nD) To aggregate data from multiple sources\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) To broadcast data to all worker nodes for efficient joins. In PySpark, broadcast variables are read-only variables that are cached and available on every worker node in the cluster. They are particularly useful for efficiently performing join operations by broadcasting smaller datasets to all worker nodes, reducing the amount of data shuffled across the network during the join process. This can significantly improve the performance of join operations, especially when one dataset is much smaller than the other. However, broadcast variables should be used with caution, as broadcasting large datasets can lead to excessive memory usage and performance issues.\nWhether you're a beginner looking to break into the world of big data or an experienced professional aiming to advance your career, this PySpark Interview Questions Practice Test course is your ultimate companion for success.

On the other hand, an \"Agent Executor\" is an Agent combined with a set of tools. The Agent Executor executes the agent's decisions, calls relevant tools, manages the flow of actions and inputs, and facilitates the interaction between the agent and tools.\n\n\nSample Use Case\nUse Case : Question Answering Assistant for Medical Research\nScenario: Imagine you are building a question answering assistant specifically designed for medical researchers. Researchers often need to retrieve accurate and relevant information from a vast array of medical documents to answer specific questions related to their research projects.\nIngestion Phase:\nLoad Documents: Collect a diverse collection of medical research documents, including academic papers, case studies, and clinical reports, and load them into the system using a Document Loader.\nSplit Documents: Utilize a Text Splitter to break down lengthy documents into smaller sections or paragraphs. This step helps ensure that relevant information is extracted more effectively during retrieval.\nCreate Embeddings: Employ a Text Embedding Model to generate embeddings for the individual document sections. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing for efficient and accurate retrieval.\nStore in Vectorstore: Store the document sections along with their embeddings in a Vectorstore. This index will enable fast and targeted retrieval of information during the generation phase.\nGeneration Phase:\nUser Question: A medical researcher submits a question to the assistant, such as \"What are the recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy?\"\nDocument Retrieval: The system performs a retrieval step by searching the Vectorstore for relevant document sections related to cancer immunotherapy advancements. This retrieval is based on the user's question.\nConstruct PromptValue: A PromptValue is constructed using a PromptTemplate. This template combines the user's question with the retrieved document sections, creating a comprehensive context for the language model.\nModel Interaction: The constructed PromptValue is passed to a language model specialized in medical research. The model generates a response that addresses the researcher's question using the provided context.\nReturn Result: The response is retrieved from the model and presented to the researcher. The generated answer is supported by the relevant information extracted from the medical documents.\nBenefits:\nBy implementing this question answering assistant, medical researchers can quickly access accurate and up-to-date information from a wide range of medical documents. The retrieval augmented generation approach ensures that the generated responses are informed by relevant data, even from documents the language model was not explicitly trained on. Researchers can obtain targeted and contextually relevant answers to complex medical inquiries, aiding their research projects and decision-making processes.\nConclusion:\nThis use case illustrates how the concepts of ingestion (loading, splitting, creating embeddings, and storing in an index) and generation (retrieval, constructing prompts, model interaction, and result return) can be applied to build a specialized question answering assistant for medical research. By combining retrieval augmented generation with the capabilities of LangChain, researchers benefit from a tool that enhances their access to essential medical information.",

      "description": "1400+ AI/Machine Learning Interview Questions Practice Test\nAI/Machine Learning Interview Questions and Answers Practice Test | Freshers to Experienced | Detailed Explanations\nPrepare yourself for your next AI or Machine Learning Engineer interview with this comprehensive practice test course designed to simulate real-world technical assessments. Whether you're a fresher aiming to break into the field or an experienced professional targeting top-tier tech companies, this course offers over 1400 high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering the full breadth of AI and machine learning concepts, tools, and applications.\nEach question is crafted to reflect actual interview patterns from leading tech firms and includes detailed explanations for correct answers, helping you not only memorize but deeply understand the underlying principles. This is not just a quiz — it's a mastery tool to reinforce your knowledge, identify weak areas, and build confidence before your big day.\nWhy This Course?\n1400+ Practice Questions: Structured across 6 core sections, each containing hundreds of scenario-based, conceptual, and coding-related MCQs.\nReal Interview Simulation: Questions mirror those asked in technical rounds at FAANG companies, startups, and data science roles.\nDetailed Explanations: Every correct answer comes with a clear, step-by-step explanation so you learn why an option is right — and why others are wrong.\nFlexible Learning: Practice by topic or take full-length timed tests to improve speed and accuracy.\nCovers All Experience Levels: From foundational theory to advanced deployment and ethics, this course supports learners at every stage.\nCourse Structure: 6 Comprehensive Sections\nThis course is divided into six meticulously curated sections, each focusing on a critical domain in modern AI/ML engineering. With approximately 230–250 questions per section, you’ll gain balanced exposure across theory, coding, deployment, and real-world application.\n\nSection 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals\nMaster the core algorithms and theoretical foundations every AI engineer must know.\nSupervised Learning (Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees)\nUnsupervised Learning (Clustering, PCA, t-SNE)\nModel Evaluation Metrics (Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC)\nRegularization Techniques (L1/L2, Dropout, Cross-Validation)\nBias-Variance Trade-off and Feature Engineering\nSample Question:\nQ1. Which of the following best describes the purpose of L1 regularization (Lasso) in linear models?\nA) To reduce computational complexity during training\nB) To prevent overfitting by shrinking all coefficients equally\nC) To prevent overfiting by shrinking some coefficients to zero\nD) To increase model variance for better generalization\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation: L1 regularization, also known as Lasso, adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This has the effect of driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. In contrast, L2 (Ridge) shrinks coefficients uniformly but rarely sets them to zero. Thus, L1 is useful when dealing with high-dimensional data where sparsity is desired.\n\nSection 2: Data Handling & Preprocessing\nLearn how to clean, transform, and prepare data — a critical skill for real-world ML systems.\nMissing Data Imputation and Outlier Detection\nData Scaling and Normalization (Standardization, Min-Max)\nEncoding Categorical Variables\nHandling Imbalanced Datasets (SMOTE, Resampling)\nBuilding Robust Data Pipelines and Ensuring Data Quality\nSample Question:\nQ2. When should you apply feature scaling in a machine learning pipeline?\nA) Only for tree-based models like Random Forest\nB) Before splitting the dataset into train and test sets\nC) After train-test split, independently on training and test data\nD) After model training to interpret feature importance\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation: Feature scaling should be applied after the train-test split, using the scaler fitted only on the training data. Then, the same transformation is applied to the test set. This prevents data leakage — if scaling is done before splitting, information from the test set could influence the mean and standard deviation used for scaling, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates.\n\nSection 3: Deep Learning & Neural Networks\nDive into neural networks, architectures, and optimization techniques used in cutting-edge AI systems.\nNeural Network Basics (Activation Functions, Loss Functions)\nBackpropagation and Optimization Algorithms (Adam, SGD)\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning\nRecurrent Networks (LSTM, GRU), Transformers, and Attention\nGenerative Models (GANs) and Reinforcement Learning Concepts\nSample Question:\nQ3. Why is the ReLU activation function preferred in deep neural networks over sigmoid?\nA) It outputs values between 0 and 1, making it probabilistic\nB) It avoids the vanishing gradient problem in deep layers\nC) It is computationally expensive but more accurate\nD) It introduces non-linearity only in shallow networks\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function, defined as f(x) = max(0, x), does not saturate for positive values, allowing gradients to flow freely during backpropagation. In contrast, sigmoid functions saturate at 0 and 1, causing very small gradients (vanishing gradients) in deep networks, which slows or halts learning. This makes ReLU more suitable for deep architectures.\n\nSection 4: Programming & Tools\nTest your coding proficiency and familiarity with essential frameworks and platforms.\nPython Programming (NumPy, Pandas, Data Structures)\nML Libraries (Scikit-learn, XGBoost)\nDeep Learning Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)\nBig Data Tools (Spark, Dask)\nVersion Control, Docker, and Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP)\nSample Question:\nQ4. What is the primary difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computational graph handling?\nA) TensorFlow uses static graphs; PyTorch uses dynamic graphs\nB) TensorFlow uses dynamic graphs; PyTorch uses static graphs\nC) Both use static graphs by default\nD) Both use dynamic graphs with eager execution\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation: Historically, TensorFlow used static computation graphs (define-and-run), requiring the graph to be built before execution. PyTorch, on the other hand, uses dynamic computation graphs (define-by-run), which are built on-the-fly during forward pass — making debugging easier. However, modern TensorFlow supports eager execution (dynamic behavior by default), though the distinction remains relevant in legacy code and performance optimization contexts.\nSection 5: Model Deployment & Optimization\nUnderstand how models move from Jupyter notebooks to production environments.\nModel Deployment (REST APIs, TensorFlow Serving)\nScalability and Distributed Systems\nModel Monitoring and A/B Testing\nHyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search, Optuna)\nInterpretability (SHAP, LIME) and Cost Optimization\nSample Question:\n\nQ5. What is the main benefit of using ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format for model deployment?\nA) It reduces model size through quantization\nB) It enables model interoperability across different frameworks\nC) It automatically optimizes hyperparameters\nD) It provides built-in monitoring for drift detection\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: ONNX allows models trained in one framework (e.g., PyTorch) to be exported and run in another (e.g., TensorFlow or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit). This promotes interoperability and simplifies deployment workflows, especially in multi-framework environments. While ONNX supports optimizations, its primary purpose is cross-framework compatibility.\nSection 6: Applications & Ethics\nExplore real-world use cases and the societal impact of AI technologies.\nIndustry Applications (Healthcare, Finance, NLP, Autonomous Systems)\nEthical AI and Bias Mitigation\nCase Studies (Recommender Systems, Anomaly Detection)\nEmerging Trends (Federated Learning, TinyML, Generative AI)\nCommunication and Collaboration in Teams\nSample Question:\n\nQ6. Which technique can help mitigate bias in a facial recognition system trained primarily on light-skinned individuals?\nA) Increase model complexity to improve accuracy\nB) Collect and include more diverse training data\nC) Use only grayscale images to reduce color bias\nD) Deploy the model only in regions with similar demographics\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: Algorithmic bias often stems from unrepresentative training data. Including more diverse examples — particularly underrepresented groups — helps the model learn fairer representations. While techniques like adversarial debiasing exist, data diversity remains the most effective and foundational approach to reducing bias in AI systems.\n\nWhat You’ll Gain\nOver 1400 practice questions with detailed explanations\nDeep understanding of core and advanced AI/ML concepts\nConfidence in tackling technical MCQ rounds and coding assessments\nInsight into real-world engineering challenges beyond academic theory\nLifetime access to a growing question bank updated with new trends\nEnroll now and turn your preparation into a structured, results-driven journey.

      "description": "Course Description:\nAre You Ready to Build Machine Learning Models That Work in the Real World?\nYou’ve probably heard of machine learning, seen flashy headlines about AI beating humans at games or diagnosing diseases, and maybe even tried a few Python tutorials. But when it comes to actually building and deploying ML models that solve real business problems — it’s easy to get stuck. That’s where this course comes in.\nThis is more than a course. It’s a complete, hands-on journey through the machine learning lifecycle — built for developers, analysts, and professionals who want to move from understanding theory to applying it with confidence.\nWhether you're looking to transition into a machine learning role, collaborate more effectively with data scientists, or lead a data-driven team, this course equips you with the tools, intuition, and experience to make an impact.\nCourse Overview\nThis course takes a practical approach to learning machine learning and deep learning. Rather than diving straight into math-heavy formulas or overly simplified toy problems, we focus on what you actually need to know to build intelligent systems — and how to do it using modern, open-source tools.\nStarting with the fundamentals of machine learning, you’ll explore how models learn, what makes them perform well (or poorly), and how to train and evaluate them using real-world data. You’ll work with classification algorithms like support vector machines and naive Bayes, and explore practical use cases such as admissions, forecasting, and outlier detection.\nAs you advance, you’ll build deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras — experimenting with architectures, layers, activation functions, and learning rates. You'll get hands-on experience with convolutional operations for image recognition, as well as transfer learning using pretrained models to boost performance on smaller datasets.\nYou’ll also explore how to scale your models using pipelines and distributed systems, preparing you for real-world deployment challenges.\nWhat You Will Learn\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\nDevelop end-to-end machine learning models using Python and open-source libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.\nApply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to real-world datasets.\nEvaluate and fine-tune deep learning architectures including CNNs and pretrained models.\nIdentify and prepare raw data for modeling, from feature engineering to training workflows.\nScale your machine learning pipelines using cloud-based and distributed systems.\nWhat Makes This Course Different\nUnlike many theoretical or overly simplified machine learning courses, this one is designed around real-world use cases, industry-standard tools, and a strong emphasis on intuitive understanding. Every topic is built to be immediately applicable—not just academic. By the end of this course, you'll have written working code, developed practical workflows, and built a toolkit of reusable techniques.\nHere’s how this course stands apart:\nHands-on from the start: You won’t just watch lectures—you actively write code, run experiments, and troubleshoot models.\nFocused on practical fundamentals: You learn topics like support vector machines, neural networks, and transfer learning through real-world examples, not abstract formulas.\nBuilt for modern ML roles: Whether you’re aiming to become a machine learning engineer, data scientist, or technical lead, this course prepares you with job-relevant skills.\nUses professional-grade tools: You’ll work with TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and other frameworks widely used in the machine learning industry.\nReady to Get Started?\nIf you’re looking for a course that goes beyond theory, teaches you how machine learning really works, and gets you building useful models right away — this is the course for you.\nJoin now and start your journey toward becoming a skilled, job-ready machine learning practitioner. The future of AI isn’t just for PhDs — it’s for builders. Let’s get started.",
