Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping Emotional Intelligence is the biggest key to overcoming negative emotions, such as anxiety and fear.\nThis course will give you the tools that you need to develop emotional intelligence so you can recognize negative emotions (such as anxiety) while they’re happening, identify the triggers that cause the emotion, and overcome the emotion.\nWe’ve been told lies about our emotions:\nEmotions are bad or that we’re not supposed to express them.\nWe should trust them—trust our gut—but, wait, no—emotions are irrational and shouldn’t be trusted\nEmotions are something that happens TO us and, therefore, they’re outside of our control.\nThe truth is that you CAN control your emotional state, including fear and anxiety. You can learn how to avoid the unwanted ones and purposefully create the ones you want. Just think about an astronaut—they HAVE to learn how to control their mind, emotions and body in order to handle the extreme stress of living in space. And, if they are human beings and can develop their emotional intelligence to overcome any anxiety and fear, so can you.\nIn fact, the skill of emotional intelligence is perhaps the most valuable skill you can EVER acquire. By developing your INTRApersonal emotional intelligence skills, you are able to understand and regulate your own emotions. And that is the best way to be prepared to develop your INTERpersonal skills, a.k.a. your ability to understand other people's emotions.\nBeing able to cope with and prevent high intensity stress, anxiety and fear unlocks our greatest abilities, frees us to go for our wildest dreams, and is a powerful factor that is often overlooked when comparing those who are successful at achieving their dreams and those who are not.\nFor most of us, in our homes and schools, no one teaches us about our emotions and how they work.\nNo one teaches that WE can control emotions such as fear and anxiety by using the power of our own mind to become aware of our thoughts and feelings and so unlock the ability to choose our emotions and direct the content of our lives.\nNo one teaches us that lack of emotional management is what leads to drama, anxiety, suffering, addiction, stress and poor decisions…. And that if we learn to control our emotions we can avoid these things.\nEmotional intelligence matters!\nAnd that’s why we’ve created this course.  We’ll focus on 3 of the most undesirable emotions—uncertainty, anxiety, fear—and how you can use emotional awareness and self-control techniques to take back control of your emotions and feel better now.\nWe’ll teach you what your emotions REALLY mean, how to recognize them, and how to direct them in a way that allows you to move toward your life goals\nWe’ll teach how to get out of your head and become the observer of your emotions as they happen, so you can avoid being hijacked by your own brain and feel in control again. In other words, you will take your power back from anxiety, stress, and negative emotions.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nEmotional Intelligence insights into to what emotions are and how they work\nEmotional Intelligence tools to recognize and identify your emotions\nEmotional Intelligence tools to direct your thoughts, giving you the power to direct your emotions\nEmotional Intelligence techniques for re-framing your perspective to find the blessings hidden within the pain\nHow to take back your power and put yourself first\nEmotional Intelligence techniques for stress reduction and to make every day more enjoyable\nProven emotional Intelligence tools for preventing loss of emotional control\nEmotional Intelligence techniques for de-escalating anxiety and fear\nNLP (neuro linguistic programming) techniques to rewire emotional reactions and anchor positive emotions\nEmotional intelligence tools to cope with challenges using humor and other self-empowerment techniques\nEmotional intelligence techniques to develop feelings of self-confidence and certainty\nEmotional intelligence techniques to master feeling hopeful and joyful\nSo, if you are ready to reprogram your brain and let go of negative emotions, such as anxiety and fear, and learn the power of emotional intelligence enroll now, we look forward to seeing you in the course!\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.  we look forward to seeing you in the course!\nSo, who are we:\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera. We both have over a decade in the field of education, psychology, social service and life coaching. Joeel has a Master’s Degree in Counseling and Education and is finishing his dissertation for his PhD in Psychology with an emphasis on happiness. He is also a former psychology instructor. We have over 800,000+ students from 200 countries. We have worked with thousands of individuals and we’ve observed clearly that the content of people’s thoughts and focus influence their emotional state, which then influences their behavior and the results and outcomes they experience in their lives. We have each also had experiences in life that have pushed us to learn how to understand, identify and influence our own mental and emotional states—and our ability to control our emotions is directly responsible for the success we have created in life. In this course, we teach you everything we have learned through our own experiences, as well as through what we’ve learned from our clients, our research, our careers and our education.\nCopyright  Transformation Services, Inc.

      "description": "Use industry-tested and science-based methods to get more done in less time, boost your career or business, and reclaim your work-life balance. Focus on results and fulfillment - without the burnout.\n\n\nMODERN AND RESEARCH-BASED APPROACH: Effortless Productivity for When Nothing Else Works\n\n\nEnergy + Timing = Peak Performance.\nIf you’ve tried every productivity hack and still feel drained, this course offers a different approach. Grounded in the latest research, it helps you pinpoint the exact times you’re at your mental best and when to step back.\n\n\nLearn the optimal moments for deep, focused work and when to recharge, so you can work smarter and get more out of each day.\n\n\nFREE UP TIME BY AVOIDING DISTRACTIONS, AND LOW-POTENTIAL TASKS\n\n\nWe all have tasks that get handed to us, we choose poorly, or seem fun but don’t add value. I’ll help you sharpen your priorities so you can cut out low-impact tasks and projects. This means freeing up substantial time—for yourself or for the work that truly matters.\n\n\nPERFORM LIKE THE TOP 1%\n\n\nWhen you focus on your most impactful tasks during your peak performance hours, everything changes. By dedicating ample time to what truly matters, you’ll produce work that’s 10X better than before.\nProduce work that's 10X better, and watch it drive 10X results.\nWeek by week, month by month, you'll see the compounding effect: greater achievements in your career or business and undeniable professional growth. All while witnessing your own personal transformation unfold.\n\n\nDO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU NEVER HAVE ENOUGH TIME? STRUGGLING TO STAY ORGANIZED?\n\n\nMany people who have a 9-5 job or are working on their own business feel exactly the same. There seems to be always too many things to do, too many people wanting your attention, and not enough time to do your best work or focus on what you love.\n\n\nNow you can finally learn an efficient way to prioritize your goals, and turn those priorities into a schedule that you can easily follow and not stray from. You'll end up accomplishing your most important work to your best abilities, while removing all the time wasters.\n\n\nNEVER HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR YOURSELF?\n\n\nDoes it seem like you have so many things to do that you never have enough time for yourself? At one time, I felt that too. I felt like I was mostly spending my time on work, and things I wanted to do for fun or personal fulfillment were getting left behind.\nThis course will help you regain more of your own time without sacrificing career growth. In fact, I'll show you task prioritization techniques which will help you excel at your career while having more time for yourself.\n\n\nLEARN HOW THE TOP-1% PRIORITIZE TASKS\n\n\nCEOs like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk don't let themselves be controlled by short-term stressors and pressures. Instead, they ask:\n\"What can I do today that will get me 100X exponential results in 5 years?\"\nTake Amazon, for example. They could charge more, but by focusing on long-term gains with low prices, they’ve become the biggest retailer in the world.\nThis course will teach you to create the same kind of lasting, exponential impact in your own work.\n\n\nMANAGE STRESS AND SHORT-TERM PRESSURES WHILE WORKING\n\n\nWhy don't most people focus on the long-term? Because when you are under stress, the only thing you can do is focus on removing the immediate stressor or pain point.\nBut after you learn to manage the stress from short-term pressures, you'll be able to give 100% of your effort to your most impactful tasks, and truly succeed.\n\n\nACHIEVE FULFILLMENT AND WORK-LIFE-BALANCE\n\n\nAfter focusing on your most impactful tasks and doing better work in those, you'll have less stress in your life and more free time.\nYou'll be able to use your newly found free time to do fulfilling tasks and whatever makes you happy.\n\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING SOFT SKILLS FOR BUSINESS\n\n\nIn professional settings, we often compete with co-workers or other businesses that have similar skillsets.

I started not only accomplishing more with my time, but the results and outcomes became exponentially better.\n\n\nTIME MANAGEMENT AND SCHEDULING WILL HELP YOU ANTICIPATE STRESSFUL MOMENTS\n\n\nEntrepreneurs and employees often experience stress when they have too much to do and are not able to handle it all at once.\nWith better time management, when you learn exactly how to set time aside for every task on your to-do list, you’ll massively reduce stress and overwhelm.
