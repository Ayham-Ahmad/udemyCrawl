      "description": "What is this course about?\nThis course deepens your understanding of what Yoga is and how it can transform you. It begins with the origins of Yoga in prehistoric times, how the ancient Yogis had a powerful vision for what life is and how to lead a fulfilling, joyous life and achieve perennial peace of mind. The course helps you realize that Yoga is not something one practices for an hour or two in a studio but  about discovering the purpose of one's life and living it. Yoga is how one lives one's life. It is about allowing the inner light to shine brightly and illuminate one's life.\nThe  evolution of Yoga is traced from prehistoric to modern times in this course. The narrative is an interesting mix of historical facts, nuggets of philosophy and symbolic Yogic tales.\nWhy should I take this course?\nThe course challenges many common and deep-routed misconceptions about Yoga and induces many “a ha” moments. It explores issues such as how old is the Yogic tradition, is Yoga Hindu religion in disguise, why so many different interpretations of Yogic texts exist and where is Yoga going in the modern world.\nParticipants also get glimpses of some of the ancient texts of India such as the Upanishads, Ramayana, Mahabharata and BhagavadGita. This course introduces many Yogis of ancient as well as modern times. It discusses the influence the West has had on how Yoga is perceived and also includes a section on how Yoga influences western thinkers as well as scientists.\nIt is very interesting to note how Yoga is bringing men and women of all backgrounds together in the spirit of one global family.\nWho is this course for?\nThis course will benefit Yoga practitioners, teachers, enthusiasts and academics as well as anyone interested in deepening their understanding of Yoga.\nWhat will I get upon completion of the course?\nUpon completion, course participants will have clear knowledge of the philosophical and historical roots and evolution of Yoga and how Yoga is a science of self-transformation.\nRam Vakkalanka is an RYT500 and E-RYT 200 - a Yoga teacher registered with the Yoga Alliance. This course qualifies for six non-contact hours of RYT continuing education credit.",

      "description": "Have you been struggling to manifest your heart’s dreams and desires with the Law of Attraction?\nAre you tired of relentlessly trying to change your thinking and getting no results?\nDid you know that the # 1 obstacle to creating whatever you desire with the Law of Attraction is your limiting beliefs and negative thoughts?\nYou might have read \"The Secret\", or seen the movie but it didn’t explain that your habits of thought and limiting beliefs are held deep within your subconscious mind, where they become long held automatic patterns of thought. These thoughts have a certain momentum to them which is hard to overcome when they have been part of your subconscious mind for so long. Your subconscious limiting beliefs are the # 1 obstacle to creating whatever you desire. No matter how hard you try with your conscious mind, those limiting subconscious beliefs won’t budge.\nThis course will help you replace your limiting beliefs, and negative thoughts which you continue to think over and over, with new positive beliefs and thoughts safely and easily.\nThe key to changing your limiting beliefs is the powerful mind tool called hypnosis and specifically self-hypnosis. Self-hypnosis enables you to connect with your subconscious mind, where you can place new positive, empowering thoughts and beliefs. It has been scientifically proven that self-hypnosis is one of the most effective tools in changing your subconscious limiting beliefs and improving your life. You don’t need to find the cause of your limiting beliefs or work at fixing your negative thinking you just need to replace them with new positive thoughts and beliefs. This is exactly what self-hypnosis and this course can do for you.\nThe course will make the Law of Attraction work for you rather than against you and change struggle into ease by:\nTeaching you how to confidently use self-hypnosis to replace your limiting beliefs and thoughts with positive empowering beliefs and thoughts, thereby changing what you attract into your life. The self-hypnosis technique taught within this course can also be used as a meditation, allowing you to train your mind into a deep meditative state quickly and easily, reducing harmful stress and allowing you to feel more calm and relaxed.\nOffering a deeper understanding of how the Law of Attraction works in your life. This will enable you to live the life you choose with more financial freedom, the relationships you seek, and vibrant health.\nIt will also show you to appreciate your feelings by understanding how important they are in knowing what you will be attracting and how important feeling good is if you wish to become magnetic to your heart’s desire and attain a happiness mindset.\nThis course offers video lectures and audio guided meditation that will take you step-by-step through the process. I’ve taught these strategies for years, and I’ve made it extremely easy to learn to create whatever you want. The course is an introductory course to my more extensive course \"Law of Attraction and Self Hypnosis: Changing Limiting Beliefs\" and if used correctly and practised diligently it does contain everything you need to be able to get the law of attraction to work for you rather than against you.\nIf you’re ready to acquire this powerful mindset changing tool and take your life to the next level, then it’s time to get started with the Law of Attraction. Join me on this journey of exploration and manifestation by hitting the \"Buy now\" button above to start creating the life of your dreams and I’ll see you in the course.\nWhat students have been saying about this course.\n\"Great course and very powerful It is a liberating experience doing this course I am now in the path of mastery of the law of attraction To manifest my hearts desire Thank you so much! :D\"\nEnzo Coloso\n\"Absolutely fantastic thought provoking, informative, easy to understand, self motivating - thank you and we'll done for doing this and sharing with others\"\nCarol Jenkin\n\"This was a great course. It inspired me to purchase the full course. I've learned a lot and have deeply benefited from the guided hypnosis meditations. Definitely worth taking this course if you're interested in the Law of Attraction\".\nTimna Gonzalez\n\"Perfect introductory course on the Law of Attraction. Very well explained with only the necessary information presented. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is unfamiliar with LOA or wishes an excellent refresher course on the subject. Thank you Chris! You are a fantastic instructor!\"\nJim Seibel\n\"This short course was excellent. I took this course as an introduction to the law of attraction and hypnosis. It was mostly due to my curiosity to know more about the subject. I enjoyed this course, as it was very well put together, and Chris' voice alone is mesmerizing :)\"\nAli Alarafat\n“An informative and well-paced course. Enjoyed it. Easy to follow and understand. Will buy other courses from the Instructor. Thank you, great course.”\nNina\n“This is by far the best course I have taken on this site and the fact that it was free was incredible.

Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\n\n\n\n\nHave you heard the call of your true self, reminding you of your forgotten dreams?\nHave you felt drawn to break free of your limitations and live more authentically?\nIs there a fire within you that burns fiercely even after years of trying to snuff it out?\nHave wake-up calls and ah-ha moments inspired you to finally embrace becoming who you were meant to be?\nTransformation happens...\nSometimes it sneaks up on us after years of quiet suffering. Other times it is the inevitable side effect of a life struck by a sudden tsunami of unwanted change and pain. Sometimes we dive head first into the journey we feel called to, but other times we cling desperately to “what was”, like a terrified butterfly unwilling to let go of the empty casing that once housed the caterpillar. Life is exhausting, painful, and dark when trapped in the cell of our resistance to change.\nThe truth is we cannot always control what happens in our lives, but we can control what we do with it.\nWe have a choice—we can submit to a life of mediocrity and unfulfillment, or we can decide that life is supposed to be more—that we have a greater purpose for being here and we will do whatever it takes to determine our own destiny.\nWe invite you embark on a quest—a hero’s journey. Along the way, you’ll no longer see your pain or challenges as obstacles, but instead you’ll see them as stepping stones to a greater purpose. You’ll stop allowing others to write the chapters of your life story, and you’ll decide, once and for all, to live life on your terms.\nTransformation is an inside job, and change is a process. This course isn’t just a list of processes to create lasting change and reach your goals, although it does cover that. This course is about changing from the inside out and preventing the obstacles that tend to stop people from reaching their true potential.\nAnd that’s why this course is designed to help you:\nIdentify the blocks that hold you back so you can become unstoppable\nOvercome fear of change, rejection and failure so you can feel confident going for your dream\nDevelop self-mastery by reprogramming limiting beliefs\nDevelop a growth mindset so you know without a doubt that nothing can stand in your way again\nGet absolutely clear about what you REALLY want and who you REALLY are so you can stop living everyone else’s dreams\nWe invite you to join us on a quest of transformation that will lead you on a hero’s journey to a place where you really can do what you dream of and become all that you are meant to be.\n\n\nSo, are you ready to transform your life? If so enroll now, we look forward to seeing you in the course!\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.\n\n\nWho are we?\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera, serial entrepreneurs, authors, speakers, and educators. We started our company, Transformation Academy, because we have experienced transformation in our own lives and we know that what unlocks every person’s potential is finding the purpose in their pain and embracing their true path. We have over a decade of experience in the field of psychology and life coaching, including Joeel’s Masters in Counseling and his research on happiness for his PhD in Psychology. Plus, we have 800,000+ students from 200 countries.\nSo, will you answer the call?\n\n\n\n\nCopyright Transformation Services, Inc. All Rights Reserved",

She loves what she does and she is very knowledgeable in her work. I have taken almost all of her courses to better myself on my spiritual journey and I can't thank her enough! - Crystal\nAnother one of Melissa's amazing courses! I am looking forward to using these practices in my daily life and eventually guiding others in meditation and mindfulness - Ashley\nYes, this course was what I have been looking for. Love it. - Blanca\nThis course is what I wish I would have known a long time ago! - Lisa\nAll of Melissa’s courses are so detailed and so well explained. Her energy is so peaceful. She is amazing. I enjoyed every one of the courses and I’ve learn so much! She prepares you for everything before, during and what to do next after the course if you chose to become a practitioner. She gives all of the tools necessary to succeed. Thank you so much Melissa, forever grateful to you. Much love and light. Namaste. - Cecile\nAs the way we use technology changes, so does the concept of what our lives should look like. We no longer track our progress against our own personal bests, but instead compare ourselves to others whose lives are on a totally different trajectory to ours. Using a disjointed comparison like that makes us we feel like we’re not doing enough (not smart enough, not good enough) to keep up with personal aspirations, societal expectations, and workplace demands.\nThankfully, there is a way to break this downward spiral – for good. This ‘way’ will be through processes I call Mindfulness + Meditations, which play a big part in allowing your inner light to shine brighter. And with that light shining, you see the truth beyond any so-called imperfection and judgement.I'm really excited to show you how easy it is to live a life of true happiness, inner peace, and real love - every single day. What's more, these steps will be most helpful during those really trying times, whether with family, friends or at the workplace. And yes, they really are easy because I do them myself! I hope you're ready to take the first step to your best life!\nPlease note that there is a prerequisite to take this course, you must either already be a certified Meditation Guide from my Learn to Meditate in Minutes course or hold an equivalent qualification from another verifiable teacher or school.",

To understand that, you must understand that there are default PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH, like HEALING, Your HEARTBEAT, and ORGAN FUNCTION. These programs are running from you Subconscious Mind WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT\n\nModern Science says that 95% of the choices you make day to day have NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR COGNITIVE THOUGHT.  The remaining 5% of your day is being played out by YOU, YOUR THINKING MIND! Let's say that again, 95% of your day is not being played out by your thinking mind.\n\nIn 2014 I found out about this power and I was making just over $60,000 a year. I'm a college graduate and work in a professional field but at the time my faith was low.  I started to read some books and watch videos AND IT ALL OF A SUDDEN CLICKED. Because of my many years of bible training I realised that MUCH OF IT IS ALLEGORY. and is hidden from the \"WISE.\"\n\nI began a journey and compiled a number of simple exercises that brought AWARENESS to my SUBCONSCIOUS MIND and since then, it has BECOME MY BEST FRIEND! In 2017 I went WELL OVER $100,000 in pay when 3 years earlier I couldn't fathom being over 6 figures.\n\nThere are many witnesses to this great power and if you can believe in yourself you too can achieve more!

      "description": "THIS COURSE IS HIGHLY RATED (4.77/5.00) BECAUSE IT CONTAINS A SPECIAL SECRET. Just look at the reviews\n***** Honestly one of the most influential courses I’ve ever taken.     Pauline Vidick     5 stars   *****\n***** Marc is a wonderful trainer who really knows his stuff. I have binged watched this course and have learnt so much already. :) I intend to go through it again and take notes as this knowledge is exciting.                           Justin Putland   5 stars  *****\n***** What an awesome course !! I'm super excited to put this into practice                Simone Pfeiffer  5 stars   *****\n***** Excellent course. Finished it in one day. Manifested a couple of small things before the last lecture.   Javad Hashtroudian   5 stars\n***** It is an amazing course which not only teaches you an amazingly simple technique but explains it in detail, so you can see how it all fits together.I highly recommend it.    Stuart Croll  5 stars  *****\n***** WOW love this course a lot to learn    Brian Thomas 5 stars *****\n***** Super powerful yet simple technique that works very well … .   Parmar Nilesh  5 stars *****\n***** This was fun, Marc’s teaching style was approachable and better yet the technique he taught worked!   Andrew Kosorok 5 stars\nTHESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE REVIEWS\nTHERE ARE MANY MORE\nTHIS IS THE #1 MANIFESTATION COURSE ON UDEMY FOR A REASON - IT WORKS !!!!!!!\n\n\nThis programme includes a proven technique that shows you how to MANIFEST your thoughts.\nAND.....the technique takes just 90 seconds.\nYou will benefit in two ways from this course :\nMANIFESTATION SKILL  - I will teaching you an ancient skill of being able to manifest your thoughts.\n\n\nMORE INCOME - you receive my personal manifestation 8-page training programme  to make $500-600 each month from running a simple 2 hour event.\n************PROVEN TECHNIQUE****************\nIt is proven because I have successfully used the technique to attract money (over $375.000 over the last 4 years), two cars, a wonderful relationship, great health (previously has 18 ops on my vocal cords) and literally 1,000's of other things both big and small.\nWhen you get good at this technique, you will be able to think of 'things' and they just happen.\nThe technique originated over 2,000 years ago and was kept a secret because it gives 'ordinary people' control over their lives. I have adapted it to the modern day and in my course I will explain :\nINSTANT MANIFESTATION - how you can think of something and it just happens\nSPIRITUAL HELP 24/7 - why the spiritual world wants you to succeed and is there helping you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\nMANIFESTATION MISTAKES - where people go wrong and block 'stuff' coming into their lives\nThe beauty of this course is that you can test it, by first manifesting small things. This then provides you with the belief and confidence to manifest bigger and more exciting items into your life.\nThe technique I will show you is simple and anyone can do it.\nFor 22 years I have been working with energy and have developed a skill of knowing how things, life and the spiritual world works. This has come from testing everything that I learn so I can PROVE TO YOU it works.\nPlease understand that my work is based on my personal experience and is unique. To know how to manifest, you first know how life and the spiritual world works. That is why in my course I explain :\nTHE SPIRITUAL WORLD - why we are here and how the 1% physical world (us) exists hand in hand with the 99% non-physical (spiritual) world\nSPIRITUAL HELP 24/7 - why the spiritual world wants you to succeed and is there helping you 24 hours a ay, 7 days a week\nSPIRITUAL CONNECTION - how you can tap into the 99% spiritual world and have a permanent connection (TO MANIFEST)\nIf you ignore the spiritual world, it is like having the most brilliant of cars but with no fuel. Its absolutely useless and will go no where.\nThe beauty of this course is that you can test it, by first manifesting small things. This then provides you with the belief and confidence to manifest bigger and more exciting items into your life.\nFor me, I love the fact that it puts me in control of my life, makes me feel content and happy.\nYou also receive an invitation to my SUPERachievers Group on facebook, which is for people who desire to lead a SUPERspecial life. Each week I provide FREE coaching in the TRUTH about how life works so that your life can get better and better.\nI look forward to you joining this course and being able to work with you.\n'Stay excited.'\nmarc",

      "description": "Learning Hypnosis Keeping Hypnosis Simple in 2024\n\n\nLearning Hypnosis Keeping Hypnosis Simple\nIf you want to learn how to hypnotize someone one of the most used hypnotic inductions by hypnotists is called progressive relaxation where you get someone who wants to be hypnotized to close their eyes and focus their attention on different muscle groups throughout the body.\nbut before you jump in and just try something like that you must first get someone into the right mindset by making sure they have no fears about being hypnotized and to do this you discuss the most common misconceptions about hypnosis.\nonce they understand these, they will have a new curious mindset instead of a mindset of fear as fear creates only one thing for a good hypnotic induction process failure.\nSo, it is important to start any hypnotic induction with a good foundation and that is overcoming misconceptions then it is time to open the mind to new possibilities with suggestibility tests.\nAnd while these are called tests of suggestibility, they really are a step by step approach to engage and open their mind by visually seeing how what they think effects their body so if what they think effects their body what they think effects their life and if they are just following ideas you are offering and they are accepting them something is happening to their body that is beyond conscious control.\nSo, once they have engaged and respond reasonably well their mindset has changed, they accept that what you say to them makes something happen at a subconscious level so therefore when you say something to hypnotize them there is only one place to go into hypnosis.\nAlso accepting the words which are suggestions that take them into hypnosis which is a very nice place to go means that your words has taken them somewhere that makes them feel good so if you give them a suggestion for changing an old behaviour to something positive, they may accept that change to become their new reality.\nYou will also learn how to discover your hypnotic voice by experiencing the difference between an ordinary speaking voice and a hypnotic voice along with my tips on how you could discover your own hypnotic voice.\nYou will also learn the importance of the right types of suggestions so that you take someone only in the direction they want to go because your wording needs more precision than everyday conversation as the inner critic that makes choices is offline during hypnosis, but I will demonstrate what I mean in this course.\nOne of the most important lessons you will learn in this course is how to get someone’s mind back on track if they should wander and get caught up in emotional stuff.\nAnd of course, the de-induction what to say to someone to bring them out of trance correctly and if you don’t what you should do.\nWhat will you learn?\n1. Suggestibility Tests for getting into the right hypnotic mindset.\n2. Why Hypnosis Suggestions Don’t Work.\n3. How to get your Hypnotic voice\n4. Giving Suggestions in Hypnosis\n5.

(with over 15 years as a hypnotherapist, coach and mentor to 10's of 1000's of students globally)\n\n\nAll you have to do is enjoy these specifically selected and designed abundance audios while you lie down and allow these powerful hypnotic instructions to dissolve all the limitations that are stopping you from automatic abundance.\n\n\nThere are 10 handpicked audios (plus instructions) for you to listen too, as many times as you want. Whenever you want.\n\n\nIn fact, many people choose to “jump-start” their day by listening to an audio Abundance Induction when they get up in the morning.\n\n\nThen they just go about their day as normal (doing all their normal things) -- except suddenly they are noticing... A new-found energy And\nopportunities falling into their lap.\n\n\nWhat will you notice?\n\n\nWell, it's impossible for me to say for sure. All I can say with complete conviction is if all you do is know what you want to improve and then just listen to all of the Abundance Induction a day for 35 days you will experience one or more of three things:\n\n\nHow you feel about your situation (the thing you wanted to improve or change) will be completely new and much more positive. You will see things in a completely \"new\" light.\n\n\nYour situation will be unfolding in a way that you can see positive changes taking place. And you won't feel like you're struggling to make those changes either. They'll seem to be happening naturally just like water flowing down a stream.\n\n\nYour situation will have completely resolved itself. Perhaps you will have landed a new job. Been given money to pay off a bill. Or perhaps been given an opportunity to take part in something you've always wanted to do. Whatever \"it\" is, it will have fallen into your lap.\n\n\nBut don't just take my word for it. Prove it for yourself with the Abundance Inductions.",

      "description": "Personal Development, Personal Transformation, and Finding Your Life Purpose - All humans grapple with these topics, but only some create a meaningful process for living life to its full potential. This is the longest, most thorough, and detailed Personal Development and Personal Transformation course available on this platform!\nTJ Walker has been leading personal development seminars around the globe for more than 30 years. His unique approach to becoming a creative and fulfilled human being takes the best of the traditional self-development world and fuses it with 2020s realities and unique technology solutions using your cell phone in a liberating rather than enslaving manner.\nWe live in a modern world of overabundance everywhere. We face an overabundance of stimulation and content coming at us from our cell phones and screens. We are drowning in an overabundance of stuff, junk, and possessions that arrive cheaply and near-instantly from Amazon and your favorite superstore. And we are overwhelmed with giant portions of fat and sugar-filled food and snacks made avail to use every waking moment.\nModern overabundance is fueled by a digital delivery system that makes traditional self-help techniques impotent. In the modern, attention-driven economy, everybody is fighting for our mind space. This course will teach you how to aggressively take back control of your own mind, your own habits, and your own creativity by counter-programming your brain with your own wipes, dreams and goals.\nThe world is splitting into two groups at greater acceleration: The creators versus the consumers, those who take action versus those who are passive, the haves versus the have-nots, the fulfilled versus the empty, the ones who create a lasting legacy and those who are soon forgotten.\nWhich group do you want to be a part of?\nYou can take 100% control over your present and future. You have the ability to condition your thoughts, actions, and methods of living life for more fulfilling results.\nTJ Walker is the founder of Createocracy and the developer of Selfie-Speaking Programming audios, a system where you create your own audio \"infomercial\" to rewire your brain.\nIf you are ready to live a more active life, develop your own creative projects and live a healthier and more meaningful life, then sign up today for this Complete Personal Development Personal Transformation Course on Createocracy.\nTJ Walker has conducted personal development workshops in more than 30 countries around the globe.

I highly recommend this course!!! JT, thank you for your service to help others improve and succeed!!!!\" Beth Kay\n\"I have already taken a course on Leadership from him and this is the reason I have enrolled for the second one. TJ is an amazing mentor and a great speaker. He is my personal benchmark and standard, especially for speaking skills. Keep up the good work.\" Zafar Iqbal Ahmed\n\"There is no Real good structure in this course. A strange combination of two courses so far, with mixed topics. No definitely not recommended, I will finish it just to know what to avoid.\" Malgorzata Cybulska Dusson\n\"Yes, it's a good match. It tells us to think of the personality, the way we communicate, things we do; and guides us / give tips to change certain ways/habits.\" Swapnil\n\"Yes, I need to develop myself as a leader. For that to happen I must equip myself with content related to personal development and apply the knowledge in my life.\" Mojau Mokone\n\"I like the fact that I can rewire my brain and I also believe that social media most of the time misleading and negative information spread but the government usually do the same as social media; therefore it is good to follow your own gut feelings and focus on positive ways of thinking.\"  Francois Venter\nEnroll now to Complete Personal Development Personal Transformation Course!

I will also discuss about Chakras & Color Therapy in This Course!\nThis course is designed, keeping in mind that you don't have any prior knowledge and understanding for Color Therapy. This course will cover Color Therapy as a whole and enable you to practice the methods and techniques to deal with common ailments.\nColor therapy, also known as chromotherapy, is an ancient holistic healing practice that uses colors and light to balance the body’s energies and promote emotional, physical, and mental healing. Its roots can be traced back thousands of years, with evidence of its use in ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian civilizations. In ancient Egypt, the use of sunlight and colors for healing was common, and temples often incorporated colored walls and glass to expose individuals to healing colors. Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine includes the concept of color, especially in relation to the five elements and their corresponding colors. In India, the practice is closely tied to the chakra system, where each of the seven chakras is associated with a specific color. Color therapy was rediscovered in the West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with notable figures such as Dr. Edwin Babbitt and Dr. Theo Gimbel researching and promoting its use. Dr. Babbitt's book \"The Principles of Light and Color\" (1878) explored the relationship between colors and their effects on the body, while Dr. Gimbel's work focused on the therapeutic potential of colored light. Throughout the 20th century, the interest in color therapy grew, particularly in the fields of psychology, alternative medicine, and energy healing.\nThe benefits of color therapy are vast and include emotional healing, physical wellness, and mental clarity. Each color is thought to resonate with specific frequencies that affect the mind and body differently:\n- Red is associated with vitality, strength, and passion. It is often used to stimulate energy, improve circulation, and increase motivation. It’s beneficial for physical exhaustion and low vitality.\n- Orange promotes creativity, enthusiasm, and joy. It is thought to boost the immune system and aid digestion while balancing emotions and encouraging optimism.\n- Yellow is linked to intellect, clarity, and mental focus. It is often used to treat anxiety and depression, promote mental clarity, and enhance concentration.\n- Green represents balance, healing, and harmony. It is believed to calm the body and mind, alleviate stress, and support physical healing, particularly in the areas of the heart and respiratory system.\n- Blue is a color of tranquility, peace, and communication. It is often used to reduce tension, ease pain, and promote deep relaxation. It is also thought to help with sleep disorders.\n- Indigo helps stimulate intuition, psychic abilities, and mental clarity. It is believed to calm the mind and aid in deep meditation, balancing the third eye chakra.\n- Violet is a color that resonates with spiritual awareness, intuition, and transformation. It is used to relieve stress and support the development of spiritual practices.\nColor therapy is used in various ways, including through the application of colored light, visualization techniques, wearing clothing in certain colors, and the arrangement of colors in one’s environment. It can also be integrated into energy healing practices such as Reiki or acupuncture, where color is introduced to balance the energy flow. Practitioners may guide clients to focus on certain colors during meditation or use colored light to treat specific physical and emotional ailments.\nIn modern times, color therapy is often used as a complementary treatment in the fields of psychology, stress management, and alternative medicine. It has proven particularly effective in addressing conditions like anxiety, depression, insomnia, and chronic pain. Many people also use color therapy to improve their home or office environments by choosing specific colors that promote the desired emotional atmosphere, such as calming blues for bedrooms or energizing reds for creative spaces.\nAs scientific research into color psychology and its effects on the brain continues to grow, color therapy has gained wider acceptance in mainstream wellness practices. The therapeutic use of color is now seen as a valuable tool for promoting emotional well-being, supporting mental health, and enhancing physical healing. Whether through light exposure, meditation, or simply surrounding oneself with the right colors, color therapy offers a holistic approach to achieving balance, harmony, and wellness in life.\nThis course is for\nThose that are interested in learning about Color Therapy!\nThis course is for those interested in Color and how they affect a person\nThis course is for those who want to practice Color Therapy for themselves\nThis course is for open-minded people and beginners looking to learn color in an exciting, new, and intuitive way\nThis course is for those who want to become a Color Therapist and work with clients\nWorking with Color Therapy is a powerful lifestyle practice that you can use every day to create magic in every aspect of your life.

However, many people do not yet feel confident enough with all the different terms and concepts that belong to the topic of LGBT+ to have a good, respectful conversation about it with someone that identifies as LGBT+, or in any other setting, for example at work, school or with family or friends.\nWouldn’t it be nice to be able to learn about this from the safety of your own home, from someone that actually is a part of that LGBT+ community?\nMy name is Lara Louise, and I am an avid advocate of Diversity and Inclusion. As a Lesbian myself, my ‘specialty’ is LGBT+ inclusion. Over the past years I have taught many people about the topic of LGBT+, and now I can share my knowledge and experience with you through this online course.\nIn this course, I will teach you all about that full LGBT+ alphabet soup. After this, you’ll know exactly why there are so many letters, and what they all mean. You’ll also know when to use which words, and, not unimportantly, which words NOT to use.\nNext to learning about which letters the alphabet soup consist of and what they mean, we will also talk about the differences between concepts such as Gender Expression and Gender Identity, so you know when you can use these in a conversation or recognize them when others do. Although it might seem complicated at first, I’ll share some easy tricks that’ll help you remember the meanings of these terms and when to use them.\nThere could be many reasons for you personally to participate in this course.\nIt could be that you have a friend, a family member or a colleague that has come out to you as being LGBT+ and you want to make sure that you know enough about the topic to support them properly;\nMaybe for you, it’s not about knowing anyone personally, but you want to educate yourself so that you can better participate in discussions around the topic at school, at work or in any other settings.\nOr maybe you identify as LGBT+ yourself and you are curious to learn a little more about the people that identify with the ‘other’ members of the alphabet soup.\nWhatever your reason, I am very happy that you are here, and I’m confident that I’m able to make sure you get what you’re looking for.",

You will develop your skills and learn how to create and structure coaching programs with your clients to give them the success they are looking for.\nTransforming your career is just a few clicks away!.\n\nUniquely, this course features video footage captured at our live Association for Coaching Accredited Coach Training Sessions. This will help heighten your training experience and see new life coach students in action.\nDelivered by Steve Payne, an expert International Life Coach, published personal development author and one of very few Certified Master Trainers of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) in the world, the course mixes studio and live training videos, graphics, downloads, text, quizzes and tests to help you chart your progress. The course also mixes elements of neuroscience, positive psychology and NLP. These elements only serve to deepen the skills of the life coach.\nOur Philosophy behind this Life Coach Training course\nWe have a 1-2-3 approach to life coaching. After understanding the client's goal, we 1) Understand the way the client views the world (their values, beliefs and interpretations), 2) understand the client's triggers and traits (what they like and dislike doing) and 3) create strategies based on the first two elements.\nSuccess in life coaching comes from clients achieving their goals. In order for a life coach to help a client put strategies in place that succeed, they need to ensure that the client completes tasks that move them forward. They need to also ensure the client has a growth mindset based on personal empowering beliefs. For that reason our life coaching course focuses on understanding how individuals think and create their 'model of the world', what beliefs empower them and what beliefs hold them back, what is important to them, what they dislike and what they love. Only then can we make sure that the strategies we put in place, along with the client, have the greatest chance of success. This in turn will help us achieve more with our clients, create more clients through positive word-of-mouth referrals, and find greater success as a life coach.\nSo what are the skills of a successful life coach? You will learn:\nHow to understand people\nHow to build trusting relationships\nHow to listen like an expert\nHow to help others develop successful strategies\nHow to ask the right questions\nHow to create tasks as a life coach\nHow to develop a growth mindset\nAs a life coach, you will show others strategies for how to succeed in life by setting goals. Setting goals and achieving them requires clients to follow processes and this course has a number of processes that will help with this.\nBy the end of this course, you will have the confidence to make a real difference to the lives of others, and, just as importantly, to your own life! You will be able to help your clients gain clarity and focus, after all, what is life without purpose or intention? You will be able to help your clients know what they want, how to get there, and provide strategies for action.\nThe course will also be updated regularly, to provide you with the very latest information and greater depth.\nThis course comes with a certificate of completion when you have finished all the modules.",

It's not just the responsibility of one person or department, but of the whole organization. All types of people can contribute to talent management, from executives to middle managers to recruiters to HR pros.\nThree things are usually in a talent management system:\nFirst, you've got to identify the current and future skill gaps within an organization and figure out how to fix them.\nIt's also important to recruit and hire employees who can fill these positions and contribute to the organization's success.\nLastly, current employees need to grow and develop.\nHOW DOES KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT WORK?\nAn organization's knowledge management process involves creating, sharing, using, and managing information. Using the knowledge at their disposal to improve the organization organically. This course will explain the major concepts of Talent Management,  Knowledge Management, Human Resources, HR management, HR development and the knowledge management system.\nA Knowledge Management system consists of these things:\n· Capture company knowledge with this simple process\n· Review information coming in by a Community of Practice (internal experts)\n· Community of Practice and technology support\nThe five major topics I want to cover in this master's course are:\n1. What talent management and knowledge management are and why they're important\n2. Talent and knowledge management pillars, components\n3. Developing a talent management strategy and process\n4.

      "description": "What are people saying about this course?\n\n\"I really loved this course. This isn't just sitting and mediating, it's learning how to make meditation a part of your everyday life. Highly recommended!\" – Adam Domine\n\"I’m happier now than I’ve ever been before because I use the mindfulness tools taught to me by Jeremy every day.\" – Donna Seagle\n\n\"Jeremy is an excellent meditation teacher. His patient, open-minded, and enthusiastic teaching style are grounded in everyday life, and really help make the practice accessible and relatable.\" – Emily Du\nThis course provides an in-depth introduction to the foundations of mindfulness meditation practice, in an easy-to-follow, 14-day training guide. With the power of mindfulness meditation, you will learn how to manage your stress and anxiety, and cultivate more joy, happiness, and gratitude!\nThis course focuses specifically on the practical implementation of mindfulness meditation, rather than just a conceptual understanding. Whether you're a beginner just starting out, or already an advanced practitioner, if you're a interested in building a strong foundation of HOW to practice mindfulness meditation, using an approach that is based on science and reason, then this is the course for you!\nThe instructions and lectures in this course are clear, concise, and easy to understand, allowing you to master the basics of meditation without having to learn any spiritual jargon, travel to any foreign countries, or even leave the comfort of your own home. In just 2 weeks, you will be able to master the basics of mindfulness, and you will have begun building the foundation of a daily habit that sticks! This science based training in mindfulness practice will help take you from complete beginner, to experienced meditation practitioner in no time at all!\nUpon completion of the course, you will be able to:\nConfidently practice mindfulness in any situation.\nMaster the key concepts and practices of mindfulness meditation.\nIdentify and overcome the 5 most common obstacles in meditation.\nRelease stress and anxiety from the body using the mindful body-scan technique.\nFeel more at peace, even in high stress situations.\nEasily sit in meditation for long periods without feeling anxiety or restlessness.\nFeel connected to the present moment more frequently throughout the day.\nHave an increased sense of self-worth and self-confidence.\nFinish meditation sessions feeling more calm and relaxed.\nBounce back from anxiety attacks and emotional difficulties more quickly than before.\nDevelop a consistent meditation habit that feels joyful and is sustainable.\n\n\nCourse Contents and Overview:\nThis course begins with the essential mindfulness meditation techniques, such as mindful breathing, mindful body awareness, and mindful listening, and then moves on to slightly more advanced techniques such as mindfulness of thoughts and emotions.\nThe second half of the course goes into how to identify and overcome some of the most common obstacles you will face in mindfulness meditation practice, such as distraction, restlessness, self doubt, and judgement.\nFinally, the course ends with a loving-kindness practice, designed to help you learn the practice of cultivating loving-kindness for yourself and others, an integral aspect of any well-rounded mindfulness meditation practice.\nCultivating the SKILL and SCIENCE of mindfulness:\nThroughout the course there are guided mindfulness meditations at each step of the way. Rather than merely approaching mindfulness as an intellectual concept, this course gives you first-hand experience in order to tap directly into the state of mindful awareness, so you will be actively cultivating the skills of mindfulness as the course progresses. Each step of the way, you will be reducing stress and anxiety, and cultivating more happiness, gratitude, and contentment – all you need to do is follow along with the guided meditations!\nIn meditation, and particularly with mindfulness, an experiential understanding is much more important than a conceptual one, which is why this course focuses on the practical foundations. All of the lessons are based on a science of the mind, so there is no need to adopt a new belief system, take on any gurus, or learn how to chant things you don't understand. Mindfulness is much more of a science, or direct investigation, of the mind, than a belief system. By the end of the course, you will have the tools for investigating your own mind on a daily basis, which will allow you to let go of negative habits of the mind like stress, anxiety, and anger, and instead live with more joy, gratitude, and happiness!",

A way to discipline yourself, a way to tame those bad habits and institute new, Ass-kicking habits. To get the full benefit of the program requires work on your part. The only way you will succeed is to follow the instructions and MAKE THE DECISION to go through with it. Decide to never quit. It won't be easy, but when you emerge 30 days later you will be amazed at the energy, creativity and vitality you will feel. You can become as you wish to be, it requires only a change of mindset, a smidgen of self-discipline and some will-power.\n30 Days of Discipline is designed to help increase feelings of:\n\nEnergy\nVitality\nCreativity\nStrength\nConfidence\nSelf Discipline\nSelf Determination\nPride\nAccomplishment\nHere is what some of the guys who went through the 30 Days of Discipline program are saying… \"It may just be that the purpose of your life is to become a Man. When you meet death or God and you are asked what you did with your short time on Earth, you can say “I became a Man\". When all other males around you gave up their manhood, when your whole society conspired to ruin you, when circumstances worked against you, at least you can stand firm and say “I became a Man despite it all\". You're not a Man because you do what a Man does, but you can't be a Man without doing what a Man does. The place to start, is 30 days of discipline. I started it over 4 months ago and it has helped me immensely in my entrepreneurial activities, to become more decisive and of course, the foundation of all achievement, it has helped me with my discipline.\" - Russ\n\n\"Thanks for the kick in the ass Victor. 30 days is already changing my life.\" - Seth\n\"Cheers for the checklist Victor, working well so far here in the UK.\" - Chris\"\nAm one week into the 30 days of discipline and feeling marvelous. Late middle-aged, successful career, good marriage; children out and successful, starting to gain some weight and boredom approaches. Needed and found the challenge with excellent results. No more 4-Hour Body b.s. with “slow carbs\". Should have found and started 30 Days of Discipline long ago. Almost forgot what it was like to feel like an 18 year old paratrooper again. Oh, and others have noticed too. No prisoners today!\" - Oyaji\nI just completed 30 days of discipline and let me tell you this program is pure gold. These 30 days has taught me one of the most important lessons in my life, HAVE A PURPOSE AND QUIT MAKING EXCUSES. Have a goal each and every day and do what it takes to achieve that goal. That's why I'll continue to use each habit inside 30 days of discipline. These habits have taught me how to apply the lesson I mentioned above, stop making excuses and start achieving... Guess what, my numbers went up in the gym as well. I hit PR's...Bottom line is stop making excuses and keep moving forward. Thank you for this invaluable lesson and advice with 30 days of discipline. - Steve\n\"...Not even 24 hours later I feel like I'm kicking ass. This is a pivotal moment in my life. I can FEEL it.

Details for how to request the official certification and optional 15 CPD/CEU credits will be provided at the end of the course.\nTHIS COURSE IS PART OF OUR MASTER SELF-CARE + BOUNDARIES COACH CERTIFICATION (ALONG WITH OUR SELF-CARE COACH, EMPOWERMENT SELF-DEFENSE COACH, EMPOWERMENT COACH AND PEOPLE PLEASER COACH CERTIFICATIONS).\n\n\nWe are top Udemy instructors in the personal development category. Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\nThe course also has a thriving Facebook networking group.\n\n\nIf you would prefer to take a version of this course that is meant for individuals, not life coaches, check out the \"Develop True Confidence and a Growth Mindset\" course.\nLife Coaching: Help your clients develop TRUE Confidence\nHave you ever had a client who had great potential and ideas, and maybe even a great plan, but who didn’t follow through? In life coaching it is normal to have this experience with your clients.\nMaybe you’ve even experienced this yourself! The truth is, we are often our own worst enemies. We know what we need to do but we don’t do it. We procrastinate. We talk ourselves out of it. Our inner-critic goes on the attack. We develop self-doubt. We become paralyzed. These are all symptoms of lack of confidence.\nWe created this life coaching program because we have seen so many life coaches try to help their clients boost their self confidence by unintentionally giving terrible advice. Life coaches try to boost their clients’ self-esteem so they feel better about themselves. They encourage them to focus on their abilities and affirm that everything will turn out great. However, that is not what creates true confidence. Unfortunately, all this does is make the client feel good in the moment, but it doesn’t develop true confidence.\nYou see, having to feel good about yourself discourages you from stepping out of your comfort zone which holds you back from developing true confidence. Needing to feel confident in your abilities makes you avoid trying anything you might be bad at.\nIn this life coaching certification we’re not going give you some secret formula or quick fix for giving your clients an ego boost, because that is not what confidence is.  We’re going to deep dive into the most up-to-date leading edge research into the psychology of success and what creates genuine, long-term, unshakable confidence.\nThis life coach certification program will help you understand the limiting beliefs and behaviors that lead to self-doubt and low-self confidence. As a life coach it will give you a blueprint of proven processes for creating a Confidence Life Coaching Plan that meets each client’s unique needs, whether they’re trying to feel more empowered, overcome procrastination, make a big life change, express themselves better, overcome fear, or improve their competency in any skill.\nYou’ll help your life coaching clients to:\nDevelop the #1 core underlying belief that unlocks genuine confidence—the growth mindset\nStop self-sabotage and procrastination by overcoming the 4 traps of self-doubt to create true confidence\nStop feeling socially anxious and dependent on the positive judgment of others in order to feel good about themselves so that they can develop true confidence\nFeel deeply confident even in the face of rejection and criticism\nThe confidence to feel good about themselves in a way that doesn’t get knocked down by failure or judgment\nThe confidence to stop being crushed by failure and shrinking back from risk\nThe confidence to actually reach the goals they set for themselves\nThe confidence to turn challenges and setbacks into the fuel they need to ignite their life\nThe confidence to stop holding themselves back due to fear and develop such a strong belief in their potential that they feel unstoppable\nHaving a structured life coaching confidence coaching program to follow will give you the tools you need coach your clients to success, but even more importantly, you’ll develop TRUE confidence as a life coach by applying what you learn in this course to your own life. You’ll find that having a solid plan is fantastic, but knowing that you can trust yourself to be flexible, learn, and adjust as different needs and desires arise during the coaching process is the TRUE confidence that both you and your life coaching client are looking for.\nIf you are ready to transform your confidence and the confidence of your life coaching clients then register today!\nWe look forward to seen you in this course.\n\n\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.\nSo, who are we?\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera, life coaches, serial entrepreneurs, authors, speakers, and educators.

We’ve learned to use failure as a catalyst and no longer fear risk.

The information in this course is all based on Scientific research.\n\n\nWHY GOAL SETTING IS IMPORTANT\n\n\nYour goals are the foundation of everything you do in your personal and professional life. Everything you do is based on your goals. So setting the right goals and focusing on the right goals for you is monumentally important.\nImagine looking back at your life and realizing that you pursued wrong goals or mis-goals. It would be a mis-life.\nDon't let that happen to you. Sign up for this course, understand the ideas behind goal setting, learn to identify your correct goals, and get on your way to achieving them.\n\n\nCONTEXT: SMART GOALS VS. ABC GOALS VS. GENERAL GOAL SETTING\n\n\nIn the world of goal setting, you may hear about different strategies like SMART goals, ABC goals, and other techniques. There are a few themes in goal setting that unite these concepts. They are very related.\nSMART goals is just an acronym. It stands for:\nS - Specific\nM - Measurable\nA - Actionable\nR - Relevant\nT - Time bound\n\n\nUNLOCK TRUE FULFILLMENT AND MOTIVATION\n\n\nIf you can't seem to get motivated to do your work or don't feel fulfilled by it, the reason is likely that you had not done proper goal setting before, and are on a path to achieve mediocre goals.\nWith proper goal setting, you increase your chances to find the true goals that are most important for your life, and get all your motivation and fulfillment from working towards those goals.\nCreate personal development plans and personal work goals to have a clear vision towards which to strive.\n\n\nMANAGING DIFFERENT KINDS OF GOALS\n\n\nGoal setting is a big concept. Within goal setting there are smaller categories like professional development goals, personal development goals, self development goals, personal work goals, and personal growth goals. The course will show you how to achieve work-life-balance and a feeling of fulfillment by balancing all those goals.\n\n\nINSTRUCTOR EXPERIENCE\n\n\nI've been an entrepreneur for 20+ years, have coached 1,000+ entrepreneurs, taught 850,000+ students, impacted millions of entrepreneurs worldwide creating 6 and 7-figure businesses in the process, and I would love to help you.\nI've helped hundreds of coaching clients specifically with goal setting to make sure they identify the right goals and get on a path to achieving what's truly important for them, and I'd love to help you with goal setting too.\n\n\nWORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT: RESPONSIVE AND CARING INSTRUCTOR\n\n\nIf you have questions, know that I am here to help! I answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours. Many students tell me that other instructors don't respond. Well, I do because:\n1) I care about my students.\n2) I feel a responsibility to make sure that students get their money's worth from the course.\n\n\nMONEY-BACK GUARANTEE\n\n\nThe goal setting course comes with an unconditional, Udemy-backed, 30-day money-back guarantee.

James clearly presents the development of the Feng Shui BaGua and explains the intricacies of this fundamental tool in very easy to understand language.\nJames teaches us how the BaGua came into being (approximately 5,000 years ago), why it is so important, especially if you are a Feng Shui Practitioner, and how it is used in modern Feng Shui.\nFrom the concept of the polarity of Yin and Yang, through the development of the Eight Trigrams and the Five Elements, James weaves a thoroughly engaging and insightful presentation.\nShort videos filled with rich content allow you to dive into this class at your own pace, ten minutes each evening after the kids are in bed, or perhaps on your lunch break for some inspiration!\nWhile this class may be for anyone with a basic understanding of Feng Shui, it was created for Feng Shui Practitioners eager to continue their education and review the origins of the ancient practice.

      "description": "Have you ever suspected that there was a Higher Intelligence whose presence you could feel but that you could never seem to contact?\nMany people throughout history have alluded to such an all-pervading Intelligence.\nA century before the birth of Christ, the Roman scholar Cicero said, “No man was ever great without divine inspiration.”\nGeorge Washington, the first President of the United States, said, “Providence has at all times been my only dependence, for all other resources seem to have failed us.”\nThe twentieth-century author, Wayne Dyer, wrote, “This spiritual essence is our Source, which is magnificent and stupendous compared to our earthly self. When we’re inspired we are connected to this force that is greater in every respect than our physical being.”\nBut nobody – not Cicero, not George Washington, not Wayne Dyer, nor any of the countless others who had claimed this guidance from a higher power – could teach us how to connect with that High Intelligence and obtain It’s guidance for ourselves.\nNot until José Silva developed the UltraMind ESP System.\nImagine coming into direct, working contact with that all-pervading Higher Intelligence that could guide you to make the correct decisions in your life.\nWhat if a simple, reliable, and repeatable process could put you in touch with a Guide who actually knows what lies ahead, who can guide you to success, happiness, and fulfillment, and help you to avoid life's pitfalls?\nThat is exactly what over six million of José Silva’s graduates, from all over the world are able to do right now, today! And that is what you are going to learn to do in this streamlined version of the Silva UltraMind ESP course.\nIn this course you will learn to\nEnter the most powerful part of your mind whenever you wish. This is the part of the mind that is most effective for turning your thoughts into your reality.\nCreate a communication channel between your conscious mind and the nearly unlimited power of your subconscious mind.\nRecognize and learn from the sometimes mysterious messages that come from your subconscious mind.\nAsk for guidance from your Higher Intelligence in a way that it has to respond to.\nSo what are you waiting for? Click the Enroll Now button and start creating your life by design instead of by default.\nDo it now, while it’s still fresh in your mind!",

      "description": "Scrying is a form of Divination typically using crystal balls, reflections of water, oil, wax and mirrors. Through patterns and shapes, symbols, letters and numbers - meaning can be interpreted from what is seen and sensed. The idea of seeing into a mirror or crystal ball is commonly found in fairytales and movies and originates from ancestral practices going back to Ancient Greece, Egypt, Asia and the Bible.\nIn this course you will be able to learn about how these methods came about and how they work. I will be taking you 'on location' to sacred sites in the UK to giant Megalith standing stones in Avebury, the West Kennet ancient sound chamber and the famous Glastonbury Well.\nI will be guiding you through creating your own Scrying Chamber in the Astral Realm where you can build a relationship with your Scrying Guides. And I will be teaching you about keeping a Scrying Journal. With practice and all that you have learnt in this course you will be able to Scry for yourself, your family friends and clients.\nI will introduce two main types of Scrying. The direct method of seeing and interpreting patterns based on preconceived ideas I call the 'Match and Hatch' method and a second type I call \"Go and Flow' which uses your deeper intuition and psychic abilities along with your Scrying guides to provide impressions, messages and prophecies.\nThis is a complete course expiring a variety of Scrying techniques which will give you some fabulous tools for your esoteric, magical toolbox!",

Angela is a great coach! Kinda feels like I'm sitting in the room with her as she guides me with EFT in trying to rid myself of unproductive behavior and thought processes. I'm really looking forward to practicing what she has taught and recommend learning with this tutor, as she is so authentic and explains everything very thoroughly with examples.

I thank God for finding your course.” Marcon T\n“This course helps one to understand the core reasons that we experience anger through self discovery through traits of our behaviors.

Living in this world in human form is challenging enough, so establishing a connection and gaining assistance from beyond this realm is especially helpful when life gets difficult. Finally, we will close with a ceremonial healing ritual called the 5 Basic Elemental Prayer. That’s what Shamanism and this course is all about! Upon completion of the course, the student will receive a Personalized Certificate, and have a working knowledge of journeying into Shamanic Energy Medicine.",

Early in my career, I was working with high-paying lawyers who wanted to quit smoking. Can you imagine their reaction if I asked them to “float above a timeline” or “walk down a staircase going deeper”?\n\n\nExactly. I would have been a joke.\n\n\nSo instead, I was forced to create a strange yet insanely powerful process that allowed me to hypnotize and heal sceptical clients—without them ever realising it was happening.\n\n\nThe Secret About Resistant Clients\n\n\nHere’s what most hypnotists miss:\n\n\nThe moment resistant clients know you’re starting hypnosis, their walls go up a thousand-fold.\nNo suggestibility test, history lesson, or pre-talk can break that down.\n\n\nSo what do you do?\n\n\nYou use their resistance against them.\n\n\nThat’s right. Resistance becomes the very fuel for creating mind-bending trances in minutes—where even if they try to resist, they get pulled into a deep healing experience.\n\n\nIntroducing: The Emotional Trance Method\n\n\nIn this 2-hour advanced masterclass, I’ll walk you step by step through my personal go-to strategy for resistant clients:\n\n\nThe Emotional Trance Method—my #1 system for sceptical clients\nHow to trigger rapid trances without them even noticing\nWhy resistance is your best ally (and how to use it)\nReal-world examples of turning resistance into breakthroughs\n\n\nWe won’t waste time on fluff—you’ll be diving straight into the deep end.\n\n\nPro tip: To fully master this process, I recommend pairing this with my Complete Conversational Hypnosis Program (also on Udemy). This training will give you the tools, and the program will help you sharpen them to mastery.\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\nIf you want to hypnotize, heal, and wow even the most sceptical clients—while making them wonder “what just happened?”—this training will change the way you practice hypnosis forever.\n\n\nSee you inside the program.\n\n\n– Scott Jansen\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: You acknowledge and agree that: We are not accredited by any governing body, nor are we a registered training organisation and any outcome of taking part in an Online Course will not be considered a qualification, including any certification we provide to you; our Online Courses are available for purchase worldwide; however, we do not warrant or represent that the Content will comply with laws in the country you live and/or operate your business; we do not guarantee any particular outcome or benefit as a result of participating in the Online Course; and it is your responsibility to comply with all laws applicable to you, and you are solely responsible for the outcomes resulting from any implementation of the Content or learnings from the Online Course, when dealing with your patients.",

Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is NOT another lame goal-setting program. It provides a proven blueprint for achieving your goals—the one we use for ourselves and our clients.\n\nAre you ready to break through and make this your best year yet?\nEven if it's not the beginning of the \"new year\" you can ALWAYS set new goals!\n\n\nAre you feeling motivated and inspired?\nDo you feel like you’ll really make the change this time?\nDon’t fool yourself.\nEven when there is a big push to make RESOLUTIONS during the \"new year\" transition, setting goals (and keeping them) isn't that simple! This is because the tick from one calendar year to the next takes place on an ordinary day. The excitement of the new year is NOT enough to propel you to your goals.\nWe’ve worked with 10's of thousands of people and we’ve seen that year after year they get excited and make commitments, yet only a small percentage follow through and reach their goals.\nIn fact, studies show that only 50% of people make \"new year\" resolutions, and of those only 8% succeed.\nBut with that said, we’ve worked with enough people to know that you absolutely CAN make this your best year yet! You CAN change. You CAN achieve your goals!\n8% may sound small, but YOUR odds could be much, much greater.\nWhat if you could learn what that 8% who succeed did DIFFERENTLY and then do THAT?\nThat’s what we did. Over years of studying human potential and psychology, coaching and teaching others, and running our own businesses—we’ve learned the 9 reasons why new year’s resolutions fail and what those who succeed do differently.\nReflecting back over the past year we see that we’ve met or exceeded all of our goals. We surpassed our revenue goals, we moved to the beach, we’ve traveled and explored, we’ve improved our health, and we’ve successfully converted most of our life coach training programs into digital courses.\nOur clients, family and friends often ask us “how do you do it—what’s your secret?”\nAnd our secret isn’t what you’d think…\nWe’re not workaholics, in fact we take more time off and spend more time at the beach than ever before.\nWe’re not smarter or more talented.\nWe didn’t start out with more resources (in fact, our company began while we were both unemployed and living in an extended stay motel).\nAnd no, we don’t have a magic wand.\nOur secret—that we’ve used to life coach ourselves and our clients, is that we:\nSet specific, actionable, inspirational goals\nWrite a strategic, detailed plan\nCheck-in and reprioritize monthly and weekly\nWe know exactly what steps to take right now\nWe learn from obstacles and remain flexible when opportunities arise\nContinue to empower and inspire ourselves through continually learning\nWhat if instead of making another new years resolution that you doubt before you even get started, you made a SOLID, actionable plan based on inspiring goals?

Details for how to request the official certification and optional 15 CPD/CEU credits will be provided at the end of the course.\n\n\nWe are top Udemy instructors in the personal development category. Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\n\n\nIf you are a current or aspiring life coach and you want to help your clients develop more peace of mind, mindfulness, manage their thoughts and emotions, and lead happier, healthier, more awakened lives, than this Mindfulness Certification is for you!\nStudies have shown that people spend almost 50% of their daily life on autopilot, meaning that your clients are probably missing out on their life because they’re lost in thought, worry, or stress.\nBut the good news is that YOU can offer them one simple thing that will not only help extend their life but will help them actually experience more OF their life.\nThe solution is MINDFULNESS!\nMindfulness has helped transform our lives and the lives of our clients. Regardless of the niche of coaching that you focus on, mindfulness is an essential skill to add to your practice.\nYou see, about 50% of our daily habits are unconscious repetitive actions. Let's face it, it is hard to create change in our client when they are stuck on autopilot, living in the past or sabotaging themselves with negative self-talk and overwhelming thoughts and emotions.\nIn order for ANY client to effectively create lasting change and happiness, they need to learn how to take back control of their mind, emotions and decisions through mindfulness.\nAnd, the ONLY time they can do this is when they are aware in the present moment and able to clearly observe their thoughts and emotions.\n*There is a reason almost all extremely successful people and professional athletes use mindfulness and meditation techniques!*\nMindfulness and meditation are the key that unlocks self-awareness, focus, concentration, emotional self-control, clarity of thought, and the ability to make transformational change. No one can be effective if they're trapped in their monkey mind, which is constantly distracting them from their dreams and causing stress and anxiety.\nThe greatest gift you can give your clients is the gift of being more aware, awake, and alive in their daily life!\nNot only does helping your clients develop mindfulness (including meditation) transform their lives, it's also a great tool to use as a coach, such as bring both you and your clients' full awareness into the present moment at the start of your coaching session.\nIn this course we’re giving you all the mindfulness tools and strategies we use so your can get your clients these same results.\nThis course is a complete life coach training program that gives you a blueprint for helping your clients develop mindfulness and meditation practices in everyday life.\nIt includes a 21 Day Mindfulness Challenge that contains over 50 mindfulness exercises and meditations.\nAs a Certified Mindfulness Life Coach you’ll be able to help your clients:\n·        Master their monkey mind\n·        Reduce stress and burnout\n·        Manage negative emotions\n·        Enjoy their life more\nYour clients will learn how to:\n·        Be the observer of their thoughts and emotions\n·        Stop getting caught up in a runaway mind\n·        Stop being overwhelmed by their emotions\n·        Develop self-compassion and take back control of what and who they allow to influence them, as well as practice being more present with others.\nPlus, they’ll experience all of the benefits of mindfulness. Nearly all people who are extremely successful, as well as most professional athletes, use mindfulness because study after study have shown that mindfulness increases mental clarity, reduces stress, and has powerful health benefits, including improving sleep, increased energy, and an improved immune system!\nAs a life coach or an aspiring life coach this course will provide:\n· A proven life coaching blueprint to help your life coaching clients develop Mindfulness tools.\n· A life coaching program that you can implement as a stand alone niche life coaching service or life coaching tools and skills that you can add and incorporate to any life coaching niche.\n· Transformational research based mindfulness  techniques that can be used in your life coaching practice\n· Essential psychological and emotional life coaching tools that will better help your personal and professional life.\n· Access to a private life coaching network community with over 7,000 active life coaches from all over the world. This group is made up of life coaches that have either completed or are completing one of our life coach certification programs. This support group of life coaches is invaluable as you have a range of life coaches with past experience that share their experience and provide feedback and insights.\n· Made for you handouts, exercises, and activities that you can give to your life coaching clients.\n· Access to our Transformation Life Coaching Magazine\n· Free listing in Transformation Life Coaching Directory\n· Official Life Coaching Certification from Transformation Academy\nSo, who are we?\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera, serial entrepreneurs, authors, speakers, and educators.

You cannot move forward if you carry any resentment or fear of failure from the year before.  Your intentions must be clear, your focus sharp and your motivation high.\nThis course will help you gain clarity, focus and take action.\nTap out the prior year’s fears and failures. EFT teaches how to let go of what you don’t want and tap in what you do want. What if you could get clear on what you want? What if you created one goal, or perhaps more than one, for the new year.  90% don’t keep their new year’s resolutions.\nWhat if you tapped every day for clarity?\nWhat if you tapped every day to get one foot out of bed 10 minutes early?\nWhat if you tapped every night for a good night’s sleep?\nI will help you choose manageable goals and keep them.  I made a commitment to myself last year to exercise. I now work with a personal trainer 2 days a week and do cardio another 2 days a week.  I am accountable to myself and friends with whom I have chosen to share my goals.  I have other goals that I share with others who keep me accountable.\nSuccess with EFT every day.\nEnroll today and change your life!",

      "description": "The Complete Life Coaching Master Class\nAre you having a difficult time creating a sense of purpose and urgency for your coaching clients to sign up for or continue with you and your coaching? How much different would your coaching practice be if your clients couldn’t wait to get to their next coaching session and use it right away in their lives?\nIt’s time to stop wondering if your clients trust you and if they want to start or keep coaching with you. In The Complete Life Coaching Master Class, I will show you, step-by-step, just how to train to be a life coach and start your own highly profitable life coaching business. Whether you’re a seasoned, experience coach, or just getting started building your coaching clientele, you’ll learn how to make your clients feel excited and motivated to move forward and create a long-term coaching partnership with you and your coaching practice.\nWhat Is The Complete Life Coaching Master Class?\nThe Complete Life Coaching Master Class is a Life Coach Training Program that is specifically designed to help coaches better their coaching practice and GET MORE CLIENTS...and then KEEP THEM. A coach that goes through this program is more like a Coach-sultant. It’s coaching + consulting all wrapped up into one.\nWhy THIS Coaching Program?\nThere are three key reasons why our Coaching is different:\nYou’ll learn WHY our method works. Jason Teteak spent the last 10 years writing this coaching program from scratch as he started and built his own coaching program. He is not just going to tell you how to do it or what to do. He will ALSO show you WHY it works so you can learn to “fish” as you coach on your own.\nYou’ll learn in YOUR unique communication style. We all communicate differently. That’s why every lesson is taught with four unique selling styles (Fascinator, Performer, Inspirer, and Energizer). This content is taught for top coaches who are want to be authentic and genuine when they coach.\nYou’ll be able to APPLY practical techniques right away. This training actually makes sense. World-renowned trainer and professional life coach, Jason Teteak, is able to decode the magic that happens when top coaches meet with clients. He then bottles up the secret sauce and presents it to you so you can easily understand how to use the best techniques—in your own style and in any situation.\nHow Is The Complete Life Coaching Master Class Different?\nThis program is going to transform how you do your coaching. You’ll learn new techniques for attracting new clients; how to obtain high-quality referrals; and how to ask the questions that make you a better coach, period. And, above all, this will make your clients more happy and successful, and it will make you more money. This course is going to pay for itself in no time and is exactly what you need to grow your coaching practice.\nThe reason I am so excited to have you dive in on some of this is that through the process of being taught how to do this, you will find new pieces of gold that are within you that you didn’t even know were there. And these discoveries will help you become a better coach. I’m going to prove it in this program with real case studies that will give you some amazing ideas for your own coaching practice.\nTestimonials from Other Participants of the Program:\nThe techniques in this program will help you get over the coaching hump to seal the coaching deal. It is exciting to see what you will uncover. And, instead of me telling you why this The Complete Life Coaching Master Class program is different, I thought I would share with you what some of our actual coaches that have taken this program had to say:\n“I don’t just want to be another accountability coach – maybe a little – but it’s not worth it. In this program I learned how to help my clients craft personal life plans that impact their life and their business, and it’s allowed me to help them LIVE OUT their life vision and mission, and that’s been a way better coaching process than I had before.” -Christy (Executive Coach)\n“There are two reasons I’m considering coaching: (1) Successful people have coaches. (2) Helping people feel good about things they’ve achieved. Clients should feel good about their life and their business and I should feel good helping them get there – yeah I’ve got coaching skills and my clients (and future clients) have skills – if we don’t work on myself, it isn’t going anywhere. If they don’t work on themselves, the same is true for them. Coaching will change my life drastically – change my personal relationships with my spouse, my family, the balance of me being a parent and a spouse. The whole reason I’m here is my values, personal relationship, new experiences, professional development, personal development, autonomy, and play…and this program has helped me and my clients get there.” – Josh (Life Coach).\nWhat Will You Get with Life Coaching Master Class?\nAfter interviewing dozens of coaches, I discovered the top eighteen things coaches worry about with their coaching and their clients. Ask yourself, have you ever had any of the following concerns?\n“I won’t be relevant.”\n“This person doesn’t want to coach with me.”\n“I have to build a relationship with this person.”\n“I have to sell something to this person.”\n“I don’t know how to find clients that I can work with.”\n“I’m lying when I coach people about making their lives better.”\n“I have to say all the right things to this person.”\n“I don’t know how to meet with this person.”\n“These people don’t want what I have to offer.”\n“I have to know all the answers.”\n“I don’t have my own self in order, so I can’t help others.”\n“I’m not organized enough to do this.”\n“These people are going to ask too many questions.”\n“I have to prove my worth to this person.”\n“I don’t know the coaching industry.”\n“When I get paid, I’m taking things from the client.”\n“I have to have a friendly relationship with this person before they’ll work with me.”\n“Being genuine will cause me to repel people.”\nWe’ll address how to handle each of these eighteen concerns and more in this program. You’ll learn how to build relationships, communicate effectively, and ask the right questions during the coaching to get your clients excited to work with you (and keep working with you).\nMost gurus just say, “Here’s the gold dust,” but many coaches don’t know what to do with the “treasure,” or it simply doesn’t work. The point is that the gurus often don’t give the precursors as to why it works.\nConversely, in this program, we will break down each and every technique to make it simple for you to understand. We will tell you why it works so that you can apply your knowledge to new situations day after day. In each circumstance, you will know how to attract and coach new clients and uncover people’s mission, vision, principles and solutions that are both already inside them and help them with solutions they never knew existed.\nYou’re going to find in this program that we have broken down coaching into bite-sized pieces that are easily ingestible and applicable for you with your clients. You’re also going to find that some clients will ask you to go down a path in a certain coaching session that maybe you didn’t prepare to go down.\nDon’t worry…we will show you how to handle that too. You will not only get a complete step-by-step “red letter” language recipe, but you will also get all of the tools and techniques you will need to pivot immediately and help meet clients where they are at, and address any concerns they have in the moment they are there, with specific templates to address each of the goals and objectives clients typically need coaching in.\nThis program will help you with twenty-two key areas of your coaching practice:\nYou will learn how to start coaching right away.\nYou will be more relevant in the coaching sessions.\nClients will want to talk to you.\nYou will be more attractive and genuine to people in your coaching calls.\nClients will view you as being their partner.\nYou will build better relationships with prospects and clients.\nYou’ll look forward to meeting with every client.\nMore clients will introduce you to new prospects than ever before.\nClients will want to be friends with you.\nYour prospects will give you the right data in the introductory, exploratory call.\nPeople will want what you have to offer.\nYou don’t have to know all the answers.\nPeople will instantly see how you can make their lives better.\nYou will be more organized and efficient in the coaching sessions.\nPeople will ask you just the right amount of questions.\nYou don’t have to prove your worth to anybody anymore.\nYou’ll get paid for helping people in ways you never dreamed of.\nYou can work with people in a more friendly and profitable way.\nYou will start to work with clients where there wasn’t a client prior.\nClients will send you more thank-you cards.\nYou will attract more high-dollar clients.\nThese techniques will make your life sweeter.\nWhat will you specifically learn in this program? The answer is: everything you need to start and continue coaching into the future – things that can only be learned through trial and error. That’s why, after years of trying, failing, getting back up, and succeeding, I decided to create this program, so that other coaches could learn from my mistakes and failures, and could then apply the successes and have the same amazing future in coaching that I now have.  Enjoy!\n~Jason Teteak",

Do you know which soft skill can open access to any knowledge you want to master? Do you know which soft skill can make you the most valuable person in your society and workplace?\nThis is a learning skill. And this skill is actually undervalued and not taught at school or university, even though, with help of this skill people could learn any subject; they could have any degree or they could master any other skills they want.\nThis course is not about how to achieve success in personal and professional life, although, if you master a learning skill, you can achieve anything you want, because everything starts from learning.\nAfter you develop your learning skill, you can learn how to become a good or exceptional professional; you can learn how to become happy and successful; you can learn how to become a millionaire. I mean, you can become anyone and achieve anything you wish. With this skill, your only limit will be your life-time.\nThe course is quite short regarding time but extensive regarding the aspects it cover therefore it is interesting, informative and practical. It is not only about tips and tricks on how to develop your learning skill. The thing is that actually, any accomplishment in life to 80% consists of psychology and only the rest 20% is about instruments.\nTherefore, we organized the course in the following sequence:\n- The first two parts (part 1 & 2) of the course are dedicated to prepare your inner condition or right mentally. In these parts, we will talk about some misconceptions related to the mind itself; we will talk about the reasons why you should develop your learning skill and how to get yourself motivated to do it.\n- Then, in part 3, we will review the importance of your health or body in the development of your learning skill. You should understand that your body is an executor of your ideas. Healthier you are, more productive your actions will be.\n- Finally, in parts 4 and 5, I will provide practical techniques and tips on improving your learning skill.\nI want to remind you beforehand that most concepts that I give in this course are not novel, but they are principles and techniques used for hundreds of years, and most probably you know about them. Therefore our task will not be creating a wheel but rather it will be learning how to learn in a systematic way.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Come and take your 'key' to all the accomplishments in your life.",

Develop Jedi-like Mental Strength to calm the mind get grounded quickly. (Mind-Body Training)\nWith a strong mind, you can practically TURN OFF FEAR.\nRecent scientific studies show that certain mindfulness exercises help control our fear center of the brain (the amygdala).\nHave you noticed how Buddhists monks are always so calm and carefree? That’s because they have the mental strength to not let anything faze them.\nDispositional Mindfulness Training was developed by an MIT professor after dissecting the science behind many meditation practices. This strengthens the mind and control over your emotions, fear, and limiting thoughts.\nThis type of training is quickly becoming the go-to tool for psychologist and doctors to help patients with anxiety, depression, and other stress related illnesses.\n2. Reset your nervous system and reprogram your mind.\nWe’re tackling fear at the source not just the fear of one specific activity.  We want you to stay grounded no matter what comes your way. Whether it’s a life threatening emergency situation, or you’re approaching the most beautiful girl in the room.\nWe’ll use a few different exercises to reset your mind and nervous system to feel less anxiety overall. One of these exercises takes one minute and feels like you’ve been meditating for one hour. Professional athletes do this regularly.\n3. Systematic Desensitization to conquer fear, one step at a time.\nThis is where we apply your new skills of mind-body control. Systematic desensitization is a type of behavior therapy used in the field of psychology to help effectively overcome phobias and other anxiety disorders. Basically, we’ll help you face your fears, but in baby steps.\nWhen we combine this with the first two techniques, activities that were once fearful, barely feel out of your comfort zone. We’ll expand your comfort zone, one step at a time.\nEverything you need to know has been condensed into this 10 Day Plan",

The intention: To help you live with meaning, truth, and kindness in your own personal way.\n“Each of us carries some wisdom waiting to be discovered at the center of our experience, and everything we meet, if faced and held, reveals a part of that wisdom,” explains Mark. Still, time exposes the story of our lives with its friction, wearing away the film that covers our eyes and the calluses that guard our heart, till we can inhabit the wonder waiting under the skin of everything.\nHow can we meet this process? How can we ready ourselves? Who and what do we listen to along the way? How do we listen to life and not to what life does to us when suffering and loss meet us at every turn? How do we make sense of our experience?\n“My offering here is to explore these challenges and introduce you to your own wisdom and gifts, and through our time together to help you personalize the ways you can nourish the spark of life we each carry inside.”\nFlames That Light the Heart is an invitation to ten video sessions where Mark will explore the passages that open us, as well as the skills and ways of being that help us meet the difficulties that life brings us. Using ancient and contemporary stories, poetry, journaling, and dialogue, Mark will explore what it means to be transformed by what we go through and how to access the skills and inner resources for learning, growing, and healing.\n“Meaning, truth, and kindness are our constant teachers,” Mark explains. “They are flames that light the heart with a burning quality we must endure in order to receive that light.” Join him in this intimate conversation on our shared “growing pains of transformation” and the art of living “as an awakened part in an awakened whole.”",

      "description": "Your Spirit Guides, Teachers and Angels are always there to help with your path of spiritual development.\nThis course offers a way to help you build a lifelong connection, and communicate with your guides. Your Spirit Guides can and should be your friends from now till eternity.\nLearn what Spirit Guides are.\nOpen yourself up to Spirit's Guidance.\nLearn how Spirit Guides Communicate.\nIdentify which guides are communicating with you and how they can help.\nUnderstand tools you have for communication.\nBuild a foundation for a long lasting connection.\nBuild a foundation for Spiritual Growth\nUnderstand that you are never truly alone. Your Spirit Guides are your own personal spiritual helpers, and can aid you in your spiritual growth. You have guides that can aid you on your path to happiness, health, and wisdom. If you but open the door, spirit is there to guide you.\nYou do not have to be a fully developed psychic medium to connect with spirit, your guides are your personal helpers and there whenever you seek them.\nIn this course you will learn the basics of spirit guides and how they can help. We will go in depth about the types of guides and their roles, and how you can begin to build a connection with them.\nSpirit Guides can communicate in many ways, and we will discuss the most common ones in detail. I will show you how you can use breathing and meditation to aid in spirit communication, and common tools used to reach your guides.\nAt the end of the course you will be empowered to build a long lasting connection with your guides, and use their Love and Light to aid your spiritual growth.\nSpirit guides are incorporeal beings that are assigned to us before we are born that help nudge and guide us through life.  They’re responsible for helping us fulfill the spiritual contract we make with ourselves before we incarnate.  Your higher self helps select these guides, who help us while we are living out our incarnation.\nWho are these guides?\nSome guides will stay with you throughout your entire life, and others will pop in every now and again to help you with specific areas of your life or goals you are trying to achieve.  These guides are at varying levels of consciousness themselves.  Some may be highly ascended masters (such as Jesus) and others might be your average spirit who just happens to be a master in a certain area.  They may appear to have a male or female energy, though in reality they are just energy.  They may be spirits who have had physical incarnations, or they might be spirits who have never taken corporeal form.  You may be the only person they are guiding, or they may be on the “panel” for other people as well.  They might be deceased relatives, but that is less likely.  When it’s time for your spirit guides to help you, they tune in to your energy and help direct you to fulfill your earthly mission.\nHow do guides help us?\nSpirit guides can see what’s going on in our lives, and when it’s time for them to actually guide and/or intervene they have several ways they can accomplish this.\nSending signs.  Guides can arrange synchronicities to help alert you to something you need to see or know about.  Pay attention to those when they happen.  Recently the same scene from the movie, The Incredibles, was shown to me 3 times in 3 different ways in a 24 hour period.  I saw it at home while my kids were watching it, at Office Depot (it was playing as a demo on the tv), and someone else mentioned that particular scene to me in conversation.  That’s a sign, folks.  I got the message.\nGut feelings.  Guides can poke you in the gut when you’re experiencing something they want you to pay attention to.  Following your gut feelings is probably a good idea.  Have you ever had this eerie feeling that something terrible was going to happen but you couldn’t quite put your finger on it?  That might be a guide poking you in your gut.\nIntuitive insight.  Guides can send you flashes of intuition which may sound like a voice in your head.  “Slow down!” and then you realize you were almost in a car accident.  Or “He’s cheating on you.”  These are thoughts that appear to come out of nowhere but which contain important information you’ll want to notice.  Many people tune out their intuition, but it’s a valuable source of information.\nSending people into your life.  Your guides sometimes get together with other people’s guides and together they try to create a meeting between their charges.  Perhaps you are thinking about someone from college and whammo blammo see them in the bookstore later that day. Chance encounter?  Probably not.  Perhaps you were thinking about moving and you run into your old realtor friend in the supermarket.  If it feels like a coincidence, consider that it might be more of a set up.\nArranging and nudging.  Guides can also nudge you in the direction they want you to go, or arrange for something to happen to you.  For example, perhaps you’re running late and can’t find your keys.  You’re frustrated because you need to get somewhere on time.  Suddenly, your phone rings and it’s a really important call you would have missed if you had found your keys earlier.  Who do you think actually misplaced your keys?  This is hard for them because you have free will.  They can only arrange so much or nudge so hard.  The more you can pick up on their clues, the better.  Sometimes you just need to surrender to a situation that seems frustrating.",

Defining themselves by the number of likes and followers they get.\nBut then they feel unfulfilled. The hole in their being is not satisfied.\nSooner or later, this leads them to ask:\nWho am I? What am I doing with my life?\nMany believe that in order to find the answer to this question they must travel to the far reaches of India, South America or some other country. To take exotic herbs. Go through strange healing rituals. Spend endless hours in therapy.\nWhile this can be helpful, the truth that people seek is actually inside them. Waiting for them to uncover it. To find your true self you just need to look inside yourself.\nThis level 1 course begins the process to 'unwrap' yourself and move to thru the first step to becoming an authentic person. The first important step is that of self awareness. This involves getting to know yourself and who you are.\nWithin the course you will find clear and helpful lessons that are easy to understand. Your professor, Richard, believes in cutting away the fluff and technical/philosophical aspects so that the course is accessible to everyone.\nYou will find resources at the end of each module which will help you further in The Search For Self.\nEnrol now and let's take a journey to self discovery.\n-------\nRichard Butler is a Udemy Professor, life and business coach and business consultant who is changing the way people see life with his highly acclaimed courses.\nPrevious students have praised is matter of fact, down to earth, no fluff approach to topics within self development.",

      "description": "Hosted and written by Marie Atkinson 'Chopra Center Certified Instructor'\nSo much of our life is subconscious programming. How we think, act, behave, feel, judge and choose, is based on our past; our life experiences.  This is where we find the seat of our limiting beliefs, invisible bars that we’ve put around our creativity, our true potential, our intuition and sense of adventure.\nIn support of this course there is also a YouTube Channel that is focused on a 'Healthy Body, Calm Mind and a Productive Life'   called Love Yourself over 40.   There is a new video posted each week which I hope will be beneficial to you.\n\n\nThis course is about becoming aware of our thoughts, behaviour and choices.  It’s about living in the present moment and not allowing the past to rule our present moment or our destiny.\nThis course is about falling in love with your true potential, believing in a future reality that as yet you can’t touch but you can learn how to feel and experience it as though it’s already evolved.\nThis course is about bringing your creativity and intuition back to life.  The answers are never out there, they are inside us.  Freedom from our limiting beliefs is a breath away.  We just have to stop, become aware and really listen.  To do that, we will need to learn how to meditate effectively.\nSo, what will you get from this course?\nYou will be given the skills and techniques to meditate effectively.\nThis will be an opportunity to find yourself, transcend your limiting beliefs, and find your life’s purpose.\nThrough your meditation practice, you will learn how to reach into your own state of being, rise above your limiting beliefs and then reconnect with your intuition, your passion and become the best version of you.\nYou will learn how to effectively deal with stress and know how to rise above conditioned, habitual thoughts and behaviours, that are not loving to you, many of which have probably been running your life.\nYou will become very aware of your life from a higher state of consciousness.\nAnd when you are aware you become so much better at listening, focusing, learning, noticing the small things, appreciating your environment, and naturally you become more compassionate, more grateful and appreciative.  It’s being in this state that brings more of the same to you.  As the saying goes,\n“You get what you are projecting out into the world, not what you want.”\nEssentially if you put in the work, make the time, you methodically go through each lesson and participate fully in the meditation classes that are in each of the four modules then get ready to experience real changes in your life.\nAnd until I started meditation, I can’t even count the number of times that I attempted and failed to make changes in my life.  I just didn’t know at the time, there was any other way to change other than effort, strain, force, positive thinking and battling forward.\nThis course isn’t about doing any of those things.\nWe’ll be reaching into our subconscious programming and shining the light of awareness onto it.\n\n\n*You will also receive your own personal Primordial Sound Mantra based on the time, place and date of your birth.  Once you have completed the course, message me, and I will send you your Mantra within 24 hours.\nWho is this course for?\nIf you want to grow, transform and be the best version of yourself or if you are searching for direction, searching for more creativity and inspiration, this course can certainly help you to find your path.\nWhen the mind becomes quiet and you experience a portal open into your own true essence, there will be no going back.",

There has to be a plan or roadmap in place.\nThe 12-Month Plan is a course that gives you a step by step method for discovering exactly what it is you want to achieve, and then teaches you how to create and develop your own personal plan to reach your goal.\nFor most of us, a dream goal or big achievement can leave us feeling overwhelmed or with a worry that the task or accomplishment is too big. This course will help you to break even the biggest of goals down into manageable, bite size tasks that are designed to keep you motivated and driving towards your goal.\nWhat this course will teach you?\nThe best way to break down large tasks and goals\nHow to define what you really want vs. what you think you want\nThe reasons why creating a solid plan is more likely to bring success\nTips on how to stay on track with your plan\nStep by step guidance on developing a personal 12-month plan\n\nContents and Overview\nThe course is divided into 4 sections, each concentrating on different elements of creating your personal 12-month plan.\nWe start with an overview of goal setting and an introduction into the strengths of creating a long-term plan to achieve great things.\nThe next section helps you assess whether the goal you think you want is going to fulfill the overall desire or if it is a moving piece for an even bigger dream. Either way, we provide you with a great exercise to draw this information out and will be there to show you how to act on it.\nYou will then be taken step by step through the process of creating your personal 12-month plan. By this stage you will have your end goal identified and you will take simple steps in order to understand the various elements and requirements of being able to achieve your goal.\nYou will learn a number of methods in order to analyze and identify the tasks you will need to tackle on your journey to greatness.\nThe final section has been created to provide much needed insight and advice to help you as your progress through your 12-month plan. As someone who uses this strategy, I am fully aware of some important areas to focus on, and things to be aware of.\nThis way you will not receive any unexpected surprises and will feel fully equipped to manage the challenges as they arise.\nThe end result will be a working 12-month plan that can be used to map out your journey to achieving your desires and systematically taking leaps closer to creating a life that you want.",

      "description": "Did you know that just one dream, well understood, can change a life and a destiny?\nThis course is presented in a very simple, accessible way by Kaya, one of the most important professors & symbol specialist of dream interpretation.\nIt's been prepared to raise awareness in students to learn to discern and understand the importance and impact of our dreams on our behavior, feelings, and ways of thinking.\nKnowing how to interpret dreams creates and accelerates our evolution. In the long term, it gives rise to responsible people who know how to tell the difference between good and evil , right and wrong, positive and negative, and how to make decisions consciously, with profound understanding of their life program and that of others. It creates the possibility to travel in our past (memories), in our present time, and also  opens the door to the probabilities of what we can become. It provides a solid foundation to the understanding that before being physical, everything is metaphysical.\nThis course leads students to better understand the memories that are hidden behind fears, behind limitations. This very advanced Dream Introduction Program called Dreams & Symbols, The Source Code, provides accessible tools and knowledge to students of all ages.\nUnderstanding Symbolic Language gives students the key tool to not being afraid of their nightmares by de-dramatizing and understanding that they represent a hidden percentage of a potential that will eventually create who we are and will become if we do not cleanse it. In this course, students will learn that coincidence does not exist, that there is a reason for everything, that a nightmare is a true key, a source of transcendence that we need to work on achieving in order to free ourselves from it.\nKAYA is a Spiritual Teacher, Author, and International Lecturer and a worldwide specialist on the Interpretation of Dreams, Signs & Symbols in more than 43 countries. His profound spiritual knowledge, expertise in dream, sign & symbol interpretation, his philanthropy, exemplary devotion, and humanitarian aid are a source of inspiration for millions of people worldwide. He is also the Author of the Dictionary, Dreams-Signs-Symbols, The Source Code published by the multinational non-profit organization, UCM Publishing.",

You will be able to fill in the blanks within your own intelligence, and take the necessary steps to become a wiser individual.\nSign up for this unique course, and improve the quality of your life by making yourself more intelligent.\n\n\nBOOST EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n\nMost people think that Emotional Intelligence is a field started in the 1980's by Daniel Goleman. He did put Emotional Intelligence on the map, but he isn't a researcher himself. Before Daniel Goleman, many prominent researchers studied emotions and the intelligence within emotions.\n\n\nUNDERSTAND AND HANDLE COMMON EMOTIONS\n\n\nYou'll learn about many common emotions like fear, anger, and many more. Plus you'll learn many techniques to handle them correctly like anger management techniques to help you deal with negative emotions like anger or fear.\n\n\nLEARN PHILOSOPHY RELEVANT TO EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n\nIn addition to that, philosophers from Aristotle to Jean-Paul Sartre explored elements of Emotional Intelligence. This course gives you a broader view of Emotional Intelligence.\n\n\nADVANCED EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n\nAn advanced way to look at Emotional Intelligence is as a tool to improve your quality of life. That's the perspective I gained from Dr. Robert C Solomon who was a professor of philosophy at the University of Texas, and a world-class expert on\nEmotional Intelligence.\n\n\nIn this course, I share the advanced teachings from Dr. Robert C Solomon, which I regard as the most far-reaching and most in-depth and passionate about Emotional Intelligence.\n\n\nTHE NEUROSCIENCE OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n\nPhilosophers and thinkers of the past didn't have the benefit of research in Neuroscience that we do today. In addition to providing you the philosophical background on Emotional Intelligence, I'll also show you modern Neuroscience that explains what actually goes on in our brain when we feel different emotions.\n\n\nINSTRUCTOR BACKGROUND\n\n\nI've been an entrepreneur for 15+ years, have coached 1,000+ entrepreneurs in person, taught 850,000+ students, impacted millions of entrepreneurs worldwide creating 6 and 7-figure businesses in the process, and I would love to help you.\nMy work has had a positive impact on millions of entrepreneurs, improving lives in every country of the world, creating 6 and 7-figure businesses in the process, and I would love to help you next.\n\n\nBONUSES INCLUDED\n\n\n* Lots of extra freebies, downloadable worksheets, and exercises to make the course more interactive and valuable\n* Be entered to get chosen for my student of the month status and have your business featured\n\n\nRESPONSIVE AND CARING INSTRUCTOR: WORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT\n\n\nI answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours.

      "description": "The SETSA(Self-Empowerment through Self-Awareness)  program encourages Participants to introspect i.e. to take stock of 'where they are’ in their lives, identifying as far as possible how they got there, be it due to past underlying issues, wavering relationships and/or experiences of grief but to also\n-accept and acknowledge how they got there\n-look ahead instead of using the review mirror to the past\n-consider their purpose in life,\n-look at their desired values and beliefs that they now wish to live by define measurable and sustainable goals that they will adhere to take responsibility\n-INVEST IN THEMSELVES by realising that it’s their lives, their time and about their (conscious) choices in order moving forward positively.\nThe program is NOT about providing more information, more knowledge or intellectual stimulation but rather one of searching within to find either one or two aspects that could really help one to take that step towards making a change in ones’ life. It’s an experiential process (and not a \"quick-fix\")\n\nThere's no compulsion and no need to accept or remember all the topics in the material provided. There’s no formal ‘testing'.\nAs facilitators of change we have no interest in testing one’s intelligence, one’s memory, recall or even net worth. The focus is simply on defining and applying per the principle:\n“Learning = Behaviour change”\n\n\nWHY SELF AWARENESS?\nAristotle once said that \"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all Wisdom\".\n\nBeing self-aware is about knowing yourself. That is being aware of every given moment is the essence of being alive, being 'present' in one's own life, and by taking charge rather than being constantly stuck in the past or fearful of the future.\n\nBeing aware of one's feelings, of one’s emotions is the first step to taking charge and 'control' in making conscious decisions as opposed to having life pass you by, living in a daze, being on 'auto pilot' or even reacting blindly.\n\nThe old habits of reacting defensively and retaliating without thinking, without assessing the situation leads to the turmoil and pain.\n\nTo be grateful for another day of opportunity, to make better choices, ultimately leads to a better quality of life\n\n\nWHY SELF EMPOWERMENT?\n\"People who empower themselves don’t see the world as the source of their problems\" (Jayrenan)\n\nAt the core of every being is the deep need to belong, to be accepted and connected with the ability to contribute. When one feels ‘less’ or over-extended, the zest for living fully, slowly diminishes.\n\nThrough the SETSA program we encourage individuals to \"pause\" and take stock of where they are and what they believe they need to do to fulfil their potential, however they define it; to acknowledge where they want to be. In so doing, we encourage individuals to deal with unresolved past issues, emotions (current and past) and current and past relationships, no matter how difficult or painful it may be. Recognise what you truly want for yourself, empower yourself to achieve accordingly.\n\nWe aim to create an understanding of the false notions of freedom and happiness through materiality. We seek to help participants define the foundational pillars for their lives and define ultimately their life’s purpose, all with the intention in assisting to free people from the burdens of the past, to recognise and value their worth and gifts and feel truly empowered to live life their best life, God Willing.\n\n\n..................................................................................\nHere is a list of the topics covered in SETSA\n1. Introduction. What is Self-Empowerment, Self-Awareness?\n2. Knowledge / Wisdom/ Learning\n3. Thoughts/Cognitive Behavior Theory (CBT)\n4. Trust/Confidentiality/Respect/ Contract\n5. Maslows Hierarchy / My Purpose\n6. Joharis Window / My Transparency\n7. Personality and Character\n8. Feelings. Sympathy and Empathy\n9. My Life Now / Personal Timeline\n10. Recap/Review\n11. Time\n12. Prejudice and Labels\n13. Role Models and Legacy\n14. Values and Beliefs\n15. Relationships Parts A and B (Love / Partner)\n16. Heart versus Head\n17. Ego versus Soul\n18. Emotions\n19. Grief (Part A)\n20. Grief (Part B) – Personal Story\n21. Emotional Intelligence\n22. Power\n23. Recap/Review\n24. Communication\n25. Anger (management)\n26. Conflict management\n27. Generation Gap  (and Narcissism)\n28. My “Struggle”\n29. Freedom\n30. Happiness\n31. (a) Self Esteem (b) Self Discipline\n32. Goals and Risks\n33. Wrap up",

        "SETSA program initially stemmed from working with persons with substance abuse issues. From that experience, the program was enhanced to support women and care-givers given their crucial roles and the many challenges they are confronted with. Through numerous additions over the years to accommodate different needs and situations of people, the SETSA program could benefit anyone intent on real life growth rather than acquiring more information. Are you ready to deal with personal challenges? Ready to introspect? Do you want to realise your full potential? SETSA may assist in your journey."

In other words, how to get you to change your behavior. We will be exploring three main phases:\n- Definition (knowing what your specific goals are, your timeline, making a decision);\n- Executing (actually starting to draw boundaries, having the right mindset and supporters, among other things);\n- Resilience (knowing how to properly discharge negative emotions, as well as change your state when you find yourself in a negative one);\nThe course contains multiple techniques related to psychology, behavior change, and other areas, all applied to help you become more assertive, speaking up more and defending yourself when others try to abuse your time.\nBy the end of this course, you will know how to cultivate the necessary habits and behaviors to become more assertive in the long-term, not being derailed by obstacles, and always performing at your best.",

It contains ALL of the content of this course, plus coach training.\n\n\n\nLife truly is what we make of it. The stories we tell can either liberate us or enslave us.\nWe are all natural story-tellers and are constantly telling ourselves and others stories about our lives. But, our life stories are more fiction than fact. We believe they are real, but they’re only loosely based on what actually happened. They are muddied by our interpretations, the people who influenced us, our limited memories, and the meaning we ascribed to each event. Usually, these stories are unconscious; they are deeply ingrained into our psyche through years of repetition. We tell stories about who we are and what happened to us. We tell stories about others, We tell stories about life.\nBut these stories aren’t who we are. Most of them aren’t even true. We continue to tell them out of habit. And continuing to carry them around will perpetuate those stories into our future.\nBut, it doesn’t have to be that way.\nStudies have proven that even subtle tweaks to our story can shift our attitude, improve our self-confidence, and redirect our futures. We may not be able to change the past, but we can change how we see it, the story we tell, and therefore how it affects us and who we become.\nBy changing how see the past, we can better envision a compelling future. When we find the blessings contained within the curses of our past, we tell our story from a new perspective, and are able to see current and future challenges as opportunities.\nThe activities and tools you will use to transform your life are based on a foundation of neuroscience, psychological principles, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Transactional Analysis.\nThis course is designed to walk you through the process of:\nIdentifying your life story and where it came from\nQuestioning the underlying beliefs that form your story and identity\nLook at your story of the events of your life with a new, empowered perspective\nRe-write your life story or life script\nCreate lasting change and live in alignment with the higher truth of who you are\nFeel confident and powerful, stepping forward into a compelling future free of past pain and limitations\n\n\nSo, are you ready to transform your life and rewrite your life story? If so enroll now, we look forward to seeing you in the course!\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.\n\n\nThis course is taught by three experts in the fields of life coaching, personal development, psychology and psychoanalysis.

Some are big and can have life changing consequences, others are small and almost inconsequential.This course is your guide to solving these issues, to becoming a better problem solver, and best of all it only requires your brain!\nSo it does not matter what age you are, nor where you come from or how you see the world. Everyone has the ability to look at a situation and observe what is happening. Once you demystify the complexity of a problem and understand the fundamental issues, you are half way to finding a solution. It is then simply a matter of conuring up a solution, testing it and applying it... right?\nAlmost. you see, there are several key points that you need to address at each of these stages. Certain points, which if ignored can lead you to in-effective and costly solutions. Designed to be as useful as possible this course centers around 5 key steps. Each step broken down into easy to accomplish tasks. Each task addressing the important points.\nSo, if you are a thinker, a planner, a person who see's problems and not solutions, then this course is for you. If you just like to ponder the what-ifs in life, or analyze what others have done, then this course will help you evalutate their solutions!\nProblem solving is about building that confidence to put your idea forwards in a crowded room.\nIt is about achieving that sense of satisfaction when you get to say 'I told you it would work'!\nIt is about looking more professional at your work place and becoming the go-to guy(or gal).\nThis course will show you what you need to consider when coming up with ideas, what you need to think about when evaluating your proposal and how to determine if you have the right solution in the end.\nYou are here because you want to become a better problem solver!\n\nYou are here because you want to learn!\nI am here to help you in this course, so come join me on the inside and let us get started...",

It's also for those who dedicate their lives to helping people transition. We go on a personal adventure to find out why we are afraid of death; how we can find ways to move beyond this; and how to encourage a peaceful, fearless death that is composed of love, appreciation, joy, peace and often laughter. For those working/living as a companion to someone who is facing death there are wonderful tools here on how to do this with love and compassion for them and also for yourself from the beginning through and beyond. We share tools and techniques that have been proven power gifts and helpers at this powerful time of transition.\nYou are not the body, it is simply a vehicle to allow us to journey in this life. We all know that the body drops when we die. Then why is it so painful, so traumatic? We journey into this and explore ways to find a gentle death for all involved. It can be an amazing, perhaps the most amazing experience of our lives.\nWe offer tools, techniques and ideas, some of which  come from experts that have worked with the dying around the world and some which come form our experiences supporting the dying. Join us on this powerful and tranformational journey.",

After all, how can you really know what you’re getting? And even if they are stylish themselves, how do you know that they can dress you? Well, I am here to tell you, Dr. Akbari is The Real Deal. This woman has a simply unbelievable eye and fashion sense. She has an amazing eye for detail, encompassing numerous things that are invisible or insignificant to me, but which other people (especially women) most definitely notice. As an example, the weekend after working with her, 4 different women (strangers) complimented me on the shirts I was wearing. Fair to say, that never happened to me before in my life. Forget the others. This woman is worth your time and money. A unique find.\n-- Michael, Business Executive\nWorking with Anna transformed every aspect of my life, including my desirability to women. Because of her, I threw out most of my clothes and refined my wardrobe into an easy, sophisticated style; I mentally rebalanced and reprioritized my life; and I learned about dozens of resources that I'm now using to optimize the way I live and work. As a result, I've never looked or felt better. Anna is an invaluable resource -- and she actually makes self-improvement fun (which I didn't know was possible!)\n-- Jonathan, Lawyer\nBefore my experience with Success With Style, I knew neither where to shop nor what to shop for. The truth is, even if I did, I wouldn’t have done a particularly good job putting it all together. Or purging my closet of the unflattering clutter I called clothes. Success With Style was far more helpful than I imagined. In the end, the experience made for a dramatic improvement in my life – easier to get myself dressed well, a less cluttered closet, less money wasted on bad clothing choices, and a long-term improvement in my style and public appearance. I’ve referred multiple friends for this life upgrade and I’ve heard (and seen) nothing but fantastic results.\n-- Oliver, Entrepreneur\nI loved Success With Style! I didn’t realize what shopping really meant until I met Anna. As a guy, I’ll pick up an item or two in a store, try it, buy it (or not) and then call it a day. With Anna’s system, I came out the door with a dozen items — all perfect. But that wasn’t even the best part: Chucking all my unused closet dust gatherers — now THAT was cathartic! I haven’t missed a single piece of clothing that Anna forced me to throw away. (I thought I would, but I didn’t.) And now I’m left with half as many items that I use twice as much -- and get more compliments than ever before. Thanks, Anna!!\n-- Malte, Entrepreneur\nAS SEEN IN...\nThe World's First Online Proven Style Formula Step-by-Step\nLearn 15 years of style secrets from the research of Sociologist and Founder of Sociology of Style, Dr. Anna Akbari\nFrom the Comfort of Your Own Home\nMove through the simple, easy-to- follow process at your own pace.\nTake Control of Your Future\nLearn to take your image into your own hands and present your best self for that next interview, social setting, or first date.\nBoost Your Confidence\nHave full confidence that your identity is working for you and tackle the world with confidence.\nPersonalized Expert Feedback and Peer Connections\nEnjoy 3 months of free access to the private Success With Style System forum, where you'll have direct access to Dr. Anna Akbari, founder of Sociology of Style, for all your questions and concerns.\nRisk Free: 5-Day Money Back Guarantee\nWith our 5-day no-questions-asked money back guarantee you can begin this transformational journey with us at no risk to you\nHere's what we'll cover in this video course:\nLesson 1: Introduction -- We'll go through everything that's covered in the course, so you'll know exactly what to expect.\nLesson 2: Rethinking the Transformational Power of Fashion -- You’ll better understand why image matters and learn how to assess your own self-presentation so you can start building the right aesthetic foundation that will help you achieve your personal and professional goals.\nLesson 3: The Power of Uniforms -- You’ll learn to identify the makings of the right everyday uniform for you, creating a consistently sharp, distinctive style, while also minimizing fuss and unnecessary mistakes.\nLesson 4: Closet Catharsis -- In lesson 4 it's time to purge.

Success leaves clues and these strategies will give you the results you want and deserve, no matter who you are and what you want to achieve. But enough talking, GET this course now ;)\" - Edmund Piunow\n\n\"The course provides easy and practical tools to apply in a daily basis to become more productive and achieve my goals. Thanks!\" - Arturo Lloyd\n\nWhat you will find inside this course:\n\nWould you like to learn how to set and achieve exciting goals? Do you want to become more confident, boost your self-esteem, and get more things done? What about the ability to notice the positive side of things?\nFinally, would you like to learn how to climb your personal Everest?\nWelcome to this course on strategies for success.\nIt may sound a bit counter-intuitive, but the truth is that success is predictable. You become your habits. How you think, what you do on every day basis and people you surround yourself with have a huge impact on your level of success.\nMany people look at the ones who made it and say: “that businessman was lucky, that model has good genetics, that investor is from a rich family”. The reality is that they are simply making excuses. Instead of working hard on their goals, they work harder on finding the reasons why they can’t be successful.\nHowever, there are certain things successful people do on a daily basis that most people are simply not willing to do OR they have no idea that they should do them. Your life is ending one minute at a time and there is no point in reinventing the wheel. In this course, you will learn proven strategies used by top performers and I will show you how you can implement them to climb your, personal Everest.\n\nI’m excited to have you on board and let our journey begin.\n\n- Jimmy",

      "description": "A Quick Story\nA man once approached me after I had given a talk in a beautiful venue in the Middle East.\n“Andy”, he asked, “Is it possible for me to read someone’s thoughts?”\n“Do you have someone in mind?” I replied. The man looked down. “Someone close to me” he offered (I reckon it was probably his wife).\n“Jack (I read his name badge), I have a method that works nearly every time I use it to find out what someone is thinking…” Jack looked up, raised eyebrows, expectant. I paused and said slowly…\n“I ask them, Jack, I ask them!” Jack opened and closed his mouth, frowned then slowly looked up as a grin formed on his face. He nodded and walked away…\nSOMETIMES THINGS ARE A LITTLE EASIER THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE!\nAndy Edwards is an international speaker and widely published author, who's been teaching relationship and ‘soft’ skills to companies and individuals for over 25 years. He's taught all over the world, as well as online, and has an entertaining and practical teaching style. This course is guaranteed to keep you engaged, motivated, fascinated – and even (at times) amused. The Yoo course aims to teach you life changing skills to transform your approach to three key areas of your life.\nAnd, like Jack discovered in the story above, it’s simpler AND MORE PRACTICAL than you might think!\nThe Yoo course could help you develop tons of confidence and self-esteem; increase your popularity, find you a soul mate, get a new job – make you happier! Bold claims indeed… however, any and all are entirely feasible with the right awareness and approach.\nAndy’s story of developing the Yoo approach\nBack in 1990 Andy himself was in a bit of a mess. Unemployed for two years, no real friends a failing marriage, his family homeless at one point; he didn’t think things could get any worse.\nThen, on November 6th 1991, things got MUCH worse.\nA personal tragedy (every parent’s worst nightmare), showed Andy what it was like to be at the very bottom of life’s barrel. He takes over the story:\n“Well, over the following few years, I grieved, reflected a lot. I read a lot. I learned a lot… Even went on a couple of ‘personal development’ courses. I now completely understand (from a psychological perspective) exactly what I was going through… but not at the time! Unsurprisingly my marriage finally failed. It dawned on me that I needed to effectively reinvent myself.\nAnd, in doing so, I started experimenting in what I could do to make a difference in my life… I initially thought it was about money. However I was wrong. After exactly a year of trial and experimentation, I decided to make a specific effort to study and practice just THREE particular areas.\nMore by luck than judgement I believe I got these three things absolutely right.\nIt is those three areas that have made fundamental differences in my life – such that, these days, I can claim to be a very different person.\nPeople still meet me and call me ‘Lucky’ for what I have. But I know better. They didn’t see me back in the early ‘90’s!! Yeah… Luck may play its part – but I tell you, the Yoo approach, for me, has been the ‘Luck Generator’. And it’s simple to learn!”\nThe three areas of study\nAndy’s successful ‘Personal Development’ approach (which he now calls ‘Yoo’) boils down to three interrelated areas:\n1. Self awareness to build esteem and confidence\n2. Understanding others to build and maintain (even repair) relationships\n3. Personal resilience to face (or create) important changes in our lives\nThe Yoo course covers these three areas showing how each is interrelated. You literally can’t address ONE without affecting the other two.\nContents and overview\nAfter an introduction you get an immediate opportunity to ‘Self-select’ your personality type based on descriptions on a set of colour cards. You end up with a ‘Colour Order’ to which you can refer as you learn more about yourself and other people during the course.\nThen it’s time to understand the underpinning psychology starting with Hippocrates – and some pretty gross-out medicinal practices, through to Carl Jung, one of the ‘Fathers’ of modern psychology.\nWe learn that our fundamental, psychological differences are based on just a few preferences and traits. Once we know what these are, we can start to recognise such traits in real life through observing our own and others’ behaviours.\nAll well and good. However, we need to also understand what happens to our behaviour on a BAD day. The answer will surprise you – because Bad day behaviour is directly related to Good day behaviour – and we find out exactly how.\nBear in mind that, throughout the course, there are downloadable exercises and information sheets to help you apply your new-found learning.\nNext up is the four ‘R’s. A simple model to help us understand how a relationship develops… and why it has to happen in a particular order. Here, we also examine whether you want to kill me or have babies with me! This is because we are still subject to primal human reactions – even though, these days, political correctness demands we largely keep these things to ourselves!\nNow is the time to review the colour energies to be able to ‘read’ others. We look at typical Body language, Tone and likely Content of speech. We even have the basic ‘motto’ for each type. From this it’s a short hop to a fascinating model (Created by the author Gary Chapman) called the 5 Love languages. There’s no better insight into your ‘significant other’s’ preferences.\nEmotional intelligence (or EQ) marks our next stop. The basic components of EQ speak of self-awareness and understanding others, so it’s a no brainer as part of the Yoo course. We also explore ‘Psychological Payoffs’ which can often be our unconscious barriers to making the changes we want to make in our lives.\nBy the end of this course\nPeople will be drawn to you – and they won’t know really know why\nYou will have the knack of being able to ‘read’ someone almost instantaneously\nYour Communication with others will improve – misunderstandings drop\nYou will be far more self-accepting and confident in who you are\nYou will find it easier to forgive – or at least understand why people behave in negative ways\nYou may become more tolerant – and yet more assertive\nYou will be able to anticipate how certain people will react to certain situations\nYou might even find out what people say about you when you’re not there!\nAnd that’s just for starters – it all depends on how you apply your learning – and in what context.\nWho this course is for:\nThose who work, play, meet and interact with other people on a daily basis (at work you might be in sales, teaching, management, professional services, a therapist, hospitality, customer services or the caring professions. Or simply a member of a team).\nNot suitable for those wanting an advanced academic qualification in psychology.\nPeople looking for the most accessible, practical and easiest elements of psychology to apply to their daily lives.\nTestimonials for Andy and the Yoo material\nWorking with the Yoo process has been a voyage of discovery, learning more about myself than I ever imagined. Mary (Female late 70’s).\nYou are inspirational to me and what you have passed on. I would like to think I am also a better husband, father, son and friend to those in life through what I have learnt. Richard (Male early 40’s)\nThe course has had quite a profound effect on me, I feel lighter, more free (less burdened) empowered, energised and above all more at peace with myself. Alex (Male mid 20’s)\nFor me personally this has been a game changer. Abbie (Female early 30’s)\nThis stuff really made me think. I can fully understand why so many people find it fascinating and useful. Richard (mid 50’s)\nI would recommend Andy in every capacity – as a speaker, trainer, coach, a mentor, a motivator, an inspiring force… Andy is beyond ‘good’ at what he does. He’s the best. He lives it, practices it… always with incredible results. Mohammed (Male late 30’s)",

      "description": "The Developing Emotional Intelligence Program, includes 5 sections also presented as individual courses for your convenience:\nDefining Emotional Intelligence,\nEmotional Intelligence in the Workplace,\nEmotional Intelligence and Teamwork,\nIncreasing Emotional Intelligence, and\nEmotionally Intelligent Leadership.\n1. Defining Emotional Intelligence\nDeep feelings and emotions act as necessary guides when humans face situations too important to defer to the intellect alone.\nIn all decision-making and action situations, feelings count as much, if not more, than rational thought. In fact, there has been far too much emphasis on rational thought (IQ) in the past when evaluating human behavior and potential.\nIn this course you'll gain an understanding of the emotional intelligence theory, and you'll explore the basis of emotional intelligence by examining the following four areas:\nthe purpose of emotions,\nmanaging emotions,\nthe impact of emotional intelligence,\nwhat it takes to become emotionally literate.\n2. Emotional Intelligence in the Workplace\nCan you measure your intelligence simply by taking an IQ test? Will your SAT scores determine your on-the-job success?\nStudies show that emotional intelligence plays a role that's just as, if not more, important than IQ. By developing your people skills, you'll have a positive effect on your career.\nIn this course, you'll explore:\nwhat emotional intelligence is,\nhow to realistically evaluate yourself,\nwhy it's important to manage your emotions, and\nhow self-motivation affects your career.\n3. Emotional Intelligence and Teamwork\nGroups are common in the workplace. Why do some work groups flourish, while others seem to drag behind? Team members develop a culture which contributes strongly to their success.\nSome groups have an atmosphere of excitement and an ability to adapt. Others resist change and have a negative, growth-inhibiting environment. The ability to handle emotions appropriately and work well with others is known as emotional intelligence.\nThis competency factors into the team's success. Participation and collaboration are key to the success of your team. In this course, you'll explore the importance of these characteristics in accomplishing group goals.\nYou'll also examine:\nthe competencies needed to become an effective team member,\nthe techniques for handling emotions,\nthe ways to evaluate your team's emotional intelligence, and\nthe strategies for improving your team's emotional intelligence.\nStellar teams don't appear out of thin air. They're made up of the right people in the right place. These teams have the support and encouragement they need to succeed.\nTeam members are committed to the success of the group and they work to enhance their abilities to thrive in today's fast-paced business environment. This course will help you contribute effectively to your team's growth.\nIncreasing Emotional Intelligence\nAre the most successful people \"intellectuals\"? Or do they have a different kind of brainpower that helps them excel in the workplace? How can you increase your \"people smarts\"?\nFirst, you'll need a strong understanding of emotional intelligence. Then, you will need to understand how and what you need to improve.\nIn this course, you'll examine:\nhow emotional and intellectual intelligence differ,\nwhy emotional intelligence matters at work,\nwhere emotional intelligence comes from, and\nhow to improve your emotional intelligence.\nIn today's workplace, you need emotional intelligence to get along with others. The \"stars\" around you outshine others because of their ability to use their emotions effectively.\nMost people believe that emotions are automatic responses over which they have no control. Actually, emotions are determined by what you think.\nThere are concrete techniques to help you gain control of your feelings. In this course, you'll gain the skills needed to increase your emotional intelligence.\nEmotionally Intelligent Leadership\nEmotional intelligence is a popular concept. How does it relate to your effectiveness as a leader? This course delves into the importance of emotional intelligence to today's leaders.\nYou'll examine:\nwhy leaders need emotional intelligence,\nhow you can acquire emotional intelligence,\nwhy it's important to develop your staff, and\nhow you can increase others' emotional intelligence.\nThis course will provide you with a step-by-step guide to increasing your effectiveness as a leader. You'll learn proven techniques for improving your relationship with your staff. You will also examine leadership strategies for getting more work done with less stress. (HARVEL-FNNRX)\nThat’s it!

      "description": "'I cannot recommend this course any more highly. I have found few things that are life changing, but this is one of those courses. Thanks so much for putting the information, summaries, teachings, and homework together! It is just plain awesome! ' - Rick.\n'The use of the chalkboard lectures and just having Angela and Tom talk about the ideas and their applications is priceless. Plus, as a bonus, they utilize the 13x4 methodology to applying the book to your life. All in all, a mind-blowing experience. Good job! ' - Laura.\n'This course will shake up and challenge your existing notions of how the world ‘is’ and reveal a wonderful perspective that will have an immediate impact on your life from day one. If you are even a little curious about the Science behind creating wealth (or anything for that matter) you will love this course.' - Sam.\nThis book should really have been called 'The Science of Giving Value'. But then it's not up to me, I didn't write the book. Wallace Wattles wrote it in 1910 and called it 'The Science of Getting Rich'. Possibly when 'Rich' wasn't such a dirty word.\nIn summary, 'Getting Rich' in this book is all about more life to all. Not, more life to you at the expense of others. It's all about delivering value to others.\nIndeed you can paraphrase the whole perspective like this:\nIf you're not currently as wealthy as you'd like, you just haven't worked out a way to give enough value to enough people.\nSo, where did the Science of Getting Rich come from? Wallace D Wattles published the book in 1910 as a culmination of all his studies and experiments in the science-based, monistic approach to life, the universe and everything.\nIt's certainly an unusual book. It is not widely known, yet it has more wisdom and practical advice in its 16 short chapters than everything else I have ever read, combined.\nI have read (or listened to) this book over 1000 times and I keep getting more out of it, every time I read it, I get something new. The gift that keeps on giving.\nSo, why do I like it so much?\nIt advocates an approach that is so different from everything else I've ever read.\nIt's practical.\nIt's simple.\nIt's based on Science.\nIt works.\nOK, so if it's so good, why hasn't anyone heard of it?\nWell, it could be something to do with the writing style being pretty dense and unappealing, which is one of the reasons we've turned it into a course.\nThe other reasons we created this programme:\nWe wanted to show how the science behind the book was a century ahead of its time.\nWe wanted to give you stories that support how well it works for everyone we've used it with.\nWe wanted to give you the TOOLS to make it easier to take action on the principles.\nWe wanted to apply our 13x4 system for Advanced Mind Mastery to the Science of Getting Rich, in the hope that everyone around the world will get truly wealthy, rather than this be just 'a book they read once and thought was quite good.'\n(Read the book and see why we're not just completely out of our minds!!! )\nThat old 'One Thing at a Time' idea again!\nAnyway, have a look here at the preface to the Science of Getting Rich and see if you can get why we needed to modernise it a bit!\n'This book is pragmatical, not philosophical; a practical manual, not a treatise upon theories. It is intended for the men and women whose most pressing need is for money; who wish to get rich first, and philosophize afterward. It is for those who have, so far, found neither the time, the means, nor the opportunity to go deeply into the study of metaphysics, but who want results and who are willing to take the conclusions of science as a basis for action, without going into all the processes by which those conclusions were reached.\nIt is expected that the reader will take the fundamental statements upon faith, just as he would take statements concerning a law of electrical action if they were promulgated by a Marconi or an Edison; and, taking the statements upon faith, that he will prove their truth by acting upon them without fear or hesitation. Every man or woman who does this will certainly get rich; for the science herein applied is an exact science, and failure is impossible. For the benefit, however, of those who wish to investigate philosophical theories and so secure a logical basis for faith, I will here cite certain authorities.\nThe monistic theory of the universe the theory that One is All, and that All is One; That one Substance manifest itself as the seeming many elements of the material world -is of Hindu origin, and has been gradually winning its way into the thought of the western world for two hundred years. It is the foundation of all the Oriental philosophies, and of those of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Schopenhauer, Hegel, and Emerson.\nThe reader who would dig to the philosophical foundations of this is advised to read Hegel and Emerson for himself.\nIn writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy; it has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment; it works. If you wish to know how the conclusions were arrived at, read the writings of the authors mentioned above; and if you wish to reap the fruits of their philosophies in actual practice, read this book and do exactly as it tells you to do.'\nWallace D Wattles, Author of 'The Science of Getting Rich'\nTake this Science of Getting Rich course now and learn how to become rich.",

Salespeople, for example, have known for ages that people buy from people they like.\nAcross more than two hours of video content, we'll explore seven unique principles of attraction. By looking closely at the available evidence, we'll learn more about when and how these principles promote greater liking. Each section covers one principle of attraction, and at the end of each section, I review what we've learned and offer thoughts about applying the information.\nThrough this course, we'll cover…\nhow surprising changes in your posture and gestures can increase rapport and social connection\nwhy people like you more the more they see you, even if you never say a word\nhow something as simple as having similar likes and dislikes powerfully increases liking\nhow simple compliments can create liking even if they're not at all true\nhow a simple tap on the shoulder increases your ability to convince another person\n...and much more!\nThe principles in this course rely on scientific research in psychology to give you an in-depth look at statistically reliable tactics shown to increase liking and attraction. Unlike other books and courses, these aren't just assumptions about likability.\nImportantly, I won't just provide you with the scholarly research and leave it at that. At the end of each section, I offer ideas on how to translate the scientific findings into concrete strategies that you can implement right away the next time you're hoping to make a social connection with someone.\nAs an award-winning psychology instructor, I have experience translating research in the field and presenting it in an engaging, understandable way. My students routinely evaluate my courses highly and comment on the passion I have for social psychology. I hope you can join this group of satisfied students and learn something new about yourself and psychology.\nSo take this course now and begin to understand the science of attraction and what it can do for you!",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\nLove the way Melissa shares her love and teachings. She is the ‘real deal’ and comes from a place of love always. I have done a few of her courses and will be doing more. Thank you beautiful lady – Gaye\nMelissa, You always give us jewels to utilize in our everyday lives. Thank you for this awesome class! – Debra\nVery thought-provoking and beautifully communicated Melissa. – Vicky\nThis course actually helped me to release couple of layers of my heartache and I am so grateful for finding this course on my journey. I recommend this so much to anyone who has stuck emotions because it guides one to a release. I feel so much relief after doing this course. – Inuk\nExcellent course! One of my most favorite from Melissa. I find the breadth of her practical knowledge amazing. - Elizabeth\n\n\nWhether or not you're aware of it, you already create outcomes with your thoughts with incredible accuracy. Whether or not you like those outcomes comes down to how well you've employed your time.\nMeaningful thoughts which replay, repeat, and rehash themselves in your mind - the ones which evoke emotions, even physical responses – underpin the truth of the famous saying “Whether you think you can, or think you can’t – you’re right”. And it’s those same thoughts, chocked-full of belief and conviction, that create irrefutable mental placebo effects that tinker with real-world scientific results. In short, your thoughts matter.\nAs such, the more attached you are to the ideas in your mind, the more you believe in them. The more you replay those thoughts in your mind, the more you trust them. The more you act on those trusted thoughts, the more your life ends up looking like them. It’s this cycle which ultimately makes whatever you’re thinking about true – be it good or bad.\nAnd this is where using Positive Thought Healing comes in! As you go through the course, you'll soon understand how your thoughts actually create your life. You'll easily grasp all the basics at the start, then we'll take our time to dive deep into the world of energy and creation, and finally end up going through my step-by-step Positive Thought Healing method.\nTo help you learn all my Positive Thought Healing steps, your enrollment comes with a 100+ page handbook (PDF), plus helpful worksheet examples.\nBy the end of our journey together, you’ll be able to implement my steps to help you transform negative thoughts into healing ones!\nFor existing students and graduates, you'll see a little bit of 'cross-over' in some parts. But that material complements this course's significant amount of new, detailed and helpful content! In short, the knowledge you pick up from this course will not only be a great addition to your existing healing skills, but an incredible leveling-up for your spirit, too!\nPlease note: Completing this course does *not* qualify the graduate in any particular type of healing modality - it's purely a 'deep dive' into how positive thoughts impact our lives - and how we can use them for our benefit. As such, it's a 'no experience required' course for everyone, but would be considered 'further learning' for those who are Reiki practitioners, energy healers, empaths, therapists, or healthcare workers.",

      "description": "Are you living paycheck to paycheck? Does extra money flow to you and then suddenly it disappears? Do you borrow from Peter to pay Paul? Are you a single parent who has difficulties budgeting and saving?  If so, this is the course for you.\nMy step-by-step system helps an individual learn how to heal money blocks that have been growing roots for many years, even as far back as childhood. Most of our money blocks have been taken on unconsciously from the conditioning of our family, friends, religion, and society.\nIf you are experiencing the following:\nNever seem to have enough money after payday\nWorry about paying your bills on time\nDrained financially and/or unable to save\nFeel uneasy viewing your bills and banking accounts\nHave buyer’s remorse\nUnderpaid or unemployed\n…then you have a money block. So, read on baby!\nThis Money Healing course will give you a deep understanding of how to clear unprocessed money blocks that are holding you back from making the loot you want. You will learn strategies to help move from feeling broke to being successful and how to get out of low-frequency money fear and find our way back into the high frequency of wealth.\nI am an Energy Healer, Law of Attraction, NLP Practitioner, and a highly driven career woman. I will share healing and neuroplasticity techniques I have used to shift and transform energy to increase my income in a short time.\nWhether you want to heal yourself from money challenges, this course will inspire and educate you using a unique teaching style that is down to earth, humorous and effective.\nWho is this Course For?\nAnyone who wants to learn how to use subtle energy to heal money blocks in the energy body.\nAnyone who wants to transform their self-limited money belief\nAnyone who wants to attract money solutions\nAnyone who wants to use advance money manifesting techniques\nAnyone who tired of being broke\nYou will learn how to:\nTransform harmful money beliefs to wealth consciousness\nHow to develop a new neural pathway for new money habits\nOvercome money worries and anxieties\nHeal money blocks within the chakras\nPractice the easiest and fastest ways to attract $$\nRaise your money vibration and increase income\nAwaken the inner genius for money opportunities\nThroughout this Money Healing course, I will reference money energy using the terms “money frequency” and “money vibration.” Whatever word you place on this vital life force, it is a non-physical, unseen, and unheard by our ordinary senses. This concept doesn’t mean “subtle” energy doesn’t exist.\nMost people in Western society are so oblivious of what exists beyond our senses and the material world. They can be so grounded in the physical reality that they are blind on how their thoughts, emotions, and beliefs have a direct reflection of what and who we attract. With awareness or not, it doesn’t stop the energy from affecting their lives, especially the flow of money.\nOur money emotions, dreams, and thoughts – the powerful energy of our life force – ripples through our reality, leaving impressions, like fingerprints on this world.\nThe first step to money healing is to become aware of those money stories impressions that affect our well-being at this present moment. You will learn how to tap into your subconscious mind and release these harmful money perceptions that are suppressed and buried alive.\nThe exercises in this Money Healing course will allow the student to understand where these subtle money energies are repressed and suppressed within our energy system. As well as change how they transmit their money signals and tune into money frequency.\nUnderstanding and working with our money energy is not a supernatural privilege. It’s the natural interaction with have with the world around us. Regardless if you have doubts about how this power works or thinks this is a New Age concept, energy will do its work with or without your knowledge or consent. So, don’t you think it time to take back your power?\nThis Money Healing course explains in plain and simple terms how to gain back the power to attract money without exerting an extensive amount of energy. Once you have an awareness of the basic principles and the type of relationship behind your money flow, you can best apply the changes to your life as well as our legacy. The slave mentality is overrated and unnecessary if you chose to think differently. Remember, 80% of success comes from the mind, and 20% is mechanical. I don’t know about you, but working two dead-end jobs to make ends meet is stressful and exhausting.\nHow to Use This Course\nThis course includes personalized exercises for understanding our money stories and relationships. Each lesson will introduce key concepts and skills that allow the student to develop more significant experiences during their healing money woes and wounds. This workbook will help you rebuild a new money foundation into fun and practical applications. The exercises throughout this course allow for hands-on experiences as well as recording your results to personalize the learning process.\nBut this is far from fluff. In our first lesson, we delve into our first exercise as the “Daily Practice.” This daily practice will begin the money reprogramming stage of our subconscious mind.\nThis course also has hands-on tools for practice and guiding you during your healing journey. These tools consist of self-hypnosis, EFT, NLP, sound frequency and variation of meditation practices such as breathing, repetitive phrases or words and visualization.\nI strongly urge you to start from the beginning and work through every lesson sequence. I wouldn’t ingest the entire course in one sitting. Most of the exercises require releasing energy, and the best approach is to dedicate at least one week per module for learning and to apply the techniques. Depending on the number of money blocks stories, it may span several weeks’ worth of work. This money healing course requires releasing and restoring energy, which may weigh a tow on our energy system. So, please take this course seriously and slowly.\nSome of the exercises have to be repeated based on the number of money stories or experiences that may be causing a blockage. During this high-replay value, you will begin to reveal more aspects of your money experience that you may have previously missed. Although going through one money block exercise on the first try can release that blockage, your most significant benefits will come through repetition. It’s no different than learning a new skill, as repetition and hands-on training are the best ways to receive results.\nYou will find that every lesson contains a topic overview and the exercises that complement each lecture. All of the activities encourage the students to tailor their own needs. This course provides a basic template, but everyone's background, experiences, stories, and beliefs are unique. If any exercises don’t adapt well to you, please, by all means, adjust that exercise, so it works best for you.\nI hope you enjoy this money healing course.\nHappy Money Healing!\nNamaste,\nNan D.

Mastery.\nIn a whirlwind of crazy mixed up rampant change, the one grounding force is YOU. ... that is, when your mind becomes your new BFF.\n\n- In this course you Unlock Your Real SuperPowers and Make Your Mind Your Friend by mastering the 5 Natural Faculties of Mind that are essential to creating the results we desire.\n- Intent, Intuition, Subtle Energy, Resonance, and Meditation are not yet taught in traditional education, yet are vital to living a masterful life.\n-This course teaches you a clear and precise understanding of these natural-born \"superpowers\" so you activate them in yourself. You learn to use them in daily life and you live them spontaneously, with ease.\n-Through real-life examples, stories, and awareness practices, creator of QuantumThink®, Dianne Collins distinguishes the specific qualities and functions of each of the 5 faculties of mind and how they work together.\n- In these dramatically changing, uncertain times people are dealing with more stress factors than ever. Mastering our 5 Natural Faculties of Mind is key to peace, equanimity, and happiness. Centered, confident, and self-aware. These are states of mind we all want.\n- There are two key aspects of this. One is keeping your vibrational frequency more refined, lighter, higher, clearer.\nThe other is actually conditioning uplifting, positive and productive habits of thinking.\n\nThe intent of this course is for you to:\nEstablish mindfulness as a natural, integrated way of life.\n\nTap into your inherent genius to create inner states of calm and connectedness, generate high quality relationships, and achieve outer world accomplishments with grace and fulfillment.\n\nBreak free of limiting thoughts and authentically experience being in command of your destiny -- focused and confident, peaceful and happy.\n\nDevelop the state of being centered in awakened awareness. This is the state that great wisdom masters achieved, and the state from which all great accomplishment derives. This is the state of freedom and choice.\n\nWhat’s unique about this course is that it's infused with the QuantumThink® method.\n- Dianne Collins’ revelation, QuantumThink®, is a system of thinking that blends quantum principles, universal wisdom,  metaphysical insight and modern logic into practicality we can live daily.\n\n- Unlock Your Real SuperPowers includes the spirit of the QuantumThink principles and practices that leap us to the expanded and more up-to-date perspective of our Quantum Age -- a digital world of interconnectedness and unity, multi-dimensions, and energy-intelligence, and magical quantum fields.\n\nWisdom expressed in its simplest form has the power to inform, transform and entertain!\n- Dianne Collins, known for having people experience inspiring, expansive transformations, entertainingly guides you to the greatest adventure of all – to the state of mastery and excellence that resides in you.\n- Dianne calls it “the ultimate selfie” because: It’s You becoming the Superhero of your own life.\n\n\n- LIVE THE WISDOM -\nWhen you master your mind, you master your life.",

      "description": "To change your body, you must first change your mind.\nShifting that excess weight that just won't budge no matter what you do is about first shifting your mindset. Because if you're carrying excess body fat, it's serving a purpose. You just don't know what that purpose is. To give you an idea though, some people hold onto excess weight because they feel 'small' and unimportant; people hold onto excess weight for fear of being attracting sexual attention, which feels 'unsafe' (very common in people who've been abused), people hold onto excess weight to put distance, or a buffer, between themselves and the world, as well people who fear or experience poverty carry excess weight as a survival technique... and many more reasons.\nAs hard as it is to believe, when your conscious self would do ANYTHING to lose weight, the truth is that some subconscious part of you WANTS the extra padding and this part of you will fight hard and clever to keep the weight. So you can count your calories and tot up your carb grams till the cows come home but the fat will never permanently shift unless your subconscious mind decides the weight is surplus to requirements. The harder you battle to lose the weight, the harder your body-mind will fight back. Transformation is an inside-out job.\nOver 21 days, use these EFT Tapping meditations to peel off the layers of diet culture conditioning sludge that have you stuck in the miserable dieting not-so-merry-go-round of despair, deprivation, and self-judgement.\nSloughing off all this negativity and finding a space to enjoy and accept your body is crucial to shifting your internal chemistry and allowing the body-mind to heal – and when that happens, your body feels safe to naturally rebalance and return to its ideal weight.\nYou are never going to shame and hate yourself thin and happy. When you stop fighting and resisting the excess weight on your body, you create a space for it to begin releasing – because you’re transforming the reasons for it being held there in the first place.",

I tested this Anxiety Management course with my anxiety and depression clients and all of them not only loved it but ceased their anxiety and depression in a rapid time.

I do not rely on one style of therapy, but choose the best from different styles and techniques to create the best treatment.\nDo you sometimes feel uncomfortable in social situations and perhaps worried about what people might think of you?\nPerhaps you feel anxious about traveling to new places, experiencing new things or meeting new people?\nOr are you constantly overanalysing everything that happened or exaggerating what might happen?\nYou might worry about having anxiety or panic attack?\nThis course will allow you to feel confident and comfortable in any new situation.\nHave the ability to:\n- master Anxiety Management with CBT, Neuroscience and Mindfulness\n- develop Emotional Intelligence\n- become Emotionally Resilient and confident\n- resolve your limiting beliefs and eliminate negative thinking\nWith this  Anxiety Management course you will gain a better understanding of why you are the way you are, meaning your personality traits, behaviours and habits.

Treatments are often more powerful when used in combination. I do not rely on one style of therapy, but choose from different styles and techniques to create the best treatment plan.\nEven where medication or traditional therapy failed my clients managed to free themselves of anxiety and panic attacks using this Anxiety Management course. All you need to do is to use these CBT and Neuroscience techniques regularly and make them your new habits.\nAs you know this is a Udemy course and so If you don’t love this course you have 30 days money back guarantee.

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED\nAdd Soul Care Therapy/Spiritual Counseling to your practice. This course will add profound mental and emotional training to the psychological side of healing, counseling those who come to us for healing in addition to Reiki, Chakra Work, Seichim, Thai Chi and any other healing modality you practice. Whether you are interested in holistic healing and are starting your journey, or if you have been involved in healing and are realizing there is a need to understand the mind and psychological side of healing to be paired with your current modality, this is the course for you. I offer you my wisdom and knowledge of over 20 years of healing work, and share this information in a conversational way, and through story telling. There are also PDF guides alone the way. This is not a pie chart/graph course. My style of teaching in through experience sharing, storytelling and conversational lectures. Also, a little silliness! This work is non-exhaustive because it is work that never ends. You will leave with much knowledge, and much to continue learning. Work on the soul is not finite, but an infinite endeavor. The real work begins when you leave the course and begin to see it in action with clients and in your own implementation. Disclaimer: this course could also trigger your belief systems and excuses if there are any in there. If they are there, and a trigger comes up, look within and process it and ask why. If you resort to negativity and blame you are taking a longer, harder path to recovery and wisdom.\n\n\nI myself realized the demand to \"unpack\" the feelings and experiences that arise from doing healing work such as Reiki, Seichim and Chakra work. As I did more and more healing work on others, my emails, calls and texts began to increase needing to talk more about the session to understand what was happening to them and \"talk through\" the healing. Because this became such a demand, I had to create a way to control the life work balance, this was essential to not deplete my own energy and that which I give to my family. I created Soul Care Sessions, allowing people to book appointments with me. As I continued to see need, I continued to educate myself in the processes of the mind to heal, using Spiritual Counseling, psychology, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Gestalt Psychotherapy, all of which I am certified in. This course teaches a cumulative study of all these topics with a foundation in Reiki, Chakra Work, Energy Work, Guided Image Therapy, Counseling and Therapy. All through conversational lectures.\n\n\nThis course will certify you as an Alternative Healing Therapist & Practitioner, combining any/all of your other modalities with Soul Care Therapy and give you tools in the process of how to add Soul Care Therapy Sessions to your current practice of healing, or simply to begin a new practice starting with this course if you are courageous enough. This course is priceless in what you will learn and comes from over 20 years of study in healing and therapy. What you learn here you will take with you for a lifetime to healing not only yourself but assist clients in their healing journey.  You will learn so much from this course as I have in the journey to acquire it, and now I share it with you. Remain Open, Receptive, and Appreciative of the process (O.R.A.)\nDisclaimer: This course is not a license, nor does it provide licensing permissions in your state. This therapeutic certificate is in the broad language of many modalities and alternative healing methods. After taking this course you will not be a licensed therapist with said privileges nor will you be able to join professional Therapist licensing directories. For that you must take the traditional academic route. This is a ministerial route as a spiritual counselor afforded in most states as a Minister of Peace. Visit the Univeral Life Church website to obtain your Minister of Peace Certificate and any counseling certificate of interest there for additional confidence. The MOP is not required to practice healing, but there as an added security for those who feel they need it. Place of Bliss Academy does not support fraudulent claims of licensing to practice nor is POBA responsible for the quality of services provided by others after taking this course.

Keep  in mind that this mindfulness course comes with life time access so you will be able to  come back to it and utilize the tools and meditations as many times as you wish.\n\n\nA Personal Note from Joeel\nWe are passionate about teaching people to develop self-awareness and mindfulness because our ability to remain centered and focused is what has allowed us to thrive through even the most challenging parts of life. In fact, when I was sick and bed ridden for a year I used many of these mindfulness techniques to not only help me find peace but also find joy in the darkest places. In my many emergency room visits,  the doctors wondered why I would be laughing and joking around with Natalie while my body was basically shutting down. The reason was that mindfulness helped me detach from the chaos and see the light at the end of tunnel, regardless of how dim it was because we were able to focus in the moment rather than being lost in worrying thoughts. Therefore, we know the power of mindfulness and this is why we are so excited to share these tools with you!\n\n\n\n\n21 Day Mindfulness and Meditation Challenge OUTLINE:\nIn Week 1 you’ll practice enjoying the present moment and learning how to be mindful in everyday life.\nIn Week 2 you’ll learn to be the observer of your thoughts and emotions so you can master your monkey mind and manage negative emotions.\nIn Week 3 you’ll take what you’ve learned and use it to develop self-compassion, take back control of what and who you allow to influence you, and practice being more present with others.\n\n\nWhy practice mindfulness?\nNearly all people who are extremely successful, as well as most professional athletes, use mindfulness because study after study have revealed the amazing benefits! Mindfulness and meditation have been shown to actually change the areas of the brain associated with memory, learning and regulation of emotion. This leads to increased mental clarity and concentration, reduced stress, and increased experiences of peace and happiness. Plus, it’s been shown to have powerful health benefits, including improving sleep, raising energy, increasing immune function, lowering blood pressure and reducing pain and headaches.\n\n\nSo, who are we?\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera, serial entrepreneurs, authors, speakers, and educators. We have over a decade of experience in the field of psychology and life coaching. All of our programs are designed based on our experience in coaching, social services, psychology, and education, as well my Masters’ in Counseling and research on happiness for my dissertation for a PhD in psychology. At the time of this recording, we have over 800,000+ students from 200 countries.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright Transformation Services, Inc. All Rights Reserved",

      "description": "Mindfulness Meditation with Jack Kornfield is a complete course in practicing mindfulness by one of the world’s leading experts. Decades of neuroscience studies show the power of mindfulness to relieve stress, awaken our positive capacities, and bring balance to our lives. Mindfulness gives us the power to meet any situation wisely, to be fully present, and to operate with compassion. When we can look more clearly into ourselves and our life situation, new possibilities naturally open up for transforming difficulties and emerging stronger and wiser.\nThis comprehensive training in all the fundamental mindfulness practices is entirely accessible to everyone, from beginners to those with prior meditative experience. Rich with stories, practices, teachings and good humor, it features eight complete sessions of guided exercises in sitting meditation including mindfulness of breath, body, feelings and thoughts; walking meditation; mindful eating; compassion practice to free the heart; and connection with our deepest aspirations and intention. These guided segments are a valuable resource that can be used again and again to sustain or refresh your regular, ongoing practice.\nHere is the benefit: We all know how busy and divisive modern times can be, and how easily they can fuel stress and anxiety. Mindfulness is both healing and liberating. Learning to meet our complex world and our own changing mental states with mindful loving awareness and courage allows us to find spacious, clear and healthy responses to life, rather than be caught in habitual reactions and struggle.\nMindfulness quiets the mind and heals the heart. Systematically practicing mindfulness, we can recognize and foster positive states of mind like kindness, generosity, steadiness, and love -- discovering how they are natural to us; and learn to nurture and strengthen them into a new, more gracious life of well-being.\n*To stay up to date with Jack's ever-expanding course offerings, please visit JackKornfield dot com.",

Many teachers say far too much and over complicate this simple and profound practice. You will be shown that what you leave out, is as important as what you put in. It will show you why you should avoid cramming too much information and too many activities into your classes, and allow space.\n\nEnsure teaching is Practical - Teaching has to be practical and relevant to a student’s or client’s everyday life. You will explore how to show your students/clients how to apply mindfulness to every area of their lives, such as home, work and relationships. Relationships are often an area of much difficulty but also of much growth. You will learn practical techniques to share with your students when in difficult situations in life.",

And let me reassure you of something... It's Not Your Fault!\n\n\nThink of it as the instruction manual that your mind has created for you -  that creates rules for how you experience your life... how you feel, the emotions your experience, and habits you act upon (negative and positive) - without your control.\n\n\nUltimately this manual can be very limiting in what it allows you to achieve. –  Your life can only change (for the better) if we create new instructions for your mind to live by (are you getting excited yet?)\n\n\nThis is why goals seem unachievable, negative habits become impossible to change and no matter your effort – success, money, happiness, joy and love seem to be impossible to reach.\n\n\n...Until now!\n\n\nIf right now you are experiencing a limit to your success, money, happiness, joy and love it's because of just one thing.\n\n\nI call this you're conscious to unconscious conflict.\n\n\nIn layman's terms, it sounds like this\n\n\n...I really want this – but I’m too scared to try.\n\n\n...I really want to become a millionaire, but what if people laugh at me and I fail.\n\n\n...I really want to be in a loving relationship – but I’m too scared to have my heart broken.\n\n\n...I really want to lose weight – but I enjoy eating chocolate cake and sitting on the couch.\n\n\nSound familiar?\n\n\nAnd although everyone experiences this conflict differently – it doesn’t mean it needs to stay like this.\n\n\nIt's just that nobody has ever given you the mental tools necessary to extend and recreated your instruction manual -- and shown you how to use the necessary mental tools -- so you have the \"extra capacity\" to do and achieve more of what you want to do in your life. - with NO conflict.\n\n\nSo if you’re ready too...\n\n\nIncrease your performance in any area of your life...\n\n\nReach a particular goal that has always been out of reach for you...\n\n\n\"Outgrow\" your personal problems...\n\n\nExperience “inner healing” to emotional blocks\n\n\nAnd (if you want) experience heightened states of conscious awareness...\n\n\nI'm going to show you how to become your own hypnotherapist, capable of changing any negative conflict you find inside your mind, destroy it, and create a new profound way of thinking,l acting, feeling and knowing – essentially rewiring your entire mind towards - success, money, happiness, joy and love.\n\n\nWelcome to the Advanced Self-hypnosis (Become your own hypnotherapist) program.\n\n\nTo your success - Scott Jansen",

This isn't difficult and any women can do this with a little bit of dedication. All you really need is the desire to let your feminine side shine.\nSign up today and replenish the feminine goddess within you!",

It is possible to study this course alongside our Professional Counselling Diploma  course if you wish to qualify in this field of expertise at the same time. There is a $15 admin fee (or your currency equivalent) if you wish to go ahead and have Karen’s certificate, which is different to the standard Udemy certificate - Details will be given in the course.\nOur easy to learn modules include:\nIntroduction to your Professional Grief & Bereavement Counselling Course\nYour Professional Grief & Bereavement Counselling Course Training Manual PDF\nAttachment, Grief & Loss\nThe Mourning Process\nGrief Counselling\nGrief & The Family\nThe Counsellor & Grief\nSummary\nAccreditation\nBonus Lecture\nFAQ\nAnd much more!\nThis is a Professional Diploma Course that is fully accredited by CTAA - Complementary Therapists Accredited Association.",

      "description": "\"If HABIT is the vehicle that will drive you to your GOALS, this COURSE is the roadmap that will guide you on the journey.\"\n~ Chris Kyle, creator of The Habit Journal\n_____________________________________\nDid you know that focusing on your daily habits can make you healthier, wealthier, happier, more productive, more creative, more confident, more mindful, more organised, less anxious and altogether more successful?\nSo why aren't we all working on our habits? Well, making something a habit is difficult...which is why I created this course to help you get started right now.\nMy name is Chris Kyle, I am the creator of The Habit Journal™ and this course will teach you how to use it to track your habits, achieve your goals and change your life forever.\nThe Habit Journal was launched on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter, in February of this year. It had a goal of raising £3000 ($4500) in 30 days to manufacture the physical version. It reached the goal in 3 days and went on to raise £32,435 ($49,300), attracted 2218 backers and was selected as a Staff Pick within an hour of going live. The first run of the journals is now sold out and we're currently working on the second run with our Italian manufacturer. (Don't worry, you don't need the physical journal as the full printable PDF version comes free with this course)\nWhen was the last time you set a goal for yourself? This course is very hands on with many practical exercises...in fact, this is one right now: take a pen and a piece of paper and start listing all the goals you've achieved in your life.\nHow long is your list?\nSeriously, be honest, have you ever achieved a goal that you set for yourself?\nI'm not preaching here, for 30 years of my life I hadn't set myself one goal never mind achieved one...not one. My goals were set by my teachers, my parents and my bosses. I let my life be determined by other people. My one and only aim was to create as little friction as possible in this world and in doing so I achieved absolutely nothing. The worst thing was, I thought I was doing just fine. I had a house, a car, a girlfriend, some friends, an average paying job. Maybe you also think you're doing just fine as well, but are you really?\nWhat if you were capable of so much more? What if you had untapped potential? What if you could tap into that potential just by focusing on your daily habits? What if instead of watching TV, playing video games, drinking soda and surfing the internet you decided to work on habits that could transform your life and make you a success?\nHow would it feel to finally set your own goals, to start successfully achieving those goals, to improve every area of your life including your health and fitness, your mental and spiritual well-being, your relationships with your family and/or partner, your personal development and your financial situation?\nThis course will teach you how to use the journal to identify your goals and then get you focusing on all the right habits to help you achieve those goals...AND...it takes just 5 minutes of journaling every night. Are you willing to trade 5 minutes of your time for the life you want?\nYou don't need to be into journaling to use it.\nYou don't need to be into self help.\nYou don't need to pay for a life coach.\nYou don't need to be young.\nYou don't need to have any qualifications.\nYou don't need to already know what you want in life.\nThe only thing you need to be is motivated and committed to giving the course 100% effort. When you do this you'll realise than every goal is achievable and everything you want in life is attainable.\n_____________________________________\nWHAT YOU WILL GET WITH THIS COURSE:\nThe Full PDF version of The Habit Journal, a 272 page guided journal for recording, measuring and applying lasting habits.

      "description": "Learning to read the Tarot is life transforming. Tarot is truly about the journey of life, as a soul having a human being experience. If you ever wanted to get a good grasp on how the law of attraction operates, learning the Tarot provides just that.\n\n\nTarot readings essentially focus on these areas\n* Your current/present energy\n* Your opportunities and blockages in your current energetic space\n* Your recent past, meaning what is on your mind mostly, and how that led to your present life circumstances\n* Lessons from your past\n* How your subconscious beliefs about yourself and life affect your experience of life\n* The direction in which your current energy is taking you\n* Your strengths in your current life space/energy\n* Areas of improvement in your life you will benefit from working on\n* And literally, so much more.....\n\n\nA common misconception about learning to read the Tarot is that you have to do it exactly as your trainer does. In teaching another person how to read the Tarot, we as teachers share the ancient knowledge with you. Yet, it is only through applying yourself that you build a personal relationship with all the beauty Tarot has to offer.\n\n\nPlease understand that the Tarot is not a way of predicting the future. Our present life circumstances are created in the past and based on what we focus on today will determine what our future will look like. Tarot reading is about empowerment, pointing out to another person their personal power. In learning how to provide this valuable service to another, you will also discover it within yourself. How exciting is that?\n\n\nAs a person who has been reading the Tarot since 2001, it is my divine pleasure and honor to present this Detailed Tarot Reading Course to you. May you find great value from it.\n\n\nForever love\nAdrian Nelson\nLife Enthusiast",

This is a course that is not that focused on the actual techniques and practical skills (the type of conversations to have with people, personality types), but the mindset. In other words, if you already know what you have to do logically, but for some reason, you can't get yourself to do it (maybe it's your emotions, maybe you don't deal well with setbacks, or others), then this is the course for you.\nOur goal with this course is to cover the psychology of personal transformation. In other words, how to get you to change your behavior. We will be exploring three main phases:\n- Definition (knowing what your specific goals are, your timeline, making a decision);\n- Executing (actually starting to control and redirect your energy, having the right mindset and supporters, among other things);\n- Resilience (knowing how to properly discharge negative emotions, as well as change your state when you find yourself in a negative one);\nThe course contains multiple techniques related to psychology, behavior change, and other areas, all applied to help you manage your anger, communicate more calmly and make these effective, long-term habits.\nBy the end of this course, you will know how to cultivate the necessary habits and behaviors for anger management in the long-term, not being derailed by obstacles, and always performing at your best.",

      "description": "Students who complete the Emotional Intelligence Life Coach certification course will receive an official life coach CERTIFICATION from Transformation Academy. This course is also accredited by internationally recognized Continuing Professional Development Standards Agency (Provider No: 50134), and 15 CPD/CEU credits are available upon request. Details will be provided at the end of the course.\n\n\nWe are top Udemy instructors in the personal development, psychology, business,  and life coaching certification category. Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\nThe course also has a private thriving Facebook life coach networking group. This group has over 7000 students that have taken our life coaching certifications.\n\n\n\n\nBecome a Certified Emotional Intelligence Life Coach!\nMany people believe that intelligence, or IQ (intelligence quotient), is what determines success. However, researchers have consistently found that people with average IQ’s outperform those with higher IQ 70% of the time. So, why is that? It turns out that the missing link in determining a person’s long-term success is emotional intelligence, or EQ. Those average IQ people had high Emotional Intelligence, making emotional intelligence tools essential for any coach that wants to help clients transform their life.\nStudy after study have shown that people with high emotional intelligence:\n· Have higher levels of performance (for instance sales representatives with high emotional intelligence outperformed others by 50%)\n· Have higher levels of productivity (for instance a study of over 40 fortune 500 companies found that programmers in the top 10th percentile of emotional intelligence produced software 3 times faster than programmers with low emotional intelligence)\n· People with high emotional intelligence have higher problem solving skills and lower levels of conflict\n· Those with high emotional intelligence are more effective leaders and earn substantially more over their lifetime\nThis means, that as a life coach, nearly every client you encounter would greatly benefit from developing his or her emotional intelligence.\nThe good news is that emotional intelligence can be DEVELOPED! It is not a fixed in-born trait (and neither is intelligence for that matter—but we cover that in a different course).\nThe problem is that for most of us, no one teaches us about emotional intelligence and our emotions and how they work. No one teaches us that we can have more control over our emotions by developing awareness of our thoughts and feelings. This is where a life coach can play a vital role in helping clients learn and develop these tools.\nMany people that have low level of emotional intelligence, including life coaching clients, struggle with:\n· Being overwhelmed by life stress\n· Getting carried away by negative emotional responses\n· Feeling stuck when facing challenges\n· Feeling socially awkward or having troubled relationships\nAnd that’s why we created this course! This complete Emotional Intelligence life coach certification and training program gives you a blueprint for helping your clients develop emotional intelligence, both INTRApersonal intelligence, or understanding of your own emotions, and INTERpersonal intelligence, or understanding of others’ emotions.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn Emotional Intelligence techniques to use with your life coaching clients to help them:\n· Better understand the cause of their own emotions so they can shift their own emotional state\n· Catch negative emotions early and avoid triggers, in order to prevent escalation\n· Reduce and release stress and better cope with life events\n· Develop healthy empathy so that that can better understand others without being sucked into their emotions\n· Listen and communicate effectively and tune into non-verbal communication and body language\nAs a life coach or an aspiring life coach this course will provide:\n· A proven life coaching blueprint to help your life coaching clients develop emotional intelligence.\n· Life coaching emotional intelligence assessments.\n· A life coaching program that you can implement as a stand alone niche life coaching service or life coaching tools and skills that you can add and incorporate to any life coaching niche.\n· Transformational NLP techniques that can be used in your life coaching practice\n· Essential psychological and emotional life coaching tools that will better help your personal and professional life.\n· Access to a private life coaching network community with over 7,000 active life coaches from all over the world. This group is made up of life coaches that have either completed or are completing one of our life coach certification programs. This support group of life coaches is invaluable as you have a range of life coaches with past experience that share their experience and provide feedback and insights.\n· Made for you handouts, exercises, and activities that you can give to your life coaching clients.\n· Access to our Transformation Life Coaching Magazine\n· Free listing in Transformation Life Coaching Directory\n· Official Life Coaching Certification from Transformation Academy\n\n\nThe skill of emotional intelligence is perhaps the most valuable skill anyone can EVER acquire. Especially for those in the helping field such as life coaching.\nGive yourself and your clients the gift of Emotional Intelligence through by taking this life coach certification and becoming a Certified Emotional Intelligence Life Coach!\n\n\n\n\nCopyright Transformation Services, Inc.

      "description": "“The only constant in life is change”\nHeraclitus (Greek philosopher of Ephesus, 500 BC)\nWe all face change every day – whether it is a simple change in the weather, a change to our work schedule or changes in our family life.\nChange is the only constant in life - the only thing we can be sure will happen.  Change affects everyone and everybody deals with change differently.  If you can create awareness of the way you respond to life events and organisational change and manage your emotional response to the event you're well on your way to effectively managing change and managing people through change.\nThis course's focus is on Emotional Intelligence for Change.\nEmotional intelligence for change refers to the ability to recognise and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others, in order to effectively navigate change.\nWith emotional intelligence, an individual can be better equipped to lead and influence others during times of change and transition.  They can also recognise their own emotional reactions and adjust them to be more effective in the face of adversity, allowing them to take on a more proactive role in creating positive change.  Ultimately, emotional intelligence for change is a powerful tool for creating a better future.\n\nEmotional intelligence consists of a range of fundamental skills that enable you to confidently respond to people and changing situations.  This type of intelligence allows you, as a leader, to understand better the motivations, feelings, and needs of people around you who will be involved with change, and adapt to evolving situations accordingly.  Emotional intelligence also enables you to handle conflict, deal with stress, and maintain relationships more effectively in challenging times.\nManaging the way you respond to events and your ability to communicate effectively is essential for change leadership, for managing people effectively through change and for managing personal change.  It's not what happens that matters but how you and others response to change that really counts.\nBeing emotionally intelligent is the underlying structure that underpins and supports effective responses to events, people and change.  In the workplace and in our personal lives being emotionally intelligent is an essential component to building resilience for mental health and successfully managing people and change.\nThe ability to quickly and easily adapt to change is often a competitive advantage for a change leader.  Emotionally intelligent leaders and managers are also able to help others manage difficult change.\nPractically applying emotional intelligence at work and using emotional intelligence well during change will help you drive change leadership positively and effectively.\nThis course has been designed to explore the role of emotional intelligence in change looking at change at the personal and organisational level.  It explores working with emotional needs through conscious choices fundamental to effective change.\nPeople often talk about positive and negative emotions in change.  This is not that helpful as emotions cannot really be labelled in that way.  The course also covers the myths around positive and negative emotions and why this terminology is not appropriate when working to understand emotions and emotional intelligence in the workplace.\nChanging the way that you work with your emotions is not easy.  This course will give you some insights BUT developing your emotional intelligence will take you time and a lot of effort, and even then you are not going to get it right all the time!!  Emotional intelligence is about improving performance, engagement and well being in a sustainable way, so that it sticks.\n\nThe course covers\n\nThe importance of emotional intelligence in managing change\nWhy resistance to change occurs and how to overcome this\nThe neuroscience of change to explain the psychological reasons people react to changes\nThe emotions that people experience and ways to support people positively as they transition through change\nHow to utilise change management models practically using emotional intelligence and a focus on the people involved\nThe course contains narrated videos, activities and some fun material to download.\nCompleting this course, you will be able to\nDescribe the role of emotional intelligence in change leadership\nConsider what is involved in working with the emotional climate\nExplain why resistance occurs and how to overcome this\nRecognise how people react to events by understanding the neuroscience of change\nIdentify the emotions that people experience as they transition through change and identify ways to support people positively\nDetermine how to utilise change management models practically using emotional intelligence at work and with a focus on supporting the people involved\nExplore ways to effectively manage change in your current circumstances\nThe course material makes up part of a one week advanced workshop that has been endorsed by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\nPLEASE NOTE - This course is NOT for you if you are not prepared to work through the practical activities that make up a fundamental part of the course.  Emotional intelligence cannot be developed by learning some techniques through watching a few video lectures.  The course requires you to do some reflective thinking, to get some feedback and to discuss your development with others.  I'm afraid that you won't get the best from the course unless you are prepared to do this.\nThis course is being continually refined and updated to ensure it remains current and relevant.\nThere are FIVE Activity Booklets included within the course that are designed to help you to work with your emotional intelligence for change.  The activities require you do some work outside of the course.  The emotional brain learns from doing things and through activity.  Repetition and rehearsal over weeks will embed in changes.\nThe course contains a series of Lightbulb Moments resource cards, which have been created to provide you with handy reminders of key points around topics covered within the course.\nAll PDFs can be completed online and are Section 508 / ADA Accessibility compliant.\nAll videos are high definition recorded in 1080p.\nAll videos have grammatically correct English captions.\nLatest update - September 2025",

You will also develop communication skills and learn how to build a successful Life coaching practice. Help your clients develop awareness and mindfulness. A life coach can help a person to identify his or hers strengths, develop them, and identify personal and professional goals. Their role is to assist the coachee throughout the change process. As you will discover, this happens in several ways. If a person chooses coaching, there are many benefits. Coaching conversations help a person focus attention on their desired goals. The foundation of a good coaching relationship is trust and authenticity. This allows for vulnerability. Coachees who open themselves to being vulnerable also can experience growth in self-compassion.\nMost of the session involves the coach listening, and then asking powerfully focused questions.\nSome of the benefits that clients get from the life coaching process are:\nHelp your clients empower their thinking and self-talk.\nTeach your clients to take back their power over negative emotions.\nTeach your clients eliminate their toxic and limiting beliefs\nHelp your clients make hard decisions and take actions they've been putting off.\nHelp your clients overcome fear of change, failure and risk.\nHelp your clients live a life of passion and purpose.",

Or you behave in a way that causes you difficulties and although you fight against, you have no success. These can be addictions, deliquent behaviour, being always the victim etc. Or you sabotage your goals and your happiness.\nThe reason for this is the hidden loyalty in a family. Children absorb feelings or behaviors from former family members and experience them in their lives - without realizing this connection. You have a loving connection to your family in the very depth, even if in real life there was quarrelling, separation, violence or lovelessness!\nThe first time you hear this, it sounds strange, but in my 20 years of work as a psychologist with family dynamics I have rediscovered it again and again.\nIf a problem has been haunting you for a long time, I invite you to look with me in this direction of the past of your family.",

I have held off, (until now) from going into the subject because so many people either roll their eyes, or become paralyzed at the very idea.\nAfter some soul searching, it’s clear that NOT telling you what I know about the subject is an act of gross malpractice as a Remote Viewing Teacher. So, I’m teaching you what I know, so you’ll know.\nIf you’ve had this nagging feeling, or dark cloud hanging over your head because you can feel that something about the future, just isn’t right. You already know it in your bones.\nIn a nutshell, the “Killshot” is real. It’s coming. And, if you’re not prepared, the world and everything you know about it, is going to get really ugly. But, it doesn’t have to be all that terrible, if you know what to do and where to go, and if you can make it to the other side, some really amazing things will happen.\nIn this course you’ll:\nLearn what he “Killshot” is all about\nWhere the few safe zones reside\nUnderstand the reason for securing your sanctuary location\nDiscover the “Road to the Killshot” through a series of past/future events\nKnow what you need to secure yourself and your family\nWhat to expect before/during/after the “Killshot” event.\nWhile this subject does deal with a very dark topic, it’s not all doom and gloom. There is hope for those who make it out the other side. We are evolving. For evolution to take place, nature makes room for the next phase to succeed and flourish.\nWe have the ability to do what the dinosaurs couldn’t, avoid extinction through evolution.",

You will actualize and upgrade your current energies to resonate with the Earth and Cosmic Changes!\nWe are living in times of Change. The Global Energy level of the planet is rising. Some say the Earth has already ascended to the next level of Reality, to the new dimension. Our body is evolving. Our subtle bodies are expanding and integrating each other as one.\nIt has never been easier to expand our consciousness and to embody our Light, and at the same time, the need for reconnecting and integrating these changes is getting every day stronger.\nThe technologies have weakened our abilities to embrace the New Human that we are becoming, the Homo Sanctus. Cellphones inhibit telepathic abilities, Microwaves harm our astral bodies, Negativity in the media impacts our minds, the hormones in the food mess up our emotional bodies, the GMO and the lack of non polluted air harm our physical bodies… Tough Time ! But here is the solution if we want to survive the Change and ride the Wave with Grace and ease : we need to take some time every day to actualize our energies, to clear our subtle bodies, to ground ourselves in this new Earth, to maintain our sovereignty as Human living in the New Earth.\nThis is why I compiled this new practice, which is a blend of many downloads and routines I have been practicing the last 20 years. I was blessed enough to receive from my guides many simple tools, to purify, expand and integrate my Light.\nIn 30-40 minutes you can go through 8 steps that will bring you many benefits :\n· A better grounding and a strong connection to the Earth Core.\n· More vitality in the physical body\n· Increased Immunity, better health\n· Peaceful Mind: the solution for stress\n· Tuning in harmony with the rising Schuman Resonance\n· An awareness centered in the Heart\n· An expansion of the energy field, that will increase with time.\n· Better memory and cognitive functions\n· Centering and harmonizing of the subtle bodies.\n· Clarity about our purpose and missions\n· Confidence in our ability to go through challenges\n· The ability to create a sacred space wherever you are\n· An increased feeling of safety and confidence\n· Balanced and strong healthy boundaries\n· A sacred connection with Oneness and the Divine\nThe basic level of Octascension has 8 steps :\n1. Creating a Sacred Space where we can align to the divine and the Earth.\n2. Stretching/Moving energies in the body and bringing in new virtues.\n3. Grounding and Sourcing : tuning in with the Earth Resonance and connecting to our original Star System.\n4. Color alternate pranayama : balancing the polarities, tuning with the 7 colors of the Rainbow Body.\n5. Activation of the Torus and the Merkabah : powerful expansion of the energy field.\n6. 7 Chakras purification and activation with DNA codes\n7. Activating a psychic veil with the Divine Ray of Illahi Noor to remain protected and safe at all times.\n8. The Diamond Heart meditation : accessing multidimensional awareness.\nDo you feel its time to reach another level of expansion, centering and clarity?\nThen this is for you! Now is the time! Be ready for an incredible upgrade in your consciousness.\nTry it and commit to yourself to do it everyday! You will see the changes in your life almost instantly.\nMaybe you just want to take few of these steps because you already have a practice, go for it!\nBut it is a whole sequence, coherent and effective as it is.\nReady for the ride?\nThen sign in!",

From the moment you wake up in the morning, you will see a vast array of colours everywhere you look.\nWhether you want to take this course for yourself or become a Colour Therapist, this course gives you all the tools you need to utilise Colour in a positive and strong way in your life.\nOur course includes video modules & an in depth training manual.\nWe also make use of colours in our own homes, we take time to choose the shades of furnishings that suit our personal choices and relate to how we feel and we buy clothes not just because of the style but because we are drawn to the colour. When we face difficult situations at work, we power dress, using strong colour to influence us even if subconsciously. If we want to feel more carefree or younger of spirit, we choose lighter, pastel shades that can strip away the years. But more, each person has an aura – an electro-magnetic field that cloaks the physical body and which contains fluctuating colours influenced by how you think and feel and which helps fuel the physical body with energy.\nColour therapy is not new. The interest in colour dates back thousands of years – as far back as the ancient cultures of Egypt, India and China. It is a complementary therapy which uses colour to promote health and well-being and while it is used as a standalone therapy, it is also a perfect therapy to aid orthodox treatments and to boost the healing process.\nThere are seven visible colours to the spectrum i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet and these resonate with the energy of the seven main chakras – the energy centres of the body. All of the chakras must be balanced and operational for your physical and emotional well-being.\nSo your health will be achieved and maintained by balancing these energies. In colour therapy, it is possible to re-balance and/or stimulate these energies by using the appropriate colour. This course is ideal to complement any existing therapy skills you already have or to incorporate it as a healing therapy itself. Please note there is a small admin fee payable if you are a Udemy Personal Subscription, Free Trial or via Udemy for Business student to review your assessment from the course and issue your certificate.\nOur easy to learn modules include:\nIntroduction to your Fully Accredited Professional Colour Therapy Course\nYour Training Manual\nLight & Colour\nThe History of Colour Therapy\nColour Psychology\nThe Aura\nThe Astral Body\nColour Therapy Methods\nAccreditation\nAnd much more!\nThis is a Professional Diploma Course that is fully accredited by CTAA - Complementary Therapists Accredited Association.",

You will also be able to watch NLP in action through professional video demonstrations.\nIf you want to make a real difference in the lives of your clients, NLP is the most powerful, practical and in-depth tool you can learn, and you can start right now!\n\n\n\n\nSO, WHO ARE WE?\nThis course is taught by 3 instructors in the fields of NLP and life coaching.\nNLP Trainer David Key was the very first Association of NLP (ANLP) Accredited Trainer in the world and is a pioneer in the field.

Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\nThe course also has a thriving Facebook networking group.\n\n\nIf you are or want to be a LIFE COACH, we have a CBT Life Coach Certification version of this course available, which you can enroll in instead.\nTransform Your Life using CBT: Cognitive Behavior Therapy Techniques and Tools.\nDo you ever feel stuck, like you know what you want but you just can’t get yourself to take action?\nDo you ever feel like your thoughts, your emotions, or your life are out of your control?\nHave you ever made irrational decisions you later regretted?\nAre you tired of self-sabotaging or procrastinating?\nDo you have an inner critic that is always putting you down, telling you you’re not good enough, and beating you up for mistakes you make?\nAre you tired of holding yourself back because you’re afraid of failure?\nHave you ever had the sinking feeling that you are your biggest road block that is stopping you from living the life you really want?\nIf you can relate to any of these things, you are not alone.\nThe human mind is the most complex machine on the planet. It is what allow us to paint masterpieces, build modern marvels, make scientific discoveries, and learn through online courses like this one. But, unfortunately, our minds don’t come with an instruction manual. Most people never reach their potential because their machines—the most powerful tool they will ever have—inherited faulty programming. But, it’s not their fault—they were never taught how their mind works or how much power they have to create the lives they want.\nYou were probably never taught that you have the ability to change ANYTHING about yourself—your level of intelligence, your talent, your abilities, your personality.\nYou were probably never taught that you have the ability to control your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors., and you certainly weren’t taught how (CBT can teach you how).\nYou may have been told you could be or do anything you wanted when you grew up, but you never believed it. You were surrounded by people who settled in life, who were unhappy, who were dysfunctional and who, unfortunately, passed the beliefs and patterns of thinking that got them there onto you.\nNow you’re grown up and you have a million thoughts that run through your mind that make you doubt yourself and believe your dreams aren’t possible (CBT can help with this).\nLike most people, you’ve got a monkey mind that’s always negative and distracting you from creating the life you want. Well, it’s time to give your monkey mind a banana. This course is the banana! And, it’s also the human mind owner’s manual you never knew existed.\nIn this course, you’ll learn how to use cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT, on yourself. CBT teaches us that our thoughts create our emotions and influence our behavior. We can learn how to have greater control over our thoughts, and therefore, we can have greater control over our emotions and our behaviors.\n\n\nIn this course you’ll learn how to reprogram your mind with these CBT techniques.\n·        With CBT: You’ll learn how your thoughts and emotions work and how to identify why you think and act the way you do. You’ll develop self-awareness so you an stop negative thinking in the act and retrain your monkey mind to think more positively.\n·        With CBT: You’ll be able to stop self-sabotaging behaviors and bad habits\n·        CBT will help you: Stop stalling and overcome procrastination\n·        CBT will help you: Get yourself to take those actions you’ve been putting off in only 5 seconds\n·        CBT will help you: Make decisions more rationally, including feeling more confident making hard decisions\n·        With CBT you will: Stop the incessant worrying and silence the inner critic\n·        CBT will help you: Overcome fear and resistance that is holding you back\n·        CBT will help you: Manage anger, cope with stress, and minimize anxiety\n·        CBT will help you: Feel more peaceful and optimistic\n·        CBT will help you: Stop feeling out of control and take back your power\n\n\nSo, are you ready to transform your life by taking back control of your mind and emotions? If so enroll now, we look forward to seeing you in the course!\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.\n\n\nSo who are we?\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera.

Do NOT enroll in both.\n\n\n\n\nLife truly is what we make of it. The stories we tell can either liberate us or enslave us.\nThe most powerful transformation your can offer your clients—as a life coach, a counselor, a speaker or a teacher—is to help them rewrite the story they tell about their lives and who they are.\nWe are all natural story-tellers, but our life stories are more fiction than fact. We believe they are real, but they are muddied by our interpretations, the people who influenced us, our limited memories, and the meaning we ascribed to each event. Usually, these stories are unconscious; they are deeply ingrained into our psyche through years of repetition. We tell stories about who we are and what happened to us. We tell stories about others, We tell stories about life.\nBut these stories aren’t who we are. Most of them aren’t even true. We continue to tell them out of habit. And continuing to carry them around will perpetuate those stories into our future.\nBut, it doesn’t have to be that way—for you OR for your clients!\nStudies have proven that even subtle tweaks to our story can shift our attitude, improve our self-confidence, and redirect our futures. We may not be able to change the past, but we can change how we see it, the story we tell, and therefore how it affects us and who we become.\nYou may have clients with tremendous potential and drive, but who seem to be held back by limiting beliefs, low self-confidence, and a persistent life story that keeps them stuck in a rut or returning to the same life scripts over and over again. By helping them change how they view their past and re-write their life’s story, you will help them envision a compelling future and see current and future challenges as opportunities.\nThe activities and tools you will use to transform your life are based on a foundation of neuroscience, psychological principles, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Transactional Analysis.\nThis course provides everything you need to:\nCreate a complete life coaching package on Rewriting Your Life Story\nReceive an official certification as a Life Story Coach\nUnderstand the psychological principles behind people’s life stories, beliefs and narratives\nUse proven, step-by-step tools and strategies with your clients to help them re-writing their stories, release limiting beliefs, and empower their self talk\nUse principles and exercises from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Transactional Analysis to help clients change life patterns\nThis course is taught by three experts in the fields of life coaching, personal development, psychology and psychoanalysis. Our varied experience and perspectives add depth and variety to the program.\n\n\nSo, are you ready to transform your life and the life of those you serve through proven strategies that will help them change their life story? If so enroll now, we look forward to seeing you in the course!\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.\nThis course is presented by 3 instructors:\nInstructors Joeel & Natalie Rivera run Transformation Services, Inc in Florida, United States. They have over a decade in the life coaching field. They have a background in social services, psychology, education and as entrepreneurs. Joeel has a Masters’ in Counseling and is completing his dissertation for his Ph.D. in Psychology, with a focus on happiness.

      "description": "This course is meant for anyone who wishes to learn about the inftroductory 48 EFT Techniques used by many Clinical EFT Techniques Practitioners today and how to incorporate them with sound, reiki and any modality the student may be already using and all geared toward facilitating the student in achieving a good quality of life.\nFocus is given on practicing more than just theory, as it's in the practice that most people fail.\nThis course is great for autistic people and or victims of narcissistic abuse, including those who have had to deal with such issues since a young age or even the fetus stage of early life.\nBecause this course has been created by an autistic Reiki Master Teacher you will notice the teaching style is quite different than what courses created by neurotypicals instructors offer.  Neurodiverse minds may appreciate this course and the directness of the instructor whose intention is only to help and never to shame.\nEstablishing a daily routine that is both enjoyable and effective is key to being able to put these techniques to full effect.\nWith 44 plus years of direct exposure to different healing modalities this course offers insight in more than just EFT Techniques and ties into many other aspects of our daily lives often overlooked in other courses.\nThe content will be continuously updated  and expanded as the needs of the students and the times require.\nThis course should facilitate the student who is new to EFT Techniques or to Reiki or to Sound Healing in finding new ways to use different modalities together in a more organic manner.\nReiki Level 1 and 2 attunements will be offered to those interested with the purpose of self-healing only. To become a Reiki Practitioner there needs to be a course dedicated to it but here we will cover the basics and all needed to get started on oneself and their pets/plants/food.\nAll content covered in this course is intented as informational and helpful and not to shame anyone.  Many people get triggered by vegan talk so if you are one of those people we urge you to avoid the section where the vegan content is touched upon and we urge you to ignore any parts that may be triggering to you as none of this was ever intented to shame or belittle anyone in their own personal journey. I share information that can help in the healing journey but it's up to the students what they do with it.\nSelf-soothing in an effective manner is key to living a great life, whether we are still living with narcissistic abuse or other issues this course will show you how we can use all negatives in our life to propel ourselve forward in our healing journey.\nThis course delivers the knowlege and real life experience from someone with 44 plus years exposure to all kinds of healing modalities and in a manner that can be accessed by any level of knowledge and memory level.\nWhat are you waiting for?",

      "description": "This course will teach you the basic Remote Viewing protocols developed by the United States Military to turn regular “off the street” people how to become psychic spies. We’ll take your natural intuition that society has told you to ignore and give you confidence through positive response based affirmation. Thereby imprinting verifiable intuitive data on the mind, the same way muscle memory is created in Martial Arts, sports or Ballet.\nYou’ll also come to understand that “Thinking” and “Knowing” are truly “counter-intuitive.”\nThe only known quantum computer in the Universe is the human brain. It receives over 20 million bits of information every single second, yet only processes 15 thousand bits per second. We spend the vast majority of waking state editing out that information. It’s why people are so very tired at the end of the day, even working a desk job. The level of concentration used, just to block the massive amount of data streaming into the brain, is hard work.\nWhat is all that other information?\nEverything you’ve ever wanted to know about the past, present or future. The Universe is a gossip that wants to tell you anything you want to know, you just have to know how to listen and ask the right question. Just like doing a search on Google, ask one way and get over a million different answers, ask the same question a different way and *poof* what you want to know comes up.\nHowever, in this case, you and your brain are Google.\nIn this course you’ll learn how to know anything about a person, place, thing or event anywhere in space/time.\nHere you will discover how to take your natural intuition and “turn it up to 11” through the scientifically proven skill.\nCommit a weekend to train your brain, like others train for the Ironman race, and your mind will start to work for you in ways you never realized were possible.\nDownloads provide you with all the material you'll need to print out.\nBring a BLACK pen and your intuition.",

Michael Hall last August 2018 in Manila, Philippines.\nAs a Communication Model, NLP provides the premises, guidelines, and tools for modeling the structure of subjective experiences.  This design enables those who train Master Practitioner and those who complete this level of training to engage in the process of modeling which is what innovates new patterns and models.  We will use the modeling tools inherent in the Meta-States Model and the Matrix Model.  The intention is to train people in NLP and Neuro-Semantics who can model experiences of excellence and by doing so, innovate new models and patterns in the coming decades.\nThis  course answers the questions \"How do they do it?

What to expect:\n30 day full money back guarantee, no questions asked\nWeekly educational announcements, mostly blog posts, on how our brain works and its impact in our daily life.

We were not taught and the behaviour, relationship we build with money dictates our experience and outcomes.\nBuilding wealth is an automatic behaviour which depends on what beliefs we have about money, what mindset we are operating from. Our money mindset is the feelings and thoughts we subconsciously developed towards money from our past experiences.\nRecent research in psychology and neuroscience have uncovered reliable strategies that people can use to create financial freedom.\nThis course keeps things simple by highlighting 15 simple things that you start doing to improve your financial level. Everything you're about to learn comes from documented, peer-reviewed research in psychological science.\nThis course is in four parts.\n1. Understand money - What is money, where does it come from.\n2. Money management - development of skills, qualities, understanding saving and spending.\n3. Money mindset - what are our beliefs, feelings and thoughts and how can we change negative beliefs about money to a more positive one.\n4. Building wealth - create strategy, learn how to build wealth by offering a service, pursuing your passion, by investment.\n\n\n“What you habitually think largely determines what you ultimately become. One will never get any more than he thinks he can get.” – Bruce Lee\nIf you think you are only capable of earning £2000 a month then this is what you will earn. If you think you can earn £10000 then this is what you will earn.",

      "description": "Assertive people ask for what they want and don’t let others either intimidate them or enrage them. They speak up to express their needs and desires. They hold true to their internal power and the little voice inside that asks to be heard. They speak calmly and diplomatically, carefully and firmly, without offending reasonable people. They comfortably say “no” when they need to, without belittling or insulting others.\nAssertive people are neither passive nor aggressive. Passive people know they need assertiveness training to find their voice and not allow others to take advantage of them or dismiss them. They need help finding ways to stand up for themselves and be heard!\nAggressive people don’t usually think they need assertiveness training because they believe they get their needs met just fine. The thing is, aggressive people roll over others, bullying them into submission. Even if they cover their aggression with humor, they bully others without concern for other people’s feelings or needs. This isn’t okay either. Aggressive people need help finding ways to be more respectful of others during moments of conflict, and to behave appropriately.\nThis course helps both passive people and aggressive people find their voice within the appropriate expressions of assertiveness. It helps passive people find the strength to speak up, and it helps aggressive people stop bullying.\nThe material for this course comes entirely from science. Investigators and researchers have spent their lives examining assertive communication and how it differs from both passive and aggressive communication. That’s one thing that makes this course different from the others out there. It’s not about the instructor’s individual perspectives at all, but tested and proven strategies and techniques.\nAnother thing that sets this course apart from other assertiveness courses is that we are not interested in why people are passive or aggressive at all. In fact, communication research says that for some people these characteristics are in their DNA while for others it’s in their conditioning. We simply don’t care about that. We only care about the communication behaviors that make assertiveness happen. We start with definitions about assertive communication and how it differs from passive and aggressive communication, then work through many ways that assertiveness can show in your communication behaviors. Exercises help reinforce your learning and give you practice for when certain situations arise in your real life. Quizzes make sure you’re following along properly.\nSo stop getting walked on, and stop walking on people to get your way! Learn assertive communication and improve your own well-being and communication appropriateness. Just a couple of hours can change your life for the better. Becoming more assertive is just a matter of learning what that looks like. This course shows you how!\n\n\nEnroll now and start today!",

I really liked the division of this course and the way this course is designed and there is so much information and encouragement in this course. The fact that the creators encourage you to write books, even if you never thought you are a writer material is really revolutionary. The positive side of having money is another revolutionary idea for me. The way section on mediation is designed is really wonderful. I feel I have the strength to try meditation which I have been putting off for years. I felt the section on Morning routine lacked details. Wanted to know how to start the morning routine from scratch and for a person who has accumulated all the bad habits in the world. In the end would like to say Great course and must take for everyone.\" - Vaneet Aggarwal\n\n\"they have kept me interested, that is the most important thing right now.

      "description": "NOTE: Our Effective Communication Skills Master Class course has just been upgraded for 2024, with a new structure, fresh content and new videos, an upgraded workbook, and End of Module tests so you can monitor your progress. And it's still aggressively priced at Udemy's lowest tier so you're not paying a premium for top training!\nDo you feel that people sometimes don't \"get\" your message?\nDon’t you agree that better communication skills will improve everyone’s lives?\nThis course shows you what drives effective communication: what's important for the many different ways in which we interact – whether face-to face, phone, written or digital.\nAnd whether in business, at home or with friends.\nYou get a workbook with an Action Plan (downloadable from the short “General Introduction” module at the start of each course). This enables you to take your own notes, then revisit and review your progress in a structured framework that's proven to work.\nAnd we don’t waffle! No-one wants to sit through hours of over-explaining before they get the knowledge they need? What's the point of a long course if it rambles?\nSo we make sure that everything is covered in easy-to-follow video lessons, and we get to the point so you make the best use of your time.\nThe course teaches you:\n· How Communication Works – Learn the basics, the rules and look at your own style.\n· How to be an Effective Communicator – Review your self-image, your opinions, objectives and preconceptions.\n· Questioning and Listening Skills – Look at verbal skills, how to ask questions and listen, and how to use active listening.\n· Face-to-Face Communication – See what you need to do, by being positive, creating good impressions and following our rules for success.\n· Telephone Communication – What’s good and bad about the phone, how to get the most from it, and how to overcome challenges.\n· Written Communication & Social Media Basics – Learn how to use a concise, simple, three-stage structure, and how to set up an effective social media profile.\n· Overcoming Communication Problems – See how to deal with barriers, with conflict and opposition, and deliver difficult messages.\n· Getting Better Outcomes – Learn about assertive communication, where and when to communicate, and follow best practices to get what you need.\nUpon completion (and with a little practice…) you'll be able to give and receive communications in a way that improves the clarity and effectiveness of the way you deal with people.\nCourse Reviews from Udemy Customers\nThere's nothing like customer reviews to see what other people think!\nSo here are a few, all from Udemy customers:\n\"A really good start for self assessment on personal communication skills and where to start to improve.\" Sergiu U\n\"Awesome!

      "description": "Our education system is such that it teaches us about chemicals and organisms that we hardly encounter in our life. And it fails to educate us about something we experience every day, every hour of our lives: Emotions.\n'What do i do when i feel extremely angry/ guilty/ sad/ anxious', is something we have no answer to.\n\n\nSociety teaches us to suppress, ignore, deny emotions and run away from them. Phrases like “be strong” “don't cry like a kid” have instilled the belief that emotions are not good and make you vulnerable. And yet these emotions keep influencing every decision we make, and every step we take.\nThese distressing emotions, when not correctly processed, become a root cause of all major issues, like obesity, sleep difficulties, relationship conflicts, and also physical diseases.\nBut when you learn how to cope with distressing situations that trigger emotional reactions, you see its effect in every aspect of your life. Relationships improve, you feel energetic and motivated to work, you sleep peacefully and surprisingly, many of health disorders also seem to vanish.\nSo, in this course we take a step ahead towards breaking this unhealthy belief and the corresponding patterns of behaviour. We will break down the old conditioning about running away from emotions and learn how to embrace them as a natural part of us. We will learn how to face them, in a way that positively impacts health, relationships, vitality and productivity and helps you live a fuller, more satisfactory life.\nWhen there is inner harmony,  its reflected in outer success and overall well-being\n\n\nAfter the course, you will be able to:\nIdentify and label emotions\nUnderstand people better and be more emphatic and compassionate\nHave a better control on your unwanted emotions\nMake better decisions in all areas of life\nRelease old buried junk of emotions\nFeel more energetic and full of life\nSee a drastic improvement in your physical health and a boosted immunity\nKnow exactly what to do, when an overwhelming emotion engulfs and over-takes you\nUse EFT for yourself.\n\n\n“The emotionally intelligent person is skilled in four areas: identifying emotions, using emotions, understanding emotions, and regulating emotions.” — John Mayer and Peter Salovey\n\n\n“What really matters for success, character, happiness and life long achievements is a definite set of emotional skills – your EQ — not just purely cognitive abilities that are measured by conventional IQ tests.” — Daniel Goleman",

How can we help these clients to reach a deeper level of relaxation and focus and to reach that alpha and theta state?  How can we help them to have a session that is fulfilling? Techniques to reach a deeper level of trance, relaxation or focus are called deepeners.\nEncountering situations where clients can't get into the relaxed state of mind, the hypnotic state, which we call the alpha and theta state, can be challenging for the practitioner. Every Quantum Healing practitioner or hypnosis practitioner will encounter these situations sooner or later. Having extra tools to cope with these challenges will help the client and the practitioner. This course is to help practitioners feel more confident and help them guide their clients safely and gently.\nIn this course, you will also learn how to facilitate surrogate and group sessions and learn more about online sessions' do and don'ts.\nA basic understanding of hypnosis or quantum healing is needed to use this 'toolbox'.  This course is ideal for those who have just started their journey in quantum healing or hypnotherapy.\nIf you have taken my course 'Quantum Healing for All' on Udemy and want to continue learning and developing more skills, this may be the course for you.

      "description": "We are the World’s number one provider of Self Development and Arts Therapy Courses, with more than 180,000 students in 192 countries.\nYou will have everything you need to be up and running your own company, including all the resources necessary to be a successful life coaching h and stand out from your competitors.\nStart up your own life coaching business, the complete life coach package\nThis life coaching course is the second in the series of life coaching courses by Libby Seery, which are designed to help you train as a professional life coach and start your own life coaching business.\nWhat life coaching looks like is not something that is set in stone, but rather an area of constant development.\nThe modern life coach, is not about accumulating various qualifications, in fact the modern life coach doesn’t need any qualifications.\nWhat you do need is an array of skills, and this start up your own life coaching business course has been designed, to teach you all the skills you need, to be able to set up your own practice and have it running in a matter of weeks!\nWhatever your level of coaching ability is at the moment, advanced, intermediate, or a complete beginner, this start up your own life coaching business course will provide you with everything you need, to start up your own coaching practice.\nAs long as you can help someone commit to the work necessary to make a change in their lives then you can do the job.\nLife coaches are almost universally entrepreneurs. The burden is on them to find work and sustain a business based on providing life coaching services. This means that a successful life coach must not only master the art of life coaching itself, but must be an effective marketer, consultant and business manager.\nEverything has been covered in this start up your own life coaching business course, and to help you achieve success in this amazing profession. This start up your own life coaching business course, has been designed with every aspect of coaching in mind, nothing has been left out. Taking this course will provide you with everything you need (even if you’re new to coaching) to start your own life coach practice, in as little as a few weeks. Previous clients have set up their own coaching businesses, with less than $50.\nThis is by far the simplest, cheapest and easiest time in history to run a life coaching business. In this modern internet-age you can do without a lot of the hassle and expenses of running a small business that were a definite hurdle in the past for an aspiring entrepreneur.\nEstablished life coaches are gaining substantial financial and personal rewards for their hard work. In this internet age there is also a world of possibilities for life coaches who can develop a strong personal brand and create online content that will either draw in clients or become a source of revenue by themselves. Preferably both.\nThis means that a modern life coach also needs to understand internet marketing and the role of social media in growing your own life coaching business.\nGenerally traditional life coaching consists of complimentary consultations followed by regular support sessions. Some of these sessions are face-to-face, but the majority will be via phone, Skype or email.\nHowever, someone looking to build a flourishing and sustainable life coaching business may also find themselves performing minor variations on the core process of life coaching on a one-on-one basis.\nFor example, you may provide short seminars to groups of people or have shorter one-on-one sessions, but have them with a greater number and variety of clients.\nIn this start up your own life coach business course, these are exactly the skills you will be learning. After you have completed this course you will be firmly on your way to establishing yourself as a life coach. Ready to get out in the world and make a difference to someone.\nSome of the things I’ll teach you include:\nWhat you do and do not need in order to run a life coaching business.\nThe various ways in which you can source business for your coaching practice, including Social Media, Networking and General Marketing\nHow to market your services to the outside world\nI’ll teach you professional consultation skills.\nWe’ll also cover all aspects of internet based life coaching, as this is a rapidly growing area of the modern life coach, and you’ll need the ability to communicate cheaply and easily with anyone anywhere in the world. This is not just limited to sending each other text-based messages, but also includes high-quality face to face video communication.\nWe’ll also be discussing work life balance in your career as an independent life coach.\nThis start up your own life coaching business course, also provides you with several coaching models, which are all tried and tested coaching methodologies.  All coaching models, come with examples of case studies, so you can see how they work in different scenarios.\nHere's the course syllabus:\nIntroduction To Life Coaching\nWhat Does A Life Coach Do\nDiversity As A Coach\nIs Being A Life Coach Right For Me\nYour Coaching Toolkits\nResources To Use With Your Clients\nResources: Making Changes, Breaking Habits, Motivation and General Life Coaching\nResources: Career\nResources: Health, Well Being, Anxiety and Stress\nResources: Relationships\nResources: Self Esteem and Confidence\nResources: Assertiveness\nDoes My Client Need Counselling Rather Than Coaching\nI’m A Coach Not A Therapist\nFundamental Differences\nHow Can I Tell If My Client Needs Therapy Rather Than Coaching\nCovering The Basics\nA Refresher on The Basic Skills of Coaching\nLife Coaching Basics: Listening\nLife Coaching Basics: Questioning\nBeing Client Centred\nThe Clean Language Model - Using Case Studies\nThe Clean Language Model\nClean Language Questions\nClean Language Examples and Developing Questions\nSequence and Source Questions\nUsing The SMART Model - “Coaching Mary”\nCase Study: Using The SMART Model\nSpecific Goal Setting\nApplying The Specifics To Mary\nMeasurable Goal Setting\nMeasuring Mary’s Goals\nAttainable Goal Setting\nAre Mary’s Goals Achievable?\nRelevant Goal Setting\nTimely Goal Setting\nApplying The “T” To Mary\nUsing The TGROW Model - “Coaching Jenna”\nThe TGROW Model in Practice\nExploring The Topic\nCoaching Jenna: Part 1\nSetting Specific Goals\nCoaching Jenna: Part 2\nAssessing Reality\nCoaching Jenna: Part 3\nExploring Options\nCoaching Jenna: Part 4\nWrapping Up and The Way Forward\nWrapping Up With Jenna\nWorking For Yourself\nRunning A Coaching Business\nWhat You Don’t Need To Run A Coaching Business\nWhat You Do Need To Run A Coaching Business\nWhere Do I Get Clients\nStrategising Your Marketing\nHow Can I Source Business\nContent Marketing\nGood Old Fashioned Networking\nProfessional Consultation Skills\nHow Much Should I Charge?\n21st Century Coaching\n21st Century Coaching\nCoaching International Clients\nLooking After Yourself!\nAll Work and No Play\nStaying Healthy\nConclusion",

      "description": "This course covers almost all the important topics in Transactional Analysis, everyone would expect in a course on TA 101.\n\nThe entire course is in easy to understand, simple language with a lot of real life examples that participants could personally relate with and understand. Our goal is to take the use-values of this wonderful subject called TA, to the people at large, all over the world.\nBy attending this course, you will respect the fact that every single individual is OK and he or she has personal worth and dignity.\n\nTransactional Analysis will help you to understand your internal mental states and how they lead your life in any given situation.\nYou will be aware of your 3 Structural Ego States : Parent, Adult and Child.\n\nYou will be able to make the best use of your 5 Functional Ego States and in appropriate ways : Critical Parent, Nurturing Parent, Adult, Free Child and Adapted Child.\nBy using your ‘Transactions’ effectively your communication will become much more fruitful.\n\nThis course will show you the pathway to think, feel and act appropriately in all walks of your life. Using the expected, appropriate, parallel and complementary ego states, you will be able to connect with people and improve your relationships and friendships.\n\nYou will move your ‘Psychic Energies’ to suit your wants and needs and in appropriate ways.\n\nYou will be aware of the Pleasure Principle, Morality Principle and the Reality Principle and the roles that they play, to keep you in balance at all times.\n\nYou will understand your mental blocks called ‘Injunctions’ and you will give yourself the necessary permission to overcome them.\n\nYou will be able to identify your NOT OK ‘Life positions’, if any, and start moving towards OK-OK relationships with people around.\n\nYou can rewrite your Autobiographical ‘Life Script’ to become a Winner and gain Autonomy.\n\nYou will be able to identify your favorite ‘Drivers’ – ‘Be Perfect, Be Strong, Try hard, Hurry up, or Please Others’ - that drive your life. Even though they appear to be superficially positive, you will not allow them to drive your life anymore.\n\nIn any problem situation you will immediately recognize the ‘Drama Triangle’ getting woven around you and stop playing your part as either ‘Persecutor, or Victim or Rescuer’.\n\nYou can catch yourself in the act of playing ‘Games’ that result in negative feelings for everyone involved and decide to lead your life ‘game-free’.\nYour ‘Frame of Reference’ to ‘Self, Others and the World’ would be moving towards betterment to enhance the quality of your life.\n\nYou will be aware of the Discounting process you use to Discount your ‘Self, Others and the Situations’ on hand and stop them. You will be able to identify the ‘Existence, Significance and Solvability’ of your problems and use your ‘Personal ability’ to solving them.\nYou will become aware of your ‘Racket Feelings’ and strive to get connected with your ‘Authentic, genuine feelings’.\nYou will stop collecting negative feelings in the form of ‘Stamps’ and throw away all your earlier collection of Stamps also.\nYou will not be ‘Symbiotically dependent’ on anyone nor would you permit others to remain dependent on you by making use of your full complement of ego states.\nYou will rearrange your Time Structure to ‘Withdraw, play Rituals, use Pastimes, get into Activities, stop Games and develop Intimacy’.\nYou will give ‘Strokes to others abundantly, Receive Strokes happily, work in a way that fetch you Strokes, ask for Strokes when you deserve them, and give yourself Strokes for jobs well-done’.\nOverall, you will be able to understand your own self from a higher platform, you will raise your bar and change your life path willingly for your own good. As a natural consequence, people around you in the family, office or society would also be all the more happier.\n\nAs we have said earlier, TA is a systematic psychological tool for Personality development and your personal and inter-personal well-being.\nDisclaimer:\nIts a course purely for self development, improving communication skills and interpersonal relationships. It does not have any counseling or therapeutic applications. For psychological issues you are directed to contact professionals in the field.\n\n\nWhat you’ll learn : You/will\nWill move towards Autonomy and be a winner.\nWill understand the ego states of yourself and people around you\nWill communicate positively and\nWill respond to people by coming from the expected ego states\nWill understand your mental blocks, the life positions that you have taken.\nBecome aware of the your life script written by you\nUnderstand how your Script runs your present life at an unconscious level.\n\nWill be in charge of your life and stop being driven by your 'Drivers'\nStop playing negative roles in your life drama.\n\nStop playing non-productive, negative Games\n\nChange your frames of references about people and the world\n\nStop discounting Self, others and the situations.\n\nAcknowledge your problems, their significance, solvability and your personal ability to solving them.\n\nRe-connect with your genuine and authentic feelings.\n\nStop collecting negative Stamps.\n\nRe-arrange your time structure to suit your specific needs.\n\nGive and receive a lot of strokes to your Self and others.\n\nBe a Winner as an autonomous person with awareness, spontaneity and intimacy.",

Turning your goals from the previous Module into an actual visual representation of your dream life. I’ll show you how you can make both a physical Vision Board and a digital one for your desktop or phone, so you can continue to manifest your goals ‘on the go’.\nMODULE 3 - IMPLEMENTATION\nSo you’ve created your Board, now what? This is what a lot of the ‘fluff’ trainings out there don’t teach you and is the main reason why Vision Boards haven’t worked for you before.\nIn this Module you’re going to learn to implement some daily habits while using your Vision Board, to help you remain in a state of momentum, confidence, power and positivity so that you can achieve every goal you’ve set.\nMODULE 4 - ELEVATION\nThis is where you take your manifesting process to the next level!\nYou’re clear on your goals, you’ve created your Vision Board and you’ve been implementing the steps so it’s actually a useful tool and not just taking up space on your wall, now it’s time to supercharge the effects of your Vision Board with some powerful and practical manifesting techniques and understand how to get your Board working for you over and over again!\n\n\nBy the time you have gone through the course, you will have a system that you can use again and again to manifest ANYTHING you want into your life.",

      "description": "Neville Goddard was a teacher and lecturer during the mid-20th Century who taught that imagining creates reality.  He put out a challenge to anyone that would take him up on it... name one thing in this world that didn't first begin in imagination.  It took me a while to consider what he was saying, but I couldn't name a single thing that wasn't first conceived in the mind of man.\n\n\nHe then said to test him by his understanding of what he called \"The Law,\" and find out for yourself if it be true, that the Law can be used to manifest your objectives, desires, and dreams.   Well I took him up on his challenge and to my amazement my life completely turned upside down... in the most wonderful way!  This class will document some of the highlights of what exactly did happen, many of which some would call \"miracles,\" exactly how I did it using \"The Law,\" and I'll train you in the fundamental technique by which it operates.\n\n\nThose of you who already know Neville know exactly what I\"m talking about.  If you are unfamiliar, or even a skeptic, then you owe it to yourself to at least be familiar with his work.  Neville's books and audio recordings have graced the personal library of at least two former United States Presidents who no doubt we enriched by his teaching.  All of his material is free online, and I encourage you to read it for yourself.\n\n\nI've absorbed hundreds of hours of Neville's books and lectures, both audio and written, and applied The Law with fervent persistence.  This class is the effect of what I've personally realized through experience, and I must say it is the most life-giving and powerful content I've come across.  By all means read Neville for yourself.  He is a treasure trove of knowledge!  I've taken the essentials of his teachings and techniques and boiled them down for you here.\n\n\n\nThis class is meant to introduce you the student to the basic essentials of how imagining creates reality in a practical and accessible way.  You will experience both teaching and \"hands on\" training as you learn to apply The Law for yourself.  I stripped down the essence of Neville's teaching into five simple steps that anyone can use.  I also site personal case studies that document some of the amazing results of proper use of The Law.  Some of these manifestations many would call \"miracles,\" and I provide the actual documentation as evidence to substantiate my results.\n\n\nAs an aside, this course does not delve deep into the theology of Neville or myself.  While there is some reference to the Bible and very surface level knowledge of the latest in quantum physics, this class is not meant to explore these areas but rather reference them in the light of imagining creating reality.\n\n\nLastly, in this course you'll get some fun and effective imaginal exercises that you can use to strengthen your imagination.  Think of me as your personal mental fitness trainer :)  We'll also walk through the entire Neville technique in application, and wow is it exhilarating and powerful!\n\n\n\nI am in this to give you the best of what I've experienced in my 40 years of life thus far.  This teaching and training is transformational in nature, and I highly recommend you approach it with that sense of reverence and expectation.  If you are not completely satisfied with the course I'll gladly refund your money, no strings attached.  I want to enrich your life, not take from it.\n\n\nNow, without further ado I give you \"Imagining Creates Reality.\"  Buckle up and enjoy the ride!",

Those who are not LGBTQ+, may feel unfamiliar with some of the language used, and may also have misconceptions about LGBTQ+ people. On the other hand, those who are LGBTQ+, may want to use this course as a reference in their professional lives.\nThe goal of this course is to give course participants a good starting place for creating more welcoming and inclusive environments for their co-workers, clients, friends, and family. While this course was specifically developed focusing on issues related to LGBTQ+, the overarching theme is that we are all different, and we have to respect each other’s differences and boundaries, in order to create a warm and welcoming space for people around us. By the end of the course, we will see one theme emerge: people come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, and we have to understand how to interact with others who are different from us.",

      "description": "Long ago, before rational thought became the lens through which we saw the world, there existed a perception, and a knowing, which was rooted in something far deeper, within our collective imagination...the serpentine force of creation.\nThe serpent force was understood right across the ancient world. Although perhaps no other place, or time has grasped such a profound understanding of the serpent mysteries, as Kemet (Ancient Egypt). This wisdom ensured Kemet endured for millennia as the light of the ancient world...'The Light of Egypt'.\nWhat we call Kundalini Yoga, which I learnt in India in 2005, was practiced in some form, in the land of Kemet, long ago, and was known as Sema Tawi (Kemetic Kundalini Yoga). At the heart of this practice of ancient wisdom, was the Uraeus serpent, known as the Kundalini Shakti force in India.\nWe shall explore these ancient teachings, in order to guide the serpent of light up through your spine, so your mind’s 'Eye of Horus' can shine bright once more, thus elevating your state of consciousness. It will enable the full activation of your light bodies, ready for interstellar travel.\nKemet was famously the birthplace of Alchemy, which was brought to mankind by Thoth (Hermes Trismegistus) which has continued, largely in secret through the dark ages, to this day in the West. Far more though, than turning lead into gold, it is a powerful path to the illumination of the soul, known to the Ancients as the Akhet, activated by the embodiment of Horus Consciousness. It is time to unveil this ancient knowledge.\nYou will learn about the importance of Sacred Geometry in activating the light bodies and serpent power, leading to the full activation of your Merkaba.\nYou will learn the ancient Sacred Science of the Djedi Priesthood (Wizards), and how our bodies are encoded with the keys to the stars.\nThrough your initiation into this forgotten Secret Science of Projection, you will learn how to open up an inter-dimensional Stargate.\nYou will enter the sacred initiation chamber and portal of the King's Chamber, in the most advanced Star Temple ever created, the Great Pyramid of Egypt. There, you shall uncover the mysteries of Isis and Osiris. Riding the back of the Uraeus Serpent, you will Shamanic Journey to the star systems of Orion and Sirius.\nYou will meet the old Gods of Ancient Kemet known as the Neteru, and share in their timeless wisdom.\nThis will teach you the Lost Art of Resurrection: All the ancient cultures, as well as tribal and shamanic cultures today, say the same thing about death...nothing really dies, death is simply a change of clothes.\nIt is your birthright to know, at the core of your being, that you are immortal.\nThis is an invitation across time and space, stirring ancestral memories from long ago, unlocking your hidden potential to elevate our consciousness back to the stars, where we all come from.\nAre you ready to embark on this mission to reclaim your Galactic Heritage?\n\nIf so, then brave Star Traveller, I salute you! I shall see you in the course.\n\nEnrol NOW!",

This can make a person’s professional life to become difficult to manage.\nVictimhood Thinking\nPeople who experienced childhood trauma often engage in negative self-talk and self-blame for their predicament.

Childhood trauma may also cause a person to struggle with romantic relationships in adulthood.\nLiving the False Self\nIf you suffer from childhood trauma, you are likely to bury your emotions and lose touch with your real self.

      "description": "This enlightening training offers a journey into the depths of your mental landscape, giving you the tools to enhance your mental health and achieve inner peace. Instead of focusing on traditional calming models, this course dives into the wisdom of ancient philosophies, merging them with psychological insights to refine the art of mindful living.\nThis training is designed to help you achieve crystal-clear clarity on the accuracy of your thoughts and focus. Instead of engaging in deep breathing or emptying your mind, you'll learn to direct your attention intentionally and think with precision. Through this course, you will learn about your psychological make-up, and how knowing this can enhance your mental health.\nThis training course explores crucial life questions, including: What is the connection between mindfulness and mental health? How do our beliefs shape our daily attitudes? How can we build emotional resilience to better handle life's challenges? Where do we draw the line between mindful living and controlling our thoughts and feelings? Is personality fixed or changeable?\nOur aim is not to persuade you into any particular belief system but rather offer a new perspective, with an aim of elevating your self-awareness. The course will provide ample opportunities for introspection, guiding you on how to take responsibility for your thoughts and actions. It will help you understand the power of cultivating inner peace through mindful living practices.\n\n\nThe following are some of the topics you will learn during this course:\n-  The human psychological makeup and its impact on mental health & wellness\n-  The relationships between mindfulness, self-knowledge and mental wellbeing\n-  How to reflect on truths and reality opposed to opinions, belief and perception\n-  The role of acceptance and responsibility in strengthening emotional resilience\n-  How to incorporate disciplined practices into your daily routine for inner peace\n-  The difference between controlling thoughts or feelings versus accepting them\n-  Strategies for managing stress, anxiety, and other emotions with self-discipline\n-  Ways to shift focus from negative thinking patterns to positive and helpful ones\n-  The characteristics and traits that enable personal growth and inner resilience\n\n\nStudents will explore their thought patterns, challenge limiting beliefs, and align their worldview with their core values. With expert guidance, you will develop the skills to build emotional resilience and manage stress effectively. Transform your mental state from chaotic worry to focused clarity, empowering you to engage with the world purposefully and with intention.\nThrough enlightening lessons, reflective exercises, and real-world examples, participants will gain the knowledge, wisdom and skills necessary to guide others towards self-discovery and personal growth. They will learn how to move beyond merely agreeing or disagreeing with theory, and instead reflect upon it to evaluate the value of its presence in the history of the field.\nThe wisdom, skills and knowledge you'll gain through this training are not just theoretical – they are practical and applicable to the real-life situations you'll encounter day-to-day. Throughout this training you will naturally develop a deeper knowledge of yourself, and consequentially increase your ability to build strong relationships, overcome career life and daily struggles.\nOur training materials are captured in HD video, accompanied by an MP3 version of the course, and supplemented with PDF resources to enhance your learning experience. The course is available on-demand, providing a comprehensive framework to contextualize your studies and establish a strong foundation for sharing your newfound life-knowledge with others.\nⓘ This training is part of a broader 28-course Achology curriculum.

      "description": "What are Affirmations?\nAffirmations are specially designed positive statements, spoken repeatedly to influence your mindset and empower the affirmer. Affirmations help improve mental strength, introduce new positive ideas, reinforce existing positive ideas, all in the hope of creating positive outcomes. They also help focus the mind on positive thoughts and outcomes.\n\n\nAffirmations increase Your chances of getting the outcomes You truly desire and sometimes NEED to reflect in Your world or the world around you.\n\n\nPlease note, Affirmations are used as a part of a wider approach in striving towards a desirable life. It is also a process and requires dedication, discipline, adaptability and flexibility.\n\n\nAffirmations are NOT a replacement for taking action.\n\n\nThey are to support you in getting to solutions for issues you face in life. They help:\n1). Empower the Affirmer that they can engage with the issues at hand\n2). They help reframe the problems to make less overwhelming\n3). They support the affirmer toward solutions\n\nNot all affirmations are suitable for everyone. They are fundamentally circumstance driven and need to be adapted to address the specific areas one is looking to improve for the associated outcomes.\n\n\nThis approach should improve the quality of life, for yourself and those around you.\n\n\nThe Affirmations in this course should serve as prompts, reminders, a guide or leads but can also be used verbatim.\n\n\nI would encourage you to also develop your own Affirmations and make them more personal. It is the best way to get outcomes associated with the practice of Affirmations.\n\n\nWho are they for?\nThey are for everyone and anyone. Whatever the situation or circumstance, there are suitable affirmations. If NOT, you can create them. The beauty is that they can be constructed by anyone who needs them, including You.\n\n\nWhy?\nAs the world seems to be a complicated space, being able to inject some form of influence or more control into our lives.\n\n\nDo they work?\nAffirmations help get people in the right mindset, one which they have designed, to work towards better lives.\nThey are seen as a much needed channel for individuals to attempt to influence their own lives in the direction they want.\n\n\nSome people attribute their successes to the practice of Affirmations.\n\n\nWhat aspects of Life can these be applied?\nThey can be applied to ALL aspects of life.\n\n\nIn this course, we'll focus on four big aspects, with sub-sections. These are:\na). Affirmations relating to Finances, Money and Wealth:\n- Work, Income, Self Employment, Business will also be included\n- Retirement, money management are also included\n- The strength and focus to do all of the above as well as other ideas to live a life full of good financial decisions and wealth\nb).   Affirmations relating to Health and wellbeing:\n- Sleep, rest & replenishment\n- Food, eating & eating habits\n- Mental health and wellbeing\n- Increased activities - movement & exercise\n- Abundance in health triggers\n- The strength and focus to do all of the above as well as other ideas to live a healthier life\nc). Affirmations relating to good relationships, interactions and networks\n- Romantic relationships\n- Family Relationships\n- Friendships and support networks\n- Work, professional relationships\n- Wider society\n- The strength and focus to do all of the above as well as other ideas to live a life full of healthy relationships\nd). Affirmations relating to Exams and other Assessments\n- School exams\n- Professional Exams\n- Exam preparations\n- Assessments\n\n\nI look forward to sharing my experience and knowledge about Affirmations and You learning on this course.\n\n\nThis will help transform your life.\n\n\nBest regards,\nBaba",

      "description": "How to Create Mind-Blowingly FAST Transformations (With Less Effort, Less Time & Sessions That Guarantee Results)\n\n\nImagine this…\n\n\nNo more hoping your clients get the results they paid for.\nNo more endless sessions, homework, audios, or tasking that clients never complete.\nNo more refunds, excuses, or clients walking away unimpressed.\n\n\nInstead, picture transforming a client’s entire life in a single session.\nPicture charging premium rates for results that are faster, deeper, and more reliable than your competition.\nPicture your clients walking out the door in shock, saying: “How the hell did you just do that in under an hour?!”\n\n\nThat’s what this masterclass is about.\n\n\nWhy Most Therapists Fail (And What You Can Do Differently)\n\n\nIf you’ve ever asked yourself:\n\n\n“Why do some clients transform… while others stay stuck?”\n“Why do I sometimes need 4–12 sessions for a single problem?”\n“Why do some clients come back saying it didn’t work?”\n\n\n…you’re asking the right questions.\n\n\nBecause here’s the thing: it’s NOT about trance, regression, or fancy language patterns. Every therapist is using those.\n\n\nThe secret is knowing how to guarantee results—every single time.\n\n\nThat’s what Milton Erickson did. That’s how I helped lawyers quit smoking on their lunch break (and charged $1500 for just 45 minutes). That’s why my clients—whether lawyers, athletes, celebrities, or everyday people—got guaranteed transformations while other therapists needed 3, 6, or even 12 sessions.\n\n\nAnd now, I’m giving you the exact system I used.\n\n\nWelcome To:\n\n\nHow To Create Mind-Blowingly FAST Transformations In Less Time, Fewer Sessions & With Less Work—That GUARANTEES Results\n\n\nInside this advanced training, you’ll discover my biggest industry secret:\n\n\nThe “Advanced Testing Cycle” that locks in breakthroughs permanently\nHow to deliver transformations that stick—no matter the client or problem\nHow to shrink 30-day packages into a single session (and still charge full price)\nWhy less work, fewer sessions, and faster results = MORE referrals, income & authority\nHow to end refunds, complaints, and “average” results forever\n\n\nThis is the exact process that built my multi-6-figure hypnotherapy business by age 22, got me endless referrals, and made me the go-to therapist in a competitive market.\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\nIf you’re sick of:\n\n\nWorking too hard for too little\n\n\nHoping results “stick”\n\n\nClients not being blown away…\n\n\nThen this program is your shortcut to becoming the hypnotherapist that clients beg to see, pay top dollar for, and rave about to everyone they know.\n\n\nSee you inside.\n\n\n– Scott Jansen\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: You acknowledge and agree that: We are not accredited by any governing body, nor are we a registered training organisation and any outcome of taking part in an Online Course will not be considered a qualification, including any certification we provide to you; our Online Courses are available for purchase worldwide; however, we do not warrant or represent that the Content will comply with laws in the country you live and/or operate your business; we do not guarantee any particular outcome or benefit as a result of participating in the Online Course; and it is your responsibility to comply with all laws applicable to you, and you are solely responsible for the outcomes resulting from any implementation of the Content or learnings from the Online Course, when dealing with your patients.",

      "description": "The biggest obstacle to people learning Tantra is the belief that they need a partner to learn first or a lover willing to practice with them. We can not attract a partner for Tantra with us until we have began healing and expanding ourselves. This video course will give you a strong foundation to real Tantra exercises that will create self-growth in numerous ways by the end of the lessons. The lessons are divided in the 9 segments of practices. We do not do philosophy or history.  Practice will be needed... but it will be fun, rewarding, and healing. You will be given the gifts of feeling energy, being sharper of mind, having less mental chatter, fitter, and using energy to be multi-orgasmic. Whether this is a 30 day self-growth program for you or an introduction to further Tantra, you will have an understanding of Tantra having done hours of exercises. The lessons are taught with detail but straight to the point.\nNumerous hours of additional resources are available. The instructor has taught hundreds of students in-person who came to Tantra for all reasons possible.\n\n\nAsk Debra Wilder questions: Private messages and community discussion questions are all answered to assist you.\n\n\nPlease read all of the descriptions of the videos. There is misinformation of Tantra being just tantric techniques. In this course, you will finish with a well-rounded base of knowledge and experience. It covers all of the main aspects of Tantra which have been divided into nine segments- the 9 B's. Tantra is far more than is taught to the mainstream or mistaken in the news or by misleading teachers.\nThis course is mostly about solo Tantra which is what Debra specializes in. A few partner practice options are added.\nKey exercises you will learn: Meditations, yantra, mantra, mudra, bandha, solo cultivation exercise, gazing, breathing exercises, yoga asanas, energy balance, chakra sound healing, initiation meditation, abstract meditation, and more.\n\n\nEven if you walk away wanting to only continue one segment then the course will offer benefits worth trying.\n\n\nIt would take 1,000's hours of video to learn all of Tantra and an in-person teacher to do certain things safely and correctly. This course teaches you a full well-rounded practice foundation. We do not stop at meditation or philosophy.\n\n\nThis course will not cover \"advanced\" or dangerous practices that should only be done with in-person guidance. It offers all you need for a great base of practice with intuition to go in your correct direction of further studies.\n\n\nThis course is designed to be easy to follow without being overly time-consuming. After completion, you will be able to decide which of the practices (or all) are right for you to continue weekly and daily. This is for everyone: singles, coupled, LGBTQ+, and even those on celibate break.\n\n\nMost people will need to do the course lessons multiple times to feel the full benefits of energetic practices. Some will have a breakthrough the first time. The goal is to feel explosive energy in the spine or hands or the whole body. The esoteric system takes experience should not have a goal. Bliss will come.\n\n\nThis is a course to do many times with practice not just once through. Practice more to understand and feel more.\nAnswering of questions by messaging is included in 2024.\n\n\nAbout the teacher:\nDebra has been a Tantra teacher for 14+ years first trained in India. She is honored to be able to teach here online so that she can share the benefits of Tantra with more people. She offers intermediate teachings on her SoloTantra website.",

I already want to do it over and over again. There were some moments really deep and moving. The anchor will stay with me, help me, and provide me with self-confidence in my life. I'm infinitely thankful.\" - Nicoletta\n\"Lovely practice. I really resonated with each and every one of these affirmations. I let them wash over me and flow through me, rather than repeating them all, but I felt them take hold of my imagination and settle comfortably into my mind as the way things now are, just as they should be.\" - Rebecca\n\"I have no words to explain the joy I felt in this meditation. Thank you. Namaste.\" - Margaret\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE WITH ME\nInternationally Certified Therapist helping clients all over the world achieve the life they want to live\nMeditation Teacher - 44,000+ Plays on Insight Timer (#1 Free Meditation App for Sleep, Relax & More)\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL ACHIEVE WITH THIS COURSE\nWelcome to the course that will teach you how to become the person you want to be by using practices of Neuro-Linguistic Programming and Neuroscience. You are here because you probably already have some ideas on how this course can help you.\nNow think of people you know who are genuinely happy and at peace with themselves. In a moment I will tell you a little secret on what all those people have in common. But first, let me tell you what's special about this course.\nThe first unique feature of the course is that in this journey you will learn the best ways to become who you dream to be, without having to read hundreds of books or study for years how the mind works. That’s because I already selected the best lessons for you from years of studies, practice, and experience.\nThe second special feature is I won’t only share knowledge with you. In every lesson, we will also experience a new practice together.\nI’m Fabio, the founder of Mindflow, the first Adaptive Meditation App. My whole life I have been passionate about the human mind and obsessed with understanding why people do what they do. Most importantly I was curious about how to shape the mind into a better version of itself. A long time ago my mentor told me something that shaped forever the way I see people’s minds - “Hacking has more to do with psychology than computer science.” Ever since I’ve studied neuroscience, Neuro-Linguistic Programming and Hypnotherapy for years, practicing those learnings with hundreds of people in my journey across the world as I became a coach and a therapist.\nI promised I would have shared a secret with you. What do all happy, fulfilled, and peaceful people have in common? I studied the profiles of more than 200 world-class successful spiritual leaders, business people, and athletes to realize they all mastered one simple thing. They knew themselves deeply and managed their own minds and emotions. But simple is not easy. This is why I made this course. To make it easy for you to learn these precious skills and transform your mind and yourself to be free to live the life you want to live.\nNo pre-requirements are necessary other than keeping an open mind.\nYou can take a look at the introduction video to better understand if this course is, in fact, the right one for you, and I will see you in the first session to start your new life.",

Constantly fatigued? Low energy? What about dealing with stress or anxiety? Depression? Extreme physical or emotional pain? All of this can be debilitating.\nWe have so many new challenges that all of us are facing in the world and without the right tools, life can just be overwhelming. Self-healing is an important part of your life journey. Essentially, you doing self-care and focusing on you is a form of self-healing. Our bodies need self-care consistently to lead a well-balanced, happy life.\nSelf-healing is an ongoing process. When you have lived through traumatic experiences, that can change the way you think, live, work, and grow. It can stifle your creativity, rob you of your joy, deplete you of your passion, and steal your happiness. That said, you are the one in charge of your life. Self-healing can be as simple as taking the time to have a mindful moment. Do you want tips, tools, strategies, and choices to completely transform your life?\nThis Self-Healing Coaching Course is designed for both coaches and individuals who want self-healing practices in their life. Tasha Ina Church, an Empowerment and Self-Care Coach on the island of Maui invites you to virtually join her in the Hawaiian Islands as she walks you through self-care & self-healing shooting in areas all throughout Maui. For over 20 years, she has dedicated her life to empowering others through Empowerment Self-Defense. Over the last 12 years, she has tapped into the important component of self-care through self-healing and has seen how transformative it is. It is her belief that you have the tools you need to drastically improve your life if you are willing to dedicate yourself to that work. Tasha also believe you are deserving of the process and the end result. When she started enhancing three key areas of her life, it had a profound effect on her mental and emotional state of being and it has helped her deal with chronic pain as well. These four areas are:\nBreath-work & finding your voice\nMeditation & Visualization\nSomatic Movements & Stretching Exercises.\nAlong with Self-Care for Self-Healing and Reflection\n\n\nWe can’t control the world but we can control how we move through it. We can control ourselves, our mindsets, and our positive thinking.\nThis course offers people multiple tips, tools, strategies, and choices surrounding the three categories above. Have you always wanted meditation to work but the way you’ve been doing it has been ineffective? What about breath-work or stretching?\nIn this course, Tasha provides a new roadmap in navigating different styles of self-healing based on my own experiences and that of her clients. What you will learn has the capability to support your overall health and well-being. It is research-based & evidence—based. There are several activities, along with guided and independent work. The workbooks offer insight and reflection on how the activities themselves felt and how your body responded to each activity.\nWe are so excited for you to participate in this Once-in-a-Lifetime course!\nLearn Self-Care & Self-Healing in some of my favorite spots in the Hawaiian Islands!",

      "description": "Welcome to the course on Success Habits which will help you develop a growth mindset and ultimately achieve your meaningful goals.\nMy name is Vladimir, and I will be leading you through the course. I work as an agile product manager, I’m a certified Project Management Professional, and I’ve been always fascinated by how people become successful.\nWhile success is a multifaceted concept, and I should not oversimplify it, what I’ve learned through the years is that our positive habits are a key factor in achieving success and personal growth.\nIn this course, I want to present 10 positive habits, that’ve been helping me on the journey to achieve my goals. Even though those habits are not a secret and are common sense, they are not always common practice.\nAnd to give you an example of some of the habits – reading, taking action, goal setting, dealing with failure, pushing the boundary of your comfort zone in a healthy way, self-reflection and discovering your reason why, hard work, more.\nYour task will be to cultivate these habits and make them second nature to you.\nHow do you do that? By repetition.\nTo achieve a goal, we need a new behavior and to move from a new behavior to a habit, we need repetition.\nLet’s start small, let’s be consistent and once you do that, once you cultivate these good habits, I strongly believe, your chances of success, be it financial, health or relationships will skyrocket.\nWhat do students say about Vladimir's course?\n\"I have made an amazing experience with that course. It has helped me in many areas of my life, especially about reading: I will not read anymore for entertainment, I will read for knowledge. Thank you!\" - Anthony Pierre\n\"This is a course that Compiles important habits to become successful and it is GOLD! A great reminder to achieve what I want in life. I have re-watched the lectures, especially lectures 1-4 a few times already. I'm surprised that this course is not receiving that much feedback but it is certainly useful for me. Keep it up!\" - Jeremi\n\"This is one of the most beneficial courses I've ever enrolled. The instructor made it so easy to listen to it while walking on the street if you don't have the time to watch with your eyes on the screen. I really enjoyed that content here because the course can be taken in less than 2 hours which makes it simple and useful.\" - Hadi Ghamloush\nDo I have a guarantee?\nBy enrolling in this course, you get a 30 days money-back guarantee.\nThat's enough time to go over the material and apply some principles to get results.\nIf for any reason (you don't have to explain) you are not happy, you can request a refund.\nI’m waiting for you inside the course, my name is Vladimir, and remember – stay purposeful",

      "description": "Kundalini energy is often depicted as a serpent, coiled three-and-a-half times around, resting at the base of the spine. This serpent represents the journey of the mind from human consciousness to cosmic consciousness. You rise up to the highest realms to connect your energy (Shakti) with pure consciousness (Shiva) to unite as one. This is called ‘The Dance of Shiva and Shakti’. Your mind and being are flooded with divine light, and you gain access to a vast intelligence.\nThe purpose of awakening the Kundalini energy is to purify and prepare your body, mind, and spirit to welcome the Divine into your life and then embody and express that divinity in every moment.\nWhen Kundalini energy is awakened, you become an observer. You recognize the illusions, and drama is replaced by a deep sense of peace; you are continuously aware of your center and your stability. You’ll feel more empowered and confident than you ever have before.\nIn this course, I will guide you through the fundamentals of yogic philosophies. I also share my personal experience with Kundalini awakening so that you may know what to expect and better understand your own experience.\nAwakening your Kundalini energy truly is a life-changing experience and is not for the faint of heart. Yes, it can bring you a sense of peace, joy, and even bliss but it is also an intense experience. It’s a rebirth, and because of that I feel it’s my responsibility to prepare you for that before you set out on this journey.\nI know I keep using the word ‘experience’ but it’s so much more than that. If you’re simply seeking an experience, I don’t recommend you take this course - but if you’re serious about awakening, knowing and living your purpose, and living a life filled with health, balance, confidence, and love, you’ve come to the right place.",

We have two instincts that we continually want to be satisfied, this is to feel included and to feel important. When we feel invisible, unappreciated and insignificant it cuts to our very core. We long for connection.\nThis course gives you the principles, skills and philosophy necessary to break out and connect comfortably and meaningfully. This course will show you how to insert yourself into others lives so that connection and making friends become second nature. I know that this is possible because I went through a period of time where I was shy. Now I’m free, connected and fulfilled. I love me and others genuinely. I believe loneliness is one of the primary reasons that there is so much suicide in the world today. Practicing these principles and skills might not only free you but also assist others in the most meaningful way.\nOften, all you need is good information and then to apply and practice what you’ve learned to be  highly successful.",

What processes and procedures would you want to use to ensure that your project was successful?\nNow ask: What if you treated the next year of your life as a project?\nA few years ago I was at the lowest point in my life: deep in debt, just out of a divorce, and a single dad. My business was failing – along with the economy – and I didn’t know how I’d ever recover from my self-created mess.\nI needed something, anything, to back away from the edge and get my life moving in a new direction. I believed that all I had was project management. I held that assumption because I’d written five books on project management, delivered project management seminars for over a decade, and consulted for organizations across the globe.\nSo I asked: What if you treat the next year of your life as a project? It was a challenge to press on, an opportunity to learn and to grow, and a commitment to try just one more time.\nI’m not a psychologist, a Zen guru, or some New Age zealot. I’m a man that’s learned and applied some universal truths to get what I want into and out of my life. If I can do it, you can too. Let me show you how.\nIn this hands-on course you will learn how you can treat your life as a project. You’ll create requirements, project plans, discover immediate actions to execute, identify the constraints that are anchoring your ambitions, and much, much more.\n\n\nEarn 8 PUDS:\nWays of working: 3\nPower skills: 5",

How to Start Journaling for Personal Growth teaches you everything you need to get started with a journaling practice that will deepen your self-awareness and enhance your personal development.\nStart Journaling Today with This Comprehensive Course\n\nLearn everything you need to get started with journaling today\nDiscover different types of journaling to invigorate your practice\nIdentify the journaling techniques that will deepen your personal development\nExplore your inner world through regular journaling, and find out how to revisit old entries for greater insight and awareness\nTransform your journaling insights into real-life change\n\n\nA world of information and potential at your fingertips\n\nA regular journaling practice comes with many benefits, including improved physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. In a busy, hyper-connected digital world, most of us are more externally focused (and less internally connected) than ever. As a result, we can lose touch with our values, desires, emotions and needs, leaving us feeling lost, unhappy and directionless.\nJournaling helps us deepen the most important relationship we'll have in our lives: our relationship with ourselves.\nStarting and sticking to a regular journaling practice can be challenging. Many people know journaling will be good for them but they don't know where to begin. This course is designed to answer your biggest journaling questions, provide you with all the guidance you need to get started, and introduce you to several journaling techniques that are specifically helpful for personal development and growth.\nCourse overview\n\nYou'll start by learning the answer to fundamental questions like \"What is journaling?\" \"How do I journal?\" and \"How often should I do it?\" You'll also learn more about the different tools you can use and what to do if you're worried about privacy. You'll discover how to make it as easy as possible to get started with your journaling through rituals and the right kind of environment.\nYou'll move on to cover some of the main types of journaling and learn how to use these types in your own journaling practice. Then, you'll focus specifically on journaling techniques for personal growth. You'll also have the opportunity to try these with a series of journaling challenges.\nFinally, you'll discover how to return to old journaling entries and find the gold in them. As well as looking at different ways to explore your old entries, you'll learn how to take your insights off the page and into the real world. You'll also find out how to overcome some of the most common challenges journalers face before moving forward with your journaling journey.\nBy the end of the course, you'll have clarity around how to use journaling for personal growth, 10 techniques in your journaling toolbox, deeper self-knowledge and self-awareness, and a roadmap for turning your insights into real-life change.",

      "description": "This enlightening training will delve into how the principles and practices of Neuro-Linguistic Programming can boost your personal productivity and fuel your personal growth. Through NLP techniques such as reframing, visualisation, and goal setting, we can learn to identify limiting beliefs that may be holding us back from achieving our full potential.\nNeuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is an approach to communication, personal growth, and psychotherapy that focuses on the connection between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic), and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming). It has been widely utilised in various fields such as business, education, sports, and therapy.\nOne of the fundamental principles of NLP is self-awareness. By becoming more aware of our own thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors, we can gain a better understanding of ourselves and how we interact with the world around us. This self-awareness allows us to identify areas for improvement and make positive changes in our lives. This is what you will learn in this course.\nNLP, or Neuro-Linguistic Programming, explores the impact of language on our thoughts and actions. By recognizing language and behavior patterns, we can foster positive changes in ourselves and others with greater ease. This exploration aims to equip students with a nuanced understanding of 'change dynamics', tailored to help students apply all that they learn.\n\n\nSome of the key concepts covered in this course include:\n- A framework for understanding emotions and creating positive states of mind\n- Strategies for setting clear, achievable goals and overcoming unhelpful beliefs\n- The role of self-awareness and insight in enabling personal growth & development\n- The influence of language on our thoughts, worldviews, beliefs, and behaviors\n- Visualisation as a basis for goal setting, future forecasting and action planning\n- The relationship between our mental representations and everyday experiences\n- Communication skills for building rapport, managing conflict & influencing people\n- Applications of NLP in varied areas of life, such as business, education & coaching\n\n\nBy embedding NLP principles into daily practice, you can develop strategic approaches to problem-solving, heighten your emotional intelligence, and foster a mindset geared towards growth and achievement. From this course, these foundational concepts will serve as a springboard for more specialized disciplines that boost personal productivity and development.\nThrough enlightening lessons, reflective exercises, and real-world examples, participants will gain the knowledge, wisdom and skills necessary to even guide others towards self-discovery and personal growth. They can learn how to move beyond agreeing or disagreeing with principles, and instead reflect upon them to evaluate their relevance in the context of their life.\nThe wisdom, skills and knowledge you'll gain through this training are not just theoretical – they are practical and applicable to the real-life situations you'll encounter day-to-day. Throughout this training you will naturally develop a deeper knowledge of yourself, and consequentially increase your ability to build strong relationships, overcome career life and daily struggles.\nOur training materials are captured in HD video, accompanied by an MP3 version of the course, and supplemented with PDF resources to enhance your learning experience. The course is available on-demand, providing a comprehensive framework to contextualize your studies and establish a strong foundation for sharing your newfound life-knowledge with others.\nⓘ This training is part of a broader 28-course Achology curriculum. It comes with a full 30-day money back guarantee, so if you're not satisfied, you can get a refund with no questions asked.",

Little can replace the experience of one-on-one coaching, but this self-directed GROW model course is a comparable alternative at a fraction of the price of a single coaching session.",

These include questions for reflection, open-ended questions that can help you deepen your experience, and a journal to track your experiences during the course and beyond.\n\nContents and Overview\nYou’ll begin this course by generating collective mindfulness by reciting the name of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. This will prepare you for the exploration of the energies of the Buddha.\n\nAfter learning about mindfulness, concentration, and insight, you’ll discover the concept of co-being. This will set the foundation for other Buddhist philosophies, including the Four Noble Truths, the Three Jewels, and karma.\nThe third section of the course is focused on mindful walking, so you’ll explore walking meditation to transform your experience and generate the energy of mindfulness.\nYou’ll also discover the power of sitting and how to generate mindfulness not only within yourself, but also as a part of your community, to transform and heal yourself and others.\nFinally, after you’re comfortable with generating the energy of mindfulness in your physical body, you’ll be ready to explore the exercises of mindfulness practice for your mind and emotions.\nYou’ll understand how positive and negative seeds within you become weaker or stronger with mindfulness.\nBy the time you complete this course, you’ll have a mindfulness practice that you can use daily to strengthen the connection between your mind and body, and between yourself and others.\nYou’ll be able to work with your emotions and your mind in a healthy, productive way, and embrace each moment with clarity and peace.",

      "description": "This course has one simple goal: elevate the way you speak to be more articulate so that people want to listen to what you have to say. Our society is facing an epidemic of poor communication skills. Our vocabulary is vague and sloppy, our conversations littered with “ums”, “you knows”, and “I feel likes” and our thoughts are predictable. We speak the same set of 1000 words and can't break out of our stale word cycle into the realm of verbal freshness or originality!\n\n\nYet even with our language deficiencies we still deeply reverence for power of words. Why are motivational speeches among the most sought out YouTube videos? Why does our culture become so captivated with those individuals who are able to make sense of the unfocused ideas and disorder that occupies our minds? Why do we find quotes on every social media grid, in every garden, in every garage? Because we understand words to have power. And the people who can harness this power to articulately express themselves typically attain better satisfaction and opportunities in their personal, professional, and intellectual lives.\n\n\nThat’s why I created BetterSpeak (now hosted here on Udemy!). I believe a better world is possible where people embrace language as the superpower that it is. To be clear, this is not a public speaking course. I’m not teaching how to eradicate nervousness, eliminate your accent, develop charisma, control body language, or master conversation. Rather, you will learn to upgrade your vocabulary, prune filler words and empty language, diagnose sources of poor language in your life, speak more figuratively and poetically, and see how history's greatest orators have employed these same techniques.\n\n\nI hope you would consider joining me in learning the art of articulate communication. To the adventures ahead!",

They create visions, set goals and even make plans. But it doesn't take long for something familiar to creep in:\nThe same doubts.\nThe same fears.\nThe same patterns.\nThe same weight of their past.\nThey remain stuck because they are setting goals as the person they’ve always been.\nEvery goal, every decision, every step they take is filtered through the lens of their old identity — the one shaped by past patterns, limiting beliefs, and the stories they’ve told themselves about who they are.\nWhen you (or your clients) believe these stories, you act as though they’re true — no matter how much you want something different.\nThis is where the power of Future Self Coaching comes in.\nFuture Self Coaching isn’t just about deciding what you want your future to be. It’s about transforming who you believe you are before you even start. It's about releasing the chains of your old identity and living fully as your future self who already has it all.\nFuture Self Coaching operates on the idea that the future self you dream of -- the one with clarity, confidence, and success -- they aren’t far away! They already exist. Right now. Inside you. It's not about chasing transformation or becoming someone better... it's about embodying that person, today.\n\nThe Future Self Life Coaching Certification teaches you how to help others stop striving and instead, start thinking and living like the person they are meant to be.\n\nBased on the cutting-edge psychological research from Dan Gilbert and Dr. Benjamin Hardy, you will learn:\nFuture Self Psychology: The foundation of future-focused coaching.\nIdentity-Based Transformation: How to shift clients’ core beliefs and behaviors.\nFuture-Focused Decision Making: Help clients act as their future selves.\n10x Vision Framework: Create bold, transformative goals.\nIdentity Shifting Techniques: Tools for rapid breakthroughs.\nRapid Breakthrough Methods: Turn identity shifts into lasting success.\n\n\nMeet Your Instructor: Kimberly Rich\nKimberly is a TEDx speaker, High Performance Coach and the host of Transformation Academy's The Profitable Coach Podcast. As the head coach from TA, Kimberly has led countless group coaching experiences that have helped hundreds of current and aspiring coaches step into their full coaching power.\n\nKimberly is also the Creator/Host of The Bold Life Movement Podcast - where she shares inspiring stories of common people doing uncommon things.\n\nShe firmly believes the bolder you are, the better your life is, and is passionate about helping as many people as possible to create life on their terms.

As this is not a live face-to-face course the nearest we can get to application is through Case Studies and discussion points in lectures that are then examined in the Q/A. There are students from 200 countries on my courses - just think how many in-depth discussions there can be in the Q/A if the Instructor encourages this!\nThat is why there are Case Studies especially written for this course.\nThis is a course about counselling, communicating, discussing, learning and applying.\nIs this more work for the student?\nYes - applying what you have learnt is more work - but it cements what you have learnt in lectures.\nIs this more work for the Instructor?\nOf course!  Questions posed, solutions, suggestions, discussions - these are all encouraged. I am an teacher/Instructor/lecturer by nature and I know that real learning (which is what teaching is -the art of causing learning) is through interactive discussion. Not quizzes.

Our individualized consciousness perceives the Divine as different sets of qualities. The ancient traditions have described 7 sets of divine attributes, called the 7 Sacred Rays and Flames.\nThe Sacred Flames are the energy of the divine attributes that we can call upon, that we can invoke to bring divine qualities and flavors to our reality. There are more than 7 rays, as we are living in Times of Ascension and transformation, but the 7 main Rays are the one that are already anchored on earth, so they are easy to call upon. Easy doesn’t mean they are not powerful!\nThe 7 rays and Flames are:\n1. The Blue Ray of the Will of God\n2. The Yellow Ray of Illumination\n3. The Pink ray of Cosmic Love\n4. The White Ray of Purification and Ascension\n5. The Emerald Green Ray of Healing and Manifestation\n6. The Ruby Gold Ray of Resurrection\n7. The Violet Ray of Transmutation\nIn this class, you will:\n· Learn what are the rays, and to which ones you are connected according to your day and time of birth.\n· Receive the Initiations of the 7 Rays and Flames.\n· Discover how to use them in your daily life.\n· Be able to anchor them in any sacred site.\n· Discover the connection between Rays and Gemstones.\nThe 7 Rays and Flames can help you to bring new divine qualities to your life, they can help you to heal, to overcome obstacles, to find solutions, to open your Heart Space, to transmute any negativity into Light, and so much more.\nThey can improve your meditation practice, your healing skillset and change the way you perceive reality.\nTo understand what Rays are influencing our lives will help you to know more about your Soul missions and about the way you relate to the world.\nThis is a powerful class. This is a gift from the Divine.\nAre you ready for this journey? Are you ready to become more and more Who you truly are?",

Anyone at any level can learn these skills, which is why it has been simplified. the idea is to get the best results out and maximum implement ability. Communication skills are an acquired skill set and much needed to be able to be successful today. While the medium is English, the same principles apply to all languages. But one has to keep an open mind to learning and sometimes unlearning before we make changes to our existing ways. It’s a mindset. I have trained young people in their late teens just out of college and I have conducted workshops with people who have been working in organisations for 25 years and the same rules apply to them.\nSometimes even people who have lived a certain way, need to learn that change needs to be made for them to grow as individuals and as professionals. Practice makes perfect and as you learn the basics and start to implement them, you will get better at learning to communicate more effectively with better and far-reaching results. Keep practising, alone or with someone to point out what needs to be corrected.\nSo let's begin our learning.",

      "description": "Why is it that some people are able to achieve so much success - in their personal, professional, social lives - whereas so many others are struggling? For example, when two people commit to a goal - say, to go to the gym and lose weight, why does one of them manage to follow through, and the other one doesn’t?\nWhat are successful people doing differently from the failures? How are successful people thinking differently from the failures? Are successful people wired differently from the rest of us? Is success simply encoded in their DNA? Or is it something else? And the more important question is: How can we get access to the magic ingredient that successful people have and add it to our own lives so that we too may experience more success in our lives?\nThis short and practical guide will inspire you to rethink how you set and achieve your goals. In How Successful People Think Differently you will learn:\n\n•Why successful people say “I don’t” instead of “I can’t”\n\n•Why successful people never suppress their desires - and what they do instead\n\n•How successful people think smart\n\n•The “if-then” strategy that triples your chances of achieving success\n\n•The type of thinking that makes successful people successful in the first place\n\n•Why The Secret is setting you up for failure\n\n•The wrong (and the right) way to visualize your goals (this alone will be worth the price of the book!)\n\n•The right (and the wrong) type of thinking that either sets up you up for success or failure\n\n•Simple, and sometimes surprising, success principles to help you achieve your goals\n\n•And a lot more...\nIn the last 100 years, science has made remarkable progress in unlocking the secrets behind successful people. Science has uncovered just how successful people think differently and how successful people think smarter than the rest of us. Unfortunately, a lot of this great, life-changing research is hidden inside dense, boring, hard-to read academic literature.\nFortunately, I’ve gone through that research for you - and in this success course, you’re going to be getting access to life-changing tools and strategies that are scientifically-proven to help you achieve your personal and career goals, whatever they may be.\nA lot has been written about goal setting, achievement and success. A lot of this advice sounds good but is not very useful, such as “Never give up. Think positive. Take risks”. This short and fun course provides you with practical tools that you can use to change your thinking and change your life.\nLearn the science of success, and apply the success principles in this program to set and achieve your own goals, whatever they may be. Some success principles will provide validation of what you already think to be true (but didn’t have proof for), whereas other principles will surprise.\n\nHere’s the promise: All these principles are simple to apply, and if you apply them to your life, you will begin to experience more success in all areas of life.\n\nHow do I know?\n\nBecause I have proof (inside!)\n\nJust one idea in this course might be the inspiration and the spark of change you are looking for...just one idea can change your life.\n\nNow, does that sound good?\n\nThen enroll in the course and let’s get started.",

      "description": "This course, is meticulously crafted to empower individuals by equipping them with the tools and insights needed to silence the persistent voice of doubt and nurture unshakable self-confidence. It is a transformative journey aimed at unlocking each participant’s full potential, enabling them to face challenges, showcase their talents, and navigate life with newfound ease and assurance.\n\n\nThe course begins with a comprehensive introduction to the nature of self-doubt, exploring its roots and manifestations. Participants will delve into understanding how self-doubt stems from fears of making mistakes, stress, perfectionism, or even past emotional trauma. Through relatable examples, such as those of skilled individuals like Sarah and Mark, participants will see how common and universal these feelings are, and they will begin to recognize similar patterns within themselves.\n\n\nMoving forward, the course provides a deep dive into cognitive distortions—those sneaky mind tricks that often lead us down the path of self-doubt. Participants will learn to identify and challenge distortions like self-criticism, magnification, and black-and-white thinking, thereby acquiring the power to navigate their thoughts more consciously. This section of the course is crucial for enabling individuals to break free from the grip of distorted, negative thinking and embrace a more balanced and positive mindset.\n\n\nAnother pivotal aspect of the course is the focus on reframing negative self-talk. Participants will be guided through exercises and techniques to challenge and replace these undermining thoughts with positive, constructive alternatives. This includes understanding the three C's—comparing, criticizing, and complaining—and learning how to counteract these tendencies. By becoming self-aware and disputing negative thoughts, participants will gain a clearer, more affirming perspective of their abilities and worth.\n\n\nThe course also introduces the transformative power of positive affirmations. Participants will learn the science behind affirmations and how these simple, yet powerful, statements can reshape their thoughts and beliefs. Through repeated use, affirmations help create and strengthen new neural pathways in the brain, fostering a more positive and confident mindset. The course provides guidance on crafting personalized affirmations that resonate with each participant’s journey and goals.\n\n\nA significant portion of the course is dedicated to cultivating a growth mindset. Participants will explore the differences between a fixed mindset, which limits potential, and a growth mindset, which embraces learning and development. Through practical steps, individuals will learn how to shift their mindset, embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and improvement.\n\n\nVisualization techniques are another key component of the course, offering participants innovative ways to set and achieve their goals. From goal pictures and mental rehearsals to vision boards and visualization triggers, these techniques empower individuals to envision their success and work towards it with confidence and clarity.\n\n\nThe course also emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries as a means of building self-confidence. Participants will learn to establish personal, mental, and physical boundaries that protect their well-being and enhance their self-esteem. This includes understanding how boundaries foster respect and clarity in relationships, allowing individuals to take control of their lives and interactions.\n\n\nMoreover, participants will explore the crucial role of positive influences in building self-confidence. By surrounding themselves with supportive and motivating individuals, participants can foster an environment that encourages growth, challenges self-doubt, and reinforces their self-worth. This section of the course highlights the value of mentors and role models as powerful sources of inspiration and guidance.\n\n\nFinally, the course addresses maintaining confidence during adversity. Participants will gain strategies for navigating life’s challenges without succumbing to self-doubt, learning to take things one day at a time and build self-efficacy. Real-life examples and actionable steps will be provided, equipping participants with the resilience needed to face setbacks and emerge stronger.\n\n\nThroughout this course, participants are reminded that building self-confidence is an ongoing process. Each day presents new opportunities to apply the lessons learned, face challenges, and celebrate victories. By the end of this journey, participants will have a robust set of tools and a stronger sense of self-assurance, empowering them to conquer their self-doubt and embrace their full potential.\n\n\nIn essence, \"How to Crush Self-Doubt and Build Self-Confidence\" is more than just a course; it is a transformative experience that empowers individuals to rewrite their stories and become the confident, unstoppable people they aspire to be. Whether you're grappling with self-doubt or simply looking to bolster your confidence, this course is your roadmap to lasting personal growth and success.",

      "description": "Tempted to Give Up? Here’s How to Keep Going\n\nIf you browse through the interviews with some of the most successful people on Earth, you’ll find one common piece of advice shared by virtually all of them:\n\nThey never give up on their big goals.\n\nResearch shows that grit is a better predictor for success than any other factor. The ability to keep going despite setbacks is more important than your IQ, character or other external factors like your upbringing or surroundings.\n\nBut what does it really mean to “never give up”? What exactly is grit? How do you persevere when faced with larger than life difficulties? How do you keep going when you’re at the brink of exhaustion and all your hard work hasn’t been rewarded yet?\n\nI created this course to explore the subject of persistence from a more scientific point of view than cliché self-help sayings. I want to share with you how exactly to stick to your goals according to peak performers and science – not vague motivational advice that assumes we have unlimited strength once we’re motivated enough.\n\nHere are just a couple of things you will learn from the course:\n\n- A crucial piece of advice you can learn from the first people who reached the South Pole. If you make the wrong choice, you’ll burn out – guaranteed.\n\n- What famous American comic Jerry Seinfeld did in his early days of career to keep going. It’s a simple trick that provides huge results.\n\n- What a study on top musicians, athletes, actors and chess players can teach you about achieving results and persistence. The elite performers practice much fewer hours than you believe.\n\n- The most common ways you lead yourself to self-sabotage. Usually, you’re not even aware of how many of your efforts go for naught simply because of the things you'll discover in the course.\n\n- According to studies, this one trait is strongly associated with grit and persistence. Learn what it is and how to develop it in five different ways.\n\n- Five focusing questions to keep going. Asking yourself these questions will help you boost your motivation when you’re at the brink of giving up.\n\n- How listening to others whining makes a part of your brain shrink and affects your ability to persevere when faced with setbacks.\n\nThere’s no reason why you should give up if you’re working on the right goal. Learn how to make sure you’ll reach your objectives.",

      "description": "UPDATE: Scheduled price rise to $99 very soon.\nA Happy Pocket Full of Money is a MUST read for anyone who is sick and tired of struggling with personal finance problems. The rare insights in this book will have you looking at wealth creation from a refreshing and freeing new stand point from the very first page. All around awesome book David!!! - Jamie Briggs\n\nMaster The Science And Spirituality Of Abundance And Wealth Quickly And Deeply In This Comprehensive Course\nIn a day and age when most people look at the Law of Attraction stuff as a lot of smoke and mirrors, David details the science of this universal law (and others) and how to employ them to your own best benefit. This is the book that inspired Bob Doyle, of the movie, The Secret to follow his own passions. Additionally, as I understand it, David was an adviser on the movie itself. This is A MUST READ book if you are serious about employing universal laws as well as using scientific and practical methods to change your life. - Laurie J. Brenner\nWarning: this book is heavy duty stuff. It will blow your mind into little bitty pieces, but will also slowly reassemble it back much better than before. This is the best book I've ever read, period. It is life changing, if you allow it to be. If you have a hard time getting on board with organized religion (like me), and you need science to \"prove it\" to you, you really should read this book. It will fill in all the gaps.- Charles R. Robinson\nI absolutely LOVED this book! No other book has explained \"Wealth Consciousness\" better than this book. We all know the basics of The Law of Attraction/Law of the Universe, but this book explains exactly, in detail, how it works and why it works. This book tells you exactly WHAT to do, and HOW to do things to maximize your wealth consciousness. What's great is that you can use this book for not only wealth, but for anything in life! Thank you so much for writing this book, I am so grateful that I came across this amazing book. Thank You! - R. Rahman\nI have read many books on how to change your wealth mindset, but this book just spoke to me in a way the others didn't. Rather than taking an overly intellectual perspective on wealth building or a \"woo woo\" new age approach, this book falls somewhere in the middle and really does speak to your heart. - Ashton Proctor\n\nWord cannot describe how brilliant this book is! ... I have been a student of LOA and metaphysics for over 6 years and have read about every book written (Hick's, Catherine Ponder, Ernest Holmes, Joseph Murphy, Proctor, Vitale, J. A. Ray, Michael Losier, Canfield, to name a few) and this book covers EVERYTHING! I cannot describe how eloquent and proper the author writes, the wording and language used sounds as if he was being channeled by the \"Oh-mighty\" one himself.... \"Happy Pocket\" starts from how the monetary system works then explains Quantum Physics in a very understandable way, covers LOA that takes all the authors books I mentioned above all intertwined into this book, how to think and speak, much more than able to write, and finally ending with investing information. - Brian E. Davis\nFor those of you who cringe when you hear the words, Quantum Physics, fear no more. This book explains these principles in easy to understand language that you will resonate with. After reading this book I was able to re-assess my relationship with abundance and prosperity, with a deeper understanding of what abundance truly represents. This is what makes this book so life-changing; its ability to teach us how to create a deeper relationship with self and the universe. From here flows everything else. - Victoria C. Depaul\n\nI have never come across a book where each word cannot probably be appreciated as it should and that, is no joke! … I am still amazed on the total composition… It's love, vibrations, energy, feelings, intuition, thought, duality, faith and many other concepts blended into a very phenomenal little book. …Your book however is so much more than 'happy' and 'money'. And, I'm so glad I have found that out… David, you have captured the meaning of LIFE, but more importantly, you have explained it in such a way where it can be understood by people of almost any faith. It explains the soul/spirit/intellect that we are a part of and provides an understanding of why we are an appendage to a fulfilling web woven from love and to the benefit of others as well as ourselves. It encourages you to listen rather than ignore and process at a level beyond what we understand today. This process then allows us to act and speak with mindfulness that moves the continuum forward. - Michael V. Novinski\n\n\nWhat's The Fuss All About?\nThis little book, upon which this course is based on, so impressed Rhonda Byrne that she asked the author, David, to be the Creative Consultant on the hit movie The Secret. This book is a best-seller on amazon, scoring almost 5/5 stars from dozens upon dozens of reviewers. It has helped tens of thousands of people live and experience a life of abundance and liberation around the world.\nSo, you might ask, \"What's the fuss all about?\"\nWell, there are several reasons people seem to like it:\nIt's practical\nIt's simple\nIt's based on Science and Spirituality in a very unique and understandable way\nIt has been proven to work\nStudents who take it end up feeling better instantly and start to create tangible positive changes and experiences in their lives, instantly\n\n\nContent And Overview\nYour Quantum Leap into the Understanding, Having, and Enjoying of Immense Wealth and Happiness\nThe first step to having wealth is to know what it is. And few people know what it really is, in and of itself. What is wealth? What causes it? What causes the cause of it? Let us start with money, the world's symbol of wealth, and then move deeper.\nMoney is not real.\nMoney is merely legal tender, a form of exchange. We use it to exchange value. It represents value.\nMoney is the “body\" of value. It is the physical representation of value that rises and falls in ourselves, within us. Not within “things\" outside of us, but within us. For without us, what can the value of a thing, such as a car, be to us? Nothing, at least not to us. In other words, it is we, the observers, that place value in things, but this value is really value in us—we give value to the material things. The material things have no “money\" value in themselves—we give that to them. So money is the external physical representation of a particular section of our internal value, within us, within you. That is why a house or a block of shares valued at $1 million today can fall to a valuation of half a million dollars tomorrow when fear is introduced into the hearts of those involved. The fear kills a portion of the internal values of the participants, and that is reflected by the paper money, the “body\" of value.\nHere is something else: physical paper money does not even represent money in full. It cannot reasonably do that. By some estimates (and this varies from nation to nation), only as little as 4 percent of the money in the banks exists as paper cash. Imagine how much cotton, linen, pulp, and metal the world would need so as to make all the money everyone has in his or her bank accounts. Imagine how much space it would take to store all this money in paper form.\nIf you were to stack only one million US$1 bills, it would weigh one ton and be 361 feet high. Neither does money exist as gold reserves anymore. This is for exactly the same reason - we ran out of the reasonable ability to keep a gold standard in the 1970s.\nSo what does it exist as, the money that we are always talking about? Well, it is one massive illusion...",

How to prepare, store and protect your food stocks in the event of a personal disaster resulting, lean times, economic downturn, or even a catastrophic one.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's newly published report exposed some very disturbing information. Saying that in the event of a total collapse of the electrical grid, (that lasts 6 months or more), either due to a terrorist attack or a solar weather event, 90% of the population will die. This is due to the fact that most homes only have 3 days worth of supplies on hand at any moment.\nThese finding in the report expose three very obvious things:\nThe Government has zero confidence it can prevent such an event.\nThe Government does not have the resources to help when it does happen.\nThe responsibility of your survival is yours, and yours alone.

I liked the background scenery as well in the exercises. Nature does connect us to our bodies like nothing else. I learned a lot. I came across a video about EFT Tapping on Facebook. There are many school districts teaching it to children as stress and anxiety effect so many children today. And this is leading to increased mental health issues. I felt that watching the video was clearly not enough information about EFT and somewhere in my searching this course popped up. I didn't hesitate to sign up because I have taken other courses through UDEMY and I would recommend them to anyone. I am a middle school teacher and it is my goal to bring EFT into my school. I showed the video I found to our assistant principal and she was very intrigued and wanted to know more. So now, thanks to Alan, I have that much more information to share with her. There are RESOURCES provided with this course! Thank you! I do wish there was a diagram that not only showed the Meridian points but the organs each one is connected to. It would make it easier to remember.\nGloria Budz\nIf you have been suffering from negative feelings or emotions  this is the course to help you beat that feeling of helplessness with a easy to learn and apply technique that I will teach and guide you through each exercise so that you will be able to change how you think and feel and become a more relaxed person in all areas of your life. The technique I will be teaching you is called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) it is a gentle tapping technique where when you tap on certain points on the body while thinking about a problem you reduce or eliminate the bad feelings attached to that problem. This technique may seem a little silly however the reason you are reading this is because what you have tried before has not worked whether that be medication or therapy. I am so confident you will get results from taking the time to learn and apply this technique that Udemy is offering you a 30 day money back guarantee so there is no risk or cost to you if what I teach you does not work. However as I have been using this technique for so many years with excellent results with my clients that I decided to create this course so I could reach out and help as many people as I can.\n\n\nSo what will I teach you\nWhat is EFT\nThe EFT Tapping points\nEFT Tapping Points and Energy Meridians they are connected to\nProof that mind and body are connected\nThe Setup Phrase\nThe Reminder Phrase\nThe Breathing Exercise\nLet go negative emotions with EFT\nMopping up with EFT\nMopping up with EFT using color\nthe terrible cost of unforgiveness\nEliminate anger towards yourself and others with EFT\nMy Secret Tips\nAdvanced EFT Technique\n\n\nBonus EFT Video Sessions\n1.

No matter what their title or level, don't agree with what they're saying.\nKeep in mind that as an individual, you have the right to express your views and opinions as long as you're confident and know what you're saying makes sense. An assertive person knows what needs to be said or discussed without hurting or insulting the other person.\nSelf-confidence: what does it mean?\nSelf-confidence can mean a lot of different things to different people, but in reality it's just having faith in yourself.\nWe get our confidence from how we've been brought up and how we've been taught. It's how we think about ourselves and how we behave that influences what we think about ourselves and other people. Experiences and how we react to different situations also contribute to confidence.\nThere's no such thing as static self-confidence. There are days when we feel more confident than others about performing tasks and dealing with situations.\nThe meaning of body language\nRather than using words to express or convey information, body language uses physical behavior. You can tell a lot about someone by their physical behavior, like gestures, eye movements, body postures, and facial expressions. This course will explain the concepts of Assertiveness, Confidence, Body Language, Self-Confidence, Personal development, Attraction, assertive communication and self esteem.\n1. An introduction to assertiveness, self-confidence, and body language\n2. What's the best way to read and maintain body language?\n3. What's the best way to build confidence?\n4. When it comes to work, how do you develop assertiveness?\n5. Body language at work, assertiveness techniques, and confidence in an interview",

Walking with Grief\nWarning: there are elements of this course that you may find distressing as the material here is very current (August 2023). Remember though that although 'death' is in the title, so is 'grief and healing'. The purpose of this course is to help you grieve - to help you heal. Meditations are included together with areas for you to carry out your own investigations.\nThree detailed workbooks/journals are included plus numerous other resources.\n\n\nUPDATE: This course now includes a Handbook on Death, Grief and Healing.\nBACKGROUND TO THE COURSE.\nIn the beginning there were five of us:\n\n\nPeter - Instructor\nChris - Instructor\nStephen - Videographer\nLeslie - Proof reader and overall advisor\nGrace - audio\nFive people designed this course: Chris, Stephen, Peter, Grace and Leslie.

      "description": "In this course, I'll show you the step-by-step Formula that I've been using whenever I change my environment (e.g. move to a different city, change a job, start University, etc)\n\n\nIf you want to:\nMake more friends... but just don't know-how\nBe able to start conversations... but you often don't have the courage\nFind people with the same interests as you... but not sure where to start\nthen this will means that...\nI Made This Course For You.\nAfter having a childhood mainly around computer games, from the age of 18 I started taking jobs in the customer service industry. Slowly starting as working on a parking lot and on an anchored ship in Alaska, I then took a job that demanded from me to talk to STRANGERS: Hotel Entertainment. For 6 years I was entertaining people from all over the world in hotels in Bulgaria, Greece, and Spain. That helped build a system that I can follow whenever I speak to somebody for a very first time.\n\n\nHow this course is different from the rest?\nWhen people close themselves in their rooms and talk in front of a camera for hours without moving... somehow you may not find this engaging. I don't!. And when something is not engaging, you will struggle to learn it. Think about the math classes or those long history lessons that you might not have enjoyed... much.\nSo I created this online course with the thought \"I need to be able to finish my own course without getting board\".  This is why I met with people, filmed reactions, give examples, and share a few jokes only so this course can become more interesting to you. Because more interesting = more chance to remember something.\n\n\nI'll show you communication techniques that you can start implementing straight away.\n\n\nIf you are looking for techniques on HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY FLIRT, then this might not be the right course for you. Although there are tips that might help you with the communication in those situations, this is not the main subject of the course.\nHere's a sample of what you'll learn inside:\nHow to deal with rejection\nWho are the right people for you\nWhat to talk about with strangers\nHow to break the silence\nBody language techniques\nHow to keep newly built relationships\nWhat to avoid when speaking to strangers\nHow to join a conversation in a group of people\nAnd much, much more...\n\n\nI can help you start talking to strangers instantly. The very first step you need to take is to sign up for this course.\n\n\nI'll see you in class ;)\n\n\nTo your success,\nCurious Pavel",

Or perhaps you’ve always liked the look of old style cursive and this is something you would love to learn?\nTHIS CLASS IS FOR YOU.\n\n\nHello, my name is Robert and I will teach you how to write beautiful and legible cursive.\nThe style I’ll be teaching you is loosely based on Spencerian, an old American Script used in the 1800’s. While this script is known to be very precise and with a lot of rules, my approach to using its forms and shapes is much simpler and after you learn from me you’ll be able to use it in your everyday.\n\n\nLearning cursive or improving what you already know doesn’t have to be overwhelming. It can be enjoyable and very rewarding. In this beginner's level class I will take you step by step through everything I’ve applied myself to see big results in a very short period of time.\n\n\nI want this class to allow you to write in a way that brings you joy. Not only will you be able to have beautiful penmanship, but as you progress through each lesson you will also find the way to adapt or tweak everything I teach you in a way that feels comfortable and also reflects your own personality. If you apply what you learn and spend time practicing, you will see improvement and change, I promise.\n\n\nAND THERE'S MORE!\nWith this class you'll be able to download:\nLowercase alphabet on the guide sheet (as I wrote it over the lessons).\nUppercase alphabet on the guide sheet with the most common variations.\nSample paragraph you will see me write in real-time.\nAnother sample paragraph with smaller handwriting for you to see and compare.",

No affirmation or self-help book could fix it. I was stuck on autopilot.\n\n\nBut then I discovered something…\n\nI wasn’t broken.\n\nI was just living inside a set of negative defaults.\n\n\nWhen I finally fought back and rewired those defaults using the exact system you’ll learn in this program – everything changed.\n\n\nSince then, I’ve taught this method to thousands of business owners, professionals, and everyday people who were stuck in destructive patterns – and now it’s your turn.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn in This Program:\nCreatures of Default Habits – why humans are wired to repeat pain\nMy Observations on Life – raw truths no one else will tell you\nLooking Evil in the Face – confronting the darkest parts of yourself\nThe Slippery Slope of Defaults – how “just one more” destroys everything\nPersonal Conflict with Self – why you fight yourself (and lose)\nYour Evolution – the step-by-step shift into a new identity\nFighting the Mental War – breaking the cycle of sabotage\nRecognising My Defaults – the hidden programming ruining your life\nOscillating Defaults – how you swing back and forth between good/bad\nBreaking Defaults: 30-Day Tracking – the daily system that guarantees change\n\n\nThis isn’t theory. It’s the exact battle-tested process that saved me, created my success, and transformed thousands of lives.\n\n\nIn just 30 days, you’ll rewire the defaults that have been destroying you… and finally take back control of your life.\n\n\nI’ll see you inside the program.\n\n\n– Scott Jansen",

This may be the most impactful 90 minutes of video you have ever interacted with! Through easy-to-follow video instructions, guided exercises, and fun assignments taught by a leading remote viewer and clairvoyant practitioner, teacher, author, and professional, you will discover how to apply your own intuitive gifts that you may not even have realized you had!  You will learn by doing! Still, there are challenges to using intuition to find that which is lost -  especially when it comes to pets and people who may change locations rapidly. No worries though -  these are addressed through fascinating examples and loads of troubleshooting tips. You will also learn more about how to visualize and work with energy to harness the objects you are looking for, and in the process release whatever may be in the way of you actually being able to find the object in the first place. If you never imagined you would be able to call upon your own intuitive gifts at will, or didn't know how to apply them to finding missing items, this course will help you to reimagine and redefine your own intuitive potential. It will help you to see how your own gifts have real-life and practical applications. Most importantly, you will come to understand how you may really have more power to help your own family and friends in their greatest times of need and apply that knowledge in simple and easy ways. This is not to say you will always be able to find everything you look for intuitively - those limitations will be discussed candidly in the course - but if you can be successful at least some of the time - how would it not be worth your time to learn?",

If so, you're on the right path and can get started right now.\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like to feel truly happy within and fulfilled, to live a life full of happiness no matter what struggles may come your way?\nDo you feel that there is room for improvement in your life - for you to become happier, more inspired and fulfilled?\nWhy do we still struggle with self-punishing and self-sabotaging habits after trying so hard to change? Many people believe that happiness comes from success, health, and great human connections. The inverse of this principle is actually the statement that is the truest: success, health and great human connections are the inevitable results of being happy. In order to increase our capacity for happiness, we must tap into our own sense of awareness. When we increase our awareness, we are then able to understand with more clarity the important messages our body is telling us. When we are unhappy, we'll know it and feel it. However, we also have the power to shift from unhappiness to enjoying a happy life. Unhappiness is the result of disharmony between mind, body, and spirit.\n\n\nAre You Ready to Change Your Life, to create meaning and value in all that you do; to feel joyful, happy and inspired?\nDiscover how to create the life that you want and to obtain true happiness. Learn how to weave your inspired ideas into the actions of your daily life, regardless of where you are or what you are doing.

Do the groundwork and you will be rewarded.\nWhy are we on this planet and what are we really meant to be doing? What is this thing called 'life purpose' and 'personal transformation'. Every being is intended to be on earth for a certain purpose.\" Sa'di, 12th Century Persian poet\nEveryone feels a pull towards some defining life purpose, no matter how much it may have become shrouded over along the way. Personal transformation begins with you taking the first step to realising your absolute potential. through this self-development course.\nThere are consequences to not knowing or finding your life purpose. People describe feeling \"off-track\" in some way, or incomplete, despite a conventionally successful life. Sometimes they wonder if they've been on the \"wrong\" path all along, chosen the wrong career, or life partner. Or that perhaps they haven't This course is awesomeness! I have gained so much insight from this beautiful practice. Thank you Sharon Ramel, for another great and uplifting experience! that their chosen path could be more meaningful or purposeful for them. This can bring an absence of inner peace and a sense of not being fully in sync with the inner self. The path to an improved lifestyle and personal transformation begins here and now.\nCertification and Accreditation: Some instructors offer “accreditation” via external official-sounding bodies. The majority of these are fake. We call them Certificate Mills. The only thing the “Mill” wishes to see from the instructor is money (ranging from $40 - $1500 per course depending on the Mill) to pay for the process. They do not even wish to see 1 minute of any course nor any qualification an instructor may hold. You; the student is then sent to these places to pay them (more) money as the student. They commonly offer public liability insurance that you can get WITHOUT them and the fake fancy-looking Diploma.\nAs you know Udemy offers you a certificate of completion at the end of this course. However, I am happy to offer you a certificate of completion for any course of mine that you complete. Please ONLY message me through Udemy when you have completed the course. Note - I will not answer any requests for this outside of Udemy as I need to verify that you have completed the course!\nThis course takes you step-by-step to discover your Heart's Desire - your true Life Purpose - true self-development.

For the primary purpose of every human being is simply to be: fully engaged in this moment, and aligned with the natural flow of reality itself.\nThe beauty of effortless being, and how to awaken to it through Yoga Nidra\nTapping the vast power and intelligence of stillness within Yoga Nidra Unfolding your purpose through actions in alignment with the timeless present.\nWe will use a combination of ancient yogic philosophy with its treasure trove of wisdom to draw us into the mysteries of the heart and how to use this wisdom today.\nIntegration workbook exercises to enable deep reflection on the meditations and knowledge revealed to you.

      "description": "Ken Wilber is a renowned philosopher and author who created this course to guide you through a deep mindfulness practice towards “waking up” and “growing up” your own spiritual evolution.\nEvery great spiritual avatar of the past, from Buddha to Jesus, experienced freedom through a contemplative practice. But in today’s expanding world, you need more than old methods in order to truly evolve.\nWhat Is Full Spectrum Mindfulness?\nFull Spectrum Mindfulness combines a deep mindfulness practice with leading-edge discoveries in neuroscience and developmental psychology. It is designed to give you what you need to dramatically deepen your awareness and healing of those hidden issues that still drive your behavior no matter how many self-help books you’ve read, or retreats you’ve attended.\nThe goal of the Full Spectrum Mindfulness course is to help you unlock these hidden aspects that we call “shadows,” through a time tested mindfulness practice called witnessing. You will be amazed what a difference it will make in your life.\nThrough this course you will learn how to take a “full spectrum scan” of your total being, shining a light into some of the hardest-to-reach corners of your psyche. It will help you locate and upgrade outdated coping strategies, discover and heal trouble spots in your system, and tap into the power of mindfulness in healing issues you may have concerning food addictions and impulsive and obsessive behavior.\nHow is it different from other mindfulness practices?\nSimple. It gets beneath the surface.\nMost other approaches to mindfulness allow you to become more conscious of whatever is happening in the moment, helping you bring more awareness to your thoughts, emotions, and surrounding environment as they arise in your consciousness. There are dozens of truly amazing mindfulness techniques out there that truly excel at this, any one of which can become an important part of your life.\nHowever, while these traditional techniques do an excellent job of helping you become more mindful of the surface features of your moment-to-moment experience, they have a much more difficult time getting to the deep features of your consciousness — those aspects of your psyche that cannot easily be seen through contemplation or introspection alone, yet exert an enormous influence upon your perceptions, your reactions, and the way you make sense of the world.\nThese are the invisible structures through which you filter all of your experiences. Studied, tested, and verified across all known cultures by some of the world’s greatest psychologists, these deep structures give shape to your thoughts, add color to your emotions, and bring coherence to your identity.\nFull Spectrum Mindfulness is the very first approach to help you wake up and grow up as you become more familiar and fluent with both the surface features and the deep features of your mind, allowing you to expand your awareness to the innermost depths of your being.\nAwareness is curative.\nSome of the most difficult knots in your psyche — the ones that hold you back, limit your joy, and sometimes even cause you pain —can often be loosened and released simply by bringing conscious awareness to them. Existing mindfulness practices can be an ideal way to deliver this curative awareness. But here’s the problem: all conventional approaches to mindfulness can do is help you become more conscious of the symptoms. What they can’t do is get you to the deeper source of the issue. They are unable to bring curative awareness to the innermost parts of you.\nConventional mindfulness techniques will help you become more aware of your overall thought and behavior patterns, like noticing the difference between emotional eating and genuine hunger for example. However, these patterns are often just the surface ripples of a much deeper challenge lurking far below the surface of your conscious mind — your overall relationship with food, in this case, which first began to come online when you were a baby before you began forming memories.\nWhich means that even our very best approaches to mindfulness over the centuries have been incomplete. After all, if you’re only scratching the surface of your mind, how full can your mindfulness practice possibly be?\nAre you ready to awaken 10,000 years of evolution inside you?\nFull Spectrum Mindfulness is a self-directed video web course, meaning you can go through each of the 8 teaching modules and three bonus modules at your own pace. Includes more than 2 1/2 hours of hi-def video teachings and practices. This course runs beautifully on iPhones, iPads, and other mobile devices, so you can take your mindfulness practice with you wherever you go!\nContents and Overview\nIn the first section, you will learn about the meaning of waking up through a unique Full Spectrum mindfulness practice.\nIn the second section, explore the two levels of self through Ken's guided reflection.\nFollowing this section, Ken will cover enlightenment, including its definition and the freedom that is experienced as you move through the various states of consciousness.\nIn Section 4, Ken discusses “waking up” and “growing up,” which are the two dimensions of every spiritual path. You’ll learn how to awaken to deeper levels of consciousness, and you’ll discover stages of growth that happen when you develop spiritually.\nLearn to practice Growing Up through a tool called \"videotaping\" in Section 5. Apply your new found mindfulness practice to your relationship with food and hunger.\nNext, apply this technique to the levels of impulsiveness and obsession in Section 6.\nFinally, Ken will lead you through two in depth Full Spectrum Mindfulness practices.\nAll teaching videos come with a downloadable transcript.\nBy the time you complete this course, you’ll be able to take advantage of the expansion of your knowledge and consciousness through the unique Full Spectrum mindfulness practice that enables you to use these new lessons to enhance your spiritual practice, presence and reduce the suffering in your life.",

Behaviours?\nDo you struggle to understand social situations more than you would care to admit?\nDo you beat yourself up every time you make a mistake; leaving you feeling defeated and vulnerable?\nIf so, this course is for you.\n\n\nIn this 3 module course, you will learn everything you need to know about emotional intelligence to help you...\nBecome more at peace with who you are\nManage your internal critic with greater ease\nTake you out of the dark about you and your emotions\nBuild stronger and healthier relationships\nBecome more in control over your life (by being strategic)\nSound promising? Great. Let's break down the 3 modules you will learn in this course (which include practical hands on exercises)...\nUnderstanding emotions\nEmotions are confusing especially when we're unfamiliar with their function. In this course, we'll be covering the 5 basic emotions in depth focusing on each emotion's motive, body language and importance.\nYou will learn how to notice them within yourself and in others.\nSelf-Awareness\nSelf awareness means being honest about yourself with yourself. The big question of, \"Why do I do what I do?\" will be covered in this course. You will learn how to mindfully notice your thoughts, emotions, behaviours, habits, triggers and physical sensations helping you make better decisions.\nSelf-Acceptance\nOur internal critic can be MEAN! It makes an appearance when we make a mistake or when we fail to live up to our own high standards. In this course, you will be introduced to various self compassion techniques and mindfulness training (enabling you to disarm your internal critic without the vicious fight).\n\n\nWhy do I need emotional intelligence in my life?\nIf the word emotional intelligence sound like an oxymoron to you, you're not alone. We tend to think that intelligence and emotions are separate things. However, when emotions and intelligence combine we come to see an essentially new type of smart - the ability to manage one's own emotions, thoughts and behaviours while proactively engaging with others as well. To be emotionally intelligent in essence means that we can use our emotions to think and enhance our reasoning.\nThis becomes useful in SO many areas of our life; from the relationship we have with ourselves to our external relationships and to our careers. We can notice our limiting core beliefs and challenge them. We can confront our internal critic with understanding and compassion versus harsh criticism. We can identify our triggers and can anticipate our reactions establishing proper coping mechanisms when they arise.\nEmotional intelligence is the intelligence that reminds us of our humanness, enables us to grow and helps us build effective relationships with others.\nThis is for you if:\nYou are new to the subject of emotional intelligence\nYou feel confused about your emotions\nYou have trouble managing your anxiety and internal critic\nYou want to learn how to communicate your emotions without being defensive\nYou’re passionate about becoming the best version of yourself\nYou’re ready to take your life to the next level!!!",

You see, most of us don't know what we want but the majority of us know what we don't want so we find ourselves in that world of uncertainty.  We understand that we get what we focus on.  We understand where are focus goes are energy flows!  But since we don't know what we really want we continue to focus or think about what we don't want and continue to get it and be confused.

      "description": "\"This is the best training course I've ever taken and I've taken quite a few of them.\"\n~ Rickey Benz (student)\n\n\nMini Habit Mastery: the world's most popular video course on habit formation!\nMini Habit Mastery summarizes and expands upon the concepts of the international bestselling book, Mini Habits, which taught people (in 21 languages) the best and smartest strategy to form lifelong habits. Join over 18,000 students: learn why habits are the most important part of our lives, and precisely how to shape them to reach your goals.\nStruggling to Change? Don't Blame Yourself, Blame Your Strategy\nThink about this: many people are still trying to change the same area of their life that they wanted to change years ago.\nWhat's the problem? Is it them? Are they unable to change?\nNo, the problem is that they're using the same failing strategies each time—the strategies that fill most books, blogs, and courses which are supposed to help people change.\nI've been there. I followed conventional advice and tried to motivate myself into change for 10 years; I tried to \"want it more.\" But it never worked; it never lasted because there are serious flaws with that strategy.\nMini Habit Mastery details a strategy so different from the norm that it will cause a paradigm shift in how you think about changing yourself. Since beginning my own mini habits, I'm in the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words!\nI'm not just a passionate teacher of this concept, but its first beneficiary.\n\n\n\"I have bought a lot of courses in Udemy, mostly about programming, but this is probably one of the best, if not the best I've bought here. I'm so glad I took a chance.\"\n- Erick Sandoval (student)\n\n\nWhat Will This Course Do For You?\nMini Habit Mastery will help you create good habits and remove bad habits. The strategies within it are based on cutting-edge neuroscience, and are completely different from traditional advice, which is ineffective. If you take this habit change course, you can expect your views on several important life concepts like motivation, willpower, and habit formation to change.\nStarting and maintaining a mini habit is extremely easy to do; I'll show you exactly why and how this concept works. For such a simple concept, there's a wealth of science and logic to back it up, and we'll explore all of it (in a fun way).\n\n\n\"The varied presentation styles, especially the Science in Action segments, make this course more fun than many. The production quality is high. And the information is solid.\"\n- Beth Ellen Nash (student)\n\n\nMini Habit Mastery Features A Fun, High-Quality Presentation Style\nLook at the preview video to see the quality you can expect to find inside. This course features a lot of \"bells and whistles\" to keep you interested in this life-changing strategy. The problem with plain lecturing for an entire course is that it gets monotonous, and it also fails to cater to different learning types. Mini Habit Mastery is dynamic, with nearly a dozen different ways of teaching this important information.\nThis course is based on the acclaimed Mini Habits book. When Mini Habits started changing lives, people told their friends about it. That's why Mini Habits has twice been the #1 best-selling non-fiction Kindle book in the USA; it has been the #1 selling self-help book in the USA, Canada, and South Korea.\n\n\n\"I really enjoyed learning about mini habits and why they are so effective in helping us develop new \"success muscles.\" Little steps lead to bigger changes without trying. The fun teaching style kept me thoroughly engaged and laughing at the skits. Production quality was excellent.\"\n- Halena Curran (student)\n\n\nCourse features\nBased on Mini Habits, the acclaimed international bestselling habit book (21 languages, 500,000+ copies sold worldwide).\nMore than 3.5 hours of high-quality content, featuring: HD video, crisp audio, quality editing, \"an edutaining course,\" world-class content, and the smartest habit-formation strategy\nAlmost 100% video-based course: Video is unmatched in that it engages your visual and auditory senses to appeal to different learning styles\nSeveral studies are \"brought to life\" for you: studies can be rather boring because of the torturous wording used in academic journals. But thankfully, they're quite a bit more entertaining—and often quite funny—when acted out in front of you (starring Actress Laura Avnaim).\nReal-life demonstrations of important concepts are also brought to life: motivation, willpower, small steps, and more are demonstrated in a visual, tangible way to enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the material. Studies show that increasing the fun factor enhances learning.\nThis is nothing like any other course: other books and courses parrot back content you've heard 1,057 times. Not this one. If you've read my blog, Deep Existence, you know that I have a different approach to many things. For example, did you know that motivation is not needed to form habits? I base my conclusions on thoughtful application of scientific data with some personal experimentation for support.\nThis isn't a course that promises a pipe dream: this is the exact way I changed my life after 10 years of failing with the traditional advice we hear! Read the reviews for the book or the course, or look at the stories at minihabits [dot] com to see hundreds of other people who have done the same.\nSome instructors can throw together a course in a weekend (it seems). I worked on this course every single day for more than 7 months to perfect and polish it.\n\n\n\"If ever a course deserves 5 stars, this one does.\"\n- Thomas (student)\n\n\n\"I am recommending this class to everybody I know! The instructors know their stuff and present it in such an engaging way it was pure pleasure to watch and learn. I have learned the most valuable self improvement method I have ever come across.\"\n- Melanie Taylor (student)\n\n\nI'll be inside to answer any questions you may have as you take the course. There's even more \"under the hood\" than this thorough course can communicate. What often happens when people encounter paradigm-shifting information? They have questions. I expect it, and I'll be standing by with answers.\nJoin us. I look forward to seeing you inside!\nCheers,\nStephen Guise",

      "description": "\"Our ‘Inner World’ shapes our ‘Outer World'\" is the single most important insight from the world of self-help/ personal development.\nNo matter what country, what culture we are from, there is something common among us human beings – we all want to be somebody living a good life!\n\nThere is tons of material on self-help/ personal development available these days, and while those individual pieces of advice in the form of quotes or videos provide healthy food for thought, they might not necessarily make a lasting difference as it is typically piecemeal advice without a comprehensive understanding and structure around how it all works together.\nThis is where a\ncomprehensive curriculum that teaches the most key principles around self-help/ personal development\ncan make a difference!\nThe objective of designing this course is to enable you to get quick yet lasting results. In this course, you will learn the most key principles relating to self-help/ personal development that I have gathered from my extensive reading and experience (300+ self-help/ personal development books over ~20 years).\nI have developed a dedicated framework that covers the 3 key aspects of personal transformation having 8 elements in total:\nIndividuality\nSelf-image (How you see yourself?)\nBeliefs (How you see the world?)\nCharisma (How the world sees you?)\nInspiration\nPassion (What makes you come alive?)\nGoals (What is your vision?)\nIntensity\nMind control (How to assign empowering meanings?)\nSelf-talk (How to talk to yourself?)\nTime management (How to use the greatest leveler?)\nThis course will introduce you to the most key principles that every person must understand as irrespective of the fact if you believe in or practice these principles or not, they still continue to apply for you! Once you master these basic principles, you won’t need to read up any more detailed literature.\nA number of custom-designed exercises have also been included, which have proven effective for myself and many others around me. The exercises will help you assess your current situation (know exactly where you are stuck!), define your target state and design the transformational roadmap for you to bridge the gap and achieve your breakthrough. Ensure that you complete the exercises even if they feel uncomfortable/ tedious at first.\nReal lasting impact will come from doing the exercises. Once you learn how to do one full iteration of the exercises and are able to take yourself to the next level, you can repeat the entire iteration from your new normal, and continue to be on that upward trajectory, of hitting higher and higher levels.\nPost undertaking this course, you will feel more “in control” of your life and be more successful in achieving the results that you desire along each of the life areas:\nPhysical (Health),\nIntellectual (Work),\nSocial (Relationships),\nFinancial (Money), and\nSpiritual (Soul)\nAs the world around us continues to transform rapidly creating more and more awareness and opportunities for everyone, it becomes imperative for having a happy and contented life that one has more clarity on what they want from their own lives irrespective of what others around them are doing! This is where again, having a stronger understanding of one's own body, mind and spirit comes into play.\nWith this short introduction, I would like to invite you to join me in this transformational journey. I have done my best to ensure that this course delivers significant value to you. Despite that, for some reason, should you feel you didn’t get adequate value for your money, feel free to go for the 30-day money back.\nTake action, enroll in the course, learn the principles, apply them and become the best version of yourself!!",

As a part of our Skill development program, we took the American Accent & English Pronunciation Masterclass (2024) conducted by Ms. Krishna Mukherji.\nI always thought that I spoke English perfectly but after attending Krishna Mam's class I realized that though I spoke very good grammatically correct English, I was not pronouncing many sounds correctly and I had lot of Mother Tongue Influence on my speech. I was completely unaware of this.\nI learnt a lot in her class and was able to improve my accent and pronunciation by learning the correct sounds and the speaking pattern of the American English.\nKrishna Mukherji Mam's classes were very interesting and interactive, with lots of practice exercises.\nIt has helped me immensely in my profession and all my students from the United States and other native English-speaking countries understand me much better now than before.\nI will highly recommend Krishna Mukherji Mam's course.”\n\n\nBharathi Bhandarkar: “I work as a Project Manager in a healthcare IT firm in Bangalore. Before I used to struggle to understand my American colleagues' accent and I spoke too fast. I didn't know which syllable to stress or which vowel sound to stretch or shorten. Thanks to Ms. Krishna's guidance. I learnt a lot and improved my accent and communication skills. Now I understand others better and express myself more clearly.\nThis coaching made a big difference in my professional interactions. I highly recommend this course to everyone.”\n\n\nRajini Balaji: We were a few chosen teachers who had the privilege to be coached under Krishna Mukherji Ma'am, for the English Accent Training. This helped us immensely in our tutoring classes where we have many students from the US Region. My US students are very happy with the accent that I carry in my language now.

I immensely thank Krishna Ma'am for all the wonderful classes, which has given me a good recognition in my company globally.\nSo, ditch the self-doubt and embrace the journey towards clear, impactful communication.

      "description": "Inspired by Joshua Schmude’s forthcoming book, Unveiling the Self: A Psycho-dynamic Approach to Spiritual Enlightenment (available in 2026), this lecture series offers a profound exploration of the unconscious mind and its connection to spiritual awakening. Designed to illuminate both ancient and modern spiritual mysteries, it guides learners toward a conscious realization of the divine spark residing within their own soul.\nServing as an introduction to the groundbreaking psychological theories of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, this series delves into their perspectives on the unconscious and its role in shaping personal and collective transformation. Additionally, it explores the philosophical depth of Neoplatonism, weaving in the insights of Iamblichus on divine possession and the soul’s journey toward enlightenment. Through this immersive study, participants are invited to engage with timeless wisdom and unlock the hidden dimensions of their inner self.\nJoshua Schmude, a dedicated educator teaching English Language Arts, math, and science to students from kindergarten through 12th grade, brings a unique perspective to his work. His deep understanding of the human psyche and spiritual philosophy has led to numerous appearances on radio and podcast programs, where he shares his insights on Reverse Speech and the mysteries of consciousness. His teachings inspire individuals to embark on their own journey of self-discovery, bridging the gap between psychology, philosophy, and spiritual transformation.\n*\nIf you found this course fascinating, then you're in for an even deeper, mind-expanding journey! PART 2 of this course—\"The Analytical Psychology of CG Jung: A Deep Exploration of Jung’s Method for Awakening the Divine Other Within\"—dives headfirst into Jung’s groundbreaking approach to self-discovery, the unconscious, and the mystical transformation of the psyche.\nUnlock the hidden layers of the mind, explore the concept of individuation, and experience Jung’s method in a way that reveals the divine other within you. This course isn’t just about learning—it’s about awakening. If you're ready to challenge your perception of reality, transform your inner world, and elevate your understanding of psychology, this is where it happens.",

      "description": "Updated 5/16/2019\n\nFormerly called Conscious Communication\nBONUS MATERIAL: Downloadable audio of the vocal exercises\n\"Having tried quite a few video courses on improve my speaking voice, this has been the best for me. I needed some help with my voiceovers, and this gave me noticeable improvement on the first day. I recommend it to any podcaster or VO artist.\" --J.S.,  Udemy student\n\"Fantastic! This is not a typical public speaking course. It is aimed at awareness and control of the sound of your voice. The benefits are instant and will last a lifetime. Thank you for the invaluable information.\" --O.B., Udemy student\n\nUpdated 2/5/2016\nBonus Lecture uploaded today: What is vocal placement and why is it important for speaking.\n\nUpdated 1/29/2016\nImportant note: I've uploaded 2 bonus lectures. Check them out!\n\nYour voice is your primary tool of communication!\nIf you want to naturally convey trust, honesty, and integrity through the quality and presence of your voice; If you want to speak without getting tired or hoarse; if you want to be a more influential speaker or teacher; if the sound of your voice on recording makes you cringe; if you want to learn to communicate with clarity, power, and ease; if you want to become more effective at sharing your message and influencing others positively, this course is for you!\nWhen hearing a recording of themselves, speakers and teachers frequently cringe because they realize that they sound very different from what they imagined!\nThe voice conveys so much information about who you are. If properly trained, your voice can become a powerful instrument to convey not just words, but the energy, the ideas, and the consciousness behind the words. A strong, resonant voice is confidence-building, commands attention, conveys trust and integrity, and establishes more easily a connection with your audience.\nBad habits and age are stressful to the voice. Over the years, it tends to crack more often and to sound thinner, weaker, and more shallow. The organs that produce the voice are muscles, and like any other muscle, they need to be kept in good shape in order to work properly. This course will show you how.\nVoice training can turn a weak, thin, cracking voice into a powerful communication tool. A misplaced voice inhibits, instead of enhancing, your ability to convey effectively content and ideas. Besides making it easier and more natural to use the voice, proper vocal training develops your sound and resonance, which translates into the ability to communicate on a deeper level.\nIn this course you will learn the techniques to make your voice into a strong and reliable instrument to express your thoughts and feelings with clarity and conviction. The confidence that will come as a result, will make it easier for you to “get out of yourself” and connect with your audience on a deeper level. This synergy will help you feel that you and your audience are on the same side, taking away any sense of stress and building a subtle bridge between you and them.\nThe course consists of video files with guided vocal exercises covering the main aspects and challenges of voice production. The videos will guide you through the practice of the exercises, giving you special instructions, reminders, and addressing the most common issues students often run into. Audio downloads of the vocal exercises are also available, to make it easier to practice anywhere, even while driving your car :-)\n\nYou will also have the opportunity to ask questions and get feedback by sending me a message on Udemy.\nTake action now! Every few minutes you’re delaying you’re not expressing your full potential as a speaker.\n\nTESTIMONIALS:\n\"Brings the experience of voice into the equation, a often overlooked aspect of communication. To build the complete package speaking of the individual all things must be brought to bear, include listening and speaking skills. This does get to the point of voice, the how and why. A great primer for starting the journey. Good job. --L.D.K.\n“I am pretty new to teaching, so sometimes I find it difficult to handle a classroom full of students. More so on Thursdays, when I teach seven lessons almost back to back. I usually end each week with a hoarse and aching throat. Ramesha gave me an exercise to help me learn talking from my diaphragm and with resonance in my head, so that I would not strain my voice. When next I tried it I could hear my voice sound different; it was lower, and producing it was less effort. The first time was difficult for me to maintain, I had to consciously think about my belly moving and my throat position, and every time I raised my voice I lost it and had to start all over again, but it was worth it. Aside from the lack of strain, each time I spoke that way, I felt that my energy was more centered and I was in better control of it. The result was not only a better use of the voice, but also a more pleasant teaching experience.”  — O. L., Tel Aviv, Israel\n\"Ramesha makes voice classes fun, interesting, and inspiring. He is a great example of what he teaches. His voice is so resonant and uplifting.\" --M. J., Seattle WA\n\"Ramesha can impart vocal training in an interesting and fun way, and makes everyone feel they can apply the principles and make improvements.\" --K. D.

      "description": "We all have toxic relationships and addictions in life. It may be with our family, our friends, the people around us, or sometimes with places or objects. Many of us developed as well addictive behaviors with substances like food, alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. We might also have toxic relationships with patterns, thoughts, beliefs that sometimes become extremism or obsession.\n\nThese unhealthy habits and patterns in our life hold us back, and generate a lot of suffering. They condition our reactions and responses in a way that is not serving our highest purpose.\nUsually Toxic relationships deal with our intimate  partners, but this class addresses much more than that. We will bring the awareness and the healing to all levels of your Being -physical, emotional, mental and spiritual- and to all the aspects of your existence.\nThe symptoms of being entangled in a toxic relationship are anger, resentment, frustration, sadness, feeling powerless, addictions, unhealthy control issues, obsession, feeling manipulated and not respected, feeling stuck as a victim or a rescuer...\nTo set ourselves free and reclaim our power of cocreating a healthy joyful life, we need to heal these poisonous insidious connections and patterns we developed along the years.\nThis course will provide you all the tools necessary to heal these toxic relationships and to move forward.\nFirst we will work on our awareness and responsibility as many of us are in denial about our own toxicity. We will scan and list all these unhealthy aspects of our life.\nWe will then practice 4 different kind of healing :\nAn emotional Healing with Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) to relax our emotional body and stop our uncontrolled reactions.\nA Toxic Cord Cutting Healing using the Grace of Angelic realms, as along the years we created and fed many energetic toxic cords to these people or substances.\nA Forgiving and Healing Meditation using Ho'oponopono from the Hawaiian tradition. Forgiving yourself and others is essential to move forward.\nA Healthy Boundary Healing to set up new clear, whole, healthy energetic boundaries that you will be able to activate with a snap of your fingers.\nFinally, you will be given a simple but powerful ritual to practice for 28 days to let go of the past and start a new life.\nAfter this class, you will be able to :\nBe more aware every time a relationship with somebody or something becomes unhealthy.\nPractice EFT tapping Healing by yourself, every time you will feel overwhelmed by emotions (pain, anger, cravings, sadness...)\nCut your toxic cords to create more space in you, to allow something new to unfold, by simply listening to a short meditation.\nForgive yourself and others, with a simple yet powerful visualization and guided meditation.\nFind your center and set clear boundaries with others with literally a snap of your fingers, using the Magic Cube.\nIntegrate deeply this healing, and heal your past with the 28 days ritual.\nTwo audio meditations (to be downloaded) are provided to repeat the healing processes where you want.\nAre you ready to shed the skin of you old Self ?\nAre you ready to truly transform and heal your relationships ?\nAre you ready to say goodbye to your addictions ?\nAre you ready for a quantum leap, to embrace your New Self, free from your past suffering ?\nYes !!!!\nThen this class is for you. While speaking to you, I will take you to many different shamanic dimensions of consciousness, allowing your Spirit to bring to the surface what you need to heal. It is more than just words. It is Light Language in action. There are many healing downloads in this course, to allow you to Heal your toxic Relationships and Addictions ! Trust your Intuition !

      "description": "How to Develop Self-Discipline, Resist Temptations and Reach Your Long-Terms Goals\nIf you want to make positive changes in your life and achieve your long-term goals, I can’t think of a better way to do it than to learn how to become more self-disciplined.\nScience has figured out a lot of interesting aspects of self-discipline and willpower, but most of this knowledge is buried deep inside long and boring scientific papers.\nIf you’d like to benefit from these studies without actually reading them, this course is for you.\nI’ve done the job for you and researched the most useful and viable scientific findings that will help you improve your self-discipline.\nHere are just a couple of things you will learn from the course:\n\n- what a bank robber with lemon juice on his face can teach you about self-control. The story will make you laugh out loud, but its implications will make you think twice about your ability to control your urges.\n\n- how $50 chocolate bars can motivate you to keep going when faced with an overwhelming temptation to give in.\n\n- why President Obama wears only gray and blue suits and what it has to do with self-control (it’s also a possible reason why the poor stay poor).\n\n- why the popular way of visualization can actually prevent you from reaching your goals and destroy your self-control (and what to do instead).\n\n- what dopamine is and why it’s crucial to understand its role to break your bad habits and form good ones.\n\n- practical ways to train your self-discipline. Discover some of the most important techniques to increase your self-control and become better at resisting instant gratification.\n\n- why the status quo bias will threaten your goals and what to do to reduce its effect on your resolutions.\n\n- why extreme diets help people achieve long-term results, and how to apply these findings in your own life.\n\n- why and when indulging yourself can actually help you build your self-discipline. Yes, you can stuff yourself (from time to time) and still lose weight.\n\nInstead of sharing with you the detailed \"why\" (with confusing and boring descriptions of studies), I will share with you the \"how\" – advice that will change your life if you decide to follow it.\n\nYou too can master the art of self-discipline and learn how to resist temptations. Your long term goals are worth it.",

      "description": "Welcome to this life changing course! First of all: I see you and I recognize your bravery for finding your way here. By now, you will probably have come to the crude realization that everyone in your life is a narcissist and spend a lot of time identifying narcissists in your day-to-day scenarios. Within the awful isolation from realizing the harder truths, you seek out cues for potential threats: word salads, black and white thinking, love bombing signs, potential devaluation, control and coercion signs, giveaways of manipulative behavior and so forth. Along this, you most likely already started to document yourself on the topic of \"narcissists\", often weeping while you research every time you find a resonance with your personal story.  I get it because I went through it too!\nHere's the good news! They won't change, but you will! And this will change the entire dynamic of relating in the cycle of: persecutor, victim and savior. It will change it because you will be emotionally free, stop fearing narcissists and become an integrated and empowered FULL Warrior once again, who is able to discern and release triggers at will. With that, this course is NOT for the faint hearted, it is brutal in shifting from victim to survivor. Note: if you are in the middle of the PTSD phase, experiencing high emotional distress and living with an abuser, please seek safety, support and contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline # 1-800-799-7233, 24/7. What you need the most right now is protection, care and nurture and maybe you can come back at a later time and do this course, when you want to understand what happened and how to break it at the core.\nIf you are ready to shatter for once and for all the pattern of abuse in your life, enter this 360 degree approach to the abuse wound, that tailors both the conscious and unconscious mind in processing severe trauma coming from abusive dynamics. In it, you will find 18 mind blowing, raw, relatable and informative video lectures on abuse, trauma, emotional wounds and reclaiming wholeness and the full expression of who you are. NOTE: No one will grade you and you don't have to hand it in, but please get a notebook or laptop and complete the homework listed under downloadable resources at the end of each lecture, it will help you take everything you learned here to your life and gain new awareness into who you will become after this.\nThis course will teach you to break the bondage of abuse by getting yourself back. It will also awaken triggers, but we got to feel it to heal it. However, you will also stop fearing narcissists because I will give you in-depth information of their weaknesses. This course is about facing that fear and experiencing emotional coherence and transcendence, knowing that one day you will finally look back and have a good laugh at the time you almost felt you lost it all, to the (already) wrong people. Enter with caution, push through the uncomfortable parts (if they don't make sense right now because of the pain you are in, do it anyway), because they will at a later stage and you'll be glad you had a template for those new realizations. The final gift of this course is retrieving courage, because sometimes it takes bravery to truly be happy!\nGet through it at your own pace and get your Warriorhood Certificate in the end...\nMuch love and see you on the other side!",

      "description": "With the experiences we have all had of living through a pandemic, communication skills have become increasingly important, especially so in remote work settings and our private lives. Listening is the forgotten communication skill, but arguably, the most important. It is a crucial part of our ability to engage and communicate with others. Listening deeply, however, takes this skill set up a level. So, if you would like to build relationships by creating trust and mutual understanding, and by bringing a diversity of thoughts and ideas to the conversation, then enroll for this course. There are three steps to master in order to become a better listener: listening with purpose, listening for understanding, and listening with empathy.\nThis course consists of four sections. It starts off with a quick introduction to the benefits of developing your listening skills. You will then identify good and bad listening habits in yourself and others, which you need to do before you proceed with building on and developing your own listening skills. The course then takes you through strategies to practice and improve your skills to listen with purpose, understanding, and, most importantly, empathy.\nI designed this course for those who want to develop a deep listening mindset as a gamechanger, whether professionally or privately, or both. Good listening skills are rare, and so they need to be practiced and developed. As you develop your listening with purpose, understanding and empathy, you will start to build better trust and stronger relationships.\nI am Sonia Vandeleur. I am an experienced thinking skills teacher, a trainer, a TEDx speaker and author. I have a PhD in education. I have headed the Cognitive Education Department at an independent school for over a decade, developing the program and training teachers, both nationally and internationally. My passion and interest is on the impact of thinking skills on our academic, professional and private lives.\nBy enrolling for this course, you can bring about real and meaningful change. You will experience how being better at listening will make you more curious, and it will open up the world around you. Listening well is a sign of respect and it will enrich both your life and the lives of others. I look forward to engaging with you in the course.",

      "description": "Buddhism is the oldest and most successful Self-Help program on Earth. There is debate over whether Buddhism is a religion or a philosophy. When asked to weigh in on this question my answer is always definitely yes! There is no Divine figure to worship, no cosmogony and no dogma in Buddhism. In that respect it does not appear to be a religion. But if you consider a religion to be a set of ideas around which you live your life and that in turn brings you to peace and a deep understanding of the True Nature of life, then Buddhism is most definitely a religion. This incredibly practical and adaptive tradition is something that everyone should learn about.\nI designed this course especially for Westerners who have had little or no contact with Buddhism other than the few words and ideas that have filtered through to the West. It is presented in a very entertaining and light fashion including stories and humor. The simplicity of the course however should not fool you into thinking the content is in any way compromised.  I have had lifelong Buddhists in Asia take the class and remark to me that this was the first time they truly understood their own religion. Though that may be true the course is especially designed for those who are looking for a clear and simple explanation of Buddhism.\nSo whether new to the subject or very experienced you will find knowledge of great value to you and your life in this course. In the end, you will understand why it is that you have been living less than you are deserving of and how to regain your Natural state of Joy, Compassion, Love and Freedom.",

It’s too general.\nBut, unfortunately a lot of what you still see in the market is based on the OLD model of coaching which basically means you coach a client to achieve a goal of their choosing through individual coaching sessions.

      "description": "\"Success in life depends on how we feel about our parents; when we accept and consent to reality as it is. And take them as they are.\"\n\n\nHEAL PRESENCE OF THE PAST\nUnlock the Power of Family Constellations\n\n\nOur lives are intertwined with the past, affecting us and the generations to come. Within the vast network of existence, we inherit cultures, experiences, and collective memories—a profound concept known as the \"collective unconscious.\"\n\n\nThis natural memory organizes itself into various systems, from flocks of birds to countries, but none is more impactful on humans than the family. Family systems operate under the \"Orders of Love,\" natural laws that dictate how we live and thrive.\n\n\nHowever, in most families, these orders are disrupted, leading to exclusion and trauma. Such entanglements cause pain and suffering, but there is a path to peace and freedom—restoring these orders.\n\n\nRupert Sheldrake challenges the notion that memory resides in the brain. We inherit everything from our culture, even the traumas. Trauma, like a relentless cycle, presents itself in familiar forms: addiction, lack of motivation, and repeating patterns in relationships.\n\n\nAre you unconsciously trapped in your parents' relationship dynamics? Do you find yourself attracting similar fates you once rejected or judged?\n\n\nImagine a suicidal adolescent mirroring the fate of a lost sibling never born due to a miscarriage.\nConsider how your fear of the future might stem from your grandmother's abandonment as a child.\nCould breast cancer be rooted in the unconscious guilt of a past abortion?\nWhy do marriages, where forgiveness follows betrayal, often end?\nPerhaps a man's alcoholism is an unconscious loyalty to his alcoholic father.\nCould chronic low back pain symbolize the need to honor your parents?\nAnd what if guilt actually belongs to a distant family member's dark history?\nExplore the intricate web of your own family's past and its influence on your life. This course provides a comprehensive understanding of family therapy, the Orders of Love, entanglements, blind love, and patterns that keep you trapped.\n\n\nAccording to Bert Hellinger, pain often originates from past separations that morph into destructive patterns affecting family members for generations. Recognize the signs: unattainable success, financial struggles, repetitive relationship patterns, a nagging sense of emptiness, lingering unhappiness, and the shadow of addiction and anxiety.\n\n\nUnlock the path to healing and transformation with Family Constellations.\n\n\nUnravel the Ties That Bind\nExplore the traumas that entangle your daily life:\nExclusions & Self-exclusions\nMurder\nSuicide\nSlavery\nFamily Secrets\nProlonged Hospitalizations\nAbortion\nMiscarriage\nEarly Parental Death\nEarly Child Loss\nStillbirth\nWar\nAbandonment\nAdoption\nDivorce\nInherited family trauma can manifest as:\n\n\nStruggles with success and financial stability\nMental distress and illness\nRepeated failed relationships\nDiscover the power of Bert Hellinger's transformative therapy. Resolve entanglements, find peace, and regain control of your life.",

      "description": "Hi and welcome!\nI often hear people say that want to make a meaningful contribution. They want to make a difference to others. And that is what draws them to the field of life coaching and why life coaching is so exciting.\nThe purpose of this course is to teach you the fundamentals of life coaching so you can empower others to improve their lives and achieve a higher vision as well as live a more balanced and fulfilling life.\nThe course is for those of you on the journey to become a coach and/or expand your coaching skills. But it is also for anyone in a role to influence the development of others whether it be a leader/manager, teacher, parent, priest/pastor and so on.\nPractical, Powerful Tools\nAs a psychologist and coach with years of professional experience, I provide you with powerful tools to help people improve, even transform their lives. Here are a few of the tools you'll learn in the course:\n1. The coaching conversation. The conversation consists of six steps which provide you an overall structure and process to guide the coaching process. The steps help you know exactly where you are in your coaching conversations and what you need to say next to help your client go from where they are today to where they want to be.\n2. The coaching model. This is a set of advanced competencies that bring more depth and richness to the conversation. It consists of a number of communication skills, organized around three primary themes, to deepen the process and take your conversations to a new level.\n3. The empowerment model. The model presents a cause-effect relationship between a circumstance and your thoughts, feelings, behavior and results. A circumstance is a given. But how you think about the circumstance will either empower or disempower you. You'll use this model to help your clients challenge and change their limiting and self-defeating beliefs; to help them create a mindset that will transform the way they live.\nBeyond Theory\nThis program is not theoretical. In fact, I walk you through a number of case studies of actual coaching sessions.  You’ll see how to use the coaching conversation, coaching model, and empowerment model to transform lives and help your clients (students, employees, children) achieve their aspirations and live from their best selves.\nIn addition, I give you lots of resources in the form of handouts and application exercises so you can study the concepts and improve your skills.\nTake-Aways from the Program\n\n\nAcquire skills to help people clarify their goals and accomplish their life’s vision.\nEmpower people to overcome negative thoughts and habits that keep them stuck and unfulfilled.\nLearn a road-map for moving your clients from where they are to where they want to be.\nGain proficiency in using a set of advanced competencies to bring more depth and richness to your conversations.\nKnow how to listen, ask powerful questions and elicit action.\nCommit to develop the characteristics of “masterful coaches.”\nKnow how to conduct an initial interview to design a powerful coaching relationship.\nLearn the three distinct tasks of marketing and how to get clients and grow your business.\nUnderstand the basics of setting up a business and coaching practice.\nWhy am I Qualified?\nI have a Ph.D. in psychology (University of Minnesota) and have practiced as a licensed psychologist and coach as well as teacher for decades, helping thousands of people improve their lives. I've also certified (in live workshops) around 1200 consultants and coaches from around the world to use programs I've created.\nI view my growth as a professional as a life-long journey. I’m always taking opportunities to learn, by books, online programs and live workshops. So much of what I know I learned after I got my professional degree and license, from more training in the practice of psychology, human development, and the field of coaching.\nAnd that is how I think about you. I am giving you some powerful models and skills to help you in your journey of becoming a coach or improving your coaching or influencing skills. You’ll incorporate what you learn into your skill set, and keep on learning.\nCoaching Makes a Difference\nLots of research shows that coaching makes a difference. A study by the International Coaching Federation in 2019, found that 99% of interviewees who worked with a coach found it rewarding and 96% said they would do it again. Furthermore, you don’t have to be a certified coach to make a difference. By going through this course, you’re learning skills in adult development, communication, and leadership that will expand your ability to influence people for good, no matter what your role.\nCertification\nBeyond the Udemy certificate of completion, I'm offering you a certification at the end of this course. This, like other courses in life coaching is not professional credentialing but rather evidence that you have completed this training in life coaching. You'll receive a certificate from The Human Development Institute (a company I co-founded along with my father years ago).\nAnd I do have a few expectations for you to receive your certificate. You must complete the entire course. You must show me that you have completed all of the application exercises (not quizzes) of the course by sending them to me by email. And you must submit a short essay explaining how you have or are using what you have learned in your coaching or life.\nSo thanks for taking time to read my landing page. It would be a real honor for me to accompany you in your journey of growth.",
