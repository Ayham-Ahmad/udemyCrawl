We will divide this journey together in different modules, where we are going to be increasing the difficulty as we advance through the course.\nAfter each module we will do some exercises and then together we will review how I solved the exercises.\nSince I believe that the best way to learn its by coding, at the end of the course, we will create three real life applications from the very start, and as we advance in time, I will be adding more project so can practice something new.\nTo sum everything you will learn in this course, we will learn:\n.The very basics of javascript. Variables, Operators, Array, Objects, Functions, Loops, Control structures.\nWe will learn how to manipulate the screen with the DOM, Events, Listeners, creating elements, Inserting elements and more.\nWhen we hit the advanced sections, we are gonna go deep intro Array, Objects, Prototypes, Functions so you can code like the professional do.\nWe will do exercises and at the end we will put everything in practice to build three real life applications.\nAnd of course we will cover bonus features like Requests, other frameworks like Jquery, we will talk about some third party libraries we can use to make our code better.\nES6, we will talk about most of the tools and updated ES6 provides.\nWhat about the instructor experience ?\nWell I've been around for 10 years now, built lots of applications for small projects and big companies like Citi,Fox, Dysney and a lot more.\nToday I work as developer for a major company developing applications in React or Angular mostly, but I like to teach in my spare time.\nWhat are the requirements?\n\nKnowing a little bit about HTML and CSS, nothing else.\n\n\nHow about the target audience?\n\nThis course is for everyone, if you know HTML and CSS\nIf you want to be profesional, this is the course for you.",

      "description": "Welcome to Creating CRUD API in Asp .Net Core and Entity Framework Core.\nAs the title of the course suggests, we will be creating an API that will handle Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting records from a database with the help of .Net Core and Entity Framework.\nThis course is all about CRUD operations. Step by step, we will set up a complete API to handle each of the operations in a multi-table database. For the next several hours, we will dedicate our time to interfaces, dependency injection, 1 to many and many to many database relationships, .Net Core Services, Models, Data Transfer Objects, Controllers and Actions, and of course, C# language. But don’t let any of that scare you. Quite the opposite.\nGet excited to learn a ton of new material and dive into the new world of .Net core. The course makes the learning easy with the mix of slow introduction of new material, repetition, and lot of practice! Every line of code is coded on camera, there are no mysteriously appearing blocks of code. Every step is explained every time, not just the first time you are introduced to it. And you will have a chance to practice what you learned in homework assignments.\nLet’s go over few details. First, let’s discus what this course IS\n\n\nIntroduction to creating CRUD API using Asp .net Core and Entity Framework.\nWe go over complete creation of CRUD API\nI introduce new concepts as they are needed in regards to progression of the project\nThis is a “follow along” and “practice what you learned” course\nNo code is skipped over.\n\n\nWhat this course is NOT:\nComplete or Deep Dive course\nLearn C# or .net core course\nTheory with explanation and code snippets\nReady to Deploy Real World project\n\n\n1. API are a huge subject, and so is net core and so is Entity Framework. In this course we will create a CRUD Web API in .Net Core. Nothing more, nothing less. Do not expect a dive into security, database optimization, asynchronous processing or anything else. Just CRUD. Pure and simple. We will work only with C# language inside .net core. So do not expect any javascript or fancy javascript framework or library. There is none in this course. But don’t expect to use this course as a “Learn C# course”. It is not that. I’m sure you will pick up some new syntax and C# tricks, but you do need some C# skills prior to taking this course. The project we use is a great starting point as it introduces several of the essential techniques and concepts, including often neglected CRUD operations on database tables with many-to-many relationships, this certainly isn’t a deploy-ready project.\n2. Remember, this is a course, and a practical tutorial. There are lot of courses that will show you the way into one topic and then quickly move on to another topic. This is not one of those courses! My goal is to lead you step by step, all the way, through the new territory inside .Net core and introduce you to new concepts and topics and help you learn them. And equally important is to then help you understand and retain what you learned through practice and repetition. If you prefer to be shown something once and then jump to another topic, then this course is NOT for you. If, on the other hand, you learn by combining explanation, coding along, and practicing the concepts while still having the option to see the instructor coding the whole solution, then this course is definitely for you!\n3. Did this ever happen to you? You took a course, and you just loved it! Everything was clearly explained, and you had lots of aha moments. Then the course ended…and suddenly, you felt lost. You felt like you learned so much while taking the course, yet could barely remember anything once it ended. Even when you revisited the source code supplied by the instructor, it just didn’t even seem familiar. Suddenly you felt like you didn’t learn anything. All the concepts that seemed so clear during the course felt totally foreign when you were on your own. In my experience, this is often the case when you simply take a course that starts exactly where your current skills are, but moves past the threshold of skills you are ready for. Like trying to go from crawling straight to sprinting. In this course, we go step by step, introducing new concepts slowly and only after you had a chance to practice what you learned.\n4. is this course for you? What skills should you have before taking it? If you are a programmer with decent understanding of OOP principles and C#, than you have the all the skills needed to benefit from this course. There are no prerequisites for .net core, or entity framework or how to create an API. Since you are interested in this course, I assume you heard of these things and perhaps played around a little too. That’s all that is needed to take this course.\nWell, let's code!",

To give you a foot up, I’ve gone all out to structure an all-encompassing, focused, AJAX course which I deliver to you in a way that will benefit you the most.\nMy course is distinguishable in teaching you \"why\" things work and not just \"how\" to do something mindlessly.\n\n\nWHO IS MY AJAX COURSE FOR?\nThis course is for everybody, from beginner and advanced coders. You won’t need to do any other course after mine to know what AJAX is.\nYou only need to know a little HTML and JavaScript. If you hardly know JavaScript, it may be beneficial for you to first do my JavaScript course.\nThis course can be taken alone (you don’t need to do any other course) to deeply understand what AJAX is.\n\n\nWHAT IS AJAX?\nAJAX allows you to update information on your web app dynamically, without a page refresh, and facilitates all-important streaming. A fine addition to your skill set. Smart and powerful.\nFor example. If a user wants to rate your product. You don't want the entire page to refresh when the user decides to give your product a star review, because of the unnecessary time it wastes, especially if your page is large.\nAnother example is a chat room. For obvious reasons, you don't want the page to refresh every time a new comment or a reply is posted.\nAJAX goes further than just updating data on your page without a page refresh. With AJAX, you can also stream data. Think about watching a video before the entire video has downloaded to your machine. Think about Google Maps where you only need to download data that is relevant to you. AJAX makes this all possible.\nCan you begin to see how powerful AJAX is, how essential it is today?\n\n\nKnowing AJAX is crucial if you want to become a fullstack developer, as it will allow you to make server requests and listen for incoming data, asynchronously. It has been noted that AJAX can get tricky at times, and I don’t dispute this, but with correct training which includes explaining the fundamentals in a simple way, you will, like me, learn to master and love AJAX.\nIf you want to become a full stack web developer, you need to know about AJAX and that’s what this course is all about.\n\n\nWHY IS THIS COURSE SO IMPORTANT?\nYour favorite apps today almost certainly use AJAX\nOther courses teach you about third-party libraries when using AJAX (like jQuery or Axios). This course will teach you how to use pure AJAX. No shortcuts. The real deal!\nMaking HTTP requests asynchronously is at the forefront of today’s web development. In fact, it is no longer advisable or the done thing to make HTTP requests synchronously\nKnowing how to make a server request and listen for a response, fast, is a vital skill for any web developer to master\nAs a developer, you deal with data. This data can take many forms, but the most common is XML and JSON\nYou can use AJAX to transport HTML, images, JavaScript, XML, JSON and even plain text over the internet. My course covers all this\nUsing AJAX saves memory usage and speed up your site. For instance, Google Maps uses AJAX, so instead of loading the entire page for every event it loads the required section that you are looking at only. How efficient isn’t that\nAJAX makes for better user experience, no argument in that\nEvery browser today has a built-in API (or object) called the XMLHttpRequest object, or the Fetch API. These objects give browsers the ability to communicate with servers, behind the scenes. This means a page can update (not totally upload) seamlessly without blocking anything on the user interface\nAfter completing this AJAX course, you will certainly be knowledgeable, confident and able to manage or help others make AJAX requests.\n\n\nLET ME SHARE MY AJAX KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU\nUnderstanding how AJAX works will equip you to be an awesome fullstack programmer, relevant for today. Using AJAX effectively will allow you to update parts of your website dynamically without a page refresh, stream, and save you download time, save memory space and therefore ultimately improve user experience.\nTake control through understanding and providing today’s users with the fast web experience they are coming to expect.\nMastering AJAX is challenging.\nIn this course, I take a deep-dive into explaining AJAX and how it works in a clear and simple way. Why do we need AJAX? Where did it come from? Why was the newer Fetch() API introduced? Why did we have to replace the XMLHttpRequest() object? Why do we have to use the new keyword when using the XHR object? What are Promises? What are Streams? What are the different data formats that we can transfer over the internet? By understanding (really understanding) these questions, and many more in the course, you will be able to easily build advanced websites and use the full stack process. You will be able to create dynamic sites that improve user engagement and experience.\n\n\nWHERE IS AJAX USED\n1. Form validation\nIt can be impractical and tedious to get validation results only after submitting a form. You can use AJAX in form validation, to give near instant real-time updates on validation.\n2. Fetching data from a database dynamically without a page refresh\nIf you need to fetch data from a database and display it to your page (like a blog comment, a chat response, or user's name), then using AJAX is a necessity.\n3. Sort or Filter\nIf you need to fetch data from a database and display it to your page (like a blog comment, a chat response, or user's name), then using AJAX is a necessity.\n4. Votes or Rating\nThe whole site need not to be refreshed if a user votes for something or rates your product. The voting and the displaying of the results can be done most efficiently using AJAX.\n5. Chat websites\nChatting is always real time. That’s why AJAX is a must have if you are going to make a successful chatting panel in your website.\n6. Blog Comments\nYou can load previous comments or can post a new blog comments with AJAX, easy peasy.\n7. Captcha\nTo make captcha (reloading captcha basically) AJAX is also the best platform to use.\n8. Streaming data & more\nAJAX is used to consume data before its fully downloaded (saving you memory space and time), and a whole bunch more!\nAfter experiencing my AJAX course, which I present in a fun way, you will be knowledgeable and confident.\n\n\nWHAT THIS COURSE COVERS\nThis course is comprehensive, covering the essential fundamentals of AJAX.\nAJAX refers to how browsers make HTTP requests to servers asynchronously, listen for results, and then do something with the data when it is received. AJAX is about speed and efficiency.\nYou can therefore think of AJAX as the engine that handles this entire back-and-forth process between the browser and the server.\nSimple enough.\nThe only problem is that in order to truly understand AJAX, you need to understand many other concepts, and this is one of the unique aspects of my course and style of teaching.\nSimple explanations and practical examples allow you to understand the following:\n\n\nHow to write AJAX the best way\nWhat is asynchronous code and how does it differ from synchronous code\nHow to use AJAX to make asynchronous requests\nWhat is the event loop in JavaScript\nWhat is XML and how does it differ from JSON\nHow to parse an XML file using the DOMParser\nWhat is the HTTP protocol and what is the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocol\nWhat are constructor functions\nWhat is the XHR object\nWhat is the new fetch() API\nWhat are Promises\nWhat are Streams\nWhy use Async/Await\nURL Interface, Request Interface, Header Interface and a whole bunch more!\nAnd yes, we will code real examples in a fun way, and look at how AJAX works (we use both the XMLHttpRequest object and the newer Fetch API).\nWhy should you learn so much about AJAX?\nBecause AJAX allows you to update certain parts of your webpage without a page refresh. It is used for streaming and more and today use of AJAX is essential on websites. It doesn't get better than that!\n\n\n*** A comprehensive AJAX course on Udemy ***\nSuccessful programmers know much more than memorizing a few lines of code.\nThey also know the fundamentals of how the browser & server interaction works behind the scenes which allows them to be fully creative, fix problems and enhance user experiences.\nThis is particularly true when it comes to AJAX.\nIf you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know, really know, how to make an AJAX request. You need to understand how AJAX was created, why the modern Fetch API was introduced, what Streams are, how Promises work and why the Async/Await keywords were introduced, and a bunch more!\n\n\nA UNIQUE APPROACH\nThis course contains practical examples and fun challenges and quizzes.\nUnderstanding how AJAX truly work is a vast topic. To get you up to speed, I’ve created a fun and comprehensive learning experience, embracing the content you need to know to succeed, and I deliver it to you in the best possible way to benefit you most.\nAnd I make use of the latest and best features of JavaScript and browsers along the learning journey so you can stay ahead in your business.\nYou’ll learn simple, yet very powerful strategies to make server requests from a client.\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” and “walk” AJAX by gaining an understanding of how you can build it and configure your request in practical ways. We dig deeper in every lecture, and this course has many bonus lectures which extend your knowledge base and test your skills with fun challenges.\nThis course offers you the best fundamentals and practical skills with AJAX. It can be taken alone (you don’t need to do any other course) to achieve your goals. You will emerge from this course with an advanced understanding and practical experience with making HTTP requests. It will take you to the point where you will understand what method (GET or POST) to use when sending data, how to define where the data goes, how to set up an AJAX engine and how to check for errors. This is awesome knowledge. This course will captivate you and catapult you to the next level and is an important part of your journey to become a leading Grandmaster in web development.\nIn this course you’ll learn everything about AJAX. From the basics of building an AJAX engine, all the way to learning about XML and JSON, asynchronous code, protocols, constructor functions, Promises, Streams, HTTP protocols, Fetch API, the Async/Await keywords, and various APIs such as Fetch, URL Interface, Headers Interface and Request Interface and a whole bunch more!\nIf you want to become a full stack web developer, you need this course!\n\n\nHOW IS THIS COURSE DIFFERENT?\nA unique feature of my course is the key detail I provide about how AJAX really works behind the scenes – a skill that every full-stack developer needs to master in order to utilize potential to improve.\nI use simple and effective lessons to take you beyond starter libraries like Axios or jQuery. Libraries are helpful but are not a replacement for knowledge and once you can write your own, you will better be able to use and amend library code.\nIn this course, I focus on the more fundamental aspect of AJAX. I use plain JavaScript which is the core programming language you need in order to use AJAX. Once you master using JavaScript with AJAX, then integration of a library can benefit you and may make sense.\nIn order to understand how AJAX works, I dive into topics such as protocols, constructor functions, asynchronous code, data format types (JSON and XML), Promises, Streams, error handling and how to use the keywords Async/Await with the Fetch API.\nPractice makes perfect\nTheory is theory … but there’s nothing like getting behind your computer and typing in code. That’s why we will be coding, laughing and pulling out our hair together as we code real life websites and exercises during this course.\nI love teaching and often use practical examples, which is why I start coding with you from the get-go. I will show you why the XHR object is a constructor function. I will show you the difference between JSON and XML. I will show you how to set up an XHR object, show you how to build Promises, show you what Streams are and how to use the new Fetch API. These concepts are all best learnt by coding up real examples. I can't wait.\n\n\nIS THIS COURSE FOR YOU?\nAbsolutely. If you fit in any of these categories then this course is perfect for you:\n#1: BUSY PEOPLE who want to become certified and confident in AJAX in the shortest time possible.\n#2: PROGRAMMING DESIRE. You want to advance in the world of programming.\n#3: FREELANCERS who want to know how successful developers build dynamic websites that can update information without a page refresh (like Twitter, Google Maps etc).\n#4: WEBSITE OWNERS who want to gain a solid understanding of how AJAX really works.\n#5: AGENCIES who want to up-skill their developers quickly.\n#5: EVERYBODY who wants to LEARN.\n\n\nWHY START NOW? ?\nRight this second, your competitors are learning how to become better web developers.\nWeb development is a blazing hot topic and not set to cool off in the future. We need the web more and more and advancements keep happening. But you have a distinct advantage.

      "description": "JAN 2023 UPDATE - This course has been completely updated to use Gatsby v5 & Headless WordPress with Gutenberg blocks / WordPress block editor.\nDo you want to improve your React JS skills and increase your value as a front-end developer?\n- \"Gatsby lets you build blazing fast sites with your data, whatever the source. Liberate your sites from legacy CMSs and fly into the future.\"\nLevel-up your React skillset by learning Gatsby.js with a WordPress backend! Gatsby JS uses React JS and GraphQL to generate and build static pages from a given dataset. This course will look at setting up WordPress as a headless CMS while using GatsbyJS to generate a blazing-fast server-rendered React website from WordPress data using the NEW WordPress block editor (otherwise known as the Gutenberg block editor). We'll building out custom posts, pages, menus, media, advanced custom fields, (and more!) using GraphQL to query that data.\nThat's right, we can actually query Wordpress data using GraphQL!\nThis course will cover Gatsby v5 with WordPress (using the NEW Gutenberg block editor). We'll create \"The Gatsby Garage\" in this course; a fictional classic car garage that buys and sells classic cars. While building this site we'll be covering so many different features of both Gatsby and WordPress.\nWe'll style our site using Tailwind CSS.\nWe'll dive into WordPress development by creating our own custom Gutenberg blocks using ACF Pro.\nWe'll implement forms where we'll store form submissions directly in WordPress using Contact Form 7 and Flamingo.\nWe'll implement dynamic searching of cars.\nWe'll deploy a live, production version of our site.\nPlus so much more!\nThis is the ONLY resource available online that covers using Gatsby & WordPress in this way.\nIt's recommended you have rudimentary knowledge of React. We'll be covering everything else from Gatsby.js, Wordpress, GraphQL, and Tailwind CSS!\nWhat other students are saying about this Gatsby & WordPress course:\n5/5 stars - \"Tom is a really nice guy with a good voice. His course is to the point and his response to the Q&A is awesome. I really like the fact that this course is not that long and shows you the endless possibilities that you can do with both Gatsby and the Wordpress API. For me this is a really good starting point in transforming a couple of websites without a CMS into a website with CMS\" - Edwin Boon\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"Tom's course is concise, clear, and gives you a good example of how to leverage your knowledge of React into fluency working with Gatsby.\" - Rob Thorne\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"Straight to the point, no pep talkings, Tom delivers the course as a sharing-experience between two colleagues. From his experience, without pretensions of teaching but showing what he finds to be helpful, he drives the lectures smoothly intertwining react, graphQL and wordpress with gatsby in a minimalistic way that can be approachable by anybody. Don't expect complicated ract patterns as that's not the point; I really appreciate that from Tom, keeping the focus on the whole architecture, not react/wordpress/graphQL specific. Just be aware we are not talking about the old web patterns, so make sure you have a sound understanding of react, wordpress and REST APIs; and by his exposition, gatsby explanations will naturally fall in place almost unnoticeable; you will be using it already.\" - Tony Guerrero\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"I had no idea this was possible! I usually use React but have never used WordPress before, but I found this was really well articulated. Brilliant course - thank you!\" - Carol Emma",

      "description": "Are you looking for a complete web development course that takes you from beginner to advanced? This 6-in-1 Web Developer Bootcamp is the only course you’ll need to learn web development from the ground up.\nWe cover everything in one comprehensive package: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap 5, Python 3, and Django. You’ll learn step-by-step in a beginner-friendly manner and build real projects to reinforce each skill. Every section is designed for absolute beginners, so no prior experience is necessary. (Even if you have some coding experience, you’ll discover plenty of advanced tips and modern best practices to level up your skills.)\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have the knowledge and confidence to create your own websites and full-stack web applications from scratch.\nUp-to-date and Cutting-Edge:\nWe keep the content fresh and relevant with the latest web standards. (Last updated August 2025) The HTML5 and CSS3 sections have been refreshed to include new features like responsive images using the <picture> tag and <figure> captions, modern CSS layouts with Flexbox and CSS Grid, and advanced CSS selectors.\nYou’ll also learn how to build responsive pages without relying on frameworks, so you understand core concepts of Responsive Web Design. (June 2023 Update: The Bootstrap section has been upgraded to Bootstrap 5.3, ensuring you’re learning the most current tools for building responsive sites.)\nWe use Django for the back-end, so you’ll be working with the latest version of this powerful Python framework. All the code and techniques are aligned with 2025 industry standards, so you’re learning modern web development practices from day one.\nHTML5 & CSS3 – Foundations:\nStart with the building blocks of the web. In the HTML5 & CSS3 module, you’ll learn how to structure pages with semantic HTML and style them with CSS. We cover all the essential HTML tags – headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, forms, iframes, and more – and how to bring them to life with CSS styling.\nThrough a dedicated project, you’ll build a complete website from scratch to practice your skills. Along the way, you’ll understand proper page structure, organize your files, and learn to embed media. We also dive into making your site responsive and mobile-friendly using CSS3 techniques.\nBy learning concepts like the CSS Box Model, Flexbox, and media queries, you’ll be able to create layouts that look great on any device. This strong foundation in HTML/CSS will set you up for success in all subsequent sections.\nModern JavaScript – Make Your Sites Interactive:\nNext, you’ll make your websites dynamic and interactive with JavaScript. We start from scratch – perfect for beginners – explaining variables, data types, functions, loops, and more in a simple, practical way. You’ll learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), which lets you change webpage content and styles on the fly.\nWe cover debugging techniques to help you fix errors and write cleaner code. Plus, you’ll get up to speed with modern ES2021 features (ECMAScript 2021), so you can write JavaScript using the latest syntax and best practices. To make the learning concrete, you’ll build useful features like a live form validation script, giving you hands-on experience in adding real interactivity to a webpage.\nBy the end of this module, you’ll be comfortable with core JavaScript programming and able to create richer web user experiences.\nResponsive Design & Bootstrap 5 – Professional Front-End Development:\nAfter mastering the basics of CSS and JavaScript, you’ll move on to Bootstrap 5, one of the most popular front-end frameworks. Bootstrap 5 will turbocharge your ability to create beautiful, responsive layouts quickly. You’ll learn how to use the Bootstrap grid system, components (like navbars, cards, modals), and utility classes to build modern web pages with less effort. We’ll solidify your learning by building three separate projects using Bootstrap: an Employee Management System interface, a Blog website, and a Professional portfolio site.\nEach project is designed to show you how to implement real-world features – from multi-column layouts and forms to navigation menus and image galleries – using Bootstrap’s pre-built styles and scripts. (All project files are included so you can follow along and review the code.) By completing these projects, you’ll not only understand Bootstrap in depth but also reinforce your knowledge of responsive design and front-end best practices. Your websites will be mobile-friendly and look professionally designed – a key skill for any web developer.\nPython 3 – Back-End Programming Made Easy:\nWith the front-end taken care of, it’s time to dive into back-end development using Python. Python is a powerful yet beginner-friendly programming language, and we’ll teach it assuming you have no prior coding experience. In this section, you’ll learn Python 3 fundamentals: how to set up your development environment, write simple programs, and gradually tackle more complex concepts.\nWe cover data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.), control flow (loops and conditionals), functions, and even the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. You’ll also practice working with files and modules, so you can organize larger programs. Each concept is demonstrated with examples relevant to web development, preparing you to use Python for building web apps.\nBy the end of the Python module, you’ll have a solid grasp of programming logic and syntax, which will pave the way for learning Django and server-side development.\nDjango – Full-Stack Web Development:\nFinally, you’ll bring everything together by learning Django, a popular Python web framework that powers the back-end of many modern websites. We start by guiding you through setting up a Django project and understanding its MVC-style architecture. You’ll learn how to create Django apps, define models for your database, and run migrations to set up those database tables.\nWe even show you how to create an admin/superuser account and customize the Django admin panel with filters – so you can easily manage your site’s data. With Django, you’ll build two major projects from scratch: a full-featured Employee Management System (EMS) web application and a dynamic Portfolio website.\nThrough these projects, you’ll get hands-on experience with URL routing, creating views and templates, and linking everything to a database. You’ll discover how to serve static files (like images, CSS, and JavaScript) in Django, and use Django’s template language & tags to display dynamic content elegantly.\nBy completing the Django module, you will have developed a true full-stack web application using Python – covering front-end, back-end, and database integration. This is where you transform into an advanced web developer, capable of creating your own web apps from idea to deployment.\nThis course is packed with practical exercises and projects to ensure you not only watch but also learn by doing. You’ll build a portfolio of websites and applications that you can showcase to potential employers or clients. Throughout the course, our approach is friendly and hands-on – we explain the why behind each concept, not just the how, so you gain a deeper understanding of web development.\nWhether you’re completely new to coding or looking to upgrade your skills, this course provides a one-stop solution. It’s beginner-friendly, but also rich with advanced content for those already familiar with the basics.\nBy enrolling in this bootcamp, you’re making an investment in yourself – by the end, you’ll have a broad and robust skill set in full-stack web development.\nGet ready to build awesome websites and web apps!\nJoin us now and start your journey to becoming a confident, job-ready web developer.",

Millions of developers have used (and continue to use) ASP.NET 4.x to create web apps. ASP.NET Core is a redesign of ASP.NET 4.x, with architectural changes that result in a leaner, more modular framework.\nASP.NET Core Web API is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. ASP.NET Core Web API is an ideal platform for building RESTful applications.\nHTTP is not just for serving up web pages. It is also a powerful platform for building APIs that expose services and data. HTTP is simple, flexible, and ubiquitous. Almost any platform that you can think of has an HTTP library, so HTTP services can reach a broad range of clients, including browsers, mobile devices, and traditional desktop applications.",

      "description": "Want to learn React and Redux applications the right way?\nGive my five minutes of your time, and I’ll explain why this course is the best time investment you can make to learn how to code React and Redux apps.\n\n\n*****\nWhen I was first learning web development and software engineering, I used courses, tutorials, stackoverflow threads, and public github projects. It was invigorating - teaching myself the skills that would start a career.\nBut I often found that tutorials only showed me what methods to use. I had to piece together examples, trying to figure out why examples were working - why bugs were popping up. Even when I found a code fix, there was often that missing layer of how the update addressed the problem.\nIt was a grind. The learning process could have been more efficient with better resources.\n\n\nFast forward five years, and I’m working as a full-stack software engineer at Zendesk in San Francisco. I often think back to those first couple years teaching myself web development.\nThe resources should have given me not only what to write, but why the fix addresses the issue, and how the code works under the hood.\nSo that is what I’ve created in this course. A React and Redux learning experience that will give you all three of those important aspects to understanding code: what methods to use, why to use those methods, and how those methods work under the hood.\n\n\n*****\nI really believe that taking this course will be a valuable investment of your time. I want to ensure that even reading this description is a good use of time. So I'm letting you know:\nThe first couple sections are free to preview.\nI believe that if you only end up doing this free content, you’ll still walk away with a complete React application, and a lot of valuable lessons learned.\n\n\n*****\nWhy take this course from me?\nAs mentioned before, I’m a full-stack software engineer working at Zendesk in San Francisco. I’ve also released 15 courses (a lot of them on React), with more than 170,000 students from 192 countries so far.\nI’ve applied the best practices of software I’ve learned in my career, and the feedback from my thousands of reviews, to craft the best learning experience possible for you in this course. You’ll find a healthy balance of conceptual theory, and practical hands-on experience. You’ll gain skills right from the get-go in the first section. And you’ll build interesting and relevant projects throughout the course.\n\n\n*****\nIn this course, you will:\nDive into React code right away. You will gain relevant experience as soon as the first section. Time is precious. And I want to make sure that you’ll never feel like you’re wasting it in this course. So in a matter of minutes, you will be writing React code in the first section, with a fully completed app by the end of it.\nUnderstand how React fits in the big picture of web development. In the second section, you will take an important step back and examine how React fits in the big picture of web development. You’ll build a React project from scratch - discovering all the layers that are in between the supplies that supports the React app, and the browser which displays the React app.\nCreate relevant and compelling React apps. I’m betting you’ll find the apps both useful and interesting. Useful ones like the portfolio app will help you both learn React, and be valuable as a completed project for your software engineering and web developer profile. Fun ones like “Music Master”, will make coding lively, giving you apps you want to show off to your friends and family.\nLearn Redux the right way, breaking it down. Redux is a must with React. But it has a much higher learning curve, since the concepts are more complex. In this course, every Redux method is going to be taken one step at a time. You’ll dig deeper into how the methods work under the hood. You’ll learn more than what methods to use. You’ll learn how those methods work individually and together. And you’ll learn why methods are written in a certain way, and when they should be applied. That way, you have the deep understanding that will empower you to write React and Redux apps long into the future.\nBuild more awesome apps! As you learn redux in the later sections, the projects will remain interesting and relevant. You’ll make a mini React game, using an external API. And you’ll create a React app that has multi-user functionality! Supporting multiple users is a staple of so many web applications - but can be surprisingly hard to pull off. But you’ll find the solution in this course both elegant and extendable.\nExplore backend web development. I think it’s important to learn essential backend skills as a React and web application developer. With React app, you’re often using APIs to supply the content of your application. So having the ability to create your own backends, and APIs, will give you the capability to make React apps of any kind, for your own unique use cases, long after you complete this course.\nDeploy your React applications. The projects you create in this course will be deployed to production. That way, you can share your the products of your work with anyone you like!\n\n\n*****\nIn summary, you should take this course if you want to learn React and Redux in a time-efficient way, while building relevant and engaging projects.\nOnce again, the first couple sections are free to preview. Even if you only complete the free content, you’ll walk away with a full React app, and lots of valuable lessons learned.\nSee you there!\n\n\n*****\nPromo music provided by Ben Sound.",

My opinion is that when you see some simple example working and when you try it by yourself - you already have the tools to investigate further and find exactly what you need to be done.\nI've been doing drupal-development and theming for many years now - so I know what exactly are the topics that are needed the most - I tried to include all of those and in the end I wrapped all that was learned in an example website that we will convert together form a static html-css version into a working Drupal 8 theme.\nLets conquer together the Drupal 8 theming layer!",

      "description": "PLEASE NOTE THIS COURSE TEACHES ANGULAR 1. IF YOU WANT TO LEARN THE LATEST VERSION ANGULAR 2YOU CAN CHECK OUR COURSE \"Learn Angular 2 Development By Building 12 Apps\"\nTHIS COURSE IS GOOD FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO MAINTAIN ANGULAR 1 CODE.\nThe most comprehensive AngularJS training program is here. We love this amazingly powerful framework for web apps and we promise you will love this course. By the end of it you will understand the concepts behind Angular design and will be able to create you own websites and apps. AngularJS was initially released in 2009 and it has been growing rapidly ever since. If you want to be a web developer you must learn AngularJS and with time it is going to be as essential as HTML. Our Angular course will focus on important features such as decoupling DOM manipulation and to decouple client side from the server side implementation in web apps.\nSo why use AngularJS?\n• AngularJS uses directives to add new mark-ups to HTML and turns static HTML files in to something dynamic. It is an innovative approach to incorporating HTML and developing big web applications.\n• AngularJS organizes views, controllers, directives, filters and such other elements in to separate modules. This division becomes convenient for building and managing an application.\n• AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection system and is unit-testable.\n• AngularJS uses data-binding directives to provide a projection of the model to the application view. It automates synchronization of data between model and view components.

It is simple but straight forward, for devs with a small experience within java and spring.\nVery well described course for JMS.\nExcellent to learn JMS with Spring MVC and Spring Boot.\nVery good explanation for the beginners with real example. Thank you very much\nstraight and simple\n\n\nApache ActiveMQ is open source message broker developed in Java. Have you ever thought how WhatsApp works ? One to one  messaging and one to many messaging techniques you will learn in this course. This course is not about how WhatsApp works but its all about Apache ActiveMQ.\nMany times you are in need where two or more of your Java applications need to communicate with each other. There comes the JMS (Java Messaging Service) in picture. You can execute time consuming task of your application in asynchronous manner using Apache ActiveMQ. This you will learn in this course when I will show you Real World Example with JSON message.\nIn this course you will learn Java Messaging Service (JMS) with Apache ActiveMQ.\nYou will learn Apache ActiveMQ.\nYou will get idea how WhatsApp works.\nYou will learn to publish the message to queue from Java Console App, Spring MVC and Spring Boot App using JMS template. This message can be in any format like simple text OR JSON OR XML.\nYou will learn to consume this message from Queue to Java Console App, Spring MVC and Spring Boot App.\nReal time example with JSON message will give you better idea on when to use Apache ActiveMQ.\nYou will learn to publish the message to topic from Java Console App, Spring MVC and Spring Boot App using Spring JMS Template. This message can be in any format like simple text OR JSON OR XML.\nYou will learn to consume this message from Topic to Java Console App, Spring MVC and Spring Boot App.\nYou will learn difference between Queue and Topic so that will clear you on when to use Queue and Topic.\nYou will learn to create message publisher and consumer for both Queue and Topic using Spring MVC and Spring Boot separately.",

      "description": "WebSockets are a technology that allows developers to build highly interactive, extremely fast web applications. Since WebSockets are supported by all modern browsers, and have been for years now, there is no reason why they cannot be implemented on any modern web application. This course will show you how to work with WebSockets with Go.\nWe will work with two kinds of WebSocket technologies: first, with simple calls directly from our web application to all connected browsers, where all functionality is handled by our application. The web application we'll build is a simple chat application, which will allow users to chat back and forth, and will show the list of connected users, updated in real time.\nNext, we'll take advantage of a Pusher compatible server (or Pusher itself, if you prefer) and use that server as a message broker between our web application and all connected clients.\nI am a firm believer that learning how to use a particular technology works best when applying it to a real-world situation. All too often, tutorials and courses over simplify what they are trying to teach, and create an artificial environment where things are so simple that what is being taught looks easy enough, but you immediately run into problems when trying to implement it on a more complex project. So, to implement and learn about WebSockets and Pusher, we'll build a web application which monitors remote servers and hosts, and notifies us in real-time when a service goes down or comes back up again. We will send notifications in real time using WebSockets (which will update the appropriate content on the pages being viewed by all connected clients), by email, and, as a bonus, we'll also learn how to send notifications using text messages (SMS) with  Twilio.",

      "description": "WebXR brings both VR and AR to the browser. The API has the massive forces of Google and Amazon behind it so it looks like immersive experiences, using only a browser, are going to make a huge impact in the near future. WebXR works great with Oculus headsets, including the Oculus Quest 2 and the Chrome Android browser is already supporting the API for both AR, Augmented Reality, and VR, Virtual Reality, experiences. But WebXR only harnesses the sensors on a mobile device and creates an agreed definition of how to use this data. To actually visualise 3D content you need a WebGL library and there is no better one to use than Three.JS. This mature Open Source library has many users around the globe and is supported by many developers. Three.JS is at version 118 at the time of writing and is a robust, production ready library. Recently WebXR support was added to the library. Making it easy for developers to create immersive experiences.\nIn this course you'll learn how easy it is, using Three.JS, to create VR and AR experiences. To get the best from the course you will need to be comfortable with JavaScript coding. No other prerequisites are required.\nThe course is split into 10 sections.\nIntroduction - I introduce the history of WebXR, give you a basic primer for those of you new to 3D concepts and show you the Three.JS website and the WebXR examples.\nA Three.JS Primer -  is for Three.JS novices to bring you up to speed on the library.\nAn introduction to WebXR using Three.JS - we look in earnest at your development environment and create our first WebXR examples.\nUsing complex assets with Three.JS - most things you create for immersive experiences will need complex assets and sourcing, editing, loading and working with them is the subject of section 4.\nThe WebXR API - gives a review of the WebXR API.\nCreating an Architectural Walk-Through - in section 6 we start to create real world examples of immersive content with an architectural walk-through.\nPlacing a Product in a Room - WebXR lends itself to showing real products in a person’s home and that is the topic for section 7.\nUsing WebXR for games - VR is perfect for games and we look at the basic ingredients of a game using WebXR in this section.\nUsing WebXR for training - covers the important topic of using VR for training.\nConclusion - we look at some WebXR examples to inspire you and review what you’ve learnt.\nThe only tools you'll need are a code editor, in the course I use Brackets, freely available online. The course includes comprehensive resources and code examples. Each code example comes with two versions, one for you to code along with and another that is complete in case you hit a problem. I show you how to use GitHub to host your development work on a secure server so you can easily test your work on a headset, such as an Oculus Quest\nIt’s going to be fun.\nYou get a 30 day money back guarantee, so you're nothing to lose, go virtual today.\n\n\nReviews\n\"This is by far the best guide to Three JS, nothing but fun and clearly explains the parts needed for a 3D app. Thanks Nik for taking the time on this! Can't wait to see where this course take me!\"\n\"Thanks for creating the course\" - Mr Doob, the creator of Three.JS\n\"We all Nik fans were waiting for this one when he previously announced it in the Facebook group. And he didn't disappoint us.\"\n\"Best Intro/History Video Ever\"\n\"Love it so far! The lessons are concise and to the point. The videos' length seems quite optimized, meaning they are not terribly long yet are filled with just enough information about what's going on. The supplied course project files constitute a valuable facilitation on the way through the course.\"\n\"It starts with the basics and then progress to advanced topics. I like the pace and the explanations. Great course!\"\n\"Great course, love the well-chosen examples, just what I needed!\"\n\"Excellent course, it took me by surprise how well documented and the high quality content from Nicholas , highly recommended. Cheers!\"\n\"I haven't heared before so simple yet pleasant narration of threejs app development now I realize how talented the author is.\"",

It’s also estimated that by 2022 organizations from around the globe will spend close to $400B annually on cloud services.\n\nOnce students have a grasp on use cases and cloud terminology, the course dives into the characteristics of cloud computing, followed by an introduction into the concept of virtualization. Here students learn how software is used to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware, to facilitate the deployment of virtual machines, and scalable cloud resources.\nThe modules also include a detailed overview of cloud computing service models including, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), (Platform as a Service), and Software as a Service (SaaS) to illustrate the numerous ways that cloud computing is used in small to enterprise level projects. The course also explores several cloud deployment models including:\nPrivate cloud\nCommunity cloud\nPublic vs. Hybrid Cloud\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nAs students gain familiarity with the integral elements of cloud computing, we explore the rise of AWS as the reigning king of cloud computing services. Students will learn the history of AWS, followed by a number of compelling statistics which illustrate the importance of perusing a career path specializing in the AWS platform.\nThe last module of this course offers a hands-on practical guide to establishing an AWS account along with an overview of AWS account basics. This includes exploring the following topics:\nAWS Global vs. Regional services\nCreating AWS Billing alerts\nEnabling Multi-Factor authentication for account security\nCreating IAM Users and Groups\nConfiguring a custom password policy for the AWS account\nIf you have a passion for cloud computing or foresee yourself working as a cloud practitioner, this course is an excellent place to start. By the end you will have gained valuable insights that are integral towards your journey in this vast, ever evolving space.",

      "description": "There’s no way around it. If you want to gain a competitive edge in UI/UX design, web development, or anything to do with mobile and desktop web apps, then you need to know Angular JS. Better yet, you need to know Angular 2, the latest version. This Angular 2 crash course will refresh your memory and get you updated on the essentials of the latest version. And if you’re just getting started with Angular JS, don’t worry this is the perfect introduction too.\nGet Up to Speed with Angular 2\nUnderstand Angular 2 and how it can help you as a developer\nCode an Angular 2 project with an online IDE\nGet to grips with Angular 2’s many powerful features\nImprove your UI/UX design and development skills\nDiscover what’s new in the latest version of Angular\nUpgrade your Programming Skills\nWith 71 lectures and 5 hours of content, this Angular 2 online course will give you a thorough understanding of how Angular 2 solutions are designed, administered, and developed. If you’re a web, mobile or service app developer, architect, UI designer, tester or administrator, or if you just want to know how to get Angular 2 projects up and running, then this is the course for you.\nYou don’t need any Angular 1 or UI experience to take this course, although if you’re familiar with creating web UIs with normal JavaScript tools (jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.), or object-oriented scripting languages like Java, C#, Python etc., you’ll already have a head start.\nThe course will begin with an introduction to TypeScript, the Cloud9 IDE and using Angular 2 modules. Then you’ll get stuck into Angular 2’s components, building a UI and binding your data. After that things get a little more challenging with a breakdown of advanced component concepts and component composition. From there you’ll jump into services, web services, and routing before setting up Angular 2 from scratch.\nBy the end of this course you’ll be able to set up and get going on your own Angular 2 projects quickly, easily, and efficiently.\nAbout Angular JS\nAngular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications. It’s a structural framework that allows you to use HTML as your template language, and is JavaScript based. It has many high-power features like data binding and dependency injection that eliminates huge chunks of coding for the developer, making the process much more efficient and streamlined.  It’s mostly maintained by Google and a wide network of users.  Angular 2 is the latest version of the framework, first released in September 2014.",

      "description": "This course is designed to teach students the fundamental concepts and skills needed to build modern, responsive web pages. The course covers key topics including the basic structure of a web page, building mobile responsive web apps, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax, and building various web components using these languages.\n\nFirst, students learn the structure of a web page and how to create mobile responsive sites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This will include an introduction to HTML, which is the markup language used to create basic web page structure. Students will learn various HTML elements and how to use them to create headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and other static content.\n\nNext, students explore CSS, the language used for styling and layout customization. CSS works in conjunction with HTML to create visually appealing site designs that stand out. Here, students learn to effectively use CSS selectors, properties, and values. This will include an introduction to responsive web design and using CSS media queries to create web pages that adapt to different screen sizes.\n\nIn addition to learning the basics of HTML and CSS, students will also learn JavaScript, the programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. Students will learn the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to use JavaScript to dynamically manipulate page elements. We also explore JavaScript events, loops, arrays, and other programming concepts.\n\nThe course will also cover more advanced topics such as building navigation components using HTML, creating forms using the post vs. get method, and working with DIVs, and IDs. We also cover styling images, backgrounds, borders, and text on top of images in CSS. Students will learn the different CSS positioning options (static, relative, absolute, fixed, float) and how to use them to create complex web page layouts.\n\nIn the JavaScript section of the course, students learn the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to use JavaScript to manipulate the elements of a web page. Here we explore, events, loops, arrays, and other programming concepts such as operator precedence, objects, and functions.\nOnce students have a handle on the foundational three languages, we dive into React JS – a powerful JavaScript library used for building stylish, dynamic web applications and UI components. Through a series of hands-on projects, students will build a fully functional connect-4 game, a calculator, and an e-commerce site complete with categories, checkout features, and more.\n\nThis course is designed for students with little or no previous experience in web development, but it can also be beneficial for students who have some experience and are looking to improve their skills. With the knowledge and skills gained in this course, students will be prepared to take on more advanced web development projects and to continue learning about new web development technologies.",

APIs provide the fabric through which systems interact, and REST has become a common style for APIs. The depth, breadth, and ease of use of ASP.NET Coremake it a breeze for developers to work with it to build robust Web APIs. This video course takes you through designing RESTful web services and leverages the ASP.NET Core to implement these services.\nStarting from the basic philosophy behind REST, you'll go through the first steps of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service. Taking a practical approach, each chapter provides code samples that you can apply to your own circumstances. It brings forth the power of the latest .NET Core release, working with ASP.NET Core. It then goes beyond the use of the framework to explore approaches to tackling resilience, security, and scalability concerns.\nYou will start with the basics of REST and end with building a .NET Application for your RESTful web service.\nAbout The Author :\n\nFabian Gosebrink is a Software Engineer, Microsoft MVP, Microsoft Technology Ambassador and Microsoft Certified Specialist in web application development as well as a trainer and international speaker.\nFabian develops and teaches developing web applications with Angular, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core and Typescript/Javascript.",

      "description": "Updated November 2018\nThis course details how to use one Amazon Lightsail (via AWS) instance to run multiple websites and apps (including WordPress) across a number of domains. Several hosting stacks will be explored within this course, including the Bitnami's LAMP Stack, Bitnami WordPress Stack (a variant of the LAMP stack), and the Plesk Hosting Stack.  All of these stacks are available from Amazon Lightsail with just one click!\nAmazon Lightsail is considered an easier-to-use and entry-level implementation of Amazon's AWS cloud service.  It has the specific objective of creating and running a Virtual Private Server (VPS) as opposed to the dozens or hundreds of potential use cases with AWS EC2 instances.  Lightsail is an ideal cloud solution for individuals who self-host and for small-to-midsize businesses looking to minimize I.T. costs without sacrificing performance.\nIf you want to begin to leverage the power of the cloud for your online business or hobbies, or if you've ever felt intimidated by your web hosting providers and too scared to cut costs by running your own setup, this course will help you break the dependency on overpriced shared and reseller hosting.  You'll increase your knowledge of cloud computing and cloud server instantiation while building functional skills with Linux and Apache, despite needing absolutely no Linux, Apache, or cloud computing knowledge to begin.\nAfter viewing this course, you'll be able to complete the following tasks on Lightsail:\nCreate a Virtual Private Server on Amazon Lightsail using a Bitnami or Plesk stack\nInstall one or multiple WordPress blogs mapping to different domains, subdomains, or directories\nEncrypt your website for users with SSL/TLS certification to use https:// instead of http://\nHost one or multiple static websites with just one VPS Instance\nHost one or multiple dynamic websites with just one VPS Instance\nPoint domains to your hosted websites\nAdd additional storage space to a VPS Instance\nBackup and scale your VPS Instance\nDon't miss out and don't be locked into high web hosting and VPS costs which can reach over $100/mo.  Instead, learn the fundamentals of Amazon Lightsail and be able to power your own websites on Amazon's cloud starting at just $5/mo.  Take back control of your web sites, and sign up for Hosting Websites with Amazon Lightsail today!\n\n\n====================\nSoftware Utilized\nThe course uses the least expensive Lightsail packages from the AWS cloud, specifically we utilized the US$3.50 and $5.00 per month plans (formerly $5 and $10, respectively).   Also introduced is how to use free software—such as PuTTY and FileZilla— for Instance management, but Lightsail comes with its own built-in and web-based SSH terminal, so no external software is necessary in many cases.\n\n\n====================\nCourse Changelog:\nJuly 2018 - Updated videos to show additional options for working with the WordPress installer module\nMay 2018 - Major update to include a second LAMP stack, the Plesk Hosting Stack.  This is an alternative stack to the one provided by Bitnami and it provides a web-based dashboard.  Three domains can be managed for free by the Plesk Hosting Stack on Amazon Lightsail.  Larger licenses are available from Plesk.\nMarch 2018 - Added SSL/TLS encryption and certification on the Bitnami LAMP Stack using Let's Encrypt.  Certbot is introduced as a command line tool for automating the SSL process with Let's Encrypt.\nFebruary 2018 - How to Connect via macOS Terminal lesson added for Bitnami LAMP Stack.  Also added a new section for Bitnami's LAMP Stack on running one or multiple WordPress installations that can map to domains, sub-domains, or directories.\nJanuary 2018 - Course launched focusing entirely on setting up the Bitnami LAMP Stack on Amazon Lightsail to host one or multiple websites.",

      "description": "For the past couple of years there hasn’t been a bigger brake through in the IT world than the one that the Blockchain technology has made. The extremely fast growth of the industry, market and the technology itself leads to enormous shortage of programmers that truly understand the blockchain. Along with the blockchain smart contracts have emerged and with them - Solidity.\nThe idea of this course if to give you the easiest and best practices in becoming a blockchain developer. We will be focusing on the smart contracts development with Solidity in the Ethereum ecosystem.\nYou will learn to create your first smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain even if you are a complete beginner and you know nothing about programming or Solidity.\nI will show you the online IDE Remix to create your first smart contracts and we will go through all the features that Solidity provides us as a programming language.\nYou will also be able to set up your environment to start coding with Solidity on your local machine. I will show you what settings and configurations I used to set up my VSCode and how to successfully install Truffle on Windows.\nAfter that I will teach you the basics of the Truffle Framework and how to make it work with Ganache as your own private Ethereum blockchain network.\nWe will also test out our Solidity smart contracts behavior with unit testing with Chai and Mocha. If you are a serious developer you need to know that your code is working the way you expect it does.\nWhen you are finished you will be able to create your own first decentralized application with Solidity and Truffle.\nWhile other courses are filled in with unnecessary information that make them hard to navigate through and leave you confused, this course will take you step by step from a complete beginner to a master of Solidity and smart contracts creation in the Ethereum ecosystem.\nIn this course:\nWe’ll learn the essentials of the Ethereum blockchain. How to make and protect our wallets as well as mastering Metamask as our main Ethereum wallet in the creation of our smart contracts.\nWe will go through the basic and advanced concepts of the Solidity language. We learn in depth how you can build your own smart contracts and test them out instantly in Remix.\nI will teach you how to use Metamask as your Ethereum wallet and I will give you security advice that will keep your crypto assets secure.\nWe will also go through how you can develop your own DApp with Solidity and the Truffle Framework + Ganache as your virtual blockchain and the right way to set up your development environment.\nI will teach you the basics of the IPFS network and we are going to create our own dApp application for file storage (UPDATE)\nWe will learn the essentials in DApp development with Solidity as well as unit testing of our smart contracts, so we can make sure our code behaves the way we expect.\nYou will have assignments that will help you out understand the material better with actual practice and not only passive consumption. After you finish this course you will fall in love with Solidity, Ethereum ecosystem and the smart contracts creation.\nYou will learn how to deploy your dApp using Heroku and make it go live on the web",

Make sure to check these as they contain important information. Check the BONUS section for more information.\n\n\n*** 5500+ STUDENTS JOINED ALREADY. NUMBERS DON'T LIE - ENROLL NOW ***\n\n\n***** IMPORTANT UPDATE *****\n\nNew section has been added. This is where all the new BONUS lectures will be uploaded. I have published new lectures there so make sure to check these out - We are UPDATING your Bootstrap 4 version to latest.\n\nNEW: Student Request! Request a feature and it may be added as a BONUS lecture.\nHave you always wanted to build an amazing looking website but lacked the skills? Maybe you’re already familiar with HTML and CSS but you couldn’t start coding an actual website because you didn’t have the idea or the design concept in mind? Maybe you’ve always wanted to code that template but weren’t feeling comfortable? What if I told you that, with only basic understanding of HTML and CSS you can actually create wonderful websites if you knew time-saving tricks?\n\n\nReviews:\n\n\"I can say that, so far, i learned a lot. especially the resources are very informative and the final website design looks really cool. Thanks for taking the time explaining the very details.\" - Виктор Williams\n\"the pace the instructor is going is really adaptive, i absolutely have no problem coding in real-time. all of the instructions are step by step and the instructor actually makes sure that you understand his concept before he moves on. waiting for you next course!\" - Jay Doughlas\n\nIn this course I will try to cover every concept of building a website from start to finish. We will be using the most popular CSS framework called Bootstrap 4 (we will get in-depth about Bootstrap). We’ll start with wire-framing our design (I will tell you why this is very important). Then, step by step we will design and code all the sections that the website will be able to offer. We will spice up the website with creating amazing animations using tricks and techniques that I will teach you. You will be creating animations on hover and animations on scroll that will make your website look like a piece of cake. That’s not all though, we will also create smooth scrolling on our website so it can offer even better user experience for the end-user.\nTo summarize – We will be using a free wire-framing tool to create our prototypes. HTML and CSS will be used to code and build our website. Bootstrap will help us create a responsive website that will be accessible on smaller screens and mobile devices. Also, we will even use a little bit of JavaScript and jQuery to do some event driven things like animations on scroll or trigger animations.\n\"I was a bit skeptical at first when i bought this, but once I started to dive into the course, i can say that buying this course was one of the best decisions i have made in my short web development career\" - Emilio Pet\n\nSo, why choose me as an instructor? Why buy this course among all those other courses? It’s because I will offer you a different approach to your learning experience. Each lesson you will be presented with a task that you will have to accomplish on your own. Each lesson you will be asked a question that you should answer before moving on. I believe that good teaching is done through student practice and involvement. At the end of each section you should take the quiz to check up on your skills and see if you’re ready for the next section. At the very end of this course, I will challenge you with an ultimate task – create a project as big as the one we were creating throughout the course and show it to me! I will be glad to see it. So, why wait? If all this sounds great to you, Press on “Take this Course” and start learning today! 100% money-back guarantee!",

The fact that code examples all work puts nearly every programming book and most web courses to shame.\"\nPaul Wolfson, Principal Investigator, Dallas Legal Technology\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"The Ultimate Web Development course is the most user friendly course I have encountered to date. Additionally, the lecturer, Dr. Richard Stibbard is extremely committed and accessible. Oh! If only all the on-line lecturers could take a page from his book.\"\nUrich Wilmot-Hoyte\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Solid Full Stack Development course - I have been through numerous other books and courses trying to get up to speed on CSS, JQuery, Ajax, and PHP, and so far this is the most effective. I think there are two keys to it's success. First, the app developed throughout the course is reasonably complex and whether its a particular look in CSS or behaviour in jQuery, it accurately reflects what modern apps really look like. Next, there is enough hands on coding in all the tools that it really begins to stick. HIghly recommended for anyone wanting broad introduction to modern web development that really touches almost all the bases.\"\nDonald Brummel\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTaught by freelance developer and experienced online educator Dr. Richard Stibbard, this course takes you in easy steps through the entire process of building an up-to-date web interface which updates its database and HTML on the fly without the need for page refreshes, rather like the 'Add to Favourites' function on Youtube or Trivago's hotel search.\nYou will learn how to:\nstructure a website using HTML5\napply styling with cascading stylesheets (CSS)\nconvert a static site to a dynamic one using PHP\nremove inefficient duplicate code\nuse PHP functions to isolate variables\nuse MySQLi and prepared statements for secure database queries\nmanipulate page content immediately with jQuery\nupdate the database silently with AJAX\nupload the project to a web host and deal with important security considerations.\nPDF version of the course allows full-text search\nThe course is equally suitable for beginners or more advanced students. For beginners there are step-by-step instructions which take you through every step of the project until all the principles have been covered, and then hand over to assignments which allow you to put into practice what you have learned before you see the solutions.\nFor learners already familiar with some aspects of web design and development who want to move onto specific points more quickly, incremental working files and clear guidance are provided at every stage, allowing you to skip lessons you do not need and rejoin the course at any point without losing track of the necessary code.\nWith studio quality audio, widescreen HD video, and incremental versions of the source code, this efficiently organized course teaches up-to-date coding techniques and gives comprehensive coverage of an important aspect of modern web development.",

      "description": "*** BEST DOM COURSE ON UDEMY ***\nMaster Event Handling: Understand capturing vs. event bubbling to control how events flow through the DOM.\nDOM Hierarchy: Learn about parent, sibling, and child relationships to manipulate elements effectively.\nDifferentiate Objects: Grasp the differences between host objects and native objects for better coding practices.\nDOM Extensions: Discover how to enhance the functionality of your web applications.\nEvent Delegation: Optimize your event handling with this powerful technique.\nBUILD A PROJECT: we build a project together to enhance your knowledge\nWhat This Course Covers\nThis advanced Document Object Model (DOM) course empowers you to take control through understanding. Crafting an interactive web experience can be challenging, but together we will explore the intricacies of DOM events.\nI'll help you answer questions like What exactly are events? Why are they essential? What types of events can we listen for, and how does event bubbling and capturing work? By answering these questions and more, you’ll gain the skills to access and manipulate the DOM effectively, allowing you to create dynamic applications that enhance user engagement and experience.\nThis course is the second and final installment of a comprehensive 2-part program. While Course 1 lays the groundwork for coding dynamic sites, this Part 2 dives deeper into the world of DOM events. You’ll emerge with a solid understanding and practical experience in handling events within the DOM, setting you on the path to becoming a true Grandmaster in front-end web development.\nWhy You Need This Course\nIf you've ever wondered how to add animation and life to your web pages, understanding DOM events is crucial.\nThe DOM allows users to interact seamlessly with your application—enabling them to ADD, EDIT, DELETE, or UPDATE content without frustration. We’ll start by defining what an event is, distinguishing between event listeners and event handlers, and then explore various ways to implement events in your code.\nWe won’t stop there!\nWe’ll delve into advanced topics like event propagation (capturing vs. bubbling) and the powerful concept of event delegation. This course also covers essential subjects like DOM extensions and object hierarchy.\nKnowledge is Power\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to \"speak\" and \"navigate\" the DOM confidently, understanding how to manipulate it in meaningful ways. Each lecture digs deeper into essential topics, with bonus lectures that extend your knowledge base and challenge your skills.\nThrough hands-on examples, this course helps you grasp the DOM piece by piece while utilizing the latest JavaScript features (like the new classList API) so you can stay ahead of the curve.\n*** An advanced Web Development DOM course on Udemy ***\nSuccessful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of code. They also know the fundamentals of how events work on your website behind the scenes. If you’re wanting to become a full stack developer, you need to know how to work with various events in the DOM. You need to know what an event is, how to listen for it, and more importantly, how to react to events when they happen.\nI want you to become a successful front-end programming Grandmaster.\nI want you to be able to apply what your learn in this course to your webpage.\nThis course is perfect for you.\nA unique view\nUnderstanding the DOM is a vast topic. To get you up to speed, I’ve spent months thinking about where to focus content and how to deliver it to you in the best possible way.\nYou will learn \"why\" things work and not just \"how\". Understanding advanced topics within the DOM (like event types, capturing, bubbling, delegation, host vs native objects, etc.) is important as it will give you infinite possibilities. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. You will be able to create apps that are customizable by the user. You can even allow the user to drag, move, and delete elements. Can you begin to see how important the DOM is?\nHow is this course different?\nThere are lots of great courses that focus on web development. Pity they never get into the detail about how the Document Object Model (DOM) works behind the scenes – a skill that every full-stack developer needs to master.\nIn this Part 2 course, I focus on the more advanced topics of true web development in the front end. This includes understanding what events are, looking at object hierarchy, understanding the different event types, what capturing and bubbling is, and how you can use the concept of event bubbling to streamline your code and make your job of creating dynamic websites easier.\nPractice makes perfect\nTheory is theory … but there’s nothing like getting behind your computer and typing in code. That’s why we will be coding, laughing and pulling out our hair together as we code real life websites and exercises during this course in order to appreciate and master the DOM.\nI love practical examples, which is why we build simple pages and analyze the DOM together.\nThis course is FULL of practical examples, challenges, and we even build an entire project website from start-to-finish (yep, this includes building the HTML and CSS together too).\nIs This Course Right for You?\nAbsolutely! This course is suitable for all levels of web developers. If you identify with any of these categories, this course is perfect for you:\nYou want to explore programming fundamentals and how JavaScript can enhance your web pages.\nYou’re eager to learn how successful developers create engaging user experiences.\nYou seek a solid understanding of advanced front-end concepts.\nYou want to understand JavaScript on the front end before diving into backend frameworks like Node.js.\nYou have a basic grasp of the Document Object Model (DOM) but want to learn how events work at a more advanced level.\nWhy Start Now?\nWeb development is a hot topic right now! Your competitors are already enhancing their skills—don't get left behind. This course offers memorable learning experiences, actionable tactics, and real-world examples that will set you apart.\nWhat You Get\nLifetime access to all tutorial videos—no hidden fees or subscriptions.\nQ&A support for any questions you may have.\nQuizzes and challenges to reinforce your learning.\nDownloadable lectures for offline viewing.\nLet’s embark on this exciting journey together toward becoming a professional web developer!

I've done my best to do it in an engaging and friendly way that presents the fundamentals as we build the site!\nWe will create a website in Umbraco which exercises the following features:\nDocument Types - these are the blueprints for creating pages of content\nTemplates - the \"razor\" (ASP.NET MVC) html page templates\nThe use of document types to hold data - site settings, email templates\nThe Rich Text Editor - create your own custom formats in CSS\nThe Umbraco \"Grid\" - a flexible page layout (it's built on Bootstrap!)\nMacros - wrap up your views into widgets that can then be added to the \"Grid\"\nDependency Injection - Umbraco 8 comes built in with a DI framework. Use it for referencing your own custom services\nSeparate custom code out into a separate project\nSurface Controllers - just like ASP.NET MVC controllers but they play nice with Umbraco\nForm posting - create forms that post to surface controllers that have bespoke logic in them\nI'll not only go through how to do things the Umbraco way but I'll also show you some techniques I've picked up over the years:\nHow to wireframe up a design\nThe usefulness of dependency injection\nA generic Email Service for sending out different template driven notifications\nHow to interop with APIs - using Twitter as an example\nUtilising Bootstrap (v4) to get a head start with layout and utilise components\nRegistration and Membership process\nI'll be using Umbraco V8 for the duration of this course - which was the latest version as we went to print.",

      "description": "Hi, I am a Front End Engineer and a Udemy Instructor  with over 15,000 students and 5000+ 5 Star Reviews!\nIf you are looking to build interactive web pages with JavaScript then I have released a course just for you :)\n\nLearn DOM methods and properties to use JavaScript to make your web page interactive.\nOn top of that this course will have two projects to get started with and many more on the way!\nThis isn't the only course you should ever take on learning to create interactive web pages with JavaScript but it should be your first!\nJavaScript has become an essential web technology along with HTML and CSS, as most browsers implement JavaScript. Thus, You must learn JavaScript if you want to get into web development, and you must learn it well if you're planning on being a front-end developer or on using JavaScript for backend development.\nWhat makes JavaScript important?\nHere are five reasons:\nIt’s everywhere. It’s seen adoption from large companies (think: LinkedIn, Google, Netflix) that not only decided to use JavaScript, but to rewrite their entire applications using it. This isn’t a tiny investment. It displays a great deal of trust and faith in a language to choose the risk of rewriting an application over using an existing one. These risks are being taken by industry giants, and for good reason.\nIt’s flexible. It’s not just a front-end language. As a back-end language, JavaScript provides great scalability and performance because of its event-driven architecture, more so than many of its competitors from various languages. It also allows for a seamless transition for developers from the back end to make edits on the front end. JavaScript’s adaptability is something that draws more and more people each year. It can provide you with great interactions on the front end, asynchronous operations, and is not bound to any browser or operating system. Its possibilities are endless due to this dynamic and adaptable nature.\nIt’s easy to learn. With the only requirements being a text editor and a browser, anyone can start learning JavaScript. And while learning JavaScript, you’ll interact with HTML and CSS, which are the building blocks of any website.\nIts community. Because of its popularity, the JavaScript community is heavily populated with experts, novices and resources. New ideas and libraries spring up daily to fix new problems, improve fixes of existing problems or introduce new methods. The community is constantly innovating, and through this JavaScript evolves.\nIt’s in demand. If you want to be a programmer, you need to learn JavaScript. Because it’s so widely used, you will be hard-pressed to find a job listing for a developer that does not require it. It’s the de facto language of the web, other than HTML/CSS of course.",

Or maybe you are a web development enthusiast looking to convert PSD designs into fully functional websites? Or just a beginner web developer/designer who is looking forward to learn how PSD and HTML5/CSS3 work together?\n\nEither way, PSD to HTML5 conversion is a MUST-HAVE skill for any aspiring or experienced web developer/designer out there.\nThis PSD to HTML5 conversion course will take you from a complete beginner to a knowledgeable developer who is feeling comfortable converting PSD designs into fully functional and responsive HTML5 websites.\nThis is a lot more than PSD-to-HTML course. It is one of the most comprehensive web design/development courses out there as its very content-rich and features a lot of topics. We’ll start of with Photoshop and learn what are the basic starting steps of converting a PSD design into a HTML5 website. We will firstly understand and study the PSD design and after that slice it, cut it and collect the images. Then we’ll start coding our HTML5 markup to prepare the development of the website.\n\nDuring the development stage, we'll learn a lot of things when styling our design: floats, positioning, width, custom columns, fluid design, full-width backgrounds AND MORE!!!\n- We’ll be creating stunning animations FROM SCRATCH including an iPhone turn-on animation that looks very slick. We’ll use various famous libraries to create the remaining breathtaking animations on scroll and polish our website to the maximum. However, that’s not all.\nWe’ll then dive into creating our website responsive to fit any screen size and mobile device. We will be coding CUSTOM media queries to control the behavior of our website on smaller screens. I’ll be guiding you through a way to create a responsive navigation bar menu from scratch using basic programming techniques.\nWe’ll then jump into a brand new section that will get updated over time and which will include special tips and advanced techniques to convert problematic PSD designs into working websites.\nIn this course you will take a finished PSD design and learn how to convert it to create a fully responsive HTML5 page with pure CSS3 from SCRATCH. No responsive frameworks like Bootstrap! (My earlier course covers that!)\nI believe that the only way to become a successful student of this course is through practice and involvement. That’s why you will be presented with quizzes and interactive questions throughout the course. After completing, you will be challenged to take a PSD design, use the skills that you’ve gained in this course and create a breathtaking HTML5 responsive website that you will be proud of!\nSo, what are you waiting for?

I'm enjoying every second of this.\n— PHILIP MURRAY\nI have completed many Udemy and Skillshare tutorials. This one is the most outstanding one that I have seen thus far. It is doubtful that it could be topped. This is a superior tutorial. Amazing.\n— JOSEPH APPLEGARTH\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nWhen does the course start and finish?\nThe course starts now and never ends! It is a completely self-paced online course - you decide when you start and when you finish.\nHow long do I have access to the course?\nHow does lifetime access sound? After enrolling, you have unlimited access to this course for as long as you like - across any and all devices you own.\nWhat if I am unhappy with the course?\nWe would never want you to be unhappy! If you are unsatisfied with your purchase, contact us in the first 30 days and we will give you a full refund.\nDo I get course certificates?\nYes, a course certificate will be generated at the end of each course you complete! Along with projects, certificates are a way you can prove your work on LinkedIn.\nDo I have to show up at a particular place or a particular time?\nNo, each course happens online, and you can take it from any place where you have an internet connection.All lectures are prerecorded so you can watch them at any time that works for you. Of course, you can also enjoy all the lectures on your phone and tablet.\nHow much time do I need in order to take each course?\nYou can spend as much or as little time as you want. With Lifetime Access, there is no expiry. You aren't required to complete the course within a certain time period. You can follow the course at your own pace and always come back to the videos later when you want to revisit the material or work on improving certain skills.\nWhat if I’m not good with technology?\nThe majority of Mammoth Interactive students are complete beginners. Even if you feel like you know nothing about technology, you won’t feel left out. All technical concepts are described in simple terms while avoiding unnecessary jargon. Each course starts from scratch and builds up your knowledge substantially in steps. Students from age 5 to 70 have successfully completed our courses. And just in case you get stuck, you can always ask any questions under each lecture, which will be promptly answered by one of my team members.\nWhat if I'm an experienced developer?\nStack Overflow's yearly developer survey found that developers over age 50 start to make less than their younger counterparts. Don't become one of the people affected by skill stagnation. Enroll in our school to future-proof your career for life. If you're an experienced developer, you will still benefit from Mammoth Interactive courses. By starting from scratch with each course, you will revisit the fundamentals and undo bad coding habits. You'll also find it easier to pick up new languages, making you able to take more courses and broaden your skillset.",

With Nuxt, you can code less but do more.\nYou don’t have to be a Vue expert to study Nuxt. Just basic Vue knowledge is enough.\nIn the first section, we will create a Vue app using Vue CLI 3.\nThe file structure created by Vue CLI 3 is very similar to the one used in Nuxt. They even have the same mechanism of generating pages.\nWe will recreate the same app using Nuxt and show you the similarities between Vue and Nuxt.\nYour previous Vue knowledge can help you quickly understand the working mechanism of Nuxt. Once you have understood how Nuxt works, you can master it in no time.\nOur official Nuxt study includes five sections.\n1. Nuxt basics\n2. Nuxt plugins and modules\n3. Nuxt routing system\n4. Nuxt context\n5. Data exchange with the backend program (Express.js)\nAt the end of each section, there will be an infographic article to help you review everything you just learned.\nEach review is followed by a practice session where you will practice and apply everything you have learned by creating a real app. You will also learn many new skills in this process, including how to handle cookies and create a membership system.",

I was looking for an alternative to axis2/rampart for SOAP ws-security, and I'm glad I found this course. As a nice bonus (for me at least) this course also covers REST security. 5/5. - Ionescu Alexandru\nI have done or finished both the courses on Web Services By Bharath and it is so knowledgeable and give me a real time experience,I can even use the same examples in my company.Now I am planning to do the course on Create REST APIs using Spring Data REST by Bharath. Friends go for the course and don't waste your time on thinking too much. - Vivek Kumar Gupta\n\nAwesome, completed up to Encryption & Decryption, clear explanation. So far so good. - Brady Adams\n---\nAll source code is available for download\nResponsive Instructor - All questions answered within 24 hours\nProfessional video and audio recordings (check the free previews)\n----\n\nThis course is a continuation of my \"Java Web Services\" course which is the most popular course on that topic on UDemy as well as on the internet.\nAre you interested in learning and implementing advanced Web Services concepts such as Security ? Then this course is for you.This is a incremental course.I will adding several new topics such as OAuth,Async Communication and more relevant topics that are not covered in the Java Web Service course.\nDo you want to learn the four key security areas and address them in your SOAP Web Services?\nThis course will simplify things with concepts and step by step implementations . By the end of it you will:\n1. Understand the four key security areas\n2. Use the WS-Security standard to secure your services\n3. Implement Authentication\n4. Understand what Encryption is and why it is required\n5. Learn how to use the java keytool to generate security key pairs\n\n6.

With frameworks like Angular 2 and React, we’ve seen a massive move in the industry from the imperative programming paradigm to the functional and reactive paradigms. To be successful in modern development, it’s paramount to have an understanding of how these paradigms work, and the tools that we can use to express them.\nThis course is an introduction to the core concepts of the reactive programming paradigm. We will use the RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) library as a way to explore this mindset and develop an understanding of how to think reactively. Reactive Extensions are used by many companies - from Netflix to Microsoft and even Github!\nDid you know that Angular 2 uses Reactive Extensions for its asynchronous operations? If Angular 2 is your goal, then learning RxJS is an absolute must!\nEven frameworks that don’t use RxJS directly, such as Facebook’s React, are modeled after this paradigm - and integrate with it flawlessly.\nIf you plan on moving forward with modern development, reactive programming should be your next step. With the knowledge in this course, you will gain confidence in working with modern frameworks and libraries. Even if you’re not interested in writing web applications, the concepts here apply everywhere. Reactive Extensions itself has many ports to other languages that you can easily move between!\nThe concepts in this course offer a new way to reason about code - and will apply no matter what language, platform, framework, or library you wish to use! If you want to be on the forefront of modern web development, then this course is your next step!",

      "description": "What is this course covering?\nThe course covers everything you need to become a blockchain developer. Students of this course will learn what Ethereum blockchain is and how it works on the base level and from a developer's perspective.\nStudents will learn what smart contracts are and how to create them. Smart contracts are going hand in hand with dApps(decentralized apps). The course covers them as well.\nThe front end for dApps covered in the course use React library and Next JS framework. CSS and design are built with the help of Bulma and Tailwind frameworks.\n\n\nThree real-world applications are created in the course.\nFaucet Application: This straightforward app encompasses React JS, Solidity, and Ganache. It provides an introduction to the fundamentals.\nMarketplace: This advanced application involves Next JS, Solidity, and Ganache, along with deployment to an actual blockchain.\nAdopt Pet: A bonus section focusing on React JS, this section utilizes Hardhat to manage the smart contract and deploys it to the Polygon network.\nSolana NFT Minting App: This bonus section teaches you to build an NFT minting application on Solana using React, TypeScript, and the Metaplex Umi framework. You'll integrate Solana wallet adapters, create NFT metadata, and mint tokens on the Solana devnet.\nEvery part of application creation is well explained and documented.\n\n\nFaucet application:\nThe initial application in the course provides students with a hands-on experience to learn the fundamentals and core concepts of the Ethereum network.\nThe application's frontend is developed using the React library and the Bulma framework. The Truffle development environment and Ganache (a private blockchain) are utilized for smart contract creation.\nThe faucet application allows users to donate and withdraw funds from the smart contract. Users can interact with the smart contract through a website connected to the blockchain network via the Metamask wallet.\nThe primary objective of this first application is to provide a practical learning experience while covering the basics in an enjoyable manner.\nThe application addresses several essential questions, including:\nUnderstanding Ethereum, transactions, and the blockchain.\nExploring the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and its components like bytecode and storage.\nLearning how to create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps).\nDiscovering the process of integrating smart contracts with React.\n\n\nMarketplace application:\nThis application focuses on building an interactive marketplace where clients can purchase courses using Ether digital currency, allowing students to select their preferred products.\nHaving covered the basics in the previous application, the emphasis now shifts toward practical development within the Ethereum network. The topics become more challenging, and the lectures revolve around practical coding aspects.\nThe second application encompasses various features, including a marketplace page that displays real-time updates of Ether currency and course prices compared to the US dollar. Additionally, there is a dedicated modal window for placing orders, an email hashing solution to safeguard client privacy, an order view with filtering and pagination options, and more.\nFor the development of this application, the Next JS framework is employed, with Tailwind serving as the CSS framework. Next JS internally utilizes the React library, offering ease of use and default server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities.\nWhile SSR brings numerous benefits, it also poses some challenges regarding integration with the blockchain. However, the entire integration process of Next JS with the blockchain is comprehensively covered, explained, and documented. The final application will be deployed on the Internet, and the smart contract will be deployed on the live Sepolia Test Network.\nThe notable topics covered in this application include:\nIntegrating Next JS (with SSR) with Web3 and the blockchain.\nDeveloping a more complex smart contract.\nImplementing email hashing and order verification features.\nProviding a testing solution that covers every aspect of the smart contract.\nEnabling pagination and filtering for orders.\n\nAdopt Pet Application:\nAs an additional component, this section consolidates the knowledge you have acquired in the course and applies it to a React JS app. Hardhat is utilized for smart contract management, ensuring a clean and straightforward application architecture.\nThe emphasis is on minimal design and simplicity. By the end of this section, you will have the opportunity to deploy a smart contract to the Polygon blockchain.\n\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\nEthereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone, but in the first place, It also powers applications that everyone can use, and no one can take down. It's the world's programmable blockchain.\nEthereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with some big differences.\nBoth let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable so that you can use it for many digital assets – even Bitcoin!\nThis also means Ethereum is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games, and apps that can't steal or censor your data. It's the Future.\nWhat is Solidity?\nSolidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that govern the behavior of accounts within the Ethereum state.\nSolidity is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\nSolidity is statically typed and supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features.\nWith Solidity, you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.\n\n\nSolana NFT Minting App (Bonus Section):\nThis bonus section introduces you to building NFT applications on the Solana blockchain. You'll create a React-based minting app using TypeScript and the Metaplex Umi framework, allowing users to connect their Solana wallet, upload artwork, and mint NFTs directly on the Solana devnet.\nKey topics covered:\nIntegrating Solana wallet adapters with React\nBuilding NFT minting workflows using Metaplex Umi SDK\nCreating NFT metadata following Solana standards\nHandling blockchain transactions and wallet signatures\nWorking with decentralized storage for NFT assets\nBy completing this section, you'll expand your Web3 development skills beyond Ethereum and gain practical experience with the high-performance Solana ecosystem. This broadens your ability to build NFT applications across multiple blockchain platforms.",

Gutenberg also known as the block editor is based on blocks. So your post will be composed of some blocks and each block will have a purpose. You can have a block that displays a button or an image or some text and so on.\nIn this course you will learn everything you need to know in order to create custom blocks for the block editor. We will start by a simple block and then we will create some more complex blocks.\nIn order to gain the most out of this course you need to have WordPress theme/plugin development knowledge. Javascript knowledge is required for this course. You should be familiar with basic JavaScript concepts and preferably the recent ES6+ versions. ReactJS knowledge is also required for this course. So concepts like component state, hooks and basic react concepts should not be new to you. Also advanced concepts like higher order component knowledge would be ideal however it will be discussed briefly in the course. Redux knowledge is also ideal. Not all blocks will require using redux, however in some blocks we will use redux heavily. So it would be ideal if you are familiar with redux concepts like stores, actions, reducers and so on.\nThe course content will go as follows:\nFirst and before any coding we will discuss some design guidelines that you should follow when designing a block.\nWe will take a look on how your Gutenberg post is saved in your database and what happens behind the scenes in order to construct your ReactJS based UI from the content saved in the database.\nIn Section 2, we will create a WordPress plugin. Inside this plugin we will register out first Gutenberg block. We will also use a tool provided by WordPress called wp-scripts in order to process JS and CSS files in this plugin. We will also integrate tools like ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint and Husky for an improved development workflow.\nIn section 3, we will take a quick look on some stuff that you can do in your WordPress theme that will allow you to modify/add some features in the block editor.\nIn section 4 we will create a simple block. However in this simple block we will learn a lot about what we can do in a block.\nIn section 5 we will use our knowledge to create a more complex block with some advanced features. These features include how to add blocks inside of other blocks, how to handle images and many more.\nSection 6 will be about creating dynamic blocks. So blocks can be static or in other words only generate some static HTML. But also they can be dynamic for example they can fetch something from the database.\nSection 7 will discover more about the redux-like data stores in the block editor. We will see how to use the existing data stores and also create our own store.\nSection 8 we will see different ways that we can follow in order to manage metadata in Gutenberg. We will manage metadata using a block. And we will also learn how to create a custom sidebar plugin and manage metadata in this sidebar.\nIn the final section we are going to discuss various topics like: context, patterns, templates, formatting API, filters and internationalization.",

      "description": "Fully Updated in January 2025.\nGutenberg was launched as an integrated part of WordPress 5.0.  Gutenberg was the name given to the new block editor that replaced the Classic WYSIWYG editor that we'd been using since the early versions of WordPress.\nGutenberg is the editor of choice as you create the content for your WordPress posts and pages.  There's blocks for headings, blocks for images, blocks for text.  And blocks for just about anything else you'd want to add to a web page.  You can build your posts and pages by dragging the blocks onto, and around, the editor.\nBut Gutenberg had a huge update with version WordPress 5.9.  Full Site Editing!  This is often abbreviated to FSE and quite often just Site Editing, but what does this mean?\nUsing the same block editor (Gutenberg) you've been using for your content, you can now edit and design the headers and footers for your website. So you design the bit at the top of the page, the bit at the bottom, and the bit in the middle.  That means you now have total control over the design of your website.  That is Full Site Editing. You can also create a complete block theme from scratch, and I'll show you how.\nThis course is designed to get you up to speed quickly with Full Site Editing in WordPress.\nIn this course:\n\n\nWe take a deep dive into using the Gutenberg editor to create better-looking web pages as well as a complete study on the Full Site Editor itself.\nThe course showcases the Twenty Twenty-Five theme, which is the latest block theme from WordPress.\nYou'll learn how to use the Document Overview and Command Palette to enhance your workflow.\nYou'll learn about the normal, wide, and full-width options you can use in your design, and how to set these values yourself.\nYou'll look at the box model so you fully understand padding and margin, and when to use each of these to add space around your design elements.\nWe'll cover the most common blocks, like paragraph, image, video, button, cover, query loop, columns, table, etc., but also advanced design blocks like Groups, Rows, Stacks, and Grids.\nYou'll explore template hierarchy and how themes consist of templates and template parts.\nYou'll learn to use Global Styles, including typography (where you'll be able to install and use any Google font you want), color palettes, backgrounds, shadows, layout and spacing, and even how to change the default appearance of any block.\nFollowing the detailed study of Gutenberg, we'll create a fully functional block theme from scratch, building the template parts and templates required to run a full site. During this process, you'll understand which template you need to create for any post type on your site. We'll even look at using the query loop in a more advanced \"manual\" way, so you can include multiple query loops on a page for more design flexibility.\nAt the end of the course, we'll study all of the other block themes WordPress created, from the Twenty Twenty-Two theme to the Twenty Twenty-Four theme, and how each built on the previous theme, culminating in the latest Twenty Twenty-Five theme that we used and studied during the course.\nA final section of the course looks at a few \"extras\" that were requested from students of previous versions of the course, like creating a landing page, adding custom CSS to a block theme, and even how to add a sidebar to your theme or just to specific areas of your website.\nBy the end of the course, you'll have the confidence to take over the design of your own website, using Gutenberg to design the header, footer, and content.  You'll be on your way to mastering Full Site Editing.",

      "description": "WELCOME TO MY \"COMPLETE E-COMMERCE COURSE - JAVA, SPRING, HIBERNATE AND MYSQL\"!\n\n\nOverview\nThis is a course about building a E-Commerce website using modern Java Full Stack technologies. Specifically, it's about building an online bookstore.\nIt's about bookstore, but the modules developed in the course is similar for all E-Commerce website. Those modules contains:\n\n\n- User Signup and Login\n- User profile management\n- Product Management\n- Shopping Cart\n- Order checkout and order history\n- Automatic email confirmation\n\n\nAs you can see, those modules are the basics for pretty much any E-Commerce website. Check out the preview lesson for a quick tour of the website!\nFrom the architecture perspective, the system is divided into two parts - Bookstore and AdminPortal. Bookstore is the front-end website that customer will be using for submitting orders while AdminPortal is used for administration purpose. Presumably they will be running on two servers. The good side is the two apps are decoupled in some way so that they can be managed separately. The drawback would be that we need to maintain two copies of the code. We can see that throughout the course.\n\n\nWhy should I take this course?\nBecause you probably won't find another course out there on similar topic with similar length and detail. This course covers a wide range of topics on building an e-commerce website . It is a step-by-step guide with most of the code hand typing.\nThere are students from my other courses complaining that if I copy and paste the code and then explain it, tough it can save some time, students will lose track and drive. That's why I'm developing stuff in this course from scratch and step-by-step.\n\n\nWhat does the technology stack look like ?\nAs this is a full stack development project, we will develop the code for both front-end and backend. A considerable amount of work will be on developing the front-end code using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Thymeleaf, bootstrap and etc. Thymeleaf is the latest Java template engine, which is supposed to replace previous JSP way (JSP is discontinued but is still being used out there) and it is the official template engine backed by Spring Framework, though it's not the only one you can choose. The backend side will be using latest Spring technologies - Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data and etc. Then, we will have MySQL as database. MySQL is powerful and free to use and serves as a good database candidate in plenty of commercial apps out there.\n\n\nWill I get the source code?\nSource code and database scripts are provided in the very beginning of the course. Besides, throughout each lesson (I would say most lessons), the source code will be provided to the progress of the lesson. Yet, I still suggest you to develop with me and take the source code as a reference.\n\n\nWhat will I get by the end of the course?\nThis course shows an example of building an E-Commerce app from scratch. By the end of the course, you will get exposed to various topics and building modules that you need for a basic E-Commerce web app. With the hands-on practice, you will gain a lot of experience that is beyond just the theory. Nevertheless, you can potentially deploy this web app on Heroku as a showcase (see my other course on deploying Spring Boot app on Heroku). This will definitely be helpful during interview if you can showcase this app.",

      "description": "The Spring Framework is very popular with large companies. In fact, Spring is the most popular Java framework.\nDid you know, a core reason for Spring's popularity with companies is it's IoC engine?\nA typical company will deploy their Spring Framework application in at least 3 different environments. Having a development, test, and production environment is common.\nThe problem developers face is each environment is different.\nDifferent server names.\nDifferent databases.\nDifferent user accounts.\nDifferent passwords.\nIn this course you will learn how to use Spring's IoC container to deploy your application in many different environments. Through Inversion of Control, your Spring application can wire itself for the needs of each environment.\nYou'll start the course learning advanced configuration options of the Spring Framework.\nNext, the course takes a DevOps approach. You'll see how to deploy Spring Framework applications in different environments.\nIn development, it's common to use a H2 in memory database. Of course, this database is only temporary. Not something you'd want to use for your production deployment.\nDo you want to see how to flip a switch and use MySQL? Flip another switch and your app can be using a RDS database managed Amazon. You can do this with no code changes.\nThe course also looks as best practices used in enterprise software development.\nUsing a continuous integration server is a best practice. Jenkins is the most popular CI server. You will learn how to install Jenkins on a Linux server. A server you provisioned in the AWS cloud.\nOnce you have Jenkins running on your AWS server a best practice is to setup Jenkins on a friendly URL.\nJenkins is a Java application running on port 8080. You don't want to be typing some IP colon 8080 into your browser to reach Jenkins.\nWant to know how you can use Apache and Route 53 to reach your Jenkins server your own URL? To a domain you own?\nDocker is an exciting technology. You will see how to leverage Docker to host your own Artifactory Maven repository. We'll use Artifactory to manage build artifacts produced by Jenkins.\nJust for fun, we will also use Docker to setup a MySQL database server. We'll do this by provisioning a Linux server on AWS, installing Docker on it, and then deploy MySQL in a Docker container.\nWe'll also provision an application server we can use to run our Spring Boot application. You will pull the Spring Boot jar right from Artifactory and tell it to connect to database server.\nAmazon AWS also has managed MySQL databases. This is their RDS service. You will see how to provision your own RDS database. We'll then reconfigure our Spring Boot application to connect to the RDS database.\nThere is a lot of fun and challenging content in this course. You will learn:\nHow to manage Spring properties.\nWhy you want to encrypt sensitive properties, such as passwords.\nHow Spring Profiles are used.\nUsing YAML to configure Spring.\nTo provision servers on Amazon AWS.\nLogging into your servers via SSH.\nHow to use the yum package manager to install software on Linux.\nHow to configure your own Linux service.\nHow DNS works, and how to use Route 53 to setup your own host names.\nHow to use webhooks in GitHub to trigger your builds immediately.\nWhy you don't want to use root accounts for your application.\nConfigure Jenkins to perform a Maven build.\nUse Jenkins to deploy build artifacts to Artifactory.\nThis is a very hands on course.\nTo get the most out of this course, you will need an account on AWS. You should be able to use the AWS free tier to complete the course assignments.\nTo get the most out of this course, you will  need a domain name. You will need to have control of the domain. Without this, you will not be able to configure subdomains in Route 53.\nThe course does leverage AWS for their cloud services. The skills you learn on the AWS platform will transfer to most corporate environments. AWS is used to mimic the typical company.\nThere is a lot of exciting content in this course!\nDevOps is not an easy area. Many different technologies are involved.\nIn this course, you will see how easy it is to manage Spring Framework applications in complex corporate environments.",

      "description": "Become the Expert!\nAre you a C#.NET developer ready to take the plunge into microservices?\nMicrosoft's ASP.NET Web API 2.0 for .NET Framework is an outstanding, flexible platform for creating microservices.  Unfortunately the official documentation is sparse, and you are left trying to piece together your understanding of this powerful platform by scouring the Internet for articles and examples that are often too academic, outdated, and not aligned with the practical needs of real-world services that must integrate with potentially many different kinds of clients and data center environments.\nIn this course, I will take you step by step through all of the layers of Web API to give you a full understanding of the platform components you will likely need to use in a modern, production-ready web service.  Examples and exercises are drawn from practical, real-world scenarios of the sort I personally faced while creating commercial web services-- and chances are you will face them too!\nWe'll cover all of the core Web API features like\nsecuring your API parameters,\nextending the Web API to perform custom processing,\nerror handling,\nauthentication and authorization.\nWe'll look at ways to test and document your service. We'll dig into performance improvements using techniques like caching and asynchronous operations. You'll get a clear understanding of how to make your service work correctly behind application proxies such as load balancers that every commercial web service uses in the real world.\nI've put together everything you need in one place to create professional, production-ready Web API services. This course will save you many hours of time and give you a much deeper understanding of everything Web API has to offer than trying to learn a piece at a time through Google-- so get a jump-start now and become the Web API expert on your team!\nThe Experience\nThe course experience is intended to feel like a more intimate, one-on-one setting.  I want you to feel like you and I are both sitting down in front of your computer, reviewing some code in Visual Studio and having a friendly discussion about how things work, the pros and cons of a technique, and practical issues you might face when you start writing your own services using the framework.\nThe goal is not just to learn about the details of Web API.  The examples and assignments are designed to create a web service mindset and give you of ways of thinking about the construction, performance and deployment of your web services, especially in scenarios that have unique cross-platform integration requirements.\nThe Tech Stack\nThis course specifically uses the standard .NET Framework version of Web API, which usually runs under IIS on Windows servers.  If you are using .NET Core instead of .NET Framework, then while the concepts in this course are similar, the specific syntax for .NET Core Web API is very different.  This probably isn't the course for you if you are specifically targeting .NET Core.\nFor testing, we'll be using Fiddler, PostMan and Swagger (via the Swashbuckle library).\n\n\nReal World Focus\nMy \"Real World\" courses specifically target working developers solving actual problems in typical business programming scenarios.  They are uniquely designed to cover areas you don't find in other courses on similar topics, from the specific viewpoint of developers who need to translate theory into practical application to solve the kinds of problems the \"overview\" courses don't help with.  I assume you already know how to program and have built working commercial systems-- you won't find any \"Hello, world\" here!",

      "description": "Learn JavaScript the Right Way — From Scratch With Real Projects\nSo you’ve learned some HTML and CSS — now you're ready to bring your websites to life. That’s where JavaScript comes in.\nThis is a JavaScript course for beginners who want to understand how the web really works — not just follow tutorials blindly.  You'll go from the basics of JavaScript programming all the way to building fully interactive websites.\nWe start at the beginning — how to write and run JavaScript — and slowly build your confidence through real-world JavaScript projects, including a live form validation system you’ll create from scratch.\nBy the end of this course, you won’t just “know a bit of JavaScript” — you’ll be able to write your own logic, respond to user input, and create smart, interactive features using only vanilla JavaScript.\n--\nWhat Makes This Course Different\nNo libraries. No frameworks. No fluff.\nJust pure JavaScript, explained simply, with step-by-step training, hands-on coding, and practical examples that apply to real projects.\nYou’ll write real code in a real editor. You’ll debug, test, and manipulate the DOM with confidence. And most importantly — you’ll understand why your code works, not just what to type.\n--\nWhat You'll Walk Away With\nOnce you finish this JavaScript fundamentals course, you'll know how to use JavaScript where it actually matters — in the browser, on real websites, with real users.\nYou'll be able to handle clicks, input fields, form errors, and animations. Whether it’s a small effect or a full form validation system, you’ll build it — and you’ll understand every line.\nYou'll stop guessing. You'll stop copying code you don't understand.\nInstead, you’ll think like a developer. You’ll solve problems, fix bugs, and build with confidence — using clean, modern JavaScript.\n--\nYou don’t need to be a coder to start. You just need curiosity, a browser, and a little bit of patience.\nJoin now — and let’s turn your static pages into dynamic web experiences, one JavaScript function at a time.",

Are you interested in writing your own Smart Contracts in the context of building a complete DApplication with NextJs and Ethers?\nDo you want to learn about Hardhat and Infura, very powerful DApp development tools for connection blockchain to the front end? Do you prefer as a learner to jump right into project and save valuable time by building along a project and advancing your knowledge by being hands on? If so, then this is perfect course is for you!\nIn this course we build a complete NFT Marketplace DApp from start to finish. Every line of code we write is coded out live in real time and explained (we even go deep into the libraries and frameworks and connect the dots). We start off by installing and initializing everything we need to build a DApp with a local development environment and run through each dependency and library and break it all down. Once we're nice and warmed up, we immediately dive into demonstrating and reverse engineering a fully functional NFT Marketplace example from Nader Dabit.\nWhat you will learn in this course:\nSetting up the DApp development environment\nCreate a Nextjs app using the create-next-app utility to recompose the React library\nCompile and Deploy Smart Contracts to Blockchain with Hardhat functionality\nImplementing industry standard NFT smart contracts for DApps with the ERC721 OpenZeppelin Contracts\nUsing functional programming to maintain DApp state\nIPFS data hosting with Infura Blockchain Suite Project Management\nImplementing an NFT Minting form on the front end to lock in Metadata and Files for the DApp\nLooping, iterating, and filtering through hash tables with Javascript and Solidity\nModern Card Design and UI with Tailwind and CSS\nHooking up a web3 provider to the Polygon and Ethereum network\nRunning full unit testing with Chai\nAnd much more along the way!\nCourse Set up and Tools\nThis course develops its DApp project and source code with Visual Studio Code, a free (and pretty sweet) text editor for code. You can of course use your preferred IDE and any operating system you like... well as long as it's either Max OSX, Windows or Linux.\nIs this the right course for you?\nThis course is straight to the point, time sensitive, and focuses on completing the project at hand (the reasons and explanations for the code and how it works) as the primary. Pretty much all of this course in its entirety is just building out our DApp NFT Marketplace and stopping to explain the techniques and library connections along the way. If you are the type of person who gets the most out of learning 'by doing', then this course will be for you.\nIt's important to please note that we do not start from zero coding knowledge. While you can jump in with beginner or intermediate skill level, you will need to have some basic JavaScript, web development and blockchain knowledge (please see my complete Solidity Course from Zero to Expert if you wish to start at the very beginning). If you have web development experience with other frameworks and languages besides React or JS then you should be fine as well.

You could be a web developer, sysadmin, operations manager, or someone who is part of an IT / testing / QA team.\nDevelopers use Docker to set up and run applications without the headache of having to install everything manually\nOperators use Docker to distribute applications across environments consistently and optimize server resources\nQA teams use Docker to quickly build test environments without having to deal with \"but it works for me!\" problems\n\nBy the time you finish this course you'll know everything you need to start using Docker / Docker Compose on your own projects.\n\nThis course was flawless in explaining every segment in detail while keeping it easy to follow along and learn. -- Brian K.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you use Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, Flask, Django, Java, Golang or any other language / framework. At the end of the day, Docker is a toolset that helps you package up and distribute your applications in a portable and repeatable way. You'll be able to set up entire development environments in a single command and run those same applications exactly the same in production with total confidence that it will work because you're just moving around special packages that Docker creates for you under the hood.\nThe days of \"well it works for me!\" or having to point another developer to a 20 page document on how to set up your web application are long over. Docker fixes those problems and so much more.\nNo prior Docker knowledge is necessary to take this course. We'll go all the way from \"What is Docker?\" to exploring what types of problems Docker solves to completely mastering Docker's core features (we'll cover Docker Compose in great depth too). Through out the process we'll go over Dockerizing simple web apps, complex multi-service web apps and I'll show you exactly how to Dockerize your own web apps.\nI'm a big fan of learning by doing so this course has just enough theory combined with dozens of guided labs and challenges. This way you'll learn both the \"why\" and the \"how\".\n\nInstead of sifting through 100+ scattered blog posts, this course lays everything out on a silver platter. I've done years of research and testing so you don't have to. All you have to do is sit back, relax and follow along with the videos. You're only a few short hours away from mastering Docker and applying it to your own applications.\nI have been through very few learning experiences that were this thorough. Nick not only teaches you how to use Docker, but also how to troubleshoot Docker problems and research solutions. -- Dennis E.\nWhat makes me suitable for teaching a course on Docker?\nHi, I'm Nick.\nI've been a self taught software developer for the last 20 years. I've been actively using Docker since 2014. I also help train teams and individuals on how to \"Dockerize\" their applications.\nThis course is loaded with best practices and tips I've learned from years of real world experience and now I want to share everything I've learned with you.\nI've answered over 4,000 questions on Docker over the years through my previous Docker courses.\nI'm also a Docker Captain. Docker Captain is a title that Docker awards to select members of the community. Docker Captains are both experts in their field and are passionate about sharing their Docker knowledge with others.\n\nNick has always been quick to respond to my questions. I've never had a message fall through the cracks with Nick. He has become an invaluable mentor. -- Kyle. E\nBonus content:\nSelf contained notes that you can download and reference. It includes every command we run and all websites I visit on camera. No more hunting around videos to quickly find the content you want to review.\nOver half a dozen code examples on how to Dockerize popular web frameworks.",

On Windows, download Virtualbox and a Linux .iso (e.g. Ubuntu). Once downloaded, open Virtualbox, follow the steps to create a Ubuntu VM, select the .iso from your hard drive, install Ubuntu and you're good to go with all the commands mentioned in this course. The only extra command I've had so far to install pip is 'sudo apt-get install python-setuptools'.\" -- Harry\nFAQ (Doubters Read This)\n1) I am not technical at all, are you sure I should take this class?There was a time you didn't know how to read, or write, or speak, or walk, or... I believe you are not technical because you didn't take the time to learn through the hard times OR because you haven't even tried. Coding For Entrepreneurs has a growing community to help you through the tough times, the Instructor will help, the Django Community is incredible, and often times a simple web search will solve your problem. Getting help is easier than EVER and often comes for free.\n2) Is Django actually that good? It's the default choice for Instagram, Mozilla, Pinterest, Disqus, and many, many more. Django is lightweight, super flexible, easy to learn, easy to implement. I believe it's that good.\n3) What makes Python a good language for beginners? Python looks closest to the English language next to many other programming languages and therefore is easier to learn. Python uses spaces \" \" more often than \";\" or \"$\" or \"{\" or \"(\" like PHP and Ruby use.\n4) I already know PHP (or another language), should I learn Python/Django? There are two schools of thought: 1) Yes because it's awesome and makes it easy to implemented web-based projects or 2) No because you don't really need to know more than 1 language. If there is any feeling of desire to learn more, do it.\n5) Why don't I just use Wordpress or another platform? I think this is like asking a chef why he doesn't follow someone else's recipe. The other recipe might be fantastic... but it's still following a recipe. A true chef creates. A cook follows. Using a platform can be great...but to truly innovate, you need to know how to do it yourself.\n6) I see that Django version 1.6 and Python 2.7 is what is used... isn't Python 3.4 and Django 1.7 out? Why aren't you using those versions? Yes both are out and both are very solid on their own. There is much debate about Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 as to which to use. Mac and Linux come standard with Python 2.7 so we believe it's still a solid choice and will remain that way until these major operating systems change what they use. Django 1.7 vs 1.6 (or even 1.5) is virtually the same; especially for a beginner. Once you understand Django, you understand Django. Regardless of the version until Django releases a huge overhaul (which won't happen anytime soon).",

      "description": "Hi and welcome to the Professional Rails Code Along Course, where I will walk through how to build a real world Ruby on Rails project that I was hired by a client to develop. My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. I've built many different Ruby on Rails applications throughout the past few years for companies such as Eventbrite and Quip and one of my passions is helping individuals learn how to code.\nAfter completing this course you will be able to build a production Rails project from scratch. But there are a million courses that will help you do that. What makes this course different is that you'll learn how to build a Rails application like a professional developer. I took a completely different approach to creating this course. I don't edit any mistakes and I filmed the entire set of videos in real time so you can watch my exact process when I am tasked with building a real world application. I made this decision so that you can get a transparent view into what it takes to become a pro developer, and also so you can see how I work through challenges, all in real time.\n\nOne of the most critical requirements for a professional Rails developer is a strong knowledge  of testing. With that in mind, every feature that we build in the course will be created with the test driven development process. Some of the key features you'll learn how to implement are:\nUsing TDD and BDD with the RSpec and Capybara testing frameworks\nWorking with the Twilio API to send SMS messages\nIntegrating a permission structure for users\nImplementing an administrator dashboard\nWorking with automated email components\nCreating an approval workflow from scratch\nCreating JavaScript Growl notifications\nAnd much more!\nThis course is not for the faint of heart. The ideal student for this project is someone who has already taken a basic Rails course and wants to take their skill to the professional level.\n\nEach lesson comes paired with the source code implemented at that stage so that you can follow along and compare your code with the codebase for the application. And beyond that you can also use the source code to extend it and build your own production applications.\nPlease feel free to review the course curriculum and I look forward to going through the material with you on your development journey!",

Angular is awesome, but it can be tricky to learn, especially if you are newer to web development. This is especially true if you're trying to figure out how to build an actual working application in it. It can seem like a daunting task--especially since many tutorials out there don't show how to do it from scratch.\nThe good news is that it's not that hard once you know how all the pieces work together. This course will teach you those pieces and how they fit together so that you can build your own real life single page web applications that persist data to a database.\nThis course is for all levels, but you will find it especially useful if you are newer to web development. You should know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but by no means do you need to be an expert. We'll be using tools like the command line and NodeJS to install packages, but we'll be seeing how to use them from scratch, so you don't need to have prior knowledge of them.\nThis course brings together many commonly requested AngularJS subjects that aren't seen in a lot of other ones, including:\nDirectives\nRouting\nAngular Material\nAngular 2\nIf you want to learn how to build a single page app with AngularJS, and want to learn it from scratch, then this is the best course you'll find.

Step by step, improving the application further in each class:\n\n\nThe first part of the course will start by creating the UI for an amazing React application.\nNext, we will make a refractory of this application into different stateless components.\nAfter using React Hooks, we will add a state to the application, passing all the states via props.\nIn the next phase, we will add React Redux to easier control of the state.\nFinally, we will introduce Redux-Saga to control the application's side effects while making asynchronous calls to our API.\nThe main focus of this course is:\nReact: it is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components.”\nReact-Redux: one of the most used application state management. Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree.\nRedux-Saga: one of the most used frameworks to make easier to control our application side effects (i.e., asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, and better at handling failures\n\n\nThis course covers all you need to be the best Web Developer you can be.",

By  then we will be ready to learn complex data structures like arrays, objects, maps and sets.  After that we will focus on some important JavaScript fundamentals  such as closures, object creation, method chaining, prototype inheritances, call, apply, bind, spread operator, arrow function, promises.  I will cover all of the latest features of JavaScript. Features such as Async Await, Array.from(), Array.Map() that were recently introduced.  I will also go through ES2015, ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, ES2019, ES2010 and ES2021 features.  You also will get lots of coding exercises to practice. In the end I will show you how to build few practical JavaScript Projects. You will surly enjoy building your own to-do list using pure JavaScript.  One of the best feature of this course is its simplicity. All the coding samples are very easy to understand. I prefer to use real world use cases to explain concepts.",

      "description": "Laravel is the most popular framework for PHP and it really makes life easier! VueJs is also one of the easiest and most powerful javascript frameworks out there that uses a Virtual Dom.\nWith the Laravel framework, I have done huge projects before, and with Larvel it's easy to manage and maintain.\nOne of the most beneficial features of Laravel is the Model relationships you can use. Doing queries to the database has never been easier and powerful than now!\nIn this course, we will start from the beginning and tell you how to set up your first Laravel Project. I will also show you how to deploy your code online to a Virtual Private Server. We also teach you how to add your project to a DigitalOcean server online!\nThis is a must-have course if you're simply want to jump into Laravel and improve your skill! And if you have help, you can contact me through this platform in order to help you.\nThe online world today is booming, and online developers are in demand way more than previously.\n\n\nThe most common language used for online development is PHP, and Laravel is the most popular and probably the best one out there.\n\n\nLaravel handles the server-side programming, so this basically means that it processes what it needs to do before it ends up in front of the client’s screen. So if you want some programming done client-side, then you can’t use Laravel, but Laravel integrates beautifully with Vue JS. Vue JS handles client-side programming. So for instance, if you want to build an application where you don’t want to refresh the browser in order to process something, you’ll be using Vue JS, which is one of the most popular and powerful Javascript frameworks out there.\n\n\nWith this course, I will teach you everything from where to start from scratch up until publishing your project to a live server where people can access your content.\n\n\nAs a bonus, I will also include my own built Content Management System, and I will teach you how to install it. With this CMS, you can instantly have an admin where you can log in and add pages, specials, products and more. This CMS is also going to be updated continuously, and I will update my course with all the latest changes to the CMS.\n\n\nThis Content Management System will also include an eCommerce section where you can list your products and prices.\n\n\nThis course will be really helpful for you, especially if you want to get in online application development, including websites.",

I will show how to communicate between the API and web app. We will discover how to style the application and restrict certain parts of it to authenticated users only. All that done with very popular frameworks. We will use javascript and python languages and basic knowledge of these is required.\nThis course is built from two kinds of sections: First is an introduction to the framework where I explain everything from scratch, and 2nd is a hands-on section to build a ready application. After finishing this course you will have both knowledge and also experience how to build a full-stack application using Django, Angular, and NativeScript.\nAlso, I will show you how to deploy back-end API and front-end web app on the production server absolutely for free.

I now know more about speeding up Wordpress than I ever thought possible\" (Jeffery Wood).\n\"AJ's course is a must for anyone looking to improve their or clients website speed. A course that is worth doing from start to finish\" (Ian Campbell).\n\"AJ is an entertaining lecturer and he definitely knows his stuff\" (Josh Tseng).\n\"I was totally blown away by the simplicity, logical presentation of facts and real time results as I followed these lessons\" (Frank).\n\n\nYour WordPress website made not just faster & not merely fast, but one of the fastest websites on the Internet. The Official WpFASTER WordPress Speed Optimization Master Course is, by popular demand, finally here. Enjoy the rewards now!\n\n...2 seconds...\nYou may have heard it said that this is the amount of time you have to get your content in front of the eyes of your website's visitors before they start to bounce, or before you begin to lose money.\nWhile this 2 second figure is indeed true, it doesn't actually tell the whole story. Website speed is not a game of seconds. It is a game of milliseconds. A game in which a website that is interactive in a literal blink-of-an-eye quicker than yours will enjoy better user engagement, longer on-site times, superior search engine positioning; and, more income. These are the facts.\nNow, more than ever, your website's speed is absolutely critical to your site's User Experience; and, your WordPress site's ultimate success or failure:\n\n\n\nGoogle found that a 500ms slowdown equals 20% decrease in ad revenue.\nAmazon finds a 100ms slowdown – one tenth of one second – can mean a 1% decrease in revenue.\nYahoo! found that a 400ms improvement in load time translated to a 9% increase in traffic.\n27% of users say that visiting a slow site makes them likely to visit a competitor.\nGoogle is so committed to speed and User Experience that they are, right within their search results, experimenting with affixing a \"SLOW\" label to slower websites...\n\n\nIn this, the official WpFASTER WordPress Speed Optimization Master Course, the only course of its kind on the planet, you will not learn how to make your WordPress websites merely faster, but how to make them some of the fastest, most performant websites in the entire world. You will further be able to prove that they are.\nThis course -- WpFASTER's blueprint -- includes everything you need to know, from theory to application: Basic, to intermediate, to advanced WordPress performance techniques and configurations; to troubleshooting and mitigating optimization issues; and, ultimately, the goods to produce the most incredibly fast WordPress sites on the Web.\nAnd lest I forget, you are going to learn all of this and more without having to know or learn any code whatsoever.\nMy name is AJ McKay. I am the Managing Partner for WpFASTER, the instructor for the course and here to help you every step of the way.\nIf you have a WordPress-powered website or blog and can see that this course will, in a very real way, pay you for taking & applying it, the Official WpFASTER WordPress Speed Optimization Master Course is for you!\nSPEED.

        "This course is designed for anyone that uses and therefore has an at least basic understanding of WordPress. Put very simply, if you are (for example) comfortable with adding posts and pages, navigating within your hosting account, and me saying things like \"functions.php,\" \"HTTPS,\" \"CSS file,\" and the like doesn't make you say \"wat...?\", then you'll do wonderfully. That said, even advanced WordPress users, designers and coders will benefit greatly from the course as they absorb, and subsequently learn how to apply, WpFaster's highly refined Web Performance Optimization (WPO), Front End Optimization (FEO) and User Experience Optimization (UX) architecture.",
        "There is quite a bit of material. As such, and even though the material is presented plainly and in layman's terms whenever possible, it does take a hearty commitment to absorb it such that the aggregate of the material can be effectively applied to whatever WordPress site(s) you, yourself, are optimizing. In short, the ideal student will be up for a challenge, ready to think critically and be willing to completely relearn what they think they know about WordPress website optimization.",
        "PLEASE NOTE: Enrolling in this course in no way shape or form enrolls the student in a WordPress optimization concierge service. I am more than happy to assist in the understanding of course material, to clear up any confusion about it or its application and to further explicate principles; but, I will not optimize students' websites for them.",
        "One Last Thing... If you're not looking for a comprehensive Master course; or, if you know yourself to be someone who possesses the attention span of a fruitfly, this really isn't the course for you. (No judgements, just sayin'.)"

      "description": "Svelte is a JavaScript framework that allows you to build state driven components. However what makes Svelte different from other frameworks like Angular, React and Vue; is that Svelte is a compiler. Svelte runs at build time. Which means your Svelte code will be compiled at build time into highly efficient imperative code that runs on the browser to carry out DOM operations. Other famous frameworks usually use a technique called the virtual DOM to decide how to update the DOM. This technique runs in the browser during run time. And that adds more overhead to the DOM calculations.\n\n\nIn this course we are going to learn everything about Svelte from scratch. We are going to start with the basics of signal based reactivity and we then we will create simple components. And then gradually progress and create more complex components and discuss more in depth features.\n\n\nAnd while Svelte is a great tool to build components for the web, it's not an easy task to build an entire full stack application with just Svelte. That's why we have SvelteKit. SvelteKit is a framework for rapid development of robust, performant web applications. SvelteKit provides us out of the box with things like routing, server side rendering, pre-rendering and more. It provides us with a structure that we can follow to build high performance applications that are server side rendered and progressively enhanced.\n\n\nIn this course we are going to learn everything about SvelteKit. We are going to discuss pages and layouts, loading data, hooks, error handling, environment variables, pre-rendering, progressively enhanced form actions and more.\n\n\nWe are also going to use tools like PostgreSQL & Drizzle ORM for database management and BetterAuth and CASL for authentication and authorization.\n\n\nSo join now if you want to build high performance web applications with Svelte & SvelteKit!",

We will create Three real life projects,  so we can practice our react coding in a more real environment.\nIf you don’t know much of React, no worries. We will start simple with a static landing page , then we will go to a much more compete project with authentication and DB and last but not least we will create am e-commerce style project with user cart, PayPal, not only that we will create our own server to handle all the requests.\nIf you know nothing about React, don’t worry, I added a bonus section with a tiny React course so you can understand the basics and how react works. So you can start from there and then go to the practice projects.\n\n\nTo sum everything up, this what we will be creating in this course:\n\n\nProject one ”The venue”:\nHow to create a project with React CLI\nCreation of components\nUsing third party libraries\nCreating transitions on reveal and carrousel.\nUsing parts of Material UI to make our app better.\nDeployment of a static webpages to SURGE.\n\n\nProject two “M City”:\nCreating of routes to navigate our project\nMore complex animations and transitions\nRendering components using data from a server\nWe will use authentication and create an Admin endpoint\nFirebase uploads and storage\nAdd a database on a server to work with\nDeployment of the project to Firebase\n\n\nProject three “Waves”:\nE-Commerce style application\nCreation of dynamic routes\nUsing REDUX as store.\nAuthentication, user dashboard and admin dashboard\nCreate a server with Node JS and express\nAdd database to our Project with Mongo DB\nCreating different routes to process the requests\nAdd cart items to user account\nComplete checkout with Paypal\nDeployment to Heroku\nAnd as a bonus just like tiny React course, you will get additional React components to the projects.",

      "description": "Welcome to the HTML, CSS, and React Certification course for beginners. In this course you will learn how to develop stylish, mobile responsive web pages right from scratch using some of the most powerful front-end mark-up languages and JavaScript libraries. The course starts with an in-depth overview of HTML where we start by exploring the structure of an HTML web page. Once you’re comfortable with HTML foundations, we move on to demonstrating how to work with a number of HTML elements. This includes: Inline text elements, ordered and unordered lists, embedding media, link creation, tables, background images, form elements and iframes. The HTML segment concludes with a hands-on project that will guide you through creating a complete web page with headers, footers, callouts, images, links, forms and tabular data. By the end of the HTML segment, you’ll be able to proficiently code simple and complex html pages with ease.\n\nThe second section of this course focuses exclusively on CSS to bring your web pages to life with custom style sheets. Here, students will learn the importance of responsive design and cross browser compatibility by embedding CSS style rules for individual page components. We start by exploring the parts, and types of CSS rules followed by an introduction into CSS Id’s and divisions. From there we move on to CSS margins, text properties, borders, transparency and text on top of images. Once you have a handle on the foundations we move on to more intricate CSS concepts including CSS positioning, CSS float properties, Link Styling, and z-indexes. Similar to the HTML section, the CSS segment concludes with a comprehensive hands-on guide to building a responsive web page, complete with CSS style definitions, element containers, navigation, and a number of other CSS page elements.\n\nOnce you have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, we will dive into working with React, a powerful JavaScript library used for front-end UI development. The React section starts off with a hands-on project where you’ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities.\n\nIn the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of “context” in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.\n\nAs you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground. Best of all it’s co-authored by Tim Maclachlan - a renowned senior full-stack developer with over 20 years of commercial development experience. As a multi-faceted developer, Tim specializes in algorithmic, analytical and mobile development. To date, he’s written hundreds of applications and worked in a number of industries from commercial aviation and military, to banking and finance. Tim has a genuine passion for teaching others how to become better coders and looks forward to interacting with his students.\n\nWith that said, we hope you’re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let’s get started.",

      "description": "Why should you take this course?\n\n\nWith five minutes, allow me to explain why.\n\n\nThis is the course that I needed before becoming a software engineer\nThis is the course that I needed before becoming a full-time software engineer, working downtown in San Francisco. It teaches the concepts that I put into practice every day. It's crucial to understand the entire full-stack.\nBut while I was self-learning, covering every layer full-stack was like searching for distant fragments of a huge puzzle. All the resources were spread out. They were all in different locations.\nI needed it all in one place. I needed it to be all in one project. That is the purpose of this course.\nThis course is the selected highlights of months (years actually) of research. Of reading hundreds of coding articles. Of listening to tech talks. Of building projects at hackathons. Of studying computer science in college. Of working on projects as a software engineer.\nAll in one place. In one all-encompassing project.\n\n\nFeature-focused, like the Industry\nThe project in this course mirrors projects that you would work on in the industry.\nI also structured the project development to mirror how apps are built in the industry. You will evolve your full-stack project, just like how projects in the real world grow. You will be feature-focused.\nYou’ll build the project one feature at a time - continually improving the software and shipping to the users.  This is distinct from other courses that are architecture-focused. Meaning, you won’t build the entire backend, and then move on to the entire frontend. Instead, each new feature will involve every aspect of the full-stack architecture.\n\n\nThe DragonStack Project\nWhat is the DragonStack Project?\nThe Dragonstack Project is a multi-account collector’s application for gathering dragons. You can trade, purchase, and breed your dragons! By selling dragons, you earn currency. Or if another account uses your dragon for its mating services, you also get currency. Each dragon has unique traits, and belongs to a specific generation.\nThis app is different. It's not a Facebook, nor Twitter clone. Now, the core of the architecture is the same. Behind those larger apps like Facebook and Twitter, are the concepts you'll learn in this course. But you'll use those concepts to create something unique. If you're already investing the time to learn the full stack, I want you to make something no else has made before. That way, you'll learn how to apply these concepts to innovate.\n\n\nFrom Scratch\nIn this course, you will build everything from scratch. You will take over every layer of the full-stack. You won’t use any separate APIs for the features.\n1. You’ll build the API. Sure, you can learn about web requests by consuming a public API. But in order to fully learn how these web requests APIs work, you need to build one yourself.\n2. You'll be in full control over the database. You won't rely on a library to do manage the database for you. You won't treat the database like magic. No, you'll have full control, and generate the SQL yourself.\n3. You'll build the authentication system. Authentication is an easy step to skip while learning. Don't. It's a critical concept to understand. 99% of the applications you make, or work on, will have an account base.\nThis from scratch is the core philosophy of the course. In addition to building the APIs from scratch, you’ll create the full backend. This will include the server, and core database files. Plus, you’ll build the full frontend, with the modern and very widely used React library.\n\n\nThe Full Picture Grounded with a Conceptual Understanding\nAs you work with new technologies, it is essential that you see the full picture. Therefore, in this course, you will learn more than just how to code in Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, and Redux. On top of that, you will gain an understanding of the design, models, and ideas behind these technologies. You’ll learn exactly how companies apply these technologies to their problems. With a foundational understanding of the concepts, you will be able to see how each layer fits together in the full-stack\n\n\nPractical Experience\nJust because this course places a large emphasis on concepts, does not mean you won’t dive into the code as soon as possible. This course also focuses on practical experience. After all, the concepts are only reinforced when you actually apply them and build the software!\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have so much experience working with the technologies. I have no doubt that you’ll be able to confidently add Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, and Redux to your resume. Plus, you’ll have an impressive full-stack project in your portfolio to prove it.\nNot to mention, you can do many of the final course challenges to make your course project the most unique and advanced one around.\n\n\nCourse Challenges\nLittered throughout the course are challenges. This is not the kind of course where you’ll be blindly following along the entire time. These challenges will give you the chance to implement the next feature yourself - reinforcing your knowledge, guided by your own experience.\nAs mentioned, there is also a list of final course challenges. These go beyond the scope of the course. But these are the ones that will make your project truly stand out.\n\n\nSimplicity\nOn top of teaching full-stack web development and its core technologies, the overarching emphasis of this course is building code with simplicity. No matter what technology we code in, we will ensure to design our classes and build our functions in a simple way.\nNow simple does not mean easy. Easy means to lie near. Just because something is easy and immediate does not mean it's right. Sometimes, the easy solution is actually a shortcut that will require even more work to fix later.\nOur definition of simplicity is singularity. Simplicity in this course means to be one-fold. As much as possible, we will make our functions simple, one-fold, and singular in purpose. We don’t want our functions to have an overwhelming number of side effects that introduce unneeded complexity into our application.\n\n\nScalability\nSimplicity is the prerequisite to scalability. Because you'll code the functions in a simple  way, you will find that you’ll be able to quickly add new features to the application. The upfront cost of carving out the most simple design pays huge dividends for scalability.\n\n\nProgress in Dragonstack\nYour progress with the dragonstack project will follow an exponential curve. Throughout the course, graphs will show your progress on this course. There will be an initial ramp-up period. However, once you make it past the hump, your pace will skyrocket. Stay determined to get that momentum going. It's one of the best feelings when you're riding that freeway of productivity.\n\n\nOther Details:\nPromo Music Credits\n\"Slow Motion\" by Ben Sound.\nRedux Broken Down\nRedux can be a very complex concept to handle with frontend development and React. This course boils down Redux, and explains it a low level. We won’t look at Redux as some magic library that just solves all of our state problems. No, this course is going to fully dive into Redux. We’ll experiment with its functions, examine its parameters, and even consider the overall design decisions of the library.\nPromises!\nJavaScript Promises that is! Promises will play a huge role in the backend of this course. So if you were looking for a good excuse to learn how JavaScript promises work, then this is the perfect project for you! I promise…\nNames\nThis course might spend more time than others discussing names. Some may say variable naming is arbitrary: “just give something a short and clear name and be done with it...” To that, I wholeheartedly disagree! Naming is one of the most important parts of software. Getting the name right can be the sole difference between smoothly flowing through understanding a codebase, and spending minutes or even hours trying to understand how functions work together.\nTimely Delivery\nSince Udemy allows students to speed up lectures, I’ll talk through the lectures in a timely manner that will be understandable at all speeds. Change the speed as you wish.",

I've seen it all...\nBut you can stop worrying...right here and now!\nI understand the difference between a passing fad, and what's here to stay.\nAnd do you want to know what's here to stay?\n...Sass!\nSass is what's known as a \"pre-processor\" language, and it basically supercharges your CSS so you can create flexible, clean and incredibly powerful stylesheets.\nThe entire purpose of Sass is to save you time & energy when styling websites and applications.\nWhy is this a good thing?\nI've done some experiments and I've discovered that you can style websites 150% faster using Sass vs. CSS...\n\nFor example, let's say a custom web design project takes 50 hours to style in CSS (not unusual!)\nIn Sass, it would only take you 33 hours to style!\nThat's 17 hours of saved time per project...\nTherefore, if you take on 3 web design projects per month, you'll save 51 hours each month...\nThat's the equivalent of...\n63+ episodes of Downton Abbey\nTaking an entire week off work\nBooking a paid gig at $50/hour = that's an extra $2.5k\nWalking around Central Park 25 times\nRoadtrip from Los Angeles to New York\nTaking on a part-time job at your favourite coffee shop\nThe question is, what would YOU do with a 150% increase in web design productivity?\nJoin The Sass Course today and let's get started!\n...Not convinced?\nI've taught more than 180,000 students on Udemy...\n\n...and over 26,000 on YouTube!\nI am one of the most reviewed, top-rated coding instructors on Udemy...\nI create some of the most popular & engaging web design courses on the web today...\nMy courses are known to deliver tremendous results, and keep students coming back for more (and more)!\n\n...and this course is no exception!\nThere are endless courses and instructors out there (even right here on Udemy) claiming to teach you the skills you want to learn, but many of them fail to deliver quality material...\nThey waste your time...\nThey mumble into the mic...\nYou barely learn anything...\n...and some of them are so boring that you fall asleep (been there, done that)!\nThe Sass Course is a highly engaging coding course, jam-packed with value and hands-on lessons, and sprinkled with entertainment and humour!\nFrom beginning to end, you'll be learning by DOING...\nEvery single minute is valuable, and I guarantee you'll see results from this course!\nDon't believe me?\nTake the entire course...\n...and if you don't see value, experience results, feel it's not worth your time or money, or fall asleep even once...\nYou're protected with a 100% money-back guarantee! Simply request a refund within the first 30-days, and you'll get your investment back, no questions asked.\nSo, how about it?\nAre you ready to STOP feeling frustrated, and START taking control of the skills you want to learn to succeed as a web designer today?\nLet's get started!\nSee you on the other side :)",

      "description": "WELCOME TO MY \"Build Angular 2 Complement -E-Commerce App - Java, Spring, MySQL\"!\n\n\nOverview\nThis is a course about building a E-Commerce website using Latest Angular 2 and Java , Spring Framework Ecosystem, MySQL technologies and more. Specifically, it's about building an online bookstore.\nYou can consider this course as a sister course of my other one - \"Complete E-Commerce Course - Java,Spring,Hibernate and MySQL\". They are sisters because the functionalities and layout are pretty similar to each other while the architecture are quite different. The other course uses Thymeleaf as the template engine (an official template engine adopted by Spring Framework) and is coupled to the backend.\nIn this course's approach, we make the web app RESTful. This approach is becoming popular in the modern trend. While the front-end can be developed with different frameworks, and we choose Angular 2, the backend is decoupled from front-end providing REST APIs as resources.\nThere are Pros and Cons for both of the architectures and it's better for you to go through them by yourself.\nRegarding the bookstore app, the modules developed in the course is similar for all E-Commerce website. Those modules contains:\n- User Signup and Login\n- User profile management\n- Product Management\n- Shopping Cart\n- Order checkout and order history\n- Automatic email confirmation\nAs you can see, those modules are the basics for pretty much any E-Commerce website. Check out the preview lesson for a quick tour of the website!\nWhy should I take this course?\nBecause you probably won't find another course out there on similar topic with similar length and detail. This course covers a wide range of topics on building an e-commerce website . It is a step-by-step guide with most of the code hand typing.\nThere are students from my other courses complaining that if I copy and paste the code and then explain it, tough it can save some time, students will lose track and drive. That's why I'm developing stuff in this course from scratch and step-by-step.\nWhat does the technology stack look like ?\nAs this is a full stack development project, we will develop the code for both front-end and backend. A considerable amount of work will be on developing the front-end code using latest Angular 2, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, bootstrap and etc. The backend side will be using latest Spring technologies - Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data and etc. Then, we will have MySQL as database. MySQL is powerful and free to use and serves as a good database candidate in plenty of commercial apps out there.\nWill I get the source code?\nSource code and database scripts are provided in the very beginning of the course. Besides, throughout each lesson (I would say most lessons), the source code will be provided to the progress of the lesson. Yet, I still suggest you to develop with me and take the source code as a reference.\nWhat will I get by the end of the course?\nThis course shows an example of building an E-Commerce app from scratch. By the end of the course, you will get exposed to various topics and building modules that you need for a basic E-Commerce web app. With the hands-on practice, you will gain a lot of experience that is beyond just the theory.",

      "description": "In this course we're going to look at GLSL ( OpenGL Shading Language) to create amazing effects.\nMaybe you are\na designer who has seen some terrific, cutting edge websites using cool transitions and wondered how it was done. You may have heard about WebGL and know that you can use some simple THREE.js code to do some remarkable things.\na developer trying to visualise some data in a striking way.\na game developer wanting to add some custom effects to your 3d objects surfaces.\nGLSL is how you can use OpenGL to display a surface. The code syntax is based on the C language, but fear not, we will assume you have literally no knowledge of this language at all and we will, as the course title states, learn this from scratch. GLSL uses the GPU ( the Graphics Processing Unit) to handle multiple programs at the same time, so it is unbelievably fast.\nIn the course we will be writing code for the browser, because this allows us to focus on GLSL, without needing to worry about installing any additional software. We will be using the THREE.js WebGL library and CodePen so you can instantly edit the source and see the results, needing nothing other than a browser to experiment. Only a small amount of Javascript is used but this will be explained thoroughly as it comes along. But you can also use what you learn about GLSL in a C/C++/C# program or a Python program.\nWe will start from really simple examples and progress slowly through each stage of developing a custom shader. You will be able to play with the shader code on CodePen, so you can experiment with different values to see the impact it has on the end result.\nGLSL shaders are split into vertex shaders and fragment shaders and we will focus initially on the fragment shader, working essentially in a 2d environment. With dozens of shaders in the course resources you will learn the language in gentle stages.\nCreating your own shaders means understanding the GLSL language and that is the aim of the course. You could search for a suitable shader on ShaderToy, ShaderFrog or glslViewer and then try to adapt the code. But without knowing the language you're going to find that difficult to do. To really be effective you need to know about the GLSL language, shaping functions, tiling, polar coordinates and lighting calculations. To do this you will need to follow along with the course and complete the many challenges suggested. At the end you will then be able to create any shader that you can imagine.\nAs usual there is a 30 day money back guarantee. So you have nothing to lose. Let's get shading today!\n\n\nWhat students say\n\"I came here interested in making a custom lighting shader on an obj model, and I really found answers to my questions and more. The two faced aspect of the lessons and the CodePen sketches [are] great. I thank you !\"\n\"A great course! Methodical, step by step explanations not only of the GLSL but also of the general theory behind shaders, usable with any shader system. Essential if you are into computer graphics or generative art. Thank you!\"\n\"I've tried to pick up shaders in the past but found it quite difficult. Unlike other resources I've found, this course was the course that finally helped me get a much better grasp of glsl. It is well structured and very informative. I would recommend it to anyone looking to pick up glsl.\"\n\"This is exactly what I needed. I am a web designer/developer with design background and a good a good deal of javascript experience I'm trying to get into 3D visualizations for web. Since GLSL is written in C language it had been a huge barrier. I totally recommend this course to anyone having problems to get a clear understanding of GLSL.\"\n\"So far this course has been really amazing. Very few courses on shaders really take the time to explain the math behind what's happening in a way that let's \"non-math\" folk develop an intuition for it. Great job!\"\n\"I was always intimidated by the idea of GLSL, even though I'm an advanced front-end developer. I've always been terrible at math; and yet Nik's style of teaching made me understand everything very intuitively and I'm so comfortable with shaders now. I've bought 60+ courses on Udemy; and I quit most of them after a couple videos. This one has me hooked on my chair until I finish everything! Coding along to this course is fun and Nik's challenges feel very rewarding to either solve or understand through his crystal clear explanation!\"\n\"This is a perfect course for anyone wanting to learn about GLSL in a gradual manner. The instructor makes sure to spend enough time in the basic functions of GLSL, so students can get a proper understanding before moving on to the next concept. I had found GLSL a bit daunting in the past because examples would get out of hand very quickly, so I really appreciate this course's approach.\"\n\"Another master piece of Mr. Lever. He is an incredible instructor and deep understanding of the math behind computer graphics. A must watch even if you are already an experienced CG programmer.\"\n\"Everything was explained very well & in a understandable manners. Minor details of Math I was not aware of, I learned in this course. Thank you Nicholas Lever!\"",

Therefore, no previous coding experience is needed.\nBased on user feedback and tech development, we will keep adding new content to our course. For example, we just added content teaching Vue.js.\nFor better user experience, all course content is voiced by professional voice-over artists. Therefore, new content may be voiced by a different voice artist.\nWhy not learn from free YouTube videos, manuals, and online tech blogs?\nWeb development has been a popular area for years. The internet has accumulated tons of free tutoring videos and materials. Some of them are actually really good!\nEven if you are stuck with questions you cannot solve, just post them on StackOverflow, you will have your answers within a few minutes. The answers you get are also really great!\nWith all the free tutoring materials and teachers, what is the point of creating this paid online course?\nIt depends on your own situation and what you want.\nIf you already have lots of coding experience, then learning web development is actually very simple for you. All you need is to familiarize yourself with a new set of coding grammar and functions.\nBut if you have no coding experience before, then learning to code can be rather challenging. In this case, you will find that learning from a well-designed course can make your life a lot easier. You will make faster progress as well.\nIf you just want to have a rough idea of how web apps work and create some basic programs, then there is really no need for you to pay for any courses. Free internet information is more than enough to meet your demands.\nIf you want to be able to turn your design and idea into programs that are also safe and efficient enough to be applied in real life, and most importantly, you want to do this as soon as possible, then learning from a well-designed and considerate course is your best choice.\nYou will be shown directly where the best route is. With all the detours being avoided, you can therefore save lots of time and effort.\nWhy us:\nMost online students can only devote partly to their studies. They still have other things going on in their life. Their study will often be interrupted.\nWe believe this is also a situation most of our students are facing.\nTherefore, when designing course content, we have arranged lots of review sessions. In our Vue course, we even ask you to take photos of screenshots.\nAll our projects will be broken into small bits. We only focus on one bit at a time. In the end, we will combine everything together and create complicated APPs.\nEvery time previous knowledge is needed, we will either remind you to review previous lessons or directly give you a review to fresh your memory.\nIn this way, we can keep strengthening the foundation while putting more weight on it. Eventually, you will master everything we cover in this course.\nIn summary, explaining new knowledge to you is NOT our goal. Our goal is to help you master new knowledge as well and fast as possible.",

      "description": "May 2021 Course Update! Added a new section of live coding workshops, including a deep dive on how to work with React hooks\nAre you ready to build professional applications that combine the front end frameworks, such as React JS and Angular with Ruby on Rails as a backend? Then this is the course for you. My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. In addition to being the lead instructor for devCamp I've also been building web applications for over a decade for organizations such as Eventbrite and Quip.\nAfter you have completed this course you will be able to build modern React JS, Angular, and Ruby on Rails 5 applications. In fact, in this course we're going to develop several applications that highlight the powerful and dynamic features offered by front end frameworks such as React JS and Angular working as the user interfaces, and Ruby on Rails API apps functioning as the backend. This is a powerful combination since you will learn how to create incredibly fast, dynamic React JS and Angular applications that embrace features such as real time updates, along with the power and flexibility provided by the Ruby on Rails framework.\nThroughout the course material you will learn concepts such as:\nHow to configure your system to run Angular and React JS Applications\nHow to generate an Angular applications\nHow to generate React JS applications\nWhat it takes to build React and Angular components\nHow to work with Angular Observables to automatically update page elements without even needing to refresh the page.\nAlong with how to communicate with APIs and parse the data they return.\nHow to integrate authentication from scratch with session based auth\nAnd everything else you'll need in order to build real world React JS and Angular applications, with a Ruby on Rails API!\nThis is not an entry level course. You will need at least a basic understanding of Rails in order to go through this material. Additionally, I also recommend that you are familiar with the TypeScript and JavaScript programming languages, however if you haven't worked with TypeScript or JavaScript before, you can still work through the course.\nEach lesson of the course is paired with the source code that I used in the guide so you can check your work. And since the application we're building is a real world app I'll constantly be adding to the course material with new features, as I do with my other courses.\nPlease feel free to review the course curriculum and I look forward to going through the material with you on your development journey!",

      "description": "Important note: This course was made in 2017 when classes were the primary model for React and ES6 was new. Since then, the model has changed substantially to focus on functional programming (hooks). Smaller, but important changes like using next.js, redux-tool-kit, etc. have also gotten traction. I do cover hooks in both React and Redux (react-redux module), but the course is focused around the older model. It still works, it's just \"outdated\" as current React goes. Please be aware of that if you are new, and if you prefer a class based model, then this might be exactly what you are looking for.\n\n\nThis course:\nStarting with Angular 1 in 2010, JavaScript frameworks exploded onto the scene and are required by virtually every large website on the Internet. React, which appeared a few years later in 2013  has become the dominant tool in that group. What does that mean for you? You can learn to use the same front-end framework used by Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, BBC, Airbnb, and Ebay, to name a few. And you won't just learn how to use it, but you'll learn the fundamentals around it.\nTL;DR - React is awesome. I've been teaching it professionally for 8 years and love it. Learn it here!\nWhat I need from you:\nI need you to know JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.\nIt's not required to use React, but React makes very heavy use of ES6 (the 2015 update to JavaScript), so the course will use ES6 after the first main section. I will briefly mention how it works as needed, and add a supplemental section that covers those parts.\nI need you know how to navigate your computer, not be afraid of the terminal, and ask questions as you have them!\nWhy me:\nI first used React in 2014 for a small company website. I've also used Angular, Vue, and Ember along with most other major UI frameworks and I'm a believer in React. I've taught it professionally for 4 years, and have built sites for some of the largest companies in the United States using React Router and redux alongside. I will teach you one step at a time, whiteboard, and start from ground zero before getting to webpack and eventually Redux. Prepare to start learning the best JavaScript framework!\nThe sections in bold will be finished no later than August 15. I will send out a message when they are complete.\nSections:\nEnvironment Setup (skip if you have node installed already)\nReact 101\nState and Events\nThe Component Lifecycle and HTTP\nProject 1 - Flash Card app (AWS services)\nReact Router\nRedux\nRedux Middleware (redux-promise and redux-thunk)\nAirBnB Clone with Redux\nOverview of Auth From a Front-end Perspective\nBuilding/Preparing React for Deployment\nHooks - the \"2020 way\" to do React\nContext\nSupplemental - ES6 for React",

      "description": "Take this course if you would like to learn how to use the Divi theme to build a modern, responsive, sophisticated website, all within the browser. No requirement to know HTML and CSS!\nJoin me in this course and together we will build a 5-page website. Best of all, it will all be accomplished from within your browser.\nWe will be creating a website for a fictional web design company called Blue Fox Web Design. By following along with this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of the Divi theme, as well as learning techniques that will help you build better websites.\nWhat will I learn?\nAlthough we will be creating the website for a fictional web design company, the skills you will learn can be used for your future projects. Here are just some of the things you'll learn throughout the course:\nHow to install and configure WordPress\nThe basics of Divi, including sections, rows and modules\nCustomising Divi's modules to effectively brand your website\nLots of different types of modules, including text, images, accordions, counters, and lots more\nAmazing scrolling animations - make elements appear when the user scrolls to a certain point on the page\nHover effects - make your elements come to life when the user hovers their mouse over them\nUsing Divi's pre-made layouts to save you many hours of work\nNavigating quickly and efficiently through the Divi interface\nAdding contact forms, separators, Google maps, blogs, and much much more!\nIf you're looking for the most feature-packed Divi course on Udemy, you've found it!\n\n\nWho are you?\nMy name is David Sharkey; I have been using Divi for three years, and I've been a web designer for six years. I've used Divi in many real-world projects, and I'm excited to be able to share what I know with you.\nWho this course is for:-\nCoding a website in HTML and CSS is hard, and it takes a long time. If you are looking for a way to create high-quality, modern websites in a fraction of the time, then Divi might be what you've been looking for.\nDivi's revolutionary Visual Builder makes designing webpages a fun, simple experience. Sections, rows and modules can be created in the blink of an eye, then duplicated, re-arranged and edited, all within the browser!\nWebsites that can take weeks to create using HTML or CSS can be built with Divi in a matter of hours.\nThere is no true substitute for learning HTML and CSS, but for projects that require a short turnaround time, Divi provides the tools for you to quickly achieve your goals.\nYou do not need to know how to code to take this course, but please note we will be using a few snippets of CSS when it's absolutely necessary. I will, however, provide the code which you can just copy and paste into Divi.\n\n\n**** Student Feedback ****\n\n\n\"I have never managed to create a nice looking website using Divi, despite several tries, but with this course I am well on my way to having a website I can be proud of. 5 stars - highly recommended.\"\n- John Edwards\n\n\"Great course. Every detail was shared on how to complete a stunning website. I am now feeling very confident to get my first one done. Thank you David.\"\n\n- Megan Thorpe\n\n\"This course is an excellent, thorough tutorial on how to begin using Divi. David provides clear and precise instructions on everything you need to get started.\"\n\n- Matthew Koenen\n\n\"So far this course is amazing. I just landed a job as a wordpress developer and the company uses Divi for most of its work.\"\n- Emmanuel\n\n\n\"Perfect, everything is explained very clearly\"\n- Eva Lopatová\n\n\n\"Very useful course. Best one I've seen on web site development in the WP/Divi space.\"\n- Doug Sire\n\n\n\"The instructor was knowledgeable and the course exceeded my expectations. I will be able to utilize what I learned in the course and implement Divi Builder in Wordpress. Hopefully, the instructor will offer an intermediate course.\"\n\n- Sue Hawkins",

      "description": "100% Answer Rate! Every single question posted to this class is answered within 24 hours by the instructor.\nYou can earn a living, or make some cash on the side, as a freelancer or full-time WooCommerce theme developer\nAre you looking for a comprehensive WooCommerce theme development course? Have you ever thought about becoming a professional WooCommerce theme developer and make some money on the side?\nToday WooCommerce is quickly becoming the next big thing in e-commerce. Its mission is to transform any WordPress website into a real e-commerce store. And it really does! That's why so many developers today want to learn how to create themes for it.\nYou'll find many WooCommerce tutorials out there, but most of the times they are very confusing.\nThis course is different. It features almost 100 lessons in which I'll really share with you everything I've learned so far about creating themes, especially about how to build a WordPress theme with WooCommerce compatibility.\nToday, many developers make money quickly building themes to people who want a custom theme for their stores. Good freelancers will charge anywhere between $3,000 and $15,000 for a simple custom WordPress website. WordPress sites with WooCommerce capabilities are more profitable to clients, so they are more than willing to pay even more!\nMany other developers earn a living selling premium versions of their themes. And you can be one of them too!\nI'm an instructor of more than 25,000 satisfied students only here at Udemy and I know how to help you.\n\n\nWhat exactly are you going to learn?\nHere's a quick list of the main subjects covered by this course. You'll learn:\nHow to create a classic WordPress theme that works perfectly well with Woocommerce (NOTE: in this course, a classic theme will be created, not a block theme);\nHow to declare WooCommerce support and customize your themes. Your clients' online stores will become even more attractive;\nHow to modify the WooCommerce template files in the right way. Your store will look the way you want;\nHow to use the WooCommerce shortcodes the way no one does;\nHow to use powerful tools like Theme Customizer and TGM Plugin Activation to make the store shine;\nHow to create a responsive menu and a sexy and modern slideshow  - without using plugins!\nHow to add a blog to the e-commerce store. Your theme users will sell more!\nAnd more! How about learning how to create demo versions of your theme?\nIf your intention is to sell premium versions of your theme, you'll see that the ones with demo versions are the top sellers. Your clients will love them!\nAnd how about making them available in any language?\nYou'll learn how to create themes that are fully translatable. Clients from all over the world will be able to use your themes, as they will be fully compatible with Poedit or any WordPress translation plugin.\nAnd it doesn't end here...\nHow about making your WooCommerce themes really secure?\nYou will learn how to put in place, step by step, the main WordPress security features in your theme's code! Just relax! There will be no loopholes for anyone to attack your theme.\nAnd to top it off, start a new career as an official WordPress/WooCommerce theme developer\nFollow me as I send the theme created in the course out to the official WordPress theme repository. This is one of the best strategies for those who want to start making money by creating themes, even free ones.\nYou will understand all the tests that are necessary to pass through the strict review system of WordPress, until the publication of the theme. And, of course, you'll also understand some of the strategies you can use to make money with the theme and make a living as a theme creator. Yes, you can make money, even with free themes hosted at the official WordPress theme repository.\nAnd, on top of that, all the content is loaded with basic notions about creating WordPress themes such as loops, inner pages, sidebars, template parts, filters, action hooks, page templates, enqueuing Bootstrap and Google fonts etc. Really, I won't hide anything in this course!\nBesides, you'll have all the material available to follow the lessons.\n\n\nWho this course is for?\nI recommend this course to programmers, IT students, web developers, web designers, or any freelancer or full-time professional who works with PHP, HTML and CSS. It's recommended for everyone who want to build a full-time business, creating custom WooCommerce themes for clients or for selling.\nI don't recommend, in any way, for curious people, shop owners, or people who don't know how to write code yet.\nThis is not a regular WooCommerce course. My goal is to teach the student how to create a theme, so we'll be writing a lot of code. If you are interested in just creating a webstore, without having to understand programming, there are several other courses that can help you out there.\nThis course is not about setting up a store. We are not going to learn how to configure payment methods, product shipping methods. We are not going to test those extraordinary membership plugins. We are not going to configure subscription plugins, marketing plugins, nothing like that.\nThis course is aimed at all those who want to become professional theme creators. Basically the course is aimed at two types of people.\nThose who would like to become independent, create their own custom theme, learning to customize the look of the store the way they want, or learn to customize third-party themes. They can do it for themselves, or for their clients.\nPeople who have plans to fly even higher! If you are already a little tired of working with annoying deadlines, boring clients, endless projects, anyway, if you want to start building a career with more freedom, more time for you, doing what you like to do, you will love the content that I have prepared for you!\nIn this course I will guide you, step by step, in the beginning of your professional career as a WooCommerce theme developer. I'll show you, from start to finish, how to create a theme following all the recommendations of the WordPress theme review team.\nIn the bonus section of the course you'll learn everything you need in order to make a theme pass the hard tests of the WordPress theme repository, how to bundle WooCommerce with the theme, how to prepare a theme demo, how to make your theme go international, how to make it totally secure, and much more.\nIn the end, I'll show you how to submit this theme to the WordPress theme repository, which is a wonderful showcase from which you can attract buyers to a premium version of the theme.\nThe course is also a basis for you to send the theme to other platforms, such as ThemeForest, which is one of the largest premium theme marketplaces in the world. Knowing how to do this for the official repository, you're on your way to go anywhere!\n\n\nHow is this course different?\nWhat my students like the most is the excellent response time to their questions. You know, long waiting times can slow down your progress. So, I always try to reply within 24 hours. You can be sure you’ll never feel alone in this course.\nHere's what my student Ryan Johnson has to say about one of my courses:\n“I'm almost done with my own theme, ran in to an issue, and Marcelo has responded back with very detailed, quick help. I don't know how he does it! (…) Marcelo has laid this course out well, when you come up to a snag do everything you can to research and fix it on your own, but if you can't he's there for you. That's huge for me and may be for you, too.”\nOr my student Adnan Usman…\n\"Marcelo has been amazing at explaining everything and has been extremely responsive when I ask questions while doing the course. I am not 100% done with the course yet but due to his diligence and quick and thorough responses I could not wait to give him a 5 star rating.”\nAnd Christopher Moldrickx…\n“Marcelo is very knowledgeable and makes the course enjoyable. He answered my questions in the forum fully and within a few hours time. Frankly, I would buy any WP course from Marcelo!”\nAnd the list goes on…\nSo, are you ready for this course? You can always watch the free available lectures before you make your decision. Remember, this is a Udemy course, so you’ve nothing to lose. You can count on our 100% 30-day money-back guarantee in case you don’t like it. No questions asked.\nSo join me right now. From now on, the sky is your limit!",

This is essential so that later when you start using a WYSIWYG code editor and you need to make changes, you know what is going on under the hood.\nCourse Materials\nIn addition to the video screencasts, this course includes a start file for each unit and a completed example so you can see the code in action.\nCourse Structure\nThis course contains 8 units, each of which build on the previous unit.

      "description": "This course requires you to download Docker Desktop from Docker's official website. If you are a Udemy Business user, please check with your employer before downloading software.\n\n\n100% Answer Rate! Every single question posted to this class is answered within 24 hours by the instructor.\nDo you want to create a WordPress theme that really works? Would you like to learn how to edit a WordPress theme without suffering?\nI know that searching the Internet for articles and tutorials is quite frustrating. But if you really want to learn everything about creating WordPress themes, you've found the right course! This course will pave the way for you to become an official WordPress theme developer.\nImagine yourself doing what you love most, whether at home or in your own company, being your own boss, and even earning top dollar! Good developers can earn from $3,000 to $15,000 creating a custom WordPress theme. So knowing how to create WordPress themes is synonymous with being able to earn very well, as this is currently one of the most sought-after skills on the market. WordPress is behind 30% of websites worldwide. In other words, it is a growing market!\nIf you are looking to earn extra money, or even want to work as a full-time freelancer, this course will prove to be perfect for you. It brings what I call a 'simplified approach' to the subject, because that's the way I tried to structure the course for you. I didn't have chances to learn in an easy way in the past, which is why I decided to make it as easy as possible for my students.\nYou won't have to go through all the tiresome and often useless research that I had to go through. Everything I learned is summarized in this course. It covers all the fundamental aspects of learning how to create a WordPress theme from scratch. You will be catapulted to a new professional level.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a solid foundation to become a skilled theme developer. You will be able to master a complete set of skills such as creating a theme independently, or editing a third-party WordPress theme. Take a look at what my student Walton Jones has to say:\n\"Three weeks ago, I knew very little about WordPress. Today I am laying the finishing touches on a WordPress site for a client that they are very pleased with. This is all thanks to this course. Marcelo is an awesome, responsive teacher who was always quick to answer my questions.\"\nHere are some of the things you no longer need, because all the necessary knowledge will already be at your fingertips:\nYou no longer need to read pages and more pages of documentation to understand how to create WordPress themes;\nYou no longer need to waste time reading long tutorials on the web;\nYou no longer have to be bored looking for or watching useless content on YouTube.\n\n\nWhat exactly will I learn?\nThe course will be divided into two moments.\nMoment 1:\nThis first part will have 6 sections, in which we will create the WordPress theme from start to finish. We will talk about topics such as:\nWordPress installation using Local and/or Docker. Yes, we stopped using Xampp for everyone's sake and included Local (the favorite installation tool for WordPress devs at the moment) and Docker;\ntemplate hierarchy, enqueueing of scripts and stylesheets;\nmenu creation, including responsive menus just using CSS, HTML and Javascript. Yes, at last, now the theme course will no longer depend on any plugin to work;\nthe WordPress loop, both the default loop and the custom loop (using the WP_Query class);\ninclusion of several types of theme_support;\nwidget areas, permalinks, the main template files, the various types of pagination;\ntemplate parts and conditional tags (another new subject);\nthe powerful Theme Customizer;\ntheme translation and security. Yes, I've included lessons about security in WordPress themes (!);\nsite migration from the local server to a remote server.\nMoment 2:\nIn a second moment, there will be a bonus section with some complementary subjects, which will help you understand a little bit more about the theme creation universe, as well as introduce some trends regarding this subject.\nWe'll talk about page builders. We will introduce you to child themes, talk about Docker, and especially about Gutenberg (the block editor and new features brought by WordPress in versions 5.8 and 5.9, such as block-based themes, the theme.json file, etc.).\nThis is meant to get you started transitioning from what they are now calling \"classic themes\" to brand-new block-based themes. The course will not teach you how to create block themes yet, but it will be a good start.\n\n\nHow can you tell if this course is really different?\nWhat makes this course unique is the versatility and benefits it delivers. This course brings you 69 highly comprehensive lessons, all carefully organized in sections, leaving no important subject behind.\nBut the best thing about the course is my willingness to help you. My biggest priority is to make sure that you get to the end of the course with no doubts. That's why the absolute majority of questions are answered within 24 hours, allowing you to study at your own pace with nothing to get in your way.\nI am sure that other courses cannot afford to have students saying things like this:\n\n\n\"I'm almost done with my own theme, ran in to an issue, and Marcelo has responded back with very detailed, quick help. I don't know how he does it! (...) Marcelo has laid this course out well, when you come up to a snag do everything you can to research and fix it on your own, but if you can't he's there for you. That's huge for me and may be for you, too.\" (Ryan Johnson)\n\n\n\n\nOk... Does this course really work?\nYes. Many students who have been through this course have already got jobs, or are self-employed earning a good income. Again, I will let students who have been through the course answer this question:\n\n\n\"Excellent course! It teaches in a practical and simple way, easy to understand. Teacher Marcelo is great, and answers questions quickly too! Thanks to the course I even got a job as a Wordpress Theme Developer! (Robson Henrique Rodrigues)\n\"One of the best courses I've done in my life! (...) Because of this course, I got an opportunity in my job that earned me a raise! I'm very happy and fulfilled working with something I'm passionate about, which is WordPress programming. I recommend this course and Marcelo's others to everyone!\" (Rebeca M.)\n\"Today I can consider myself a Wordpress theme developer. Sometimes I can't believe it! I recommend the course to anyone who wants to start or deepen in the creation of themes for Wordpress.\" (Clodoaldo Rodrigues de Sousa)\n\"It was an extremely good and pleasant surprise to have taken this course. It exceeded my expectations thanks to the teacher and his teaching methodology. This course has, without a doubt, changed my career as a developer.\" (Bruno Chirelli)\n\"I came to this course when I needed to update a client's front end and I didn't know anything about WordPress. I got a great result on the gig, learned how to create well organized, interactive themes and significant updates to existing themes. Marcelo is a very conscientious instructor, explains in a simple way and is always willing to solve students' doubts.\" (Daniel Brenner Moura)\n\"Thank you! It was a great course, it has never been cheaper to learn so much relevant content.\" (Ricardo Rodrigues de Lima)\n\n\nSo, are you ready?

Look no further! In this interactive course, I'll be sharing simple techniques and settings to enhance your TypeScript usage when developing React applications.\n\n\nBy utilizing TypeScript's ability to check our code, we can catch potential errors early on in the development process. This not only saves time, but also leads to a better user experience as bugs are less likely to reach production.\n\n\nWe'll start by diving into the basics of declaring React components using TypeScript, and then move on to more advanced concepts such as using types like any, unknown and never, type predicates, and exhaustive checking. You'll also learn about built-in mapped types and how to create your own custom type maps. Plus, we'll explore the power of conditional types and type inferring in the TypeScript type system.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll have the skills and knowledge to take your React applications to the next level, making them more reliable and efficient than ever before. Don't miss this opportunity to improve your development skills and create a better user experience. Enroll today!",

      "description": "Why Learn HTML and CSS?\nHTML is the foundation of all web pages. Without HTML, you couldn’t organize text or add images or videos to your web pages. HTML is the beginning of everything you need to know to create engaging web pages! CSS Works in tandem with HTML to ensure that your content looks good. Using these two, you are in complete control of what your web pages look like.\nWhy Learn JavaScript?\nHTML and CSS are static. JavaScript allows you to manipulate them while your webpage has already loaded. Imagine having an interactive document reading when their content can morph based on your actions...while you're reading it! That is what JavaScript brings to the table.\nTake-Away Skills\nLearn how to build a website using HTML, CSS, and Visual Studio Code.\nBy the end of this course, you will have learned:\nHow to create HTML Documents\nHow to link HTML Documents and create a website\nHow to insert elements in an HTML document (images, lists, tables, text, etc.)\nHow to style one or more pages with CSS (Inline, Internal and External Style sheets)\nHow to upload code to GitHub.\nHow to publish your static website to the internet using Netlify.\nHow to design a form to collect data.\nHow to write JavaScript and jQuery\nHow to use Bootstrap 5\nContent and Overview\nYou don't need to know any programming language to take this course. The content of this course assumes no prior knowledge of programming or web development. It will teach you how to set up an environment to develop a website from scratch and deploy it on the internet for the world to see.\nThis is a short course with just over 4 hours of content but smartly broken up to highlight related activities based on each module in the application being built. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along, implementing best practices, writing efficient logic, and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course, and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.\nBy the time you have finished the course, you will have moved around in Visual Studio Code and examined errors so much that it will be second nature for you when working in the Web development environment. This will put your newly learned skills into practical use and impress your boss and coworkers.\nThe course is complete with working files hosted on GitHub, including some files to make it easier for you to replicate the demonstrated code. You will be able to work alongside the author as you work through each lecture and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.",

      "description": "Single-page applications are the way to go if you want to build state-of-the-art web applications. But if you look around, there are so many big frameworks out there that just seem to take ages to learn. Guess what, you don’t need a framework like Angular to build single-page apps. Plain JavaScript and jQuery do the trick and more importantly, you have to build a fast and reliable back end. And that’s what you will learn in this course.\nThe single-page app you will build in this course is a shopping list application that uses every CRUD operation with HTTP requests, calling a RESTful web service - using ASP.NET Web API 2 - which saves your data persistently in a SQL Server database.\nMake yourself ready to learn some jQuery, HTML and CSS for the front end. And for the back end you will use Microsoft's ASP.NET Web API 2 for the RESTful web service and Entity Framework with Code First Migrations to communicate with the database.\nOn top of that you will learn how to publish your single-page app to Internet Information Services (IIS) so that everyone can access your new single-page application.\nPatrick, the author of this course, has built several web applications professionally as freelancer and employee and over the years he learned many things that you just don’t have to do to succeed in building a single-page application. This course will save you time, because you will learn the crucial and most important parts quick, so that you can get your single-page app out there in no time!\nSound’s good? Let’s get started!\n\nWhat kind of single-page application will be built?\nDuring this course you will learn how to build a complete single-page application by building a simple shopping list web application - an app that comes in quite handy for almost everybody. In this web application the user will start by creating a new shopping list. After that she will be able to add items to her list, check them off and delete them. If the user wants to access a certain shopping list, she can do so by adding the id of the list in the URL - which will be delivered by your web app, of course. That way the user is able to create the list at her computer and open it afterwards with her smartphone when she is actually in the grocery store.\n\n\nWhat technology is used for the front end?\nThere are so many frameworks out there that you simply don't need or are just too big to start learning how to build single-page applications. In this course you will learn the basics that you will also need to know when you want to understand how frameworks like Angular work. Because when you start with Angular for example, you might get results sooner or later, but maybe you won't know what actually happens under the hood.\n\n\nIn this hands-on course you will learn and understand the essence of single-page applications by using the following technologies:\nHTML - You will build the application like any other website with plain old HTML.\nCSS - To change the appearance of the application you will use a little cascading style sheets.\nJavaScript - The foundation of every single-page application framework is JavaScript. You won't learn the whole language, of course, but you will know how to use JavaScript for your web application.\njQuery - To make things a bit easier and quicker, you will use the most famous JavaScript library jQuery.\nAjax - With the help of jQuery and Ajax you will make the actual calls to the web service which returns data from the database.\n\n\nWhat technology is used for the back end?\nThe back end or server side will be implemented with .NET technologies. You will need a RESTful web service you will call from the front end, a framework that maps your C# models or classes to database tables and of course a database. The following technologies will be used for that matter:\nASP.NET Web API 2 - It's the state-of-the-art framework that helps you build HTTP services easily. With Web API 2 you will build a RESTful web service that enables the front end (or any other client you want to reach in the future) to make all CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations by using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP requests.\nEntity Framework - An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that allows you to map your C# models with actual database tables. This part is crucial to save your data persistently.\nSQL Server - At first the database you will use in this course is a file that will be generated by Visual Studio. But later on, especially when you want to publish your app to IIS and make it available to the world, you will use a SQL Server database.\n\n\nSo far for the server-side. Don't worry, every technology is available for free!\n\n\nWhat tools do I need?\nThe entire course uses the Microsoft stack to develop the single-page application - apart from the browser, which is Google Chrome. The following tools will be used and are totally free:\nVisual Studio 2017 Community Edition - Most of the time you will develop the application in Visual Studio. It might help if you already know this IDE. Older versions of Visual Studio also work.\nSQL Server Express Edition - This will be your database. The Express Edition is available for free and absolutely suits your needs.\nSQL Server Management Studio - This application is perfect to manage your database. Don't worry, you will learn how to use it step by step in this course.\nGoogle Chrome - As mentioned above, during this course Google Chrome and its developer tools will be used to access the web application. But any other browser with developer tools available will also do the trick. This means you can also use Firefox, of course. Even Internet Explorer would work... but honestly, it's not recommended.\nInternet Information Services (IIS) - Not really a tool for developing the application but for publishing it. If you have no access to IIS you can still follow the steps of publishing and use the results later on with a Microsoft Hyper-V Server for free! Everything is taught in the lectures.\n\n\nWhy should I pay for this course although there are so many free tutorials available?\nA good question! Indeed there are lots and lots of tutorials available online that might get you the information you are looking for. The advantage of this course is that you will get this one big package out-of-the-box. You will see every single step from start to finish on how to build your single-page application. Starting from the front end, then building the perfectly fitting solution for the back end and even publishing it on a server. You can't miss anything, because you're able to watch the whole development process. And if something is still unclear, you can always ask a question in the forums. And if you are still not happy you can get your money back - no questions asked.",

Virtual Cloud Servers have become the industry standard for hosting web applications of all sizes and complexity. This includes small static web pages, to dynamic, database driven web sites that handle thousands of simultaneous processes. Regardless of the project, virtual servers offer a solution that provides web developers a scalable infrastructure that can easily adapt to a changing environment.\n\nThe course starts with an overview of the registration process on Linode. From there, students quickly jump into deploying and configuring a server using the latest Ubuntu LTS distribution. Students will become familiar with the Linode admin interface, and start executing basic commands using the web based remote access console. We then explore remote access administration using more complex tools such as PuTTY for Windows, and Terminal for MAC.\n\nStudents will install and configure LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin) on the Ubuntu server. We show students how to secure the server through SSH Authentication, directory permissions, and disable root user access.\n\nThe course explores remote visual desktop configuration using TightVNC & RealVNC.\n\nOnce students have a firm handle on server configuration on Linode, we take a look at another major cloud provider – Digital Ocean. This section of the course provides an overview of the Digital Ocean Admin panel where students will deploy and configure a “Droplet”. We will explore some of the unique features Digital Ocean offers, such as Floating IP’s and Space storage.\n\nStudents learn to backup, resize, and configure DNS Zone files on both cloud hosting providers.",

You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.”\nWhen creating an AWS account, the default account is the Root account. This root account has complete access to all AWS services and resources on the account. The root account should only be used to perform a few account and service management tasks.\nEach service deployed in an AWS account should only be accessible to users permitted to use the service.\nThis course will explore the following components of IAM with hands-on exercises:\nAllowing multiple users to administer the resources in an AWS account without having to share passwords.\n\nCreating granular permissions for AWS users. This means each IAM user can be granted a different level of privileges for different resources in the AWS account.\n\nApplying IAM credentials to applications, thus providing the application with access to specified AWS services.\n\nEnabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for individual IAM Users.\n\nEnabling access records and logging for IAM Users using AWS CloutTrail.\nIf you are interested in learning how to securely manage an AWS account using IAM, hit the enroll button and let's get started.",

Born from a collaboration between Instagram and Facebook : React\n\nReact is a Javascript library used to create web interfaces. It's extremely powerfull, performant and modular.\nAnd since it's out, everybody is talking about it , it is used by Facebook, Netflix, Yahoo ,AirBnB and many others !\n\nReact is the web technology you must know, it is the most popular javascript library used at the moment to create web app. There is a lot of market demand for it; that is why It's an extremely valuable asset to add to your developper tool belt.\n\nThis courses teaches the very basis of React and Redux with all the modern features you want and need to know.\n\n\"React + Redux  - The guide (2023 Edition)\" aim to make you fluent with React and Redux as fast as possible.\n\nWe will discover all the basics and the core concepts of React and Redux. We will mostly use practice to do that, since, to me, it is the most efficient way to learn\n\nIn this course we will start from the very basis and we will build together several apps using React but also Redux.\nIf you never heard about Redux, just keep in mind that it is used in 90% of professional React projects to manage the data of you app. That is why it's a very important library to know when learning React. They are very often combined.\n\nWe will apply everything you'll learn in these videos through real example and real web apps.\nAlso, for each video you will watch, there will be a correction available, to make it easier for you to follow.\n\nFinally these courses are specifically designed to be accessible and easy to understand, with a lot of schema and examples, so, you don't need to be an algorithm killer or 15 years of experience developper to understand it. It's made for all.\n\nI will explain what I know assuming that you don't now React nor Redux at all.\n\n\n# # #\n\nAlso learn the Typescript language !\n\nI recently added an entire subcourse into this one, to learn Typescript, and how to use is with React.\nTypeScript was developed by Microsoft and has become a reference in the JavaScript community.\n\nTypeScript is the language or rather the layer that can be added to a JavaScript project (such as React, Angular, Vue, Node.JS, Electron, and many other great technologies).\n\nIt gives you access to everything that JavaScript can do, so you don't lose anything and you can do a lot more!\n\nAny respectable JavaScript project, regardless of the framework or library used, utilizes TypeScript.\nThis is even more true, especially in the professional world.\n\nAnd off course, all of that :  in a good mood and teached in a casual way !\n\n\n* Summary *\n\n\n- React + Redux\n\n\n-- Setup a React 18 project with tools like \"Create React App\" or \"Vite\"\n-- Setup Redux with Redux Toolkit\n-- Components\n-- States\n-- Props\n-- Hooks ( useEffect, useContexts, useRef, useNavigation, useRoute, useSelector, useDispatch, useMemo)\n-- Contexts\n-- Refs\n-- Forms and validations\n-- Authentification + Signup with Firebase\n-- Using Firebase Firestore as real time back-end\n-- Navigation with React router\n-- Callback functions\n-- ES6 functions (map, reduce, filter)\n-- Styling (css modules, JSS, Bootstrap)\n-- Understand NPM\n-- Write in Redux store\n-- Read from Redux\n-- Understanding slices,actions reducers\n-- Redux middlewares\n-- Make redux persistent to keep your data even after refreshing\n-- Set up a fake server with Json-server\n-- Asynchronous requests\n-- React app deployment on the web\n-- Testing with Jest and React testing library\n-- Custom hooks\n-- Make your app support multiples languages with i18n\n\n\n- The Typescript language\n\n\nPrimitives types and how to use them\nHow the TypeScript compiler works\nClasses with TypeScript\nFunctions, default and optionals parameters\nObjects\nArrays\nObject oriented programming\nNamespaces and modules\nInterfaces\nEnumerations\nAccess modifier\nTypes\nType casting\nGenerics\nDecorators\n-  A complete React + Typescript project  :\n\nCreate a Vite + React + Typescript project\nBuild a full React + TS web app !\n\n\nAnd much much more incoming soon.\nSee you soon !\nCodiku.",

      "description": "Are Your Website Visitors Seeing “Not Secure” in Their Browser?\nIt’s a bit unnerving, right? You’ve put time and effort into building your website, but when visitors land on your page, they might see that dreaded “Not Secure” warning. In today’s world, where online security is more important than ever, that little message can seriously impact how much people trust your site.\nTrust is Everything\nImagine this: a potential customer visits your site, but instead of feeling reassured, they hesitate because their browser warns them about security. It’s not just a minor issue—it’s a deal-breaker. People are becoming increasingly cautious about sharing their information online, and a website that isn’t secure can instantly lose credibility.\nHow to Know If Your Site Is Secure\nIt’s easy to check. Just glance at the address bar of your browser. If your site is secure, you’ll see a little padlock icon—sometimes even the word “Secure” next to it. If it’s not secure, there’s no padlock, and some browsers, like Google Chrome, may even display “Not Secure.”\nThat’s not a good look.\nThe Solution? SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)\nSSL is the industry standard for creating a secure, encrypted connection between a website and a visitor’s browser. You’ll know a website is protected when the URL starts with “HTTPS://” rather than just “HTTP://”—the “S” means secure.\nSetting up SSL used to be a hassle, and it could get pretty pricey. But the good news? You don’t have to worry about that anymore. In my course, I’ll show you how to get a free SSL certificate, install it, and make your site secure—step by step. Plus, we’ll boost your site’s speed and security even further by connecting to Cloudflare, a powerful content delivery network.\nHere’s What You’ll Learn:\nThe importance of SSL and why it helps your website rank better on Google.\nHow HTTPS works and how to set it up correctly.\nTips on checking whether your site is already secure (some hosts set it up for you automatically).\nHow to update your site and make sure all your pages are fully secure.\nUsing Cloudflare to protect your site and boost performance.\nHandling mixed content issues and fixing them to maintain full SSL security.\nUpdating Google Analytics and Search Console after transitioning to HTTPS.\nWhy This Course Is Different:\nI know that technical stuff can feel overwhelming, so I made this course hands-on and beginner-friendly. I’ll walk you through every step using one of my own sites as an example. You can follow along and see exactly how it’s done. At the end, I’ve included a complete conversion from start to finish in a single video—no guessing, just clear guidance.\nReady to Make Your Site Secure?\nJoin me, and let’s make sure your website shows that reassuring padlock—so your visitors know they can trust you.",

      "description": "This Course In a Nutshell - Part 1 Angular Service Worker (includes the Typescript Jumpstart Ebook)\n\nIn the first part of the course we are going to dive straight into the Angular Service Worker and the built-in Angular CLI PWA support. We are going to take as the starting point a plain Angular Application, and we are going to start adding PWA features on top of it in order to turn it into a Progressive Web Application.\nWe will start by adding the Angular Service Worker and have the Application Download & Installation feature up and running. We will learn all about Application Version Management and we will learn about the multiple caching strategies available for caching not only the application bundles, but also the application data.\nWe will then add an Application Shell using the Angular CLI and Angular Universal, and make the application One-Click Installable using an App Manifest. Finally we will add Push Notifications to the application using the Angular Service Worker, for a complete mobile-like PWA experience.\nThis Course In a Nutshell - Part 2 - Service Workers Fundamentals\nIn this second part, you will learn about Progressive Web Applications in general (including Service Workers, App Manifest, and the Cache Storage API.), and you will use these APIs to implement several native-like features: One-Click Install, Offline support, application download and installation, application data caching and more.\nWe will also learn Service Worker Web Fundamentals from first principles using built-in browser APIs directly and we will confirm our understanding of what is going on in every step of the way using the PWA built-in Chrome Dev Tools.\nThe knowledge learned on this section has a long shelf live, as its about browser fundamentals and how the new PWA Web works in general, so everything learned here is still applicable to any other development platform other than Angular.\nWhy PWAs? Build the Future Of the Web Today\nThe future of the Web is clearly going in one direction: Progressive Web Applications! With the upcoming Safari support and the ability to install a PWA directly to a Windows desktop, PWAs are the new generation of web applications that will bridge the gap towards Native Apps: this will even include in the near future things like Bluetooth and Payments.\nPWAs look and feel like native apps, but there is no App Store and all its issues involved: instead a web application can now be installed directly to the user desktop or home screen with one single click!\nThe application will then install itself immediately on the background, so that it does not have to be downloaded again unless a new version is available.\nThe application will feel blazing fast in a way that until now only native apps could: A PWA is offline, background sync and notification capable.\nPWAs are not mobile-specific: any application can benefit from starting up an order of magnitude faster! The Angular CLI PWA support and the Angular Service Worker take PWA features to another level: we will be able to add PWA features reliably to our application in a transparent way via the Angular CLI, as part of the production build process.\nBut we will still need to understand how PWA features work under the hood, in order to troubleshoot any issues, interact with the Angular Service Worker or configure the Angular CLI.\nCourse Overview\nIn part 1, we are going to take PWA features one at a time.These features where designed to be used together, so using them to implement a concrete use case is the best way to learn them. The main component of a PWA is a Service Worker, so that is our starting point.\nWe are going to learn all about the Service Worker lifecycle, how multiple versions of the service worker are handled by the browser, and we will learn multiple Service worker installation and activation GOTCHAs. We are then going to build a service worker that gives to an application the ability of showing an offline page when the network is down, using the Cache API.\nMost of the PWA APIs are Promise-based, so to make the code more readable we are going to be using Async / Await in our examples. We are then going to implement Application Download and Installation: we are going to see how we can use a Service Worker to completely download a version of the website into a user's mobile or desktop, and how to handle the installation of multiple versions of the application.\nWe are going to demo the performance benefits of caching the complete application locally by simulating a slow network, and learn how to clean previous versions of an application. We will also learn how to cache UI-specific data and derived View Model data on the client side using Indexed DB and a Service Worker, and we will also earn how to implement Background Sync.\nThe next section of the course will cover all about the App Manifest and how to configure that one-click installation experience that we are looking for. After that, we will inspect our application with the Lighthouse tool and analyze the generated report.\nThe last part of this PWA fundamentals section will cover Web Push and Notifications. In this section, we are going to setup a node server with Web Push capabilities, and then we are going to link it to our service worker in order to implement mobile-like Notifications.\nWhat Will you Learn In this Course?\nYou will learn how the PWA Browser features work in general, not only in the context of an Angular application. You will know how to analyze and troubleshoot PWAs using the Chrome PWA Dev Tools. You will also learn how to leverage the Angular Service Worker, and all the Angular CLI PWA features to build PWA-enabled web applications.\nWhat Will You be able to do at the End Of This Course?\nYou will be able to design, develop and troubleshoot PWAs, plus you will know how to quickly add PWA features to an Angular Application leveraging the Angular CLI and the Angular Service Worker.\nHave a look at the course free lessons below, and please enjoy the course!",

      "description": "Thymeleaf is a highly popular templating engine to use with Spring MVC to produce rich, and dynamic web pages.\nUnlike other options available for Java and Spring Boot, Thymeleaf has a natural templating language - meaning you can view the templates right in your favorite browser. This really helps accelerate your development process.\nTry doing that with JSP!\nIn this course you are guided step by step in building an ecommerce like web application using Thymeleaf, Spring MVC, and Spring Boot.\nThe focus of the course is on building web content with Thymeleaf. You start off the course building web pages using Bootstrap CSS. These are simple web pages you can view right in your browser. (No Spring Boot or Spring MVC - yet!) This is to give you a good overview of Bootstrap CSS, one of the most popular CSS frameworks in use today!\nNext, you build the HTML for a product catalog website. Just the HTML to show a product listing and product detail pages.\nThen we take your HTML pages and convert them into Thymeleaf templates. We add the templates into a Spring Boot application. Spring Boot will auto-configure Spring MVC to render the Thymeleaf templates under Tomcat.\nYou get to see how we transition the HTML documents from simple HTML, into Thymeleaf Templates for the Spring Boot application.\nUsing Spring MVC, you are able to start introducing dynamic content into the Thymeleaf templates.\nFrom here you get to explore using Thymeleaf with Spring Boot.\nYou get hands on examples of:\nExternalizing Text properties\nUsing Spring MVC Internationalization with Thymeleaf\nUsing Thymeleaf Fragments for common page components.\nLeveraging Spring Boot Developer tools to speed up your development\nRendering POJOs returned from Spring MVC under Thymeleaf\nLooping over lists in Thymeleaf\nUsing Thymeleaf fragments with lists\nThymeleaf expression syntax\nSpring MVC validation with Thymeleaf\nUsing Spring Security with Thymeleaf\nHow to show different content to logged in users vs anonymous users\nWhile the course does use the Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Security - these are not the primary topics of the course.\nIf you are a Spring Framework developer, used to JSPs (Java Server Pages) and wishing to get up to speed on Thymeleaf this is a perfect course for you! You'll never want to use JSPs again!\nEven if you are not a Spring Framework developer, you will still get a lot out of this course! Thymeleaf is a powerful templating technology for Java and Spring. With Spring Boot it becomes very easy to develop rich dynamic content!",

      "description": "Want to learn React the modern, fast, and real-world way — without the fluff?\nThis beginner-friendly React JS course takes you from your very first app to building practical, reusable components and interactive features — all using the latest setup: React + Vite + Bootstrap 5.\nYou won’t just learn React syntax. You’ll build clean UIs, dynamic forms, API-based components, and polished features that mirror what real developers do on the job.\n--\nLearn by Building — Not by Memorizing\nInstead of endless theory, this course guides you through real examples and practical challenges. From the very beginning, you’ll scaffold a project using Vite, a much faster and more modern alternative to Create React App.\nYou’ll write components, style them with Bootstrap, and inject dynamic behavior using props, state, and JSX expressions. Each concept is introduced with clear narration, followed by an immediate hands-on application inside your app.\n--\nWhat Makes This Course Different?\nYou’ll build mini-projects and reusable UI blocks that reflect real-life development needs:\nA counter app\nA greeting form\nA user list from an API\nFilterable product cards\nShow/hide password inputs\nTabbed UI interfaces\nDark/light mode toggle with localStorage\nFull feedback form with modal confirmation\nAnd more.\nThis is not a to-do list app repeated five times. This is React the way it’s meant to be learned — with clean logic, interactivity, styling, and structure.\n--\nCore Concepts You’ll Master\nYou’ll go from writing your first JSX snippet to understanding how and when to use useState, useEffect, useRef, and conditional rendering. You’ll learn how to build controlled forms, validate user input in real time, and even manage your app’s look and feel with a dark/light theme toggle.\nYou’ll also discover how to split large components, lift state up, and organize your folders like professional dev teams do — using a modular, scalable structure.\n--\nTech Stack You’ll Use\nThis course uses the latest tools in React frontend development:\nReact 18+ with functional components and modern hooks\nVite as the build tool for lightning-fast startup and dev refresh\nBootstrap 5.3+ for styling UI components\nES6+ JavaScript, including destructuring, arrow functions, and more\nNo backend, no databases — just frontend logic and a practical development environment you can use for your portfolio or freelance gigs.\n--\nWho This Course Is For\nThis course is made for absolute beginners and HTML/CSS/JS learners who are ready to step into the world of React. It’s also ideal for developers coming from other frameworks like jQuery, Vue, or Angular — and want to see how React builds reusable, composable UIs.\nBootcamp students, self-learners, and early-career devs will benefit from the hands-on project format. If you’re tired of dry tutorials and want to build things that feel real, this course is for you.\n--\nWhat You’ll Need\nYou don’t need any fancy tools or prior React experience. Just:\nA computer with internet access\nNode.js and a code editor like VS Code (both are free)\nA modern browser like Chrome or Brave\nEverything else will be explained step by step — including how to install Vite and Bootstrap using NPM.\n--\nBy the End of This Course…\nYou won’t just “know” React — you’ll use it. You’ll have built reusable components, structured your code the right way, used all the essential hooks, and crafted a UI that actually responds to users.\nWhether you want to build your own portfolio project, apply for jobs, or freelance, you’ll have the confidence and skill to start building React apps that look and behave like real products.",

You made me really understand the big picture of webApp. Great job simplifying hard stuffs for us Cosmin. By the way see the word \"dependency injection\" all over the internet which I don't really understand. How can I apply it to the VideoManagement App?\"\n-  Romaric Nzekeng\n\n\n\"Man, you are GOD SEND. I found only 2 .NET full stack videos how to make app from start to finish and the first one was old 2 years and already too old because things changed by then, code and everything looks different, and the way he explains is too complicated.\nThis course is perfect because I need something simple to show me which database to pick, how is whole stack connected, to give me feel why I even need API.\nMaterials for learning are so thrown around internet that I have no idea where to start from, it's so frustrating on top of many errors I get.. and I can't see myself doing any other job no matter the salary.\nI have degree in programming but on college we only learned programming languages, database and very basic things about rest of, it is not enough for me to apply for a job.\nThis course will be my huge starting point so I can know what I must specifically focus on later to improve my skills.\nThank you so much for making this, and for explaining in such a simple way, unlike those crazy definitions I find on internet when I want to learn something.\nI will contact you when I get my first job haha :D\"\n- David Konic\n\n\nVery good explanations with handy images and clear and straight code methods.

Step-by-step by diving into all the basics, I'll introduce you to advanced concepts as well.\nWe'll build the minesweeper application from scratch:\nsetup of the development environment\nconfiguration of the React JS app\nbasic algorithms of Minesweeper\nWe'll build the minesweeper game. During the course, we'll cover the most important topics.\nFirst will be a configuration of the ReactJS application with Typescript and using build tools Webpack+Babel.\nSecond, there're presented TDD or TLD approaches that I'll try to practice with you during the coding sessions. Probably you don't have enough experience with the tests, but it's ok, there's still a good way to learn it from the course. When you work with code and cover it with test cases, it provides you with guarantees that your code works as you expected. This is the purpose and benefit of the tests.\nTools for testing: Jest, Stryker, React Testing Library\nAlso, I'll try to cover basic Typescript concepts and show you a way to improve these skills. During the coding sessions, we'll cover advanced Javascript techniques to make sense of commonly used JS features.\n\nStorybook is the most popular way to build the components library. From our side, it's the most basic part of the course. We'll install and configure Storybook, which will provide us with a full components spec. This approach is called Components Driven Development.\n\nCSS-IN-JS, EmotionJS, and Styled-Components are very powerful toolkits to build UI components. Even very complex component styles can be easily produced and supported by it.\n\nWe'll introduce you to React Hooks - it's the basic way to make dynamic UI for the applications.\nWe'll make review React Router v5 and also React Router v6.\nGitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want. We create our deployment workflow!\n\nLast but not least it's Redux. Redux is a beautiful way to manage an application state. We'll use the Redux-Toolkit library - it simplifies the work with Redux.\n\nCheck out the full curriculum and free preview videos.

It's very clear, minimal, the code looks neat, and you will be able to create very robust applications in a very short amount of time.\nAll the code demonstrated is provided in the accompanying documentation that you also have access to for free, so that you will be able to easily copy/paste and participate alongside the videos.\nSo, there is much to learn, but in the end, you will have developed the techniques required to build your own Three.js projects declaratively, with re-usable self-contained components, that react to state and will be able to participate in the ever-expanding React ecosystem.\nThanks for taking part in my course, and I hope to see you there.\nSean Bradley",

      "description": "In this course, you will build a chatbot for a Webpage. We'll use Node.js and React for programming and GIT for deploying and version control. The bot will be hosted on Heroku, but you can simply host it anywhere else where they support Node.js. We'll use DialogFlow to process natural language. DialogFlow will help us understand what users want.\nIn the course, we'll be building a sample chatbot. Its purpose is only to show you how things work. Our bot on the page will help us sell products. It will give recommendations and measure demand.\nIn the process of building this chatbot, you'll learn all that is needed to build a great bot. To get the most out of the course, you can work on this sample bot, and in the end, tweak it to suit your needs.\nYou need to have at least basic knowledge of Node.js and React to start with this course. For versioning, we use GIT; therefore, you need to be familiar at least with basic git commands.\nTo make it easier for you, I've added git commits with changes to every video that has a change in the code. This way, you can compare your code to mine. And you won't lose time debugging. And remember for any questions I'm available in the Questions and answers. You are not alone.\nAnd remember, I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU.\nThe bot will be able to remember things, that is store information into a database or connect to other API services. I'll show you different implementations so that you can play and find out what suits you most.\nAt the end of the course, you'll have a demo chatbot that you can tweak and tailor to your needs.\n\n\nMy name is Jana Bergant, and I'm a developer with over 20 years of experience. I'm an IT instructor teaching people new tech skills. Over 17000 people are already taking my course.\nI help all my students at every step of development. And I'll be here for you!\nLet me tell you a bit about every section of this course.\nIn the first section, we'll take an overview of the app and get familiar with the tech stack, which is the technology used in this course. We'll look at application architecture and different ways we can implement it. We'll go through every implementation. And I'll take you through the development stages.\n\n\nThe second section will introduce you to DialogFlow, a natural language processor, that we'll use to understand what our visitors want from the chatbot. We'll go through building blocks of DialogFlow. You'll learn about agents, intents, entities, parameters, prebuild agents, and more.\n\n\nThen in the third section, we start building the server-side app for the chatbot. We'll install the Express library and generate an express app. After we are trough with configuration, we deploy it to Heroku. To speed up the development process, we'll set up a local development server called Nodemon.\n\n\nWhen you have a basic server-side app created, you'll be able to connect it to DialogFlow. And that is what we'll do in section 4.\n\n\nAnd frontend will be the next step. In the fifth section, we set up React, configure local servers, create a proxy for communicating with the backend. And we'll develop components. Components for the page and for the chatbot. Our chatbot will begin to look like a chatbot in the 5th section.\n\n\nBut we'll polish it in the 6th section, where we'll create rich messages for the chatbot like cards and quick replies. And also, we'll go deeper into DialogFlow's features, like follow up intents, contexts, events, and slot feelings. Features that make bot creation much easier and much friendlier!\n\n\nWhen our bot is polished, we can make it smarter. We want our bot to remember what the user says. Therefore we need to store information that we get from the user. In the 7th section, we'll be saving to the database and also use what we know about the user in a conversation. To make the bot friendlier. We like if people remember our preferences, it is the same with bots.\n\n\nIn the 8th section, I'll show you a different way to implement handling actions. We'll be using DialogFlow's fulfillment. I'll show you how to call fulfillment only for intents that need extra code to be run. Only for intents that need to get information from a database, or that need to call some other API, or maybe connect to a device.\n\n\nWhen we master fulfillment, we'll deploy to Heroku. In the 9th section, we'll take care of some extra configuration like routing, postbuild scripts for generating frontend; we'll also go through the code and make sure all is as needed before we deploy.\n\n\nAnd finally, in the 10th section, I'll show you how to connect to DialogFlow straight from FrontEnd. To do that, we'll need to make some changes to the architecture. I'll tell you the benefits of every decision.\n\n\nAfter the course, you'll have a demo bot that you can tweak and tailor to your needs. And you'll have the knowledge to upgrade it.\nSee you on the course!\nJana\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThe last update of the course was on 27th February 2020\nI added DialogFlow mega agents",

      "description": "Literally, it is the most extensive and most detailed course about Hasura you can find on Internet so far and it was awarded \"Content of the Year\" at the HasuraCon 2022!\n----------------------------------\n\"This is by far the best course, I have taken on Udemy. The instructor solved my queries in a day or two. I am waiting for the next course from the instructor. Top-notch quality.\" -Ankur Sharma\nIf you’re a developer struggling with GraphQL because of its complexity… or simply because it takes too much time, this is going to be the most exciting news for you.\nListen, If I told you… that you can take your existing Relational Database and turn it into a powerful GraphQL API in a matter of seconds…\nOr... build a performant GraphQL backend from start to finish in a couple of hours with very little to no coding...\nWould you be interested?\nMy name is Dmytro Mezhenskyi.\nAnd even with 9 years of experience as a web developer and teacher, I couldn’t get over the amount of time it takes to complete my GraphQL APIs.\nI found that most of my time was wasted on mundane repetitive tasks. Tasks like writing the CRUD code over and over again… for every single entity in the database.\nAnd it doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or expert in GraphQL… it still takes up way too much time.\nIn that time, you could’ve already had your project up and running. And you could’ve done it without the stress from the deadline creeping in and your boss breathing down your neck.\nTwo years ago, I started searching for solutions to make GraphQL development more \"automated\" and I came across Hasura. It had a lot of issues back then but it still felt like a revelation for me.\nAnd you'll feel the same way about it too in just a minute.\nBecause… when you learn how to use Hasura, you'll be able to create your GraphQL backends easier and faster than you ever thought possible without writing a single line of code!\nAnd you don't have to take my word for it...\nHere’s what other developers are saying about Hasura:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n“Wow. @HasuraHQ is seriously impressive. I just set up an entire backend (database, GraphQL API, authentication, authorization) in less than an hour without ever touching a terminal!” - Cole Bemis\n“Check out @HasuraHQ, this is crazy s*#&!. I can write a whole application powered by GraphQL without writing a line of backend code!” - Thomas Heyenbrock\n“I just tried @HasuraHQ for the first time and my mind is genuinely blown. I built a fully deployed GraphQL setup that would have taken me hours normally in like 30 seconds. It's incredible how fast the developer ecosystem evolves.” - Ali Spittel\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd the crazy thing is… MOST developers don’t even know about it!\nWhen I started creating my GraphQL APIs using Hasura, it took me a couple of months to get the hang of it and even more time to master it because I didn’t have anyone to teach me the nuts and bolts back then.\nBut even with all that effort, it was absolutely worth it!\nIn fact, in all my years of web development, no other tool has been more useful.\nAnd that’s why I created this course, the most comprehensive course on Hasura with: 9 segments, 80 lectures and 6.5+ hours packed with engaging content that'll allow you to master Hasura in the shortest time possible.\nIt covers all the basics, and the more advanced features, and dives into all the little details that I wish I knew when I started using Hasura.\nWhen you’re done with this course, you’ll be able to use every functionality to create your GraphQL backends effortlessly in record time.\n\n\nHere’s what other students are saying about this course:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"Wow, the best course on Hasura you will ever find!\" - Shimon Wosner\n\n\n“I'm halfway through the course and absolutely enjoying it! This is the easiest starting with GraphQL ever. Thank you and keep it up!” - Daria Lazurenko\n\n\n“Exactly what I was looking for to up-skill for Hasura, assuming we go Hasura for our next project I will be recommending this course for all DevOps, API developers, and UI Developers on the project!” - Joseph D Garrepy\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the first few sections of this course, you’ll learn things like:\n…How to let the CRUD code write itself without you even touching your keyboard.\n…How to play with all the different features in Hasura using the “playground” approach.\n…How to easily navigate through the most common errors that can cost you a huge chunk of your time if you don’t know about them.\n…And A LOT more.\nBut there are a few things you should keep in mind…\n1. There is no fluff in this course… we’ll be diving right in without wasting any time.\n2. This is not just a “what to do” guide. You’ll be learning about the concepts behind what we are doing. The “why.”\n3. If we need to write any code to extend Hasura’s functionality, I’ll be writing along with you so that it’s easier to follow through. This is NOT a “copy-paste some spaghetti code” type of course. We’ll dissect every little feature Hasura has to offer and how you can use it to your advantage.\n\n\nAlong the way, you’ll discover things like:\n· The best way to secure your Hasura endpoint and the mistakes you must avoid.\n· When you should extend business logic and exactly how to do it\n· The one thing that you CAN NOT miss when you’re doing database migrations (If you don’t want other developers to hate you)\n\n\nHow do you go through this course?\n1- Go through the different segments, one at a time, taking a 10-minute break in between each segment to let your brain soak in all the information you learned. DO NOT watch it all in one go. It’s tempting but it might overwhelm your brain…\n2- Play along with me. If you just watch without doing anything, you’ll learn a lot… but I designed this course with easy step-by-step instructions so you can get the maximum value by following along with me. Note: Hasura will be really fun when you know your way around it.\n3- If any concept seems a bit confusing, rewind the lecture and watch it again, this time paying attention to the subtle important explanations. If you do this, you’ll start feeling a lot more comfortable with Hasura as a whole.\n4- Refer back to the course if you’re stuck at any point with a project you’re working on. The course is divided into small lectures so you can quickly go through the one you need.\n\n\nImportant to note\nI am constantly updating this course with Hasura’s latest features so that everything you’re learning is up-to-date. I am also further polishing it using your feedback to include deployment, and examples with your favorite front-end frameworks.\nWhile that sounds great, it also means that the course’s value is always increasing and so the price might go up as well in the near future.\nThe only way you can guarantee yourself lifetime access to all the available AND future lessons at the current price is if you enroll in the course right now.\nEnjoy!\n-Dmytro Mezhenskyi",

Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.\nWhat is WebAssembly?\nWebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers — it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C#, and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.\nIs this course right for you?\nIf you plan to start your career as a developer or improve your programming skills, this course is right for you. Learn how to build a browser game with minimal JS and Rust code compiled into WebAssembly instructions.\nYou will get the confidence and skills required to start your projects during this course. In addition, you will get the right mindset to apply for a developer career.\nWhat are you going to work on?\nYou will build the Snake game from scratch. You will learn to write code in Rust language, static type, compiled language.\nThe course starts with an explanation and practical examples of the Rust language. You will learn Rust-specific features such as \"moving\" and \"copying\"\nRust doesn't have a garbage collector. Memory is cleared when the values are getting out of the scope. You will learn how to manage this concept with ease.\nThe next feature you will learn of is borrowing and references. Through references, you will be able to access values without owning them.\nIn the beginning lectures, we will also talk about memory management in Stack and the Heap structures, modularity, strings, and other essential topics.\nAfter Rust's introduction lectures, you will start building your Snake game. You will learn how to structure the application modular and cleanly.\nYou will build your own JS frontend, exposed through a simple Webpack development server. Later, you will transform JS implementation into TS (Typescript). This will specify types and be on the same page as Rust code.\nYou will build your rust backend code, the backbone of our game. You will learn how to compile Rust code into WebAssembly code. WebAssembly is code that can run in the browser. It's faster (almost Native speed) and more efficient than JS.\nAt the end of the course, we will create a production server and deploy our game to Heroku, so anybody on the internet can play our game.",

      "description": "This Course In a Nutshell\nIf you already know Angular, and would now like to dive deeper into the Angular ecosystem and learn Angular SSR (Server-Side Rendering), then this is the right course for you!\nNotice that Angular SSR was formerly known as Angular Universal, but the package and the feature itself was eventually renamed to Angular SSR.\nIn this course, we are going to learn Angular SSR from first principles, by taking an existing Angular single page application and converting it into an Angular Server-Side Rendered Application.\nWe will focus not only on the server-side capabilities of server-side rendering, but we will also cover in detail build-time pre-prerendering and its advantages compared to server-side rendering.\nWe will learn how to optimize our application for initial startup performance by using a fine-grained Application Shell and the State Transfer API, and we will make the application SEO (search engine optimization) and social-media friendly.\nWe will then deploy it to production using Google App Engine and see the end result!\nCourse Overview\nWe will kick-start this course by going over in detail on the advantages of using Angular SSR in our application.\nAfter this, we will go ahead and take an existing Angular Application, and using the Angular CLI we will generate a SSR bundle that will allow us to render the application on the server side.\nWe will cover in detail all the latest Angular SSR command line functionality, including running Angular SSR in development mode, pre-rendering both static and dynamic routes.\nAfter seeing the command line tools in action, we are going to understand exactly how Angular SSR works under the hood, by reviewing the auto-generated Express engine created by the Angular CLI. This will allow us to understand in detail how universal rendering works, and it will give us a lot of flexibility if needed.\nOnce we have our Angular Express application up and running, we will then make it SEO and social-media friendly.\nWe will then apply a couple of common performance optimizations that are commonly used in Angular Universal applications: we will implement from scratch a fine-grained Application shell, and we will also reduce the number of HTTP requests that the application does at startup time by using the State Transfer API.\nWe will then take our fully optimized Angular SSR application and we will deploy it to productionusing Google App Engine for Node.\nWhat Will you Learn In this Course?\nAt the end of this course, you will feel comfortable taking your existing Angular Application and turning it into a server side Angular SSR application\nYou will understand the benefits of server-side rendering, and you will be able to optimize your application for both search engines and social media crawlers\nYou will also know how to further optimize your application for performance, and you will know how to deploy it to production in two different scenarios: pre-rendered apps and runtime server-side rendered apps",

      "description": "Learn to deploy Docker at scale in about 6 hours\nLooking to scale your web applications with Docker? How about gaining heaps of practical knowledge about working with Amazon Web Services (AWS)?\nPrepare to get excited about this course!\nAWS has over a million customers, some of which are the most popular websites in the world. You can be sure that AWS will be a great fit for your web application regardless of what scale you're running at.\nOne awesome thing about using AWS is that a ton of companies are hiring people who have experience with it. All of the knowledge you gain from this course can be used to apply for DevOps or cloud computing positions.\nThe main AWS component that you'll learn about in this course is Amazon ECS, which is the Amazon EC2 Container Service. It's Amazon's take on how to manage a cluster of Docker containers.\nThe first section of this course will concentrate on getting familiar with AWS and then performing a deep dive on Amazon ECS where you'll learn everything there is to know about it. You'll also get familiar with Amazon ECR which is Amazon's private Docker registry.\nDuring this deep dive there will be plenty of guided labs to get your hands dirty.\nThe second section of this course will be all about Dockerizing a multi-service Ruby on Rails application, as well as profiling that application with Docker and other open source tools.\nIf you're not a developer or have no intentions of using Ruby on Rails that's fine because you can skip the development section. The only thing you'll have to do is build the Docker image, which will be as simple as running a few commands.\nThe third section of this course will be taking the knowledge learned from previous sections and deploying the application to production on AWS in a fault tolerant way.\nYou'll learn how to calculate costs for a real life project hosted on AWS and load balance the web application so you can scale out to as many hosts as you need.\nAlong the way you'll learn about many other AWS resources and also learn how to hook up a domain name to a load balancer and secure it with a free SSL certificate.\nThis entire course is very hands on, with just enough theory to understand the main goal -- which is to get you comfortable scaling your web apps with Docker on AWS.\n\"Excellent teacher and great material - easy to follow and informative. I especially like the hands-on labs.\"\nHere's what you'll get when you sign up to my course today:\nYou'll learn how to get your development environment set up to run Docker. Windows, Mac and Linux users will be able to follow along.\nYou'll learn what Amazon ECS is and how it differs from similar services.\nYou'll learn everything there is to know about Amazon ECS.\nYou'll learn how to create your own private Docker Registry with Amazon ECR.\nYou'll gain general AWS knowledge on identity and access management, security groups, EC2, S3, ELB, RDS, ElastiCache and more.\nYou'll learn how to Dockerize a Ruby on Rails web application.\nYou'll learn how to profile your applications with Docker.\nYou'll learn how to price out a project on AWS at various traffic loads.\nYou'll learn how to load balance your web application on AWS.\nYou'll learn how to wire up a custom domain to your load balanced web app.\nYou'll learn how to create and use a FREE SSL certificate.\n\n\nYou're getting all of that for just $25.\n\nThis course is jam packed with over 60 lectures, 6+ hours of videos and quizzes. You'll also receive full PDF text directions for each video lecture and complete source code examples.\n\"This training is great to start using ECS on AWS. It's very clear and the instructor explains really well the concepts of both, Docker and AWS and how they work together.\"\n\n\nWhy is it worth using Docker?\nSaves a ton of time and headaches when setting up development environments.\nEasily move an application across environments or servers.\nRemoves issues such as \"well, it worked on my machine!\".\nMakes developing with teams a much more pleasant experience.\nWorks on most major platforms.\nHas amazing support on most cloud hosting providers.\nDocker as a company is well funded and moving forward quickly.\n\n\nWhy is it worth using AWS?\nAmazon's infrastructure is spread across the globe.\nAmazon has a tremendous amount of experience operating at scale.\nReap the rewards of using battle hardened services.\nAvoid having to manage the low level details of your infrastructure.\nMany companies are hiring people with AWS experience.\nYou can try it out for free for an entire year.\n\n\n\"What I loved most about this course was that I could tell how much thought Nick put into arranging the labs and resources.\"\nWhy is this course for you?\nAfter finishing this course you'll have a ton of knowledge about using Docker on AWS. You'll be able to apply this knowledge to your own projects or use it to further your career by applying for DevOps or cloud computing jobs.\nYou're walking away with not only knowledge, but complete source code and working examples that you can reference for life.",

Very tedious process!\nLESS is great for the following reasons. :\nAllows to cut down one code and save time\nReduce repetition (DRY) and mistakes\nIt makes logical sense to break out CSS into multiple files with the feature\nEvery web developer or front-end UI engineer should use LESS over traditional CSS\n=> What you will learn:\nIn the first section, you will :\nlearn how to define Variables for faster maintenance.\nlearn how to declare Mixins as reusable objects\nlearn about Nesting for a cleaner stylesheet structure.\nlearn how to perform mathematical calculations with the Operators\nOn a more advanced level, we will discuss about:\nBuilt-in functions\nParametized and Guarded mixins\nThe @import directive to include external stylesheets in one single document.\nIn a last chapter, you will apply what you have learned with a hand-on project.\n=> The objectives of this course is to help you\ncreate smarter and cleanerer stylesheets,\ncut down on code,\nkeep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and organized.\n=> By the end of the course,\nyou will understand how to use the LESS features and compile the less stylesheets into standard CSS\nyou will understand how to easily integrate mixins libraries as well as external resources such as Font Awesome and Google Font into your project.\nYou will also be able to install and use the application SimpLESS to compile your less files into beautiful CSS.\nSimpLESS is a GUI application for Less and Sass compilation.\nSimpLESS is simple to learn for first-time users and it is compatible with both PC and MAC.\nIn Getting Started with LESS, learn to take your CSS to the next level and write better styling code.

      "description": "This course is the followup to Building Modern Web Applications in Go. In this course, we go further than we did the first time around. We will build a sample E-Commerce application that consists of multiple, separate applications: a front end (which services content to the end user as web pages); a back end API (which is called by the front end as necessary), and a microservice that performs only one task, but performs it extremely well (dynamically building PDF invoices and sending them to customers as an email attachment).\nThe application will sell individual items, as well as allow users to purchase a monthly subscription. All credit card transactions will be processed through Stripe, which is arguably one of the most popular payment processing systems available today, and for good reason: developers love it. Stripe offers a rich API (application programming interface), and it is available in more than 35 countries around the world, and works with more than 135 currencies. Literally millions of organizations and businesses use Stripe’s software and APIs to accept payments, send payouts, and manage their businesses online with the Stripe dashboard. However, in many cases, developers want to be able to build a more customized solution, and not require end users to log in to both a web application and the Stripe dashboard. That is precisely the kind of thing that we will be covering in this course.\nWe will start with a simple Virtual Terminal, which can be used to process so-called \"card not present\" transactions. This will be a fully functional web application, built from the ground up on Go (sometimes referred to as Golang). The front end will be rendered using Go's rich html/template package, and authenticated users will be able to process credit card payments from a secure form, integrated with the Stripe API. In this section of the course, we will cover the following:\nHow to build a secure, production ready web application in Go\nHow to capture the necessary information for a secure online credit card transaction\nHow to call the Stripe API from a Go back end to create a paymentIntent (Stripe's object for authorizing and making a transaction)\nOnce we have that out of the way, we'll build a second web application in the next section of the course, consisting of a simple web site that allows users to purchase a product, or purchase a monthly subscription. Again, this will be a web application built from the ground up in Go. In this section of the course, we'll cover the following:\nHow to allow users to purchase a single product\nHow to allow users to purchase a recurring monthly subscription (a Stripe Plan)\nHow to handle cancellations and refunds\nHow to save all transaction information to a database (for refunds, reporting, etc).\nHow to refund a transaction\nHow to cancel a subscription\nHow to secure access to the front end (via session authentication)\nHow to secure access to the back end API (using stateful tokens)\nHow to manage users (add/edit/delete)\nHow to allow users to reset their passwords safely and securely\nHow to log a user out and cancel their account instantly, over websockets\nOnce this is complete, we'll start work on the microservice. A microservice is a particular approach to software development that has the basic premise of building very small applications that do one thing, but do it very well. A microservice does not care in the slightest about what application calls it; it is completely separate, and completely agnostic. We'll build a microserivce that does the following:\nAccepts a JSON payload describing an individual purchase\nProduces a PDF invoice with information from the JSON payload\nCreates an email to the customer, and attaches the PDF to it\nSends the email\nAll of these components (front end, back end, and microservice) will be built using a single code base that produces  multiple binaries, using Gnu Make.",

The first thing that is going to stand out is that we are going to move away from the boring, non-useful demos. In the new course, we are going to build a practical application from start to finish.\nWhile we are creating this application together we will take a look at some of the new features Spring Framework 5 & Spring Boot 2 have to offer. By taking this course you will have the latest skills that you need to build real applications using the Spring Framework.\n\n\nWhat is Spring Boot?\nSpring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can \"just run\".\nSpring Boot takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.\n\n\nBuild anything with Spring Boot\nSpring Boot is the starting point for building all Spring-based applications. Spring Boot is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible, with minimal upfront configuration of Spring.\nGet started in seconds using Spring Initializr\nBuild anything - REST API, WebSocket, Web, Streaming, Tasks, and more\nSimplified Security\nRich support for SQL and NoSQL\nEmbedded runtime support - Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow\nDeveloper productivity tools such as live reload and auto restart\nCurated dependencies that just work\nProduction-ready features such as tracing, metrics and health status\nWorks in your favorite IDE - Spring Tool Suite, IntelliJ IDEA and NetBeans",

You will begin with new language features and will gradually move on to library components and then to the traps and pitfalls and ways to avoid them. You will learn about STL components such as <utility>, smart pointers, `std::function`, `std::move`, and `std::exchange`, while at the same time reinforcing and deepening your understanding of the new language features. From here, you will learn to examine containers, iterators, function objects, with STL algorithms and lambda expressions. You will also be introduced to some upcoming C++17 additions including language features such as `constexpr` lambdas, and library additions such as the new algebraic data types and metaprogramming utilities. Throughout the course, you will learn the common pitfalls in \"old\" C++ programming and best practices for software development in Modern C++.\nBy the end of the course, you will have mastered Modern C++'s most impactful language and library features.\nAbout the Author :\n\nVittorio Romeo\n\nVittorio has been a C++ enthusiast from a young age, with a BS in Computer Science from the Università degli Studi di Messina, and now works at Bloomerg LP.

      "description": "Hi guys and girls, nice to see you here :) This is my 2nd course about Webpack, and this time my goal is to help you understand how you can optimize your Webpack configurations for production use cases. In this course we are going to focus on how to make your Webpack bundles as small as possible, and how to make your application loading times as fast as possible.\nThis course is specifically designed for those people who already know some Webpack basics, and want to become experts in creating optimized Webpack configurations from scratch as well as improving existing Webpack configurations.\nIn this course we are going to take an existing web application that's not using any kind of module bundlers, and apply various Webpack features in order to optimize this application and improve its loading performance. This means you will see how Webpack works in real world use cases. Each lesson builds on top of the previous ones, so it’s very easy to follow.\nHere are just a few examples of what we are going to talk about.\nIn one of the sections, I will show you 7 different approaches of handling CSS in your applications, including CSS Modules and a couple of CSS-in-JS libraries. As a result, you will become familiar with many approaches and you will be able to choose the most suitable one for your specific needs.\nIn another section, we are going to have a long discussion about Code Splitting and Lazy Loading. Webpack is extremely good at Code Splitting, and we are going to talk about that a lot in this course. I will show you multiple Code Splitting strategies you can apply, and we will even define our own strategy applicable to the application we are developing in this course. After watching this course you won't ever be frustrated when you hear the words \"Code Splitting\" again.\nAlso, we are going to cover topics related to Optimizing Images for Production, Tree Shaking, Compression algorithms, and many more! After watching this course you will definitely have some ideas on how to improve performance of your existing web applications. I can also promise that you will know more about Webpack than the average Front End Developer in your company.\nI am regularly updating this course, so you can be sure that this course is always up-to-date and covers the latest Webpack features.\nIf you have any questions related to Webpack, feel free to post them in Q&A section. Many people have already found answers to their questions in Q&A, and I will be more than happy to help you with your questions as well.",

      "description": "This Course In a Nutshell\nI'm sure that you already heard a lot about Angular Signals, and how they provide you with a completely new way of writing Angular applications!\nYou probably also heard that RxJs is gradually becoming optional in Angular.\nSo the big question in everyone's mind is: what does an Angular application look like if it's written with signals and minimal RxJs?\nAnd that is exactly what this course is all about!\nWe are going to build a small application in Angular using signals, and present you with some common design patterns that are you likely going to need almost for sure to build an application in signal style.\nCourse Overview\nSo here is how we are going to structure this course: we are going to start by explaining in detail what are signals in Angular, why they are useful, and cover in depth the 3 core primitives: signals, computed signals and effects.\nThen we are going to use the core signal concepts to build a small Angular application from scratch using the new signal-based component authoring API (we will avoid the old API that is based on decorators).\nWe are going to cover a complete CRUD example using signals and a local backend, and we are going to cover different ways of doing HTTP in Angular using async/await, with and without the Angular HTTP client.\nWe are going to show how to do error handling, and cover how to implement using a signal-based approach common application features such as loading indicators, user messages handling, master-detail scenario, stateful signal-based services, and several other common application features and patterns that you are likely going to need.\nWe will also show how to handle authentication on the frontend using signals and functional guards.\nAnd if you need RxJs for certain edge cases, you will also learn about the powerful RxJs interoperability that we have available with signals.\nTable of Contents\nThis course covers the following topics:\nDeep dive into Angular Signals\nAbout signal-based change detection\nComputed Signals\nEffects\nThe new signal-based component API: inputs and outputs\nComplete CRUD example with signals\nHTTP with optional RxJs (two ways of doing it)\nError handling and signals\nLoading indicators with signals\nStateful signal-based services\nHandling user error messages with signals\nAngular Authentication with signals\nSignal-based view queries\nviewChild, viewChildren, contentChild, contentChildren\nBi-directional binding with signals and the model() API\nMaster-detail scenario with Signals\nRxJs Interoperability\nConclusion and final Thoughts\nWhat Will You Learn In this Course?\nIn this course you are going to learn in detail how to use signals to build modern Angular applications using the new signal-based component authoring API, async/await and with minimal RxJs.\nYou are going to become familiar with a series of commonly used signal-based application patterns that you are going to need for sure in just about any signal based application that you will ever build.\nAt the end of the course, you will feel very comfortable with the core notions of signals, and you will know how exactly to use signals to build an Angular application from A to Z.\nHave a look at the course free lessons, and please enjoy the course!",

Each challenge consists of a task and solution, where you will either fix existing code or write additional logic.\n\n\nI will walk you through every line of the solution, explaining how JavaScript works behind the scenes. By the end of the course, you won’t just memorize syntax—you’ll think like a JavaScript developer.\n\n\nTopics covered:\n• Destructuring – Efficiently extract values from arrays and objects.\n• Array helper methods – Master map(), filter(), reduce(), and more.\n• Variable hoisting – Understand how JavaScript moves declarations.\n• Let, Var, and Const – Learn which one to use and when.\n• Rest and Spread Operators – Simplify array and object manipulations.\n• Ternary Operator – Write cleaner, more concise conditionals.\n• Default parameters – Handle function arguments effectively.\n• Closures – Unlock the power of function scope.\n• IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) – Execute code instantly.\n• Classes – Leverage modern JavaScript object-oriented programming.\n\n\nAt the start of the course, you’ll get source files for all challenges, including both the starting point and final solutions. Simply open the “start” folder, begin coding, and follow along as I guide you through real-world scenarios.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be confident in solving JavaScript challenges, writing clean and efficient code, and applying these concepts in real projects.",

      "description": "***Quizzes, Hands-On Practices and Unique Projects are Included***\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular language independent, data interchange format. JSON has significantly improved server-to-browser communications, especially when it comes to AJAX. Most of today's APIs return the response in JSON format as it is much easier to load, read and process JSON compared to XML, making it very popular.\nJavaScript Object Notation is text-based and human-readable. JSON is very easy to use with JavaScript as the syntax of JSON is a subset of JavaScript. Though it is a subset of JavaScript, JSON is language-independent. Most of the popular programming languages including PHP, Ruby, C#, Python etc. support JSON making it the widely used data interchange format.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOliver says\n\"Excellent Course. I am learning easily all the concepts. Instructor explain with real examples. I have the feeling to be working online with the instructor. Very well explained.\"\nRayvn Manuel says\n\"The repetition in the explanation really helps to remember and recall the information. The approach to the topics is gradual; meaning, starting from the basics and slowly introducing more. And I appreciate the comparison of technologies since its really helpful to understand why use one technology over another.\"\nIdo Yogev says\n\"Very nice course, straight to the point. Topics are illustrated simple and professional form. Warmly recommended !!!\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"JSON in Action: Build JSON-Based Applications\" is a 100% hands-on JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) course. By the end of this course, you will not only understand what JSON is, but also learn how to develop applications making use of real-world APIs that return JSON data. Just learning JSON syntax is not going to help you in anyways. You should be able to use JSON in the development process. Though AJAX and APIs do not come under the scope of this course, here we discuss how to use AJAX to contact APIs and then to collect the JSON result returned by APIs.\nThis course is structured as follows:\nIn the first section, you will understand what JSON is, compare JSON and XML and also learn why JSON is not JavaScript Object.\nIn the second section, you will understand JSON in more detail. You will learn JSON syntax rules and different data types (number, string, boolean, null, array and object) you can use in JSON data. You will also practise to identify different data types in real world JSON data and also to write JSON data on your own.\nIn the next section, you will understand how easy it is to use JSON with JavaScript. You will learn how to use JSON.parse and JSON.stringify methods to convert JSON data to JavaScript objects and JavaScript objects to JSON strings respectively. You will also learn how to get the required information from the available JSON data. You will understand the difference between dot notation and bracket notation. You will also learn how to use XMLHttpRequest object to fetch the .json file from a server.\nThe fourth section explains how to use AJAX techniques to contact an API and to collect the JSON output returned by the API. You will learn how to contact the API using GET or POST methods and also making a synchronous or asynchronous requests. You will also see how you can pass JSON as the input to an API.\nIn the next section, we discuss how to use JSON with PHP. This lecture explains json_encode and json_decode methods. This section will be updated to teach you how to use JSON with other programming languages as well.\nThe last section is the Let's Develop section where you are going to apply your JSON knowledge to develop some applications on your own. Now there are two applications in this section.\nCurrency Converter\nBMI Calculator\nThe first application \"Currency Converter\" application contacts a real-world API, collects the JSON data, and performs currency conversion. The second application \"BMI Calculator\" is a more detailed one. As part of this application, you will be developing a simple API using PHP. You will contact that API (which you designed on your own), collect the JSON response and then process it to get the result you want.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Join this 100% practical JSON course and start developing API-based applications on your own applying JSON knowledge.",

This is the sequel, continuing your JavaScript education and diving into even more advanced concepts, under-the-hood!\nIn this course you will learn to deeply understand how modern advanced JavaScript language features work under-the-hood, such as:\nBlock Scoping (let and const)\nTemplates\nClasses\nArrow Functions\nSymbols\nIterators and Iterables\nDefault Parameters\nRest and Spread\nES6 and beyond refers to features added to the JavaScript language in ES6 and ES Next.

You won't try to learn by imitating the code I'm writing, but rather by deeply understanding how these language features work inside JavaScript engines. Deeply understanding means you will not only write better code, but also find it much easier to debug problems.\nThis course’s goal, then, is to help you have a deep understanding of JavaScript’s newest features.

Build the entire security and interaction systems between each microservice. All of that using PHP with Lumen.\n\n\nSo, do not wait any more, and enroll now :)\n\n\nWhy should you take this course?\nBecause it gives you a detailed view, as in no other course, of a service-oriented architecture that is fully functional and secured using PHP and Lumen.\nBecause you will be able and confident enough to implement your microservices and architectures using Lumen and PHP.\nBecause it not only shows you the benefits of microservices and their architectures but also shows you how to solve the challenges that microservices represents\nBecause it shows you how to secure all the microservices in the architecture and control the access to them\n\n\nWhat will you be able to do at the end of the course?\nIn general, you will be able to implement any microservices architecture you need using PHP and Lumen. You will have a clear idea of how to implement each microservice with Lumen, as well as how the interaction between each of these microservices should be structured, how to build a complete security layer that protects and restricts access to each microservice in the architecture using OAuth2 with Lumen/Laravel Passport along with authenticate users and use different grant types of OAuth2.\nYou will feel confident to take your path and carry out your projects with all the microservices and components you want with PHP and Lumen.\n\n\nWhat will you learn exactly?\nCreate projects in Lumen by Laravel\nConfigure and use Lumen easily in your system without complex processes\nUse Lumen properly for its ideal purpose: the microservices\nBuild a fully functional service-oriented architecture from scratch\nUse OAuth2 to protect access to your architecture, through Lumen/Laravel Passport\nInstall and adapt Laravel Passport to Lumen projects\nCreate access tokens associated with users to handle users data and authorization flows\nAuthenticate users credentials and restrict access to only valid users if needed\nAuthorize and use different kinds of access tokens to restrict the action over your resources\nCreate a complete system of interaction between microservices through HTTP requests with GuzzleHTTP from Lumen\nBuild fully functional and adequate services with Lumen\nReturns and builds standardized JSON responses with Lumen\nSeparate the components of a service-oriented architecture appropriately\nHandle errors and exceptions appropriately to ensure the consistency of the entire architecture\nBuild and implement, correctly, an API Gateway for your architecture\nCentralize the consumption of your service-oriented architecture through an API Gateway with Lumen\nAnd a lot much more. You will have access for life to each class that makes up the course and those that will come later. You also have direct access to me, so you can ask me questions and solve all your doubts.\nDo not wait any longer, cheer up and join the course and give free rein to all the possibilities that Lumen offers with a service-oriented architecture.",

      "description": "INTRODUCTION\nAugmented reality has the potential to become massively adopted on the web, where users don’t have to download apps or make sure they have the latest hardware. WebXR is one of the newest, official web APIs that allows developers to create VR and AR experiences using Javascript.\nDon’t miss out on being one of the first developers to be well-versed in a technology that will be all over the web soon. Within less than an hour you could be creating your own AR experiences on the web!\n\n\nSUBTITLES\nEnglish closed captions have been manually transcribed and are high quality.\nSubtitles available in Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, German, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Hindi, and Turkish.\n\n\nCONTENT\nBy the end of this course you will know the basics of how to create simple augmented reality experiences on the web and a basic understanding of how to design and code 3D experiences. Each lecture includes sample code and external link examples to support your learning.\nSpecifically you will learn how to:\nCreate basic AR apps on the web using WebXR\nUse a powerful 3D library called Three.js used by millions of applications on the web\nLoad and display 3D objects and models in AR\nAnimate objects and models\nPositioning and rotation in AR\nWork with different types of 3D models\nUse touch gestures to provide interactivity\nConvert any Three.js application into an AR app\nTest WebXR experiences on your desktop, iOS, or Android devices\n\n\nPREREQUISITES\nWhile you will find it useful to have some previous Javascript and web programming knowledge, the class can be followed by absolute beginners as the coding environment is simple and the code examples are set up with many comments and explanations. If you don’t know anything about 3D environments, augmented reality, Three.js or WebXR then this class is for you.\n\nWhile you can prototype WebXR using any desktop computer, to simulate real mobile AR you want to have either an iOS device that supports ARKit (most phones or iPads after 2017) or an Android device that supports ARCore (most phones after 2016).\n\n\nABOUT US\nWe are a coding school specializing in the exciting new technology of augmented reality on the web. No more downloading of apps or cumbersome coding in Swift or Java, just create your AR app in Javascript, HTML, and CSS and make it available painlessly to millions of people all over the world.",

      "description": "Hello,\nWelcome to the \"Typescript & React JS Course with React & Typescript Project\" course.\nTypescript and ReactJS course helps you understand React JS & Type script in detail with real Typescript React Projects\nTypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It introduces additional features like strict type binding (variables are bound to specific data types) to JavaScript and can also be compiled down to Java Script as well. TypeScript, Typescript, Type script, typescript react, react typescript, react js, hooks and context\nTypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.\nTypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.\nTypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs. TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.\nTypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.\nTypeScript is a superset of typed JavaScript (optional) that can help build and manage large-scale JavaScript projects. It can be considered JavaScript with additional features like strong static typing, compilation, and object-oriented programming.\nReact is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.\nReact is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.\nReact is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.\n\n\nThis React training can help you become skilled in using this powerful JavaScript tool. With this React course, you can learn how to create elements that let users update data in real time, create useful interactive components on a webpage, and so much more. Millions have learned to use React with JavaScript with Oak Academy, and you can too.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is Typescript?\nTypeScript is a programming language that helps developers turn medium-sized JavaScript projects and prototypes into large-scale ones. JavaScript, a widely-used programming language, was designed to be easy to use for developers and non-developers alike. As a result, JavaScript development is difficult to scale up. Microsoft introduced typescript react to solve this scalability problem. TypeScript is often referred to as JavaScript with typescript react because it allows developers to find errors while writing their code rather than wait until the application is running. And because TypeScript  is a syntactical superset of JavaScript, any JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program.\n\nWhat is the difference Typescript and Javascript?\nTypescript is a superset of JavaScript. As its name suggests, Type script adds optional static typing to the JavaScript language. JavaScript is a scripting language that allows developers to create dynamic web content. It is known for being fairly easy to use and learn. This makes it a popular programming language for small and medium-scale web projects. Developers use Type script when they need to scale up their JavaScript development. Its language is more powerful and intuitive, allowing developers to find and correct errors during compile time, rather than only during run-time, as with JavaScript. TypeScript is better suited than JavaScript for large applications, but it requires a foundational knowledge of JavaScript to use.\n\nWhat careers use Typescript?\nTypeScript is mainly associated with development careers. Typical job titles for TypeScript developers include senior developer, front end developer, stack developer, and software engineer. Because react typescript and typescript node is a superset of JavaScript, learning react typescript is a great next step for engineers who are already skilled in JavaScript. Programming knowledge is applicable in just about every industry, so developers with an understanding of TypeScript (which implies skill in JavaScript) might work in a wide range of fields building applications for both server-side and client-side execution.\n\nWhat is TypeScript and why use it?\nTypeScript features, syntax, and keywords in nodejs typescript\nTooling and Framework Options\nHow to create a class\nTypeScript variables and functions in angular typescript\nTypeScript declarations\nTypeScript classes and interfaces\nMuch more...\nWhat is React?\nReact is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.\nWhat is React used for?\nReact is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.\nHow does React work?\nReact encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.\nIs React a framework or library?\nFrameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.\nIs React worth learning?\nYes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.\nIs React hard to learn?\nEvery technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.\nWhat is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?\nReact, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.\nWhy is React so popular?\nThere are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.\nThis course is going to take you from the beginning to a further level.

Applications in APEX are configured and not coded. But don't let that fool you. APEX is modern and allows for advanced web programming if you want to get your hands dirty. In this course we dive into the basics and intermediate level of APEX configuration. There is no heavy coding in this course. We use configuration and drag-and-drop in this course to get some pretty advanced functionality.\nWhat terminology would your audience expect to find in this course?\nWe cover all of APEX's terminology (Don't worry if you are not familiar)\nTable, Sequences, Workspace, Page, Page Designer, Application Builder, SQL Workshop, Exporting, Importing, Interactive Reports, Regions, Items, Buttons, Select Lists, List Managers, Template Options, Icon Classes, Shared Components, Authentication Schemes, Theme Roller, Dynamic Actions, Application Rollback, Team Development Module, Packaged Apps, Page Processes, Branching, Page Redirection, SQL, Query Builder, and so much more\nWe also cover some web and database terminology (Would help to have a basic understanding)\nHTML, h1, h2, div, SQL, Select, From, Where\nWhat kind of material are included?\nThe format for this course is watch and follow along. You are given two options for following along:\nRequest your own Oracle Workspace and follow along (Free)\nInstall your own instance of Oracle XE and APEX (Free) on your Windows machine\nBoth options are free. The student is expected to complete all of the same exercises in the video.\nHow long will the course take to complete?\nThe student should expect to dedicate 8 or more hours to complete the course.\nHow is this course structured?\nWatch and follow along. I take you from beginning to end with this course video series. I will occasionally ask you to pause the video and complete a task to test your skills.\nWhy take this course?\nThere is nothing like seeing a developer in action and watching them build from beginning to end. You can try and use a book or blog tutorial to get your knowledge about APEX. But the experience with those formats could end up leaving you stuck. APEX is the future of web application development. If you think visually and would prefer to configure an application rather than get stuck in the weeds with code, take this course and get started on your next web app.",

GraphQL is a query language invented by Facebook in 2012, and made open source in 2015. While it has certain clear advantages over REST, it also has a somewhat steeper learning curve.\nStructured in a simple and accessible manner, these lectures will help you get on your way to using GraphQL to circulate data between back-end and front-end applications.\nIn the first section we will learn about reading data. The second section will be focused on changing data, and the slightly more advanced third section is about protecting data, using techniques both implemented in the GraphQL library or suggested by myself.\nGraphQL has a number of features that make it an advantageous change for REST adopters, like the ability to only get what you ask for, or having instant API documentation available after every change. After completing this course, you'll be in a position to implement GraphQL in a new or existing Rails application with basic features all the way up to authorisation and access control.

This means you can use all the features of CSS you use and love with styled components, including (but by far not limited to) media queries, all pseudo-selectors, nesting, etc.\nIn this styled components course we'll be creating a very basic 2 page mobile-first app using create-react-app. We'll be using styled components to style our entire app, including applying global styles, implementing third party fonts using Google fonts, creating a common mobile-first and responsive Layout, creating variations for components via props (for example a large or small Button), implementing a theme toggle component and switching our app between 'light' and 'dark' mode, as well as implementing animations with styled components.\nReact took the traditional view / viewmodel approach to web development and combined them both into one, while still keeping code modular and single responsibility. Styled Components can be seen as an extension of that, bringing the styling into the JS file as well. They all have one to one relationships, so it makes sense to combine them as long as they're kept modular. This React styled components course will help you understand the power of this approach and show you how to build such components.\n\n\nWhat other students are saying about this React Styled Components course:\n5/5 stars - \"Nice course, It improved my understanding of Styled-components.\" - Osborne Tunde\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"I loved the course that was extremely useful for me and helped me finally understand how styled-components works. Without any doubt, I recommend this course and I will go back to the future courses of Tom who is an excellent instructor. Thank you!\" - Alex Pavlov\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"I love this course so much, Tom is very responsive with the student question. No copy paste code, that we know all students doesn't like it. There's so many new information and a modern way to write a components, I like it so much and I will implement it to my projects :) Thank you Tom for helping us !\" - Kadek Pradnyana\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"A great introduction to styled components in React. It goes through each of the most common scenarios to help you start building. Excellent course!\" - Memo Ramirez\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"A great intro to the styled-components way of styling React components.\" - Ian Taite\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"I did not know that this is possible.

      "description": "Welcome to the Amazon EC2 Foundations Certification course. This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS.\n\nThe term “Scalable Cloud Computing” has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world’s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.\n\nTo illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 “Instance” we’re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it’s resources. This includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth.\n\nSimilar to physical servers that you might find on-premises, virtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers. These configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.\n\nThe level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it’s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.\n\nBeyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).\nIn addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2. This includes:\nExploring the characteristics of EC2 Instances.\nEC2 Instance Types\nCreating IAM Users for EC2\nDeploying EC2 Instances with pre-configured AMIs\nAssigning Elastic IP's to Deployed Instances\nEC2 Instance Administration\nCreating Security Groups for Deployed Instances\nRemote EC2 Administration using SSH Utilities like Terminal for MAC, and PuTTY for Windows.\nUsing EC2 Instance Connect to administer instances.\nIf you're interested in learning how to deploy and administer virtual machines on the most robust cloud computing platform, hit the enroll button and let's jump right in.",

I've been a freelance web developer for over 12 years. You might know me from my popular YouTube channel or the work I've done for well-known clients like New York Times Bestselling Author Michael Hyatt, Internet Celebrity (and Ellen regular) Lewis Howes, Inc. Magazine and others.\nOver the years, I've taught hundreds of thousands of web developers how to code.\nAnd, I've finally put my flagship PHP courses here on Udemy.\nThat's what this course is.\nI've taken my five most popular training courses and packaged them here in one big mega-course that's going to take you from beginner to building the kind of professional PHP applications clients and employers are starving for. But, let me be upfront with you before you go any further...\nI teach leaders...\nPeople willing to break the rules.\nMy goal for you isn't for you to just know what everyone else does. I'm going to challenge you to think differently and deeper... to be creative and try new things. I don't want you to be the one simply using the shiny new \"thing\" someone else developed. I want you to be the one building that shiny new thing.\nThe latest and greatest design pattern...\nOr, a newer and better framework...\nThe next multi-million user application.\nI don't want you to just be a user of these things. I want you to be the \"mastermind\" behind them. Sounds amazing... but, it's no small task. So, I'm not going to just show you one way of doing things or give you all \"my\" answers. I want you to learn how to develop your own answers.\nBecause you understand the code at such a deep level.\nThat means... this course isn't for everyone.\nBUT...\nIf you're ready to challenge yourself and take not just your PHP skills, but all your coding skills up a notch... then, this course is for you. Here's some of the things you're going to learn:\nHow to create a secure login form\n\nHow to build cryptographically secure tokens\n\nObject-oriented programming\n\nHow to send email via PHP\n\nHow to create a multi-page form using sessions\n\nHow to upload files\n\nHow to create folders\n\nHow to create a contact form\n\nArrays, loops...\n\nIf, else and switch\n\nPrepared statements\n\nPDO and MySQLi\n\nAnd, a lot more.\nPLUS, I've added module 2 of my Upwork 101 course that will show you how to build your Upwork profile to BOTH persuade clients to hire you AND rank higher on Upwork... so your profile actually gets seen and you can get paid for all these new skills you're going to learn.\nSo, if you're ready to take the challenge...\nAnd, finally just GO for it!\nEnroll in the Beginner's Guide to PHP and let's get crackin'.",

We take a bottom-up approach and first study all the elements (actors, endpoints, and tokens) of OpenID Connect. This puts us in an excellent position for the second step: to understand the various OpenID Connect Flows - how the actors, endpoints, and tokens are put together to transmit identity claims securely.\n\n\nDo you wonder why there are several OpenID Connect Flows?\nWhether we use OpenID Connect from a mobile app, a script in a browser or from a secure backend server, there is an appropriate OpenID Connect Flow with the right tradeoffs in security, functionality, and convenience for each of these scenarios. This course helps you to choose the right one.\n\n\nDo you think that these OpenID Connect Flows are confusing?\nYou are not alone; the OpenID Connect Flows tend to get confusing. However, with this course, we make it clear and easy to understand: We visualize these flows and show how to choose the flow that is appropriate for a given scenario. A picture says more than a 1000 words - that is why we explain the OpenID Connect Flows using easy to understand sequence diagrams.\n\n\nDo you want to understand how JWT works?\nThis course explains what a JSON Web Token (JWT) is, how it is used in OpenID Connect, how it is constructed, what data it contains, how to read it, and how to protect its contents.\n\n\nDo you wonder why there are so many tokens in OpenID Connect and how to use them?\nThere are JWT, JWS, JWE, access tokens, refresh tokens, identity tokens, and authorization codes. This book helps you to make sense of them all. Using examples, we explore how the tokens are used, constructed, signed, and encrypted.\n\n\nWhy is OpenID Connect so popular?\nIf used in the right way, OpenID Connect is powerful, and everyone loves it:\nEnd-users don't need to signup and remember a new password\nBusiness owners enjoy high conversion rates\nDevelopers don't get any grey hair over securely storing credentials.\nDo you want to increase the conversion rate of your app?\nSignup and login to a new app become so smooth and convenient that end-users are much more likely to try a new app. It is supported, e.g. by Google, Yahoo, or Microsoft.\n\n\n\nThis course is for you...\n\n...if you want to improve your market value as a Software Engineer and Security Expert. Imagine what could happen to your professional career if you could add OpenID Connect, API Security and OAuth skills to your CV!\nAPI Security experts and engineers who understand OpenID Connect are in HIGH DEMAND, as companies expand their digital business. Plenty of opportunities are waiting for anyone who has the right skills.\nDo you want to write best-selling iPhone and Android apps?\nThe most popular mobile apps integrate with popular social APIs of Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Paypal and many more. If this is a well-known fact, why do app developers not just do it?\nMany app developers are afraid of complicated OpenID Connect integrations. Identity, Login, and Signup are in fact the biggest hurdle for most mobile app developers.\nWith the knowledge gained in this course, you can use the secret of best app developers out there and finally integrate your app with social APIs.\nDo you want to start out on your own, as an entrepreneur, consultant or freelancer?\nKnowing API Security, OAuth, and OpenID Connect allows you to realize the big vision of your company in the field of mobile apps, cloud apps and web APIs, such as Google, Paypal, and LinkedIn.\nDo you want to build exciting solutions with next-generation technology?\nWhether you are a web developer, mobile developer or API developer, an architect or embedded developer for the Internet of Things, today you need to know OpenID Connect to build state of the art solutions.\nWhat does this course offer?\nThis course offers an introduction to API Security with OpenID Connect. In 7 hours you will gain an overview of the capabilities of OpenID Connect and OAuth. You will learn the core concepts of OpenID Connect. You will get to know all 3 OpenID Connect flows that are used in cloud solutions and mobile apps.\nThis course explains OpenID Connect in simple terms. The three OpenID Connect flows are visualized graphically using sequence diagrams. The diagrams are then animated so you get to know the interactions step by step and see the big picture of the various OpenID Connect interactions. This high-level overview is complemented with a rich set of example requests and responses and an explanation of the technical details.\nWho should take this course?\nDo you believe OpenID Connect is complicated? OpenID Connect may seem complex with flows and redirects going back and forth. This course will give you clarity by introducing the seemingly complicated material by many illustrations. These illustrations clearly show all the involved interaction parties and the messages they exchange.\nDo you want to learn the OpenID Connect concepts efficiently? This course uses many animated diagrams and sequence diagrams. A good diagram says more than 1000 words.\nDo you want to use OpenID Connect in your mobile app? If you want to access resources that are protected by OAuth, you need to get a token first, before you can access the resource. For this, you need to understand the OAuth flows and the dependencies between the steps of the flows.",

      "description": "The Flask Mega-Tutorial is an overarching tutorial for Python beginner and intermediate developers that teaches web development with the Flask framework. The tutorial was born as a series of blog articles, and has been thoroughly revised, updated and expanded as a result of a successful Kickstarter campaign. The concepts that are covered go well beyond Flask, including a wide range of topics Python web developers need to know when writing their own applications.\nThe goal of the course is to build a nicely featured social blogging web application. Chapter 1 begins with a very simple version of this application that has just a few lines of code. Then, each successive chapter adds a new feature to it. The 23 chapters in this course can be roughly split into two parts: the first 12 chapters are focused on basic web development concepts, while the remaining 11 chapters cover intermediate and advanced techniques. All the code featured in this tutorial is open source, and is available on GitHub. You are welcome to use any of it for your own projects!\nThis edition of the tutorial includes over 11 hours of video showing how to perform all the steps in detail. For added context, the blog articles from where this tutorial originated are available on Miguel Grinberg's blog.\nImportant Note: The content in this tutorial was created in 2018 and revised in 2021, so you should expect minor issues due to changes in Python, Flask and other dependencies used. The blog version of this tutorial can be used as guidance to resolve problems.",

      "description": "Seems like everyday you can find a news story about a security breach, which can be devastating to companies.\nClearly, security is a very important topic.\nThe Spring Framework is the most popular Java framework for building cloud scale applications.\nSpring Security provides you all the tools you need to secure your Java application.\nApplication security is much more than allowing access after checking a user name and password. You will learn how to limit what application features a user may or may not see. And also, how to limit what data a user may or may not see.\nThis course focuses on the core fundamentals of Spring Security.\nCentral to Spring Security is the process of Authentication. This is the process of establishing a user's identity.\nOnce a user's identity is established, the process of Authorization is used to allow the user to access specific actions and features of an application.\nSpring Security has a very robust toolset for Authentication and Authorization.\nInside this course, you will master both.\nYou will start the course by learning how to leverage the auto-configuration capabilities of Spring Boot to quickly secure a web application using HTTP Basic Authentication.\nThen, you'll be lead through a series of exercises, to replace and customize the default Spring Boot auto-configuration.\nThrough this process, you will understand the Spring Boot hidden 'magic', and learn how to master the configuration of Spring Security.\nYou will be working with a typical Spring Boot Web Application. The application mimics a robust monolithic application - with web pages and RESTful endpoints. This allows us to explore the unique security aspects unique to both web applications and RESTFul APIs.\nYou may notice there is not a dedicated section of the course about Testing Spring Security. This is because testing is done throughout the course.\nTest Driven Development (TDD) is widely considered a best practice in software engineering.\nAs we explore the features of Spring Security, we will follow a TDD approach.\nWe will first write a failing test using JUnit 5, Mockito, and Spring MockMVC, then complete the lesson objective to get a passing test.\nYou will see some great examples of testing Spring with JUnit 5. However, it is recommended you have prior experience with JUnit 5.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nHTTP Basic Authentication with Spring Security\nSpring Security Java Configuration\nUsing an In-Memory Authentication Provider\nUsing Spring Security for Password Management\nBest Practices for Password Security\nCreating Custom Authentication Filters\nUsing a database with Spring Data JPA for Authentication\nUser Roles with Spring Security\nUser Authorities with Spring Security\nMultitenancy Security\nConfigure Spring Security for CSRF Protection\nCreate a custom login form\nUsing Remember Me\nHow to lock out users after too many failed attempts\nHow to unlock accounts automatically after a period of time\nCORS with Spring Security\nCourse Extra - IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate\nStudents enrolling in the course can receive a free 120 day trial license to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate! Get hands on experience using the Java IDE preferred by Spring Framework professionals!\nCourse Extra - Access to a Private Slack Community\nYou're not just enrolling in a course --> You are joining a community learning about Spring Security.\nWith your enrollment to the course, you can access an exclusive Slack community. Get help from the instructor and other Spring Framework Gurus from around the world - in real time! This community is only available to students enrolled in this course.\nWith your enrollment, you can join this community of awesome gurus!\nClosed Captioning / Subtitles\nClosed captioning in English is available for all course videos!\nPDF Downloads\nAll keynote presentations are available for you to download as PDFs.\nLifetime Access\nWhen you purchase this course, you will receive lifetime access!

Also added a one hour live coding workshop that teaches how to build out tooltips on a website.\nHi and welcome to the HTML/CSS Bootcamp course, where we'll walk through the same course I teach code bootcamp students around the world. My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. In addition to being the lead instructor for devCamp I've also been building web applications for over a decade for organizations such as Eventbrite and Quip.\nIn this course, you're going to learn all of the key skills that you're going to need in order to start building out professional websites. Before building this new course out, I interviewed hiring managers at companies around the world and asked them what HTML/CSS skills they expected developers to know and that's how I came up with the list of concepts that you're going to learn.\nSome of the skills that you're going to learn are going to be:\nHTML5\nCSS3\nFlexbox\nCSS Grid\nAnimations\nMedia queries for building responsive layouts from scratch\nCSS Selectors\nNavigation\nFonts\nForms\nHow to integrate and style images\nFront end development best practices\nAnd much more!\nAs we go through the course material, you'll notice that I'm going to teach you my own process that I use whenever I'm building out a website.\nMy goal for this entire course isn't just to teach you how to build a single website, but instead my goal is to be able to leverage this project build that we're going to put together, teach you the fundamentals as we implement every single feature, and then by the end of it, you're not just going to be able to build the single website and follow along with what I do, but you'll be able to build any type of website.\nThere are no technical prerequisites for going through this course. This is the perfect course to go through if you want to learn how to build websites completely from scratch.\nThe ideal student is someone who is dedicated, wants to learn, and also wants to learn how to build websites using the most modern and up to date technologies. So, thank you for spending the time and going through this material, and good luck with the coding.",

Both starter and finished source code is provided as we go.\nReviews\n\"Best course I have ever seen\" \"Best intro to AngularJS on Udemy\" \"A fresh way of teaching AngularJS\" \"One of the best courses on Udemy that i took if not the best\" \"Best teacher I have had on the internet by far\"\"I...have taken lots of angular courses and I think this is the best one so far\" \"The best teaching style I've seen so far\"\nIf you are new to AngularJS, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the AngularJS course for you! To learn AngularJS you have to understand it.\nI've built the course that I would have wanted to take when I was learning AngularJS. A course that explains the concepts and how they're implemented in the best order for you to learn and deeply understand them.\nIn this course you will:\nLearn how AngularJS works, covering subjects like directives, dependency injection, two way data binding, the digest loop, watchers, and more.\nLearn fundamental Javascript and HTML principles that are used by AngularJS, such as custom attributes, loosely typed arrays, the hash, and the event loop.\nCode custom services.\nDesign custom directives, understanding concepts like compile, link, and scope.\nBuild a single page application using AngularJS.\nKeep up with the latest on the next version of AngularJS 2.0!\nAngularJS doesn't have to be hard to learn. The biggest mistake most coding tutorials make is expecting someone to learn simply by imitating others' code. Real world situations are never exactly like the tutorial.\nI believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand AngularJS.\nNote: In this course you'll also get downloadable source code. You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to.",

Bis wir diese Welt entdeckt haben, müssen allerdings die meisten von uns (mal mehr mal weniger) unseren mühevoll geschriebenen JavaScript-Code auf Fehler untersuchen und unsere HTML-Strukturen und CSS-Styles optimieren und korrigieren. Zum Glück gibt es ein Hilfsmittel, von dem wahrscheinlich jeder schon mindestens einmal gehört und die meisten auch schon verwendet haben: die Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools).\nIn diesem Kurs lernst du, die DevTools effektiv zu nutzen, um deine Webanwendungen zu debuggen und zu optimieren. Die Chrome DevTools bieten eine Vielzahl von Funktionen, die dir dabei helfen können, Fehler zu finden, die Performance deiner Website zu verbessern und die Benutzerfreundlichkeit und das Aussehen zu optimieren. Sehr viele Funktionen lassen auch mehr oder weniger 1 zu 1 auf die Edge DevTools übertragen und viele Konzepte sind so oder so ähnlich auch in den Entwicklerwerkzeugen von Firefox und Safari verfügbar, so dass du den Kurs auch nutzen kannst, um die Konzepte hinter dem Debugging von Webanwendungen/Webseiten allgemein zu verstehen und somit mit diesem Wissen auch die DevTools der anderen Browser verwenden kannst.\nKursinhalte:\nEinführung in die Chrome DevTools:\nWas sind die Chrome DevTools?\nWie öffnest du die Chrome DevTools?\nÜberblick über die wichtigsten Funktionen\nNavigation in den DevTools\nDebugging von HTML und CSS:\nUntersuchung des DOM-Baums\nBearbeiten von HTML und CSS im Live-Modus\nDebuggen von CSS-Styling\nBeheben von Layout-Problemen\nDebugging von JavaScript:\nLaden und Ausführen von JavaScript-Dateien\nSetzen von Breakpoints und Haltepunkten\nSchrittweises Durchlaufen von JavaScript-Code\nUntersuchung von Variablen und Objekten\nNavigieren im CallStack\nVerwendung der Konsole\nKonsole öffnen und zur Analyse von Logs nutzen\nJavaScript-Code in der Konsole ausführen\nKonsole nutzen, um Elemente auf der Webseite zu manipulieren\nLogausgaben nutzen, um Code zu analysieren und zu optimieren\nOptimierung der Performance:\nAnalyse von Netzwerkrequests und dabei entstehenden Fehlern\nAnalyse der Seitenladezeit\nÜberwachung der Speichernutzung\nIdentifizierung von Speicherlecks\nOptimierung der JavaScript-Leistung\nAnalyse der Anwendungsperformance\nFortgeschrittene Techniken:\nDas Application-Panel zur Untersuchung von Webanwendungen und Webspeicher (LocalStorage, Indexed DB, Cache, Manifest, Service Worker) verwenden.\nReact-Erweiterung für die DevTools installieren und nutzen\nSettings zur optimalen Einrichtung der DevTools nutzen",

API выступает в роли связующего звена между клиентом и сервером, обрабатывает запросы, управляет данными и обеспечивает взаимодействие различных сервисов. В этом курсе мы шаг за шагом разберем полный процесс разработки API на Node.js, используя Express для маршрутизации и обработки запросов, PostgreSQL для хранения данных и Docker для контейнеризации и удобного развертывания сервиса.\n\n\nВы научитесь правильно выбирать и подготавливать данные, работать с разными источниками данных (CSV, SQL, API), проектировать оптимальную схему базы данных, разрабатывать гибкие и масштабируемые маршруты API, а также реализовывать различные типы запросов (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH). Кроме того, мы разберем пагинацию, фильтрацию, обработку ошибок, настройку CORS, работу с переменными окружения и документирование API. В результате вы получите готовый к продакшену сервис, который можно адаптировать под собственные проекты или использовать как основу для будущих разработок.\n\n\nКурс охватывает полный цикл разработки API:\n• Подготовка данных и выбор базы данных\n• Поиск и загрузка данных (CSV, SQL, API)\n• Определение схемы базы данных и выбор подходящей СУБД\n• Запуск базы данных и сервисов в Docker\n• Основы Docker и контейнеризация\n• Использование Docker Compose для управления многими контейнерами\n• Работа с томами и настройка базы данных MongoDB\n• Создание и управление данными в PostgreSQL\n• Разработка моделей данных\n• Загрузка данных в базу с планированием\n• Экспорт, импорт и оптимизация SQL-запросов\n• Разработка API с использованием Express\n• Реализация маршрутов и запросов (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH)\n• Обработка параметров запроса, пагинация и поиск данных\n• Работа с CORS, переменными окружения и конфигурацией\n• Документирование и развертывание сервиса\n• Создание README файла для API\n• Подготовка сервиса к продакшен-развертыванию\n\n\nВ процессе обучения мы будем работать с современными инструментами и практиками, чтобы ваш API был эффективным, безопасным и готовым к масштабированию. Вы получите практические навыки, которые можно применить сразу после прохождения курса.\n\n\nЭтот курс подходит как для начинающих, так и для опытных разработчиков, так как включает детальные объяснения основ и продвинутых тем. В конце обучения у вас будет полноценный API сервис, который можно использовать в своих проектах.\n\n\nКурс предоставляется с гарантией возврата средств в течение 30 дней, так что вы ничем не рискуете. Присоединяйтесь и начинайте строить свой API уже сегодня!",

Skoro zdecydowaliście się ruszyć z nami na tę pouczającą wycieczkę, to z pewnością dysponujecie znajomością języka HTML! Jeśli go jeszcze nie znacie, radzimy szybko to zmienić. HTML bowiem stanowi bazę, bez której trudno stworzyć stronę WWW lub aplikację. Jeśli trzymać się tej terminologii - skoro HTML nazywamy bazą, to o języku JavaScript powinniśmy powiedzieć: nadbudowa.\nBez znajomości i umiejętności korzystania z JavaScriptu trudno jest stworzyć jakąkolwiek stronę czy aplikację, która będzie atrakcyjna i interaktywna. JavaScript jest językiem skryptowym, a tworzone w nim skrypty pozwalają między innymi reagować na zdarzenia, walidować dane wprowadzane do formularzy czy tworzyć złożone efekty wizualne. Innymi słowy, projekt wsparty mocą JavaScriptu ożywa i staje się bardziej przyjazny dla użytkownika. Stąd każdy programista, w szczególności frontend developer, powinien dobrze opanować ten język i poznać pełnię jego możliwości!\n\nCo Cię czeka podczas naszego profesjonalnego szkolenia?\n\nDzięki temu kursowi video:\nPoznasz historię i powód powstania języka JavaScript.\nDowiesz się, czym są środowiska uruchomieniowe.\nZrozumiesz, czym jest JavaScript dla frontend, a czym dla backend developera.\nNauczysz się tworzyć zmienne oraz stałe.\nZaznajomisz się z wszystkimi niezbędnymi typami danych w JavaScripcie.\nPoznasz najczęściej używane metody natywne.\nZobaczysz, w jaki sposób pisze się nowoczesną aplikację webową i jak pracuje się z Bootstrapem 4.\nCo więcej...\nZrealizujesz w trakcie szkolenia dwa projekty, dzięki czemu zyskasz różne spojrzenia na te same sprawy i nauczysz się analizować.\nFrontend developer. Kurs video. JavaScript. Poziom podstawowy kończy się na poziomie podstawowym. Udział w nim oznacza nie tylko uzyskanie suchej wiedzy - będziesz także w stanie wykorzystać ją w praktyce.\n\nUkończywszy nasze szkolenie video...\nBędziesz przygotowany do tworzenia aplikacji webowych dowolnego typu, w tym zawierających elementy interaktywne, oraz dodawania tego typu elementów do funkcjonujących już aplikacji. Uzbrojony w wiedzę o możliwościach JavaScriptu, przygotujesz rozwiązania, które ułatwią Twoje programistyczne życie. A jeśli myślisz o karierze testera oprogramowania, mamy dla Ciebie dobrą wiadomość - po naszym kursie będziesz świetnie przygotowany do pisania testów automatycznych. Wreszcie - opanowanie JavaScriptu pomoże Ci zrozumieć podstawowe założenia języków programowania, co otworzy Ci drogę do nauki kolejnych języków.\n\nRadosław Madecki - fullstack developer oraz architekt w firmie Clearcode.

Vous apprendrez à structurer vos composants et à exploiter toute la puissance des hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext...).\n\n\nEnsuite, nous passerons à Next.js, qui vous permettra de créer des applications full-stack avec un rendu hybride client / serveur et une gestion optimale des routes et des performances. Nous explorerons des fonctionnalités avancées comme :\n- Les routes statiques et dynamiques,\n- L'utilisation de Prisma et MongoDB pour gérer une base de données,\n- La mise en place de NextAuth pour l'authentification des utilisateurs,\n- La création d'une API REST,\n- L'envoi d'e-mails directement depuis l'application.\n\n\nTout au long de la formation, nous adopterons Tailwind CSS pour styliser nos applications efficacement.\n\n\nEnfin, nous terminerons par un module sur l'intégration de Stripe, vous permettant d'ajouter un système de paiement à vos projets (idéal pour les sites e-commerce et les plateformes SaaS).\n\n\nCette formation est conçue pour être progressive et pratique. Vous construirez des projets concrets tout en assimilant les concepts fondamentaux et avancés du développement web.\n\n\nPourquoi choisir cette formation ?\n\n\n- Un programme à jour :  les dernières versions de React et Next.js, y compris les nouveaux hooks de React 19.\n- Un apprentissage progressif : partez de zéro et devenez autonomes en développement web full-stack.\n- Un accompagnement régulier : accès à la rubrique \"Questions/Réponses\" pour poser vos questions.",

Pokażę Ci realne przykłady konsekwencji braku testów, obalę popularne mity oraz pozbędziemy się Twoich wymówek, by nie pisać testów. Zobaczysz czym jest TDD oraz jak powinna wyglądać piramida testów w Twoim projekcie.\n\n\nWorkflow w TDD\nPraca w Test Driven Development ma swoją kolejność. Poznasz cykl Red - Green - Refactor, właściwe nazewnictwo oraz metodę 0, 1, N, Exception. Dzięki temu będziesz wiedzieć dokładnie od czego zacząć. Nauczysz się używać PHPUnit, czyli podstawowego narzędzia do tworzenia testów w PHP, oraz dowiesz się co testować, a czego nie.\n\n\nMetody testowania\nPHP dostarcza wiele funkcjonalności, które stanowią wyzwanie podczas testowania. Pokażę Ci jak testować podstawowe interfejsy i elementy języka PHP. Dowiesz się jak poradzić sobie z testowaniem funkcji losowych, takich jak shuffle, rand czy daty oraz czas, by Twoje były od nich niezależne. Zobaczysz jak poprawnie wstrzykiwać zależności oraz tworzyć zależności między testami, by pisać kod szybciej i lepiej.\n\n\nMechanizmy w PHPUnit\nW tej części nauczę Cię jak korzystać w pełni z możliwości najlepszej biblioteki do testowania w PHP. Dowiesz się czym jest Stub, Mock oraz Spy i jak ich używać poprawnie. Dowiesz się jak testować wiele przypadków jednocześnie dzięki Data Providerom oraz jak oddzielać testy jednostkowe od integracyjnych przy użyciu Test Suites. Na koniec zobaczysz jak generować raporty pokrycia kodu, czyli Code Coverage. Zrozumiesz dlaczego 100% pokrycia jest proste do uzyskania i nie jest to dobra miara jakości kodu.\n\n\nImplementacja gry w MAKAO\nCały kurs jest nastawiony na praktyczne zastosowanie TDD. Część testów będziemy tworzyć wspólnie, ale czekają na Ciebie również zadania domowe. Nie da się nauczyć TDD tylko o tym słuchając, dlatego napiszemy wspólnie ponad 100 testów jednostkowych i integracyjnych, gwarantujących poprawne działanie gry w Makao. Będę dzielić się z Tobą swoim 11-letnim doświadczeniem w programowaniu w PHP oraz pokażę Ci swoje najlepsze triki i strategie na rozwiązywanie skomplikowanych przypadków.\n\n\nCodzienne wyzwania w TD\nPonieważ nie żyjemy w próżni, kolejny dział będzie poświęcony pracy z Legacy Codem. Zobaczysz co powoduje, że nikt nie lubi starego kodu i o ile więcej pracy musisz w niego włożyć, by czuć się bezpiecznie. Zobaczysz, że testowanie takiego kodu jest możliwe, kiedy zastosujesz się do kilku prostych metod. Zobaczysz, że 100% pokrycia kodu nie gwarantuje Ci bezpieczeństwa. Wypunktuję Ci najczęstsze błędy początkujących.\n\n\nWięcej niż testowanie\nNa koniec poznasz ciekawe alternatywy i możliwości skutecznego testowania zależności w PHP. Nauczę Cię również naprawiać bugi z użyciem TDD, dzięki czemu nigdy więcej nie będziesz musiał naprawiać dwa razy tego samego. Zobaczysz, że testy stanowią idealną formę dokumentacji oraz znacznie przyspieszają wdrażanie nowych osób do projektu. Uruchomimy stworzoną grę oraz podsunę Ci kilka pomysłów jak możesz ją samodzielnie rozwinąć, by sprawdzić zdobytą wiedzę w praktyce.\n\n\nDla kogo jest ten kurs?\nTen kurs powstał dla programistów dobrze znających język PHP, którzy wiedzą jak pisać kod aplikacji, ale nie potrafią pisać testów lub chcą robić to lepiej. Jeżeli widzisz PHP po raz pierwszy, to najpierw nabierz trochę wprawy i wróć do tego materiału za kilka miesięcy. Nie potrzebujesz natomiast żadnej znajomości PHPUnit, czy innych zewnętrznych narzędzi lub bibliotek. To kurs dla Ciebie, jeżeli chcesz tworzyć bezpieczne aplikacje o wysokiej jakości, którym możesz zaufać. Oprócz tego, jeśli chcesz przestać się stresować, że po wdrożeniu znowu coś przestanie działać, lub masz dość powtarzających się błędów na supporcie - to ten kurs jest dla Ciebie.\n\n\nDlaczego wybrać właśnie ten kurs?\nKurs wideo to najbardziej efektywna a zarazem najprzyjemniejsza forma nauki. Jest on tak prowadzony, byś cały czas mógł go śledzić z zainteresowaniem i zaangażowaniem, a także czerpać satysfakcję ze zdobytej wiedzy!\nWiedza, którą otrzymujesz w tym kursie, to nie tylko sucha teoria, ale również wskazówki od praktyka z wieloletnim doświadczeniem, dzięki którym dużo łatwiej będzie Ci opanować materiał i tworzyć solidne aplikacje.\nUczysz się na praktycznych przykładach. Kurs, który masz przed sobą to esencja praktycznej wiedzy i doświadczenia a także wzorów, które oszczędzą Ci godziny pracy i poszukiwań.",

Yang kami sarankan adalah domain dot id yang menunjukkan jelas entitasmu sebagai warga negara Indonesia. Kalau bisa, tentunya sekalian ambil domain dot com. Namun biasanya jika nama domain tersebut umum, yang dot com sudah tidak available lagi.\nNah, domain ini wajib kamu rawat konten-nya. Secara umum, merawat konten berarti menginstall CMS semisal Wordpress, yang membutuhkan lagi layanan hosting file: dan ini bisa berbiaya sampai dengan 500rb-700rb/tahun. Padahal kamu sesungguhnya sekedar membutuhkan mengisi konten: tidak lebih, tidak kurang. Kamu tidak membutuhkan menginstall plugin rumit-rumit.\nUpgrade skill, menulis progress belajarmu. That's it!\n\"Terus, gimana dong caranya supaya rada hemat?\"\nJawabannya gunakan resep ini:\n- Github Pages\n- Netlify SSL\n- Jekyl / Hugo\nKetika tiga komponen di atas selesai kamu konfigurasi, kamu hanya perlu melakukan proses editing konten di komputer/laptop-mu, push ke github.. that's it! Seketika konten-mu akan dipublish ke alamat dot com / dot id. No more charge!\nSeru kan? Nah kombinasi ketiga komponen di atas adalah apa yang dikenal dengan nama Static Site Generator. Memang ada sedikit kerja ekstra untuk mengkonfigurasi sistem ini. Namun, cukup di awal saja. Setelah itu kamu akan dapat mengisi konten dengan semudah mengetik konten tersebut di komputer/laptop-mu.\nCool kan?\nNah, .. cus!\nCheckout course ini!",

      "description": "Developing a well-structured and adaptable .NET Core application necessitates a strong base. Building an application architecture entails thoughtful planning and consideration, as initial choices will influence its future extensibility and maintainability.\nHowever, over time, applications require maintenance and, in this scenario, expansion. Unfortunately, due to the current design and code implementation, both of these tasks are impractical. Consequently, the application must undergo a redesign process to ensure its longevity and ability to accommodate future requirements.\nEverything in this course is .NET 7 compatible.\nWhen you finish this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge to create a testable and maintainable ASP.NET Core application.\n\n\nBuild A Strong Foundation in .NET Clean Architecture:\n\n\nLearn Clean or Onion Architecture and Best Practices\nLearn Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)\nImplement Mediatr Pattern\nAdd Email Service using SendGrid\nEfficient Exception Handling\nImplementing Unit Testing\nMoq and Shouldy\nAdding Validation Using Fluent Validation\nPrerequisites for enrolling in this course include a basic understanding of .NET Core development and C#.\nThis course offers a substantial amount of content, spanning over 4 hours of high-quality material. The content is organized in a way that focuses on relevant activities corresponding to each module of the application being built. Throughout the course, we will address troubleshooting and debugging errors, implementing best practices, writing efficient logic, and gaining insight into the reasoning behind certain development practices. Your knowledge will gradually expand as you progress through the course, and you will be challenged to reach your full potential.\n\n\nCoding reality dictates that we don't always get things right on the first attempt. Mistakes happen, and we address and rectify them. By doing so, you will gain proficiency in using debugging tools and techniques. By the end of the course, you will have become so accustomed to navigating Visual Studio, identifying logic and syntax errors, that it will come naturally when working in the .NET environment. This will enable you to apply your newly acquired skills effectively and impress your superiors and colleagues.\n\n\nThe course includes working files hosted on GitHub, which provide convenient access to the demonstrated code for easy replication. You will have the opportunity to follow along with the instructor during each lecture, and upon completing the course, you will receive a verifiable certificate of completion.\n\n\nBy clicking the \"Take This Course\" button, you are taking a significant step toward increasing your income and enhancing your marketability. Additionally, remember that if you feel the course does not meet your expectations, you have a full 30 days to request a refund without any questions asked.\n\n\nIt's time to take action!\nWe look forward to seeing you in the course",

      "description": "Le Serverless c'est quoi ? L'informatique Serverless est une nouvelle technologie passionnante qui permet aux développeurs de ne plus avoir à gérer des serveurs en permanence. Au lieu de cela, ils fournissent simplement leur code est définissent quand il doit être exécuté. Cela permet de réduire les coûts liés à l'hébergement et à la gestion des serveurs.\n\n\nRésolvant énormément de problème de l'hébergement \"traditionnel\" :\nPrenons l'exemple de l'entreprise XYZ qui a utilisé l'informatique Serverless pour son application de média social. Grâce à cette technologie, ils ont pu réduire leurs coûts d'hébergement de 40 euros par mois à moins de 5 euros. De plus, ils ont pu éviter les soucis liés à la sécurité des serveurs et à la gestion de la production.\n\n\nVous l'aurez compris cette technologie va vous permettre de :\n\n\nNe plus avoir à gérer des serveurs en permanence.\nRéduire les coûts liés à l'hébergement et à la gestion des serveurs, car vous n'avez plus besoin de payer des frais fixes ou de payer des personnes pour suivre la santé des serveurs.\nNe plus vous soucier de la sécurité des serveurs, car l'architecture est conçue pour répondre à tous les appels, même à des millions par seconde.\nIl n'est donc pas surprenant que l'informatique Serverless soit en plein essor et que de plus en plus d'entreprises l'adoptent. En apprenant cette technologie maintenant, vous pourrez gagner un avantage sur vos concurrents et l'utiliser pour vos propres projets ou pour postuler à des emplois bien rémunérés.\n\n\nQu'est-ce que ce cours offre alors ?\n\n\nCe cours vous présentera l'informatique Serverless par l'exemple en utilisant des projets d'api simples à comprendre.\nNous commencerons par découvrir le cloud Amazon Web Services (AWS) et ses principaux services Serverless et comment éviter les pièges, en plaçant rapidement des alertes afin de n'avoir rien n'a payer sur la plateforme pour toute la formation, mais aussi pour des applications que vous pourriez faire, et ce même si vous avez un million de visite mensuel !\nNous finirons par déployer une architecture comprenant plusieurs micro services et une base de données en utilisant l'Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\nNous créerons une API Rest sans se soucier de la complexité des serveurs et en n'écrivant presque exclusivement du code métier, et ignorant donc une grande partie de code redondant qu'on ferait dans du code monolithique.\nNous définirons vos apis avec le service Api Gateway, qui camoufle une grande complexité, permettant de gérer de l'authentification, du cache, des api keys, une gestion de quota, du versioning, ...\nNous configurerons votre code \"on demand\" via AWS Lambda, en n'exécutant le moins de code possible pour une requête, réduisant le code déployé à une simple fonction de quelques lignes !\nNous verrons ensemble comment vous pouvez stocker des données dans une base de données, bien sûr sans gérer de serveurs de base de données !\n\n\nDynamoDB, une base de données NoSql, est annoncé comme étant \"Single Digit Latency\", signifiant qu'elle répond en moins de 10 milli seconde, les avantages du clouds !\n\n\nCe cours est donc destiné aux développeurs qui souhaitent apprendre à utiliser l'informatique Serverless pour leurs projets ou pour postuler à des emplois bien rémunérés. Il est nécessaire de connaître les bases de la programmation et d'avoir une compréhension de base des concepts liés à l'informatique dans le cloud.\n\n\nCe cours est-il pour vous ?\n\n\nMaintenant que vous savez ce que ce cours offre, est-ce le bon choix pour vous ? Quelles compétences devez-vous apporter ?\n\n\nCe cours sur l'informatique Serverless est idéal pour vous si vous souhaitez développer des applications web performantes sans vous soucier de la gestion des serveurs. Il est également intéressant pour ceux qui souhaitent comprendre les services cloud et comment optimiser les coûts.\nPour suivre ce cours, vous n'avez pas besoin d'avoir une connaissance préalable d'AWS. Nous couvrirons ensemble les différents services et leur fonctionnement, ainsi que les moyens de les utiliser dans vos propres projets. Il est important de noter que pour suivre ce cours, vous aurez besoin d'une carte de crédit pour vous inscrire à AWS, mais nous verrons comment éviter de dépenser de l'argent inutilement.\n\n\nUne connaissance préalable des API Rest est un plus, mais nous aborderons les différentes notions nécessaires au fur et à mesure du cours.\n\n\nJe serais très heureux de vous accueillir à bord !\n\nMerci à Morgane Le Pennec (son profil est sur Malt) alias Sirena d'avoir prêté sa voix pour ce cours !",

Er ist der perfekte Einstieg ins Webdesign und führt dich Schritt für Schritt zum HTML-Profi.\n\n\nHTML ist die Grundlage von 95% aller Webseiten im Internet und daher eine Sprache, die jede*r Webdesigner*in und Webentwickler*in beherrschen sollte. HTML5 ist zwar sehr umfangreich, aber im Alltag als Webdesigner*in und Webentwickler*in wird nur ein kleiner Teil davon verwendet. Neben HTML5 gibt es nämlich auch noch Sprachen wie CSS und JavaScript, die man zum Erstellen von Webseiten benötigt. Als Anfänger*in ist es daher von Vorteil zu wissen, welchen Teil von HTML man beherrschen muss, um dann gleich mit den Grundlagen von CSS weitermachen zu können. In diesem Kurs werde ich dir ALLES beibringen, was du über HTML wissen musst. Ich greife dabei auf 7 Jahre Erfahrung als Webdesigner zurück und kann daher mit gutem Gewissen sagen, dass der Kurs so umfangreich ist, dass du am Ende deine eigenen Webseiten erstellen und mit dem Lernen von CSS beginnen kannst. Gleichzeitig wird dir nichts beigebracht, was du nicht auch im Alltag als Webdesigner*in brauchst. So kannst du in kürzester Zeit deine HTML5-Kenntnisse ausbauen und verlierst keine Zeit. Entscheide dich jetzt für den Kurs und mache den ersten Schritt in Richtung Webdesign-Profi.\n\n\nIn den ersten beiden Abschnitten des Kurses geht es darum, HTML zu verstehen.\nIn den darauf folgenden Kapiteln lernst du dann die einzelnen Elemente von HTML5 kennen. Du kannst diese Kapitel zum Nachschlagen verwenden, da die Titel der Videos klar angeben, worum es geht.\n\n\nZu mir:\nHej :)\nMein Name ist Laurenz und ich werde dir in diesem Kurs alles beibringen, was du über HTML 5 wissen musst.\nBereits im Alter von 14 Jahren habe ich meine ersten Webseiten mit HTML und CSS erstellt und bald darauf begonnen, Webseiten für Freunde und Familie zu gestalten.\nMittlerweile kann ich auf über 7 Jahre professionelle Auftragsarbeit zurückblicken, in denen ich verschiedensten Kunden wie Musiker*innen, Verlagen, Künstler*innen oder Streetfood-Unternehmen zu einer eigenen Internetpräsenz verholfen habe.\nDie dabei gesammelten Erfahrungen habe ich nun genutzt um diesen umfangreichen HTML5 Kurs zu erstellen, in dem du alles erfährst was du brauchst um Webseiten nach dem neuesten Standard zu erstellen.\n\n\nIch würde mich sehr freuen, wenn du dir den Kurs zulegst und bin mir sicher, dass du davon profitieren wirst.\n\n\nAnsonsten würde ich sagen, wir sehen uns im Kurs. :)\n\n\nBeste Grüße\nLaurenz\n\n\nPS: Unser Kurs hat eine 30 Tage Geld-zurück-Garantie. Solltest du also mit dem Kurs nicht zufrieden sein, weil du nichts Neues gelernt hast, bekommst du natürlich dein Geld zurück! :)",

      "description": "Questo corso introdurrà gli studenti al framework JavaScript React, partendo dalle basi per poi arrivare ad affrontare argomenti più avanzati. Gli studenti impareranno a creare applicazioni web in React, utilizzando componenti, state, props e gestione degli eventi. Alla fine del corso, gli studenti saranno in grado di creare applicazioni web funzionali e responsive utilizzando React.\nCosa è React?\nReact è una libreria JavaScript open-source utilizzata per la creazione di interfacce utente.\nSviluppata da Facebook, React è diventata una delle tecnologie più utilizzate per la creazione di applicazioni web e mobile.\n\nPerché React?\nTra i principali vantaggi di React si possono includere:\n\n\n- Facile Gestione dei dati\n- Flessibilità\n- Prestazioni\n- Popolarità\n- Organizzazione e architettura Modulare\nAlla fine di questo corso saprai cosa è React e come utilizzarlo per creare piccole applicazioni, pagine web o blog. Partiremo da zero e scopriremo tutti i concetti principali di React. Dall'anatomia di un componente, il suo ciclo di vita passando per lo State e il passaggio di dati tramite props. Metteremo in pratica ognuno di questi concetti lavorando su piccoli progetti in ogni sezione. Alla fine creeremo una applicazione Todo e vedremo come pubblicarla online.\nSe vuoi imparare react velocemente e in maniera semplice questo corso fa per te. Magari stai studiando programmazione o sviluppo web per la primissima volta. Magari il tuo è un cambio carriera. Magari sei già uno sviluppatore front end ma non hai ancora dato un occhiata a React, oppure sei un programmatore BE o full stack interessato a conoscere meglio Javascript e i framework client side. Ecco io ho creato questo corso per te. Cercando di spiegare in maniera semplice ma approfondita quello che io stesso avrei voluto sapere mentre imparavo React.",

Designer erfahren, wie sie den Output im Dev Mode optimieren können, indem sie die Design-Dateien entsprechend vorbereiten und organisieren.\nFigma ist das zentrale Design-Tool für digitale Produkte wie Websites, Web-Anwendungen, Apps und Shops jeglicher Größenordnung. Das Tool richtet sich zwar in erster Linie an Design-Teams, doch mit mächtigen Funktionen für Kollaboration und dem sog. Dev Mode schlägt es die Brücke zwischen Design, Development und Projektmanagement. Und Figma hat die Entwickler-Zielgruppe klar erkannt und baut den Dev Mode daher immer weiter aus.\nSchade nur, dass viele Dev-Teams die Entwickler-Funktionen von Figma nur sehr oberflächlich kennen. Und das obwohl sie selbst oder ihre Unternehmen für die Lizenzen viel Geld bezahlen. Das möchte ich mit diesem Training ändern. Ich zeige Stück für Stück wie der Dev Mode genutzt werden sollte, welche Features es gibt und wie die Code-Qualität positiv beeinflusst werden kann.\nAuch für Designer ist das Training relevant, denn auch sie sollten wissen, welche Informationen im Dev Mode angezeigt werden. Neben einer systematisch aufgebauten Design-Datei, spielt das Wissen über die Funktionsweise von digitalen Produkten eine große Rolle. Neben den reinen Figma-Features erkläre ich daher auch einige grundsätzliche Dinge, die hilfreich sind um Webprojekte so zu gestalten, dass sie auch gut technisch umgesetzt werden können.\nFür Projektleiter*innen, POs oder Team-Leads kann das Trainings hilfreich sein, um den Dev Mode besser beurteilen zu können. Anschließend kann informierter entschieden werden, ob bzw. in welcher Form der Workflow im Unternehmen verändert wird.",

Благодаря Doctrine, разработчики могут автоматизировать множество задач, связанных с базой данных, что позволяет сосредоточиться на основной логике приложения.\nОсновные возможности и преимущества Doctrine включают:\nАвтоматическое создание сущностей и полей: Doctrine предоставляет удобный способ определения сущностей (entity) и их полей, которые соответствуют таблицам и столбцам в базе данных. Это позволяет избежать необходимости вручную создавать и поддерживать SQL-скрипты для создания таблиц.\nТипы данных и их обработка: Doctrine автоматически выбирает подходящие типы данных для полей и управляет их преобразованием при чтении и записи. Это гарантирует корректное хранение и извлечение данных, минимизируя вероятность ошибок.\nСоздание и управление отношениями между таблицами: С Doctrine легко создавать связи между различными таблицами, такие как «один к одному», «один ко многим» и «многие ко многим». Это позволяет структурировать данные более эффективно и логично.\nПоддержка написания собственных SQL-запросов: Несмотря на то, что Doctrine предлагает высокоуровневые абстракции для работы с данными, разработчики могут писать и выполнять свои собственные SQL-запросы, когда это необходимо. Это дает гибкость и контроль над процессом выполнения запросов.\nУвеличение производительности: Doctrine оптимизирует выполнение запросов и управление данными, что может значительно повысить производительность приложения. Кэширование запросов, ленивые загрузки (lazy loading) и другие техники оптимизации позволяют эффективно использовать ресурсы базы данных.\nСокращение объема кода: Использование Doctrine позволяет сократить количество шаблонного и дублирующегося кода, необходимого для работы с базой данных. Это упрощает поддержку и развитие проекта, делая код более чистым и легко читаемым.\nТаким образом, Doctrine является незаменимым инструментом для разработчиков, стремящихся к удобному и эффективному управлению данными в своих проектах. Его использование позволяет значительно упростить работу с базами данных, повышая продуктивность и снижая вероятность ошибок.",

      "description": "Wprowadzenie\nWitaj w Kursie, w którym na przestrzeni niemal 13 godzin lekcji wideo, ewangelista Microsoft Bartłomiej Zass pokaże Ci, jak przygotować kompletną witrynę w oparciu o ASP NET MVC. Zacznij od pustego projektu w Visual Studio i przygotuj swój własny sklep internetowy z wykorzystaniem najciekawszych nowinek w ASP NET MVC\nPełny proces programowania aplikacji w ASP NET MVC\nMnóstwo praktycznej wiedzy, gotowej do zastosowania w projektach\nPraca z bazą danych, AJAX i Javascript\nTworzenie zaawansowanych, dynamicznych widoków\nZabezpieczenie aplikacji – także przez Facebook i Google\nWalidowane danych i wysyłanie e-maili\nTworzenie zadań wywoływanych w tle i logowanie błędów\nPodstawy testów jednostkowych i Dependency Injection\nWdrażanie aplikacji oraz korzystanie z GIT\n\n\nCo znajdziesz w kursie?\nPodczas tworzenia kursu przyjęliśmy założenie, że znasz już przynajmniej podstawy języka C#, HTML, CSS a także masz pewną wiedzę teoretyczną z zakresu ASP NET MVC. Kurs możesz potraktować, jako naturalną kontynuację kursu Podstaw ASP NET MVC, dostępnego na eduweb (chociaż jego obejrzenie nie jest konieczne). Nie będziemy omawiali wszystkich mechanizmów ASP NET MVC a jedynie te, które będą nam potrzebne do zrealizowania prostego sklepu internetowego. Nie będziemy skupiali się na podstawach, ale na praktycznym zastosowaniu najważniejszych elementów ASP NET MVC.\nZaczniemy od zera, a w zasadzie od projektu graficznego, jaki otrzymaliśmy od grafika. Pokażę Ci wszystkie etapy pracy nad taką aplikacją – od tworzenia prototypu, przez implementację kolejnych mechanizmów (przeglądanie produktów, koszyk, panel administracyjny), zabezpieczanie, dodawanie wewnętrznych mechanizmów sklepowych aż po samo wdrożenie naszego sklepu na bezpłatne konto Microsoft Azure. Będziemy pisali wszystko od zera, dlatego kurs jest dla osób, które nie boją się dużych ilości kodu i poznawania w ten sposób praktycznych aspektów platformy. Starałem się przemycić w kursie jak najwięcej praktycznych wskazówek, które mogą okazać się przydatne podczas Twojej pracy.\nDo kursu dołączony został pełen kod źródłowy. Możesz go na spokojnie przeanalizować, aby zrozumieć poruszane zagadnienia a także wykorzystać podczas pracy nad Twoją własną aplikacją.\nZobacz jak prezentuje się strona >>\n\n\nPrzygotowanie statycznych i dynamicznych widoków\nNa pewno wiesz już w jaki sposób napisać prostą, statyczną stronę w języku HTML. Zaczniemy właśnie od takiego prototypu najważniejszych widoków, zrobionego na podstawie projektu graficznego. Następnie przystąpimy do dodawania logiki działającej po stronie serwera. Przygotujemy stronę główną z podglądem nowości i bestselerów. Pokażę Ci jak zrobić widok dla urządzeń mobilnych z możliwością przełączenia się na stronę klasyczną. Oprogramujemy koszyk zakupów oraz proces składania zamówienia. Dodamy także prosty panel administracyjny oraz sekcję profilu użytkownika, gdzie będzie można zobaczyć historię swoich zamówień.\n\n\nPraca z danymi\nWszystkie dane naszej aplikacji (dane klientów, informacje o produktach, historia zamówień, itp.) będą przechowywane w bazie danych. Pokażę Ci najpopularniejszy obecnie sposób pracy z bazą danych – tzw. podejście Code First. Zaprojektujemy model danych w oparciu o klasy języka C# a następnie wygenerujemy strukturę naszej bazy. Zobaczysz jak zapisywać, odczytywać, filtrować dane z bazy. Przyjrzymy się również technice migracji, która pozwoli nam aktualizować schemat bazy po wprowadzeniu zmian w modelu, bez utraty danych.\n\n\nTechniki AJAX\nChyba każda współczesna aplikacja internetowa korzysta już z technik AJAXowych. Także nasz sklep w wielu miejscach będzie komunikował się asynchronicznie z serwerem, aby aktualizować dane bez przeładowania strony. Usuwanie produktów z koszyka, filtrowanie albumów, automatyczne podpowiedzi wyszukiwarki to tylko niektóre z przykładów zastosowania AJAX w naszej aplikacji. Zobaczysz jak połączyć świat Javascriptu z kodem działającym po stronie serwera. Pokażę Ci jak stosować te techniki, aby były dobre dla SEO – pozycjonowania naszego serwisu.\n\n\nZabezpieczenie aplikacji\nUżytkownicy Twojego sklepu chcieliby na pewno mieć możliwość przeglądania historii swoich zamówień. Powinni więc mieć możliwość zalogowania się. Pokażę Ci jak dodać sekcję tylko dla zalogowanych użytkowników. Dodamy obsługę ról – w szczególności administratora, który będzie widział wszystkie zamówienia a także miał możliwość modyfikowania stanu poszczególnych zamówień. Ponadto, umożliwimy użytkownikom logowanie się przy pomocy konta Facebook i Google – chcemy w końcu jak najbardziej uprościć proces logowania.\n\n\nMailing i Praca w Tle\nUżytkownicy na pewno chcieliby otrzymać potwierdzenie złożenia zamówienia e-mailem. Ucieszą się również, kiedy poinformujesz ich o wysyłce paczki z zamówionymi płytami. Zobaczysz różne techniki wysyłania e-maili z poziomu aplikacji ASP NET MVC – tak, aby zawierały zarówno część tekstową jak i HTMLową, zdjęcia dołączane jako link lub wbudowane. A wszystko bazując na wygodnych do edycji szablonach. Zobaczysz także jak wysyłać e-maile w tle – tak, aby użytkownik nie zauważył jakichkolwiek opóźnień. Będziesz mógł później dodać inne zadania działające w tle – na przykład synchronizujące sklep z zewnętrznymi portalami.\n\n\nAdministracja i optymalizacja\nSklep musi działać szybko – dlatego pokażę Ci w jaki sposób zoptymalizować jego działanie stosując Cache. Dodamy także mechanizmy logowania błędów oraz komunikatów, pozwalające monitorować działanie naszego serwisu i reagować na błędy w jego działaniu. Napiszemy także stronę, na której będzie możliwe dodawanie i edycja produktów, z przekazywaniem zdjęć do serwera.\n\n\nDependency Injection i Testy Jednostkowe\nSkupimy się także na nieco bardziej zaawansowanych aspektach, cenionych przez doświadczonych programistów ASP NET. Zobaczymy w jaki sposób zaprojektować architekturę kodu naszej aplikacji, aby była łatwa do późniejszego utrzymania, rozwoju oraz przeprowadzania testów. Skorzystamy z kontenera Dependency Injection, który pozwoli nam zarządzać zależnościami projektu i ułatwi modyfikację działania mechanizmów sklepu. Poznasz także sposoby pisania tzw. Unit Testów dla kontrolerów ASP NET MVC – czyli testów, testujących Twój kod.\n\n\nWdrażanie aplikacji\nNa koniec pokażę Ci jak wdrożyć nasz sklep na serwer, aby pozwolić innym użytkownikom na robienie zakupów. Omówimy dostępne rozwiązania i skupimy się na bezpłatnym koncie hostingowym Azure Websites.
