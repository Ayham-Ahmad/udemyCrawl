      "description": "There’s no doubt that meditation is one of the most important practices you can do for your personal development and daily sense of connection. From reducing stress to enhancing creativity, from delaying aging to cultivating joy, scientific studies are showing how meditation positively benefits what seems like every facet of life.\n\nMeditation is not just a way to reduce stress. It's also a powerful tool of self discovery. It creates the space needed for you to listen to your intuitive voices and align your life with your truth. It awakens your childlike capacity to wonder and find the magic in the everyday.\nHowever, the traditional way it’s taught can make it feel boring and heavy like a chore, and who has time for that? This approach sadly causes many people to miss out on the beautiful benefits of meditation.\nThis class shows how meditation can be enjoyable, simple, and easily enfolded into your day, yet still bring all the benefits and cultivate personal growth. It covers everything that a beginner needs to meditate deeply, from foundational meditation postures to powerful meditation amplifiers that open the inner doors to peace, joy, and clarity.\nThis class brings together the best meditation practices from Dandan’s decade-long practice of meditation, which has taken her to live in contemplative monasteries for several years. Designed to meet you where you are, all lessons are straight-to-the-point and applicable. A guided meditation library with 12 of Dandan’s most loved guided meditations is also included to further support your meditation journey.\nKEY LESSONS COVER:\nThe 9 major myths of meditation that prevent people from enjoying meditation.\nThe 4 foundational elements of meditation.\nMeditation postures to support relaxation and stability, including postures for those who have back problems or other physical limitations.\nHow to approach breathing to deepen your meditation experience.\nHow to approach unpleasant feelings or thoughts that arise during your meditation.\nHow to transform any act into a mindful, recentering experience, including when you’re washing the dishes.\nMeditation anchoring techniques to settle down your mind when it’s all over the place.\nScience-backed benefits of meditation.\nHow to maintain a daily meditation routine that’ll bring beauty into your life and help you grow as a human being.\nINCLUDED GUIDED MEDITATIONS:\nMelt Away Your Stress 10 Minute Meditation\nDiving Deep 25 Minute Meditation\nHealing Body Gratitude Meditation\nRestoring Nature Meditation\nGrounding Tree Standing Meditation\nNourishing Meal Meditation\nJoyful Sunrise Meditation\nTherapeutic Dishwashing meditation\nFreeing Expansion Meditation\nClarifying Uncertainty Meditation\nSoothing Heartbreak Meditation\nUnconditional Listening Meditation\nWHO THIS CLASS IS FOR:\nAnyone who feels like they are sleep-running through life.\nAnyone who wants to learn meditation and cultivate this powerful recentering practice in their daily life.\nAnyone who wants to bring peace, joy, and clarity into their day with only a few minutes.\nAnyone who feels lost, sluggish, or stuck.\nAnyone who wants to learn how to enfold meditation in to their daily, messy life.\nNo prerequisites are necessary.\n\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING:\n\n\"I've taken many, many meditation classes, and this is the first one that's so up front and simple. Most spent too much time going on about the amazing benefits of meditation without really delving into how to do it in a simple and understandable way that doesn't make me lose focus. I don't find myself wanting to argue or disagree with the stuff she says during the guided lessons. That might seem like a low bar to clear, but man, this is the first class to clear it.\"\n\n~Michael Marion\n\n\"This class far exceeded my expectations, I finally got in touch of what meditation really is. Thank you.\"\n\n~Tereza Kubánková\n\n\"This class was so soothing, exactly what I needed these days. The teacher made meditation feel relatable, and I was surprised by how simple it was. I will be playing the guided meditations on repeat, especially after work..they are deeply relaxing. Thank you!\"\n\n~Mat Searly\n\n\"An exceptionally well-done class which brings the what seems to be a difficult and complicated subject to people and explains it in very simple and accessible terms, simplifying and busting myths around meditation!\"\n\n~Nikola\n\n\"This gentle class offers a path to inner peace, a respite from stress during these troubled times and beyond.\"\n\n~Jeanne G",

The majority of these are fake. We call them Certificate Mills. The only thing the “Mill” wishes to see from the instructor is money (ranging from 40 - 1500 dollars per course depending on the Mill) to pay for the process. They do not even wish to see 1 minute of any course nor any qualification an instructor may hold. You; the student is then sent to these places to pay them (more) money as the student. They commonly offer public liability insurance that you can get WITHOUT them and the fake fancy-looking Diploma.\nCertificates:\nI offer you certificates in love and trust: They are a gift, not a right.\nPlease understand that NO personalisation requests will be considered.\nThe course name and images for my courses change semi-regularly - it is a way we instructors keep our courses looking fresh on Udemy.\nCourse certificates I issue will not necessarily have the exact wording or imagery currently on Udemy.\nThe only place to ask is through Udemy messages - I will not reply to external requests.\nIf you use a pseudonym on Udemy, you must request me first up to use your real name - otherwise, it stands as issued.\nPlease Note: All students who enroll in this course also will receive periodic free and discounted access to my other top-rated current and upcoming courses.\nThe material on this site is provided for educational purposes only,  and is not to be used for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment  #VisionQuest #Self-discovery #ShamanicJourneying #Shamanism #Meditation #Manifestation #Spirituality #Spiritual",

      "description": "Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.\nAside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness & joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it. It gives you the ability to focus on whatever you want to focus on, which can make you extremely productive and successful in life.\nTim Ferris studied hundreds of the world's most successful people: billionaires, celebrities, athletes, bodybuilders, and scientists at the tops of their fields. There was only one trait that over 80% of them had in common: a daily meditation practice. That's crazy when you think about it. It's not that they were all super intelligent, hard working, good looking, or born into wealthy families. The single most common trait among the world's most successful people is meditation. Isn't that weird?\nTo experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better. In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.\nIn this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation. This course is Meditation For Beginners. It will help you to get a good firm grounding in the basics of meditation, that you'll be able to take with you into daily life, to walk around in a meditative state, and to form the foundations for your own daily practice. All within about an hour and a half of course materials. Very easy, very simple, geared toward you, specifically, the beginner meditator. This will help you be happier in life, feel better, be healthier, and deal with pretty much anything that life will throw your way. The best hour and a half you'll ever spend in the rest of your life is this hour and a half, watching this course, learning to meditate for the first time.\nI'll see you inside!\nNamaste.",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\n\"Take this course, it will improve your life\" - Bob\n\"Melissa Crowhurst is my absolute favorite Udemy and general spiritual teacher, spiritual guide, and overall kindred spirit (I can feel it, tho we've never met in person!). She breaks things down, gives you great tips and tricks, and a ton of resources to master whatever you're trying to learn. She also helps you feel confident about doing or teaching what you've learned. I highly recommend this Meditation course, as well as her Reiki course, and her Spiritual Business course. Thank you Melissa for bringing your love and light into this world, for having done the work AND put yourself out there so that so many of us, your soul tribe, can find you, connect with you, and learn from you. Many blessings and love to you. Namaste!\" - Joanna\n\"I have been meditating for over 40 years and I find Melissa's approach simple and comprehensive. Her guidance for leading groups is practical and thorough.\" - Alan\n\"Melissa is a fantastic teacher, guide and healer. Her classes flow and develop in a natural way that makes sense. She creates a bond in the class setting and prepares you with everything you need to be confident with the skills she teaches. Highly recommended!\" - N D\n\"Great teacher and course structure. Well taught with great resources. I feel confident in implementing this information for clients. Thank you\" - Anita\n\"I felt the content was easily understandable via both videos and PDF. I truly enjoyed the teacher Melissa Crowhurst as she made the videos engaging. I highly recommend this course for personal use as well as professional use.\" – Crystal\n\"Course content is excellent! 10/10 Thank you Melissa.\" - Minna\n\"It was mind-blowing\" - Ashley\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nIf you're constantly stressed, anxious, short tempered and even confused about life, then you'll be amazed at how the simple act of meditation can bring relief to all those areas - and more! My course has been designed to easily introduce newcomers to meditation - regardless of how much (or little!) time they have! This can also be a great further learning tool for those with some (or even a lot!) of experience in meditation. Essentially, I created this course in a manner so anybody can learn and benefit from it!\n\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nOnce enrolled, you'll be prompted to download the course book, written by Melissa: Learn to Meditate in Minutes, and Guide Others too! (PDF). The book covers all that you need to know to get started with meditation - be it for yourself only, or if you're learning in order to guide others!\nAs you progress through this course, you'll learn the basics of meditation and its benefits, and a bit about the different types of meditation. I'll then take you through my 3-steps to meditate as well explain my 5 step-by-step meditation methods.\nThen to help ensure you have plenty of inspiration, you'll get to listen to and practice with 5 Themed Guided meditations:\nThe Relaxer (8 minutes) - a MP3 download of this meditation is included with the course!\nFearful Thought Releaser (13 minutes) -a MP3 download of this meditation is included with the course!\nDepression Buster (10 minutes)\nManifestation Creator (9 minutes)\nSpiritual Evolver (9 minutes).\nWhat's more, I even provide you with a general meditation script so you can record your own, in your own voice or speak them out to help guide others!\nAnd because I want to be sure you have enough meditation material to work with, I will then provide you with links to my additional meditation audios for your own use, too! This will ensure you have a variety of options to choose from when you want more than just silence or music for your meditation.\nWe'll then dive into a few additional tips that can help enhance your meditation experience. I'll do a quick overview of Chakras, and to help those who aren't familiar with Chakras. From there, I'll cover a little bit about energy healing and the effectiveness of affirmations.\nFor those who are interested in learning how to guide others to meditate, I then move into how to best prepare for meditation sessions. I go into detail about the important role a meditation guide has, then provide you with a general meditation script and process to bring your clients 'back' from the meditation journey they've been on. I then top it all off by providing you a step-by-step process of how to hold a guided meditation session from beginning to end.\nOnce you've gone through all the lectures and completed the recap sections, you'll have all that you need to start meditating right away - and to even help others do it!\nIf you're already a healer in any modality (eg. massage therapist, Reiki practitioner, etc) you'll be able to quickly apply and integrate these techniques in your own practice!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Meditation Guide Final Exam.  Upon successful completion, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and a Digital Seal of Completion (JPG)!  Once certified, you'll have full rights to use the guided meditation audios, scripts and steps from this course with your existing modalities and practice.\nSome of the additional benefits of this course include fast stress relief, reduced anxiety, enhanced sleep, improved health, better clarity and understanding - and that's just the tip of the iceberg! As you meditate more and more, you'll become more relaxed and centred in your everyday life, become more spiritually aware and even be able to use what you learn to attract abundance into your life! So whether it's just for you own benefit, or to learn so you can guide others, if you use these techniques regularly - your life, and the life of others will improve fast!\nEnjoy this journey! #biglove",

I can see that this has played out in my life to my great misfortune. At this stage of my life, it is very important for me to take charge of these ancient emotional triggers, and create a much healthier and happier existence. I love your class, Joseph. Thanks again for all of your hard work! Laurel Gay Edwards\nYour delivery was warm and natural and your sincerity and love of meditation shines through. I can see how much work has gone into this course and I'm sure it will reach and help many, many, many people. It's so nice to 'meet' someone with very similar views on meditation and an approach to teaching that chimes with my own. I wish you every success! Linda Hall\nJoseph Drumheller's practical, earthy approach to meditation, along with his soothing voice and approachability provides a comfortable place to begin a new practice or gain deeper insights into those more established. Speaking as a lifelong meditator myself, I recommend his work. Judy Blackwell\nI will say that the main thing I look for in someone in such a course is that they exude calm, and joy....and you do......and that they look trustworthy, good energy when you look at their eyes.... when they speak....and you do...Marika Marks\nVery informative about getting started at-home meditation. I am excited to dive into Joseph’s course! Kari Moore\nVery professional and I loved the videos! If this is your first class online, I wouldn't have known it. You did a great job! Judy Lynne",

      "description": "These meditations are designed to not only help you relax but to eradicate stress at its deepest levels.\n\n\nPerfect for whenever you feel under pressure, each of these therapeutic sessions will clear your mind and replace stress with a sense of still and calm.\n\n\nThe long term effects of stress lead to anxiety and depression and can end up being hugely detrimental to our health.\n\n\nHowever, we can counter these effects with meditation, which has been proven to reduce the stress hormone cortisol as well as combat inflammation in the body.\n\n\nIn each of these meditations, you will be given a new tool to help ground yourself and find refuge from the ever-present stress of modern life.\n\n\nAll these techniques are extremely simple and only require you to take a few minutes out of your day to practice.\n\n\nOnce you have them mastered, you will be able to return to them any time you feel the need to release stress and find inner peace.\n\n\nHow You'll Benefit\n\n\nControl Over Stress\n\n\nScientific studies reveal that the physical mechanism behind stress is reliant on the hormone Cortisol, which is released during stress. Using these meditative techniques can stem the development of these symptoms, even while the neurological systems that govern these stress symptoms operate.\n\n\nImproved Sleep\n\n\nStress is the ultimate enemy of sleep. Sleeplessness is generally caused by an inability to stop worrying about either the past or future.\n\n\nIn this course, you'll learn to root yourself in the present and allow anxious thoughts move past you without disrupting your peace of mind.\n\n\nPromote Emotional Health\n\n\nOvercoming stress anxiety will significantly improve your positive outlook on life.\n\n\nWe often feel overwhelmed by our anxious thoughts but finding the ability to overcome them will bring about feelings of self-confidence, wellbeing, and empowerment.",

Our course, Yoga Nidra: The Art of Relaxation, will guide you through the authentic traditional Yoga Nidra and help you experience the full benefits of this powerful relaxation technique.\nThe course is divided into two sections.\nThe first covers the theory and practical applications of Yoga Nidra, while the second is all about the pure experience of the practice. You'll learn methods of relaxation and immerse yourself in the experience of Yoga Nidra to achieve a deep level of relaxation and calm. Don't let the stresses of daily life hold you back any longer.

      "description": "What's good to know before you do this course:\nFeldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons are typically taught by voice. This means that they are not demonstrated by the teacher. This is a very important principal embedded within the Method: that the student find's their own movement 'solutions' to the movement 'problems' that are posed during the lesson and to not be influenced by what they see other people do. In this way, the student experiences kinesthetic based learning. When discoveries are made, they are profound and long lasting because of this.\nIn spite of this important principal, I decided to demonstrate the first of the four lessons in this series. This is because I am not in the room to respond to what I am seeing. The demonstration is just a guide to the size, speed and quality of movement that is expected when doing Feldenkrais, and nothing more. These audio lessons invite you to trust your own innate body wisdom and learn to explore the unknown with curiosity, gentleness, self care and openness. It's not about being right or wrong, but about finding your own way and owning your discoveries. Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons are a mindfulness based movement practice, not an exercise class.\nThese lessons are recorded live from the studio. In the background you will hear the soft sounds of a busy University dance campus. As such, you will be getting an authentic learning experience. As you do these lessons, imagine that you are lying on the floor with 25 other students of all different skill levels, engaged in deep learning about their bodies; the way they move, the way that they think, sense and feel. All making very individual and profoundly personal discoveries, guided just by voice and their own nervous system and experience.\nAbout this course:\nMovement is a fundamental part of all human behavior and endeavor. When you improve the way that you move and you learn to move with greater awareness and skill, you also improve the way that you feel, sense and think.\nThis second collection of lessons is for people who have done my first introductory course: “Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons: Introduction”. It is also for people who already have some experience with the Fedenkrais Method or another somatic based movement practice.\nFeldenkrais is an extremely gentle movement based training that teaches you how to heighten your ability to sense and feel yourself while you are moving while improving your freedom and range of movement in all planes of action.\nThe Feldenkrais Method is more like a movement based guided meditation rather than an exercise class.\nAs with any pattern of action, thinking or feeling, when you start to recognize the habitual and learn something new, you create the opportunity for growth, awareness and new possibility in all aspects of your life.\nPracticing the Feldenkrais Method can have many therapeutic benefits, hone specialised physical skills and support creative expression.\nThese lessons have been adapted from a series that was originally designed for and taught to people training to be professional dancers, The lessons are recorded live in the dance studio. You do not have to have the physical skill of a trained dancer to benefit and learn from these lessons.\nPlease note that only the first full lesson is demonstrated. As per normal practice, the following lessons are just audio files. This gives participants the opportunity to find their own \"solutions\" to the movement \"problems\" to optimize learning potential.\n\n\nLecture 1: How to do Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons\nStudents will understand how to do Awareness Through Movement lessons safely and in a way that will optimize their learning.\n\n\nLecture 2: Coordinating The Flexors and The Extensors\nIn this first Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lesson you will discover how improved organisation of the muscles of the trunk provides greater trunk control and stability.\nRecorded live in the dance studio, this lesson is suitable for any level of movement expertise.\nIt is done lying on your back and takes 45 minutes.\nUsually Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons are not demonstrated, but rather the class is lead verbally by the teacher. In this first lesson I will demonstrate the movements as a reference, however the lesson should be undertaken as described by the audio, rather than be watched and copied. This encourages the student to take responsibility for their own learning, problem solve for themselves, and as such, achieve greater learning outcomes.\nSubsequent lessons will be provided as an audio lesson without any visual demonstration.\n\n\nLecture 3: Opening The Arm In Side Lying\nIn this second lesson you will learn how to connect the movements of your arms to your torso.\nRecorded live in the dance studio, this lesson is suitable for any level of movement expertise.\nIt is done lying on your side and takes 39 minutes.\nThis lesson is an audio lesson and should be undertaken as described on the audio track.\n\n\nLecture 4: Powerful Arching\nIn this third lesson you will discover powerful arching by exploring light and easy back extension movements.\nRecorded live in the dance studio, this lesson is suitable for any level of movement expertise.\nIt is done lying on your front and takes 55 minutes.\nThis lesson is an audio lesson and should be undertaken as described on the audio track.\n\n\nLecture 5: Baby Bear Rolls\nIn this fourth lesson you will learn how to reduce the effort in the hip joints by finding a clearer connection of the movements of the legs to the spine.\nRecorded live in the dance studio, this lesson is suitable for any level of movement expertise.\nIt starts lying on your back and takes 63 minutes.\nThis lesson is an audio lesson and should be undertaken as described on the audio track.",

As a Breast Cancer sufferer this course is slow and easy to do, without doing hard exercises. Isaac explains everything really well and he is easy to follow. This course has been wonderful for my recovery and continued exercise program.”\n- Sarah\n\n\n\"This course has been wonderful for my balance, my inner peace and letting go of stress. I highly recommend his course to anyone needing any sort of stress relief or just anyone needing a mild form of exercise to help them feel better.\"\n- Gaye\n\n\n\"Since taking the classes with Isaac I undertake a sequence of the movements as a way to release tension and calm my mind. In breaks at work I'll do a series of the exercises to get my body moving and stretched after sitting at my desk. The online videos mean I'm able to do this in my own time and they are a good reminder for the different actions.\"\n- Brian\n\n\n\"I had never tried Tai Chi before but always thought it looked relaxing . It looks almost effortless when you watch other people doing it. It doesn’t look like you are exercising. So I was really amazed when I did my first class how much I could feel , in my arms and legs ,in fact my whole body felt awake and energised . And not stiff and sore the next day. I’m so happy to have found something I can do and enjoy and feel the benefits of . Thank you\"\n- Kerry\n\n\n\"I thought the repetition was going to be too much, but realized quickly that it did make it much easier to learn, and remember, each move. I have taken Tai Chi classes in the past and found them hard to follow and/or remember, but this one was very good for someone with my lousy memory and physical problems.\"\n- Cynthia\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMeditation.\nWe seem to be hearing more and more about it every day.\nThere is no denying it’s benefits (and need for most of us)\nBut there is one big problem...\nThanks to our culture of busyness, facebook, twitter, instagram, emailing and netflix binging.

Smooth, even, continuous, diaphragmatic breathing is the most powerful way to self-regulate the nervous system and emotion. By the end of this course you will understand healthy breathing and why it is important to you.\nThe mind can be our best friend and our worst enemy. Compulsive and compelling thoughts hijack our attention, especially when we try to sleep. You don’t have to follow along helplessly. Train your mind and body to relax and focus. Minding the gap, the transition points between breathing in and breathing out, provides a stable focus for the mind.\nOur bodies know how to do this! Simple, guided practices walk you through the process and allow you to relax as you breathe. Stress and contraction lock in an unhealthy pattern of shorter breaths higher in the chest. Relaxing your stomach muscles allows the body to reestablish natural breathing. We count the length of our breath and the number of breaths until a consistent rhythmic breath becomes second nature once again.   Each segment of the course features a video and a practice so you can feel the benefits immediately. The practices are under 5 minutes, perfect for fitting them in to a busy life. Downloadable audios of these and longer guided practices allow you to take them with you on your phone or other mobile device.\nHabits develop over time. In two minutes you will notice an immediate change. In a month or two, you can transform your breathing habits to support your own optimal health. This works!",

      "description": "The Busy Persons Guide To Meditation\n\n\nYou can meditate for a few hours or a few minutes or even a few seconds when you understand how it all works and what it means to be in a meditative state.\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN\nIn this program you will learn, step by step-\n-what meditation is\n-what happens in your body and mind when you meditate\n-and how you can benefit from just a few seconds of meditation throughout the day.\n-How to connect with other people at a deeper level\n-You will learn how to develop or improve your psychic abilities\n-what it means to be in an alpha state of mind\n-how to enhance your creative mind to improve the quality of your life\nThis is done when you become aware that you actually enter a light meditative state many times a day. This realization can show you the secret to increasing mental abilities beyond anything you believed possible.\n\n\nMeditation does not mean that you block your thoughts and think of nothing. It is just the opposite. It teaches us to be in a more relaxed state of mind at all times and to be aware of our surroundings and our thoughts and emotions. In this way, you can see your limiting beliefs and leave behind the ones that are no longer beneficial to you.\n\n\nWhen we meditate, we produce more alpha brain waves. Artists, creative people, songwriters, and inventors just to mention some, all live in a creative world because they naturally produce more alpha brain waves in their normal day-to-day life. Well, imagine if you could learn to do the same thing anytime you wanted. And it only takes a few seconds out of your time. Isn’t it worth it to be able to make changes in your life by learning to change your thoughts about your life?\nIn this program, you will learn that it does not take years of practice in a monastery or a quiet room to learn to be more spiritual and attract prosperity into your life. All it takes is to learn to take a deep breath before you respond to any situation to make a difference. Or to relax when you are trying to solve a problem and allow the answer to come to you.\n\n\nYou will learn the power of your thoughts and how to use this to improve the quality of your life.\nOur goal is not to control our thoughts and emotions but instead to stop allowing ourselves to be controlled by them. This happens when you learn to pay attention to what happens inside you when you experience- for example a stressful situation.\nIn this course, you will learn how to develop your inner potential. and you can take this to any level you choose. Such as improving your psychic abilities,\nlearn how to use the law of attraction to work for you instead of against you.\nThe law of attraction states that what we focus on is attracted to us, change your thoughts about your life and watch your life change.\nI have been teaching meditation, self-hypnosis, and spiritual development since 1975 when I first started teaching the Silva Method. We taught everyone to have a psychic experience on the last day. Yes everyone can learn these techniques and apply them to improve the quality of their life.\nIn this program, I have taken the best of what I learned in the past 45 years and condensed it into a short program to help beginners or advanced practitioners.\nIn this course, you will learn how to create more prosperity, wealth, happiness, love, and any other goal you may have by using your inner potential or your psychic abilities.\nImagine if you are having trouble- making a decision about an investment, a career change, or dating a certain person. If you are having problems making a decision then this course can help you.\nIf you have any questions you can contact me anytime.\nJust send a message here or to my email, which I give out in the course.\nI have made tremendous changes in my own life with the techniques I share with you here in this program, I look forward to hearing from you about the changes you are making. I love success stories and I can’t wait to hear yours.\nI’ll see you on the inside,\nArvin Hopcraft",

      "description": "This eight hour, 30 video course is devoted to learning one of the most famous and ancient qigong forms in depth. Dating back close to one thousand years, the baduanjin form – translated as the 'eight pieces of silken brocade' or the 'eight silken movements' – is a profound tool to cultivate the three treasure of body, breath and mind.\nWorking with the body, we develop strength, balance, mobility, awareness, and harmonious integration of the joints and soft tissue.\nWorking with the breath, we develop lower abdominal breathing – also known as diaphragmatic breathing or dantian breathing. This shifts us into a deep parasympathetic state – nourishing and repairing the mind and body and helping us to stay calm and centred whatever life throws our way.\nWorking with the mind, we fill the body and breath with awareness, learning to dwell in the present moment and gain all the known physical, mental and emotional advantages of meditation.\nTogether, the cultivation of body, breath and mind helps build good health, wellbeing, resilience and connection to the what is known in Chinese philosophy as the Dao – the wellspring of everything in the universe.\nThe course begins with two introductory practices. The first is designed to mobilise the joints of the body. The second begins with an investigation of the core qigong standing practice. We adopt an open and spacious structure - rooting into Earth and lengthening into Heaven while practising release and softness. This preparatory video then offers a three-part neigong practice. Neigong can be translated as 'inner skill'. By lengthening and releasing the body as a single, interconnected elastic unit made up of fascia and a web of acupuncture channels, by breathing deep into the lower belly (dantian), and by calming the use brain and heart, we enter the qigong state where body, breath and mind are wrapped up together into an indissoluble whole.\nSubsequent videos teach each of the eight movements of the baduanjin in great detail with more neigong practices  - in this case tailored to the specific movement. The next video presents the whole form with minimal voiceover, and there follow a whole series of videos on different aspects of qigong practice.",

As great Yogis used to use certain breathing techniques as a medium to achieve this goal with time and practice, similarly in the modern world the goal might be the same but there are various challenges.\nThe most important challenge to walking on the yogic path and achieving its goals in the modern world is Vyadhi (disease) whether physical or mental. Till the time people are struggling and suffering from their own body and mind’s instability it’s very tough to maintain discipline.\nNowadays people don’t understand and consider their limitations, diseases, and illnesses and think that like people in old days used to get benefits and achievements from yoga and yogic life, similarly they will also get, however, it’s not easy because Vyadhi is restricting them from even living a healthy life.\nAlso, they try to find out all the solutions through yoga itself, and that also in 1 hour of practice 3 days a week or less. They don’t want to understand that Yoga is not meant for therapeutic purposes, all the health benefits are the by-products of the yogic lifestyle. Yoga is not an exercise program it should be one’s lifestyle and then only all the Siddhi/achievements can be achieved.\nTherefore in Rehab Yoga, we are focusing on the foundation of life using yogic limbs as described by Maharishi Patanjali in Yoga Sutras. We are trying to overcome the limitations, instability, and restrictions which are holding a person back in a modern lifestyle from getting yogic benefits, and then with their own pace and practice, people will start getting into the path of real yoga.\nIn Rehab Yoga we are trying to give meaning and purpose to all the actions so that each step will be valuable and a stepping stone towards Samadhi/Enlightenment.\nWe need to first understand and listen to our own bodies before we can make conclusions about the external world. It’s time to get back to the basics, it’s time to get connected with the self, it’s time to be on the yogic path to achieve higher consciousness and all these will only happen when we will take accountability for ourselves and accept as it is.",

      "description": "What's good to know before you do this course:\nFeldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons are typically taught by voice. This means that they are not demonstrated by the teacher. This is a very important principal embedded within the Method: that the student find's their own movement 'solutions' to the movement 'problems' that are posed during the lesson and to not be influenced by what they see other people do. In this way, the student experiences kinesthetic based learning. When discoveries are made, they are profound and long lasting because of this.\nIn spite of this important principal, I decided to demonstrate the first of the four lessons in this series. This is because I am not in the room to respond to what I am seeing. The demonstration is just a guide to the size, speed and quality of movement that is expected when doing Feldenkrais, and nothing more. These audio lessons invite you to trust your own innate body wisdom and learn to explore the unknown with curiosity, gentleness, self care and openness. It's not about being right or wrong, but about finding your own way and owning your discoveries. Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons are a mindfulness based movement practice, not an exercise class.\nThese lessons are recorded live from the studio. In the background you will hear the soft sounds of a busy University dance campus. As such, you will be getting an authentic learning experience. As you do these lessons, imagine that you are lying on the floor with 25 other students of all different skill levels, engaged in deep learning about their bodies; the way they move, the way that they think, sense and feel. All making very individual and profoundly personal discoveries, guided just by voice and their own nervous system and experience.\n\n\nMore about this series:\nThis is an introductory series of lessons for any person who is interested in improving their ability to move, and who understand that when you improve the way that you move, you also improve the way you feel, sense and think.\nThe Feldenkrais Method is an extremely gentle movement based training that teaches you how to heighten your ability to sense and feel yourself while you are moving, while improving your freedom and range of movement in all planes of action.\nPracticing the Feldenkrais Method can have many therapeutic benefits, hone specialised physical skills and support creative expression.\nThis series of lessons was designed for and taught to people training to be professional dancers, however it is suitable for any level of movement capability.\nPlease note that only the first full lesson is demonstrated. As per normal practice, the following lessons are just audio files. This gives participants the opportunity to find their own \"solutions\" to the movement \"problems\" to optimize learning potential.\nLecture 1: How to do Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons\nStudents will understand how to do Awareness Through Movement lessons safely and in a way that will optimise their learning.\n\n\nLecture 2: Freeing The Hip Joints\nIn this first lesson you will learn how to increase your freedom and range of movement in your hip joints.\nRecorded live in the dance studio, this lesson is suitable for any level of movement expertise.\nIt is done lying on your back and takes 37 minutes\nPlease note: Usually Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement lessons are not demonstrated, but rather the class is lead verbally by the teacher. In this first lesson I will demonstrate the movements as a reference, however the lesson should be undertaken as described by the audio, rather than be watched and copied. This encourages the student to take responsibility for their own learning, problem solve for themselves, and as such, achieve greater learning outcomes.\nSubsequent lessons will be provided as an audio lesson without any visual demonstration.\n\n\nLecture 3: Roll To Reach\nIn this second lesson you will understand how the movements of your chest can increase your reach into space.\nRecorded live in the dance studio, this lesson is suitable for any level of movement expertise.\nIt is done lying on your back and takes 45 minutes.\nThis lesson is an audio lesson and should be undertaken as described on the audio track.\n\n\nLecture 4: Activating Your Core\nIn this third lesson you will learn how to organise and coordinate all of your torso to increase your proximal power.\nRecorded live in the dance studio, this lesson is suitable for any level of movement expertise.\nIt is done lying on your back and takes 35 minutes.\nThis lesson is an audio lesson and should be undertaken as described on the audio track.\n\n\nLecture 5: Discovering the Spine\nIn this fourth lesson you will discover the incredible movement possibilities of your spine.\nRecorded live in the dance studio, this lesson is suitable for any level of movement expertise.\nIt is done on your hands and knees and takes 45 minutes.\nThis lesson is an audio lesson and should be undertaken as described on the audio track.",

You do not have to sit cross-legged on the ground, as many of us think, but if you want to then you can. You need to clear your mind. How do you clear your mind? You can sit on a chair, you can lie down, all you must do is stay in a stable position and place your palms in a place where they are facing towards the sky. Be present within the moment.\nMeditation is designed to help you become a better person, but it does so by bringing your mind into a single purpose – helping your mind and body to be at harmony with each other. Many people say, “Well I tried to meditate, but it didn’t work.” If you tried meditation and it didn’t work, it means that you were trying too hard to meditate – trying to do something that really doesn’t require any “doing” at all. The purpose of meditation is to avoid “doing” anything whatsoever, and just let the moment take you away.\nThere are many good forms of meditation practice. A good meditation practice is any one that develops awareness or mindfulness of our body and our senses, of our mind and heart. It does not really matter which kind you choose. What is more important is that after you choose a form of meditation you stay with it, and practice it regularly.\nMeditation has been an essential part of my life since I was very young and has helped me a lot in my time of difficulties.

You focus on what you experience during meditation, such as the flow of your breath. You can observe your thoughts and emotions. But let them pass without judgment. To begin to meditate is to look into our lives with interest and kindness and discover how to be wakeful and free.\nMeditation is not meant to give you the power to enjoy, give you a glimpse of stillness, give you a focused mind, give you relaxation, and provide you with some sort of discipline and some other necessary qualities. No, Meditation is not meant to develop some qualities. Meditation is very important because it frees you from all kinds of suffering, all kinds of attachment, and gives you the real state of no-mind (Meditation)\nMeditation, as a practice, has been around for thousands of years, originating in ancient spiritual traditions and evolving into a modern practice for both spiritual and mental well-being. The earliest recorded uses of meditation trace back to around 1500 BCE in India, within the Vedic traditions. Ancient Buddhist, Hindu, and Taoist cultures embraced meditation as a tool to cultivate mindfulness, gain spiritual insight, and achieve a deeper connection to the divine. Over time, these techniques spread globally, influencing other cultures, and eventually, meditation became an essential component of secular wellness practices.\nIn the 20th century, meditation gained worldwide popularity, particularly through the introduction of mindfulness and Transcendental Meditation, which made the practice accessible to people seeking relief from stress, mental strain, and emotional issues. The teachings of figures like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the Dalai Lama played a significant role in promoting meditation beyond traditional religious settings, especially in the Western world. Today, meditation is recognized not only as a spiritual practice but also as a scientifically supported method for reducing stress, improving mental health, and enhancing cognitive function. The benefits of meditation are well-documented, particularly in the areas of mental clarity, emotional balance, and overall well-being. Meditation helps reduce stress by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which calms the body’s fight-or-flight response. Regular practice can reduce levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, and promote relaxation. Additionally, meditation can significantly enhance focus, concentration, and memory, making it an effective tool for improving productivity and mental performance.

It helps individuals process emotions, reducing the effects of anxiety, depression, and negative thought patterns. Meditators also report an increased sense of inner peace and contentment, as mindfulness practices help them engage with life more fully and intentionally.\nFrom a spiritual perspective, meditation encourages deeper self-awareness and a heightened sense of connection to the present moment, allowing individuals to experience greater harmony in their lives. It offers a pathway for personal growth, spiritual awakening, and a more profound understanding of one's purpose. The meditative state allows for introspection, which fosters self-realization and growth in areas such as compassion, gratitude, and understanding.\nThe History of Meditation\nMeditation has a long and rich history, with its roots tracing back over 5,000 years. It originated in ancient civilizations, particularly in the spiritual traditions of India, China, and later, the broader Eastern world. The earliest written records of meditation come from the Vedic texts of India, dating back to around 1500 BCE. These texts describe meditation as part of the spiritual practices intended to connect individuals with the divine and to understand the nature of the self. Meditation in these early times was not merely for relaxation, but as a means to achieve spiritual enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth, known as samsara.\nOver time, meditation practices spread across the world, particularly influencing other philosophical and spiritual systems. In Buddhism, which emerged in India around the 6th century BCE, meditation became a central practice aimed at reaching nirvana or the cessation of suffering. The Buddha himself is often depicted as a figure in deep meditation, and his teachings emphasize mindfulness, concentration, and insight as key elements in achieving spiritual awakening. Similarly, Taoism in China, which arose around the same time, also incorporated meditation as a way to align oneself with the natural flow of the universe, often referred to as the Tao. As these traditions spread through Asia, so did the practice of meditation, eventually reaching other parts of the world.\nMeditation in the West\nThe concept of meditation remained largely confined to Eastern traditions until the mid-20th century when it began to gain traction in the West. One of the most significant turning points in the Western adoption of meditation came with the Hindu and Buddhist teachers and gurus, such as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and The Dalai Lama, who traveled to the West and introduced meditation as a form of spiritual and personal development. The 1960s and 1970s saw an increased interest in Eastern philosophy, partly fueled by the counterculture movement and growing interest in alternative spirituality, wellness, and personal transformation. During this time, meditation began to be seen not only as a spiritual practice but also as a way to improve mental health and emotional well-being. In particular, Transcendental Meditation (TM) became popular in the United States, endorsed by famous figures such as the Beatles. Meanwhile, mindfulness meditation, a form of vipassana practiced by the Buddha, began to be recognized by psychologists and mental health professionals as a therapeutic tool. Today, meditation is widely practiced in various forms across the globe and is no longer confined to religious or spiritual contexts. It is now seen as a universal practice for cultivating awareness, emotional balance, and relaxation.\nThe Benefits of Meditation\nMeditation offers a wide range of benefits that affect nearly every aspect of an individual’s life. One of the primary benefits of meditation is its ability to reduce stress. Scientific studies have consistently shown that regular meditation can lower cortisol levels—the hormone responsible for stress—helping individuals feel calmer and more at ease. Meditation allows people to step back from the daily pressures of life, creating space for reflection, relaxation, and emotional release. This reduction in stress can lead to a host of other positive outcomes, including better sleep, improved mood, and a greater sense of overall well-being.\nAnother significant benefit of meditation is its impact on mental clarity and focus. Regular meditation practice enhances the brain's ability to concentrate, process information, and solve problems. Studies have shown that meditation increases the thickness of the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain associated with decision-making, self-control, and attention. As a result, individuals who meditate often report feeling more productive, focused, and mentally sharp throughout the day. Moreover, meditation improves memory and cognitive function, especially in older adults, and can be a valuable tool in preventing cognitive decline.\nMeditation is also known for its profound emotional benefits. By cultivating mindfulness—the ability to observe thoughts and emotions without judgment—meditators can gain better control over their emotional responses. Regular practice helps individuals develop a greater sense of emotional regulation, reducing impulsive reactions and enhancing overall emotional resilience. This emotional balance contributes to improved relationships, as meditation fosters qualities like patience, compassion, and empathy. Over time, meditators report feeling more in touch with their inner peace, which can lead to a deep sense of fulfillment and emotional stability.\nMeditation and Health\nBeyond emotional and mental well-being, meditation has been shown to have numerous physical health benefits. It can lower blood pressure, improve heart health, and enhance immune system functioning. Studies indicate that meditation practices like mindfulness can help regulate the autonomic nervous system, reducing the body’s stress response and promoting a state of relaxation. People who meditate regularly often report fewer symptoms of chronic pain, better sleep patterns, and improved digestion. Additionally, meditation has been found to lower the risk of stress-related diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and even some types of cancer.\nMindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programs, which combine meditation with body awareness, have been used as effective treatments for a variety of conditions, including anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. Meditation encourages the body’s relaxation response, which can counteract the harmful effects of chronic stress. Studies also suggest that meditation has positive effects on neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. This indicates that meditation might not only improve the functioning of the brain in the present but could also offer long-term cognitive benefits.\nMeditation's Role Today in Mental Health\nIn today’s world, meditation plays an increasingly important role in mental health care. As mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and PTSD continue to rise, meditation has become a valuable tool for many people in managing these conditions. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), which integrate meditation with therapeutic techniques, are now used in clinical settings to treat a variety of mental health disorders. By teaching individuals to focus on the present moment and cultivate a non-judgmental awareness of their thoughts, mindfulness meditation can help people gain perspective on their mental and emotional states, leading to healthier coping mechanisms.\nResearch also supports the effectiveness of meditation in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Meditation encourages a shift away from rumination—where individuals get caught in negative thought patterns—and helps them break free from cycles of worry and self-criticism. Mindfulness meditation, in particular, is frequently used to help individuals become more aware of their triggers and cultivate a balanced, non-reactive approach to their emotions. Through meditation, people can learn to observe their thoughts without becoming overwhelmed by them, creating greater emotional freedom and reducing the severity of their mental health struggles.\nMeditation in the Workplace\nOne of the most remarkable transformations in recent years is the growing recognition of meditation’s benefits in the workplace. With rising levels of stress, burnout, and mental health issues in professional settings, many companies are introducing meditation and mindfulness programs for their employees. Research shows that meditation can improve productivity, focus, and overall job satisfaction. Companies like Google, Apple, and Intel have implemented meditation programs, providing employees with resources like on-site meditation rooms, guided sessions, and mindfulness training. The benefits of workplace meditation extend beyond individual well-being. Teams that meditate together often experience enhanced collaboration and creativity, as mindfulness fosters better communication, empathy, and emotional intelligence. In addition, meditation helps employees manage workplace stress, leading to fewer sick days, decreased turnover, and lower health care costs for businesses. Meditation programs in the workplace are not just seen as a luxury but as a necessary investment in the overall health and performance of a company’s workforce.\nMeditation’s Role in Society\nIn the broader societal context, meditation has become a tool for social change. It is increasingly used in educational settings, correctional facilities, and by non-profit organizations to help people of all backgrounds cope with trauma, improve mental health, and build emotional resilience. Meditation-based programs are now being implemented in schools to help students develop better focus, manage stress, and cultivate empathy. For example, programs like the Mindful Schools initiative teach children mindfulness techniques to improve their emotional regulation and well-being. Furthermore, meditation is being embraced as part of a movement toward greater social awareness and environmental sustainability. Many people see meditation as a way to connect more deeply with the world around them, developing a greater sense of compassion and responsibility toward others and the planet. With the rise of global challenges like climate change, political unrest, and social inequality, meditation is seen as a way to nurture inner peace and contribute to collective healing. The global meditation movement continues to grow, offering a tool for individuals and communities to foster greater connection, empathy, and understanding in a fragmented world.\nMeditation for the Future\nLooking ahead, meditation is likely to play an even more significant role in society. As the pace of life accelerates and digital distractions increase, many people are turning to meditation as a way to reclaim their attention and sense of peace. With the proliferation of smartphone apps, online courses, and virtual meditation communities, it has never been easier for people to access meditation resources. The future of meditation seems to be increasingly integrated into mainstream healthcare, education, and corporate environments, making it more accessible to people from all walks of life.\nIn conclusion, meditation’s journey from ancient spiritual practice to modern tool for health, well-being, and personal development underscores its enduring power and relevance. It remains a key practice for individuals seeking to cultivate a deeper sense of self-awareness, mental clarity, and emotional balance. As more people around the world embrace meditation, its potential to transform lives, improve health, and foster greater compassion continues to expand.\nYou can meditate anytime, anywhere, and with anyone. Some meditation styles work their magic slowly and only with patience. Who knows? One of these meditations may just change your life. If you are really going to be effective with your meditation, you will find that you don’t really have to “do” anything. It isn’t going to work if you try too hard to do whatever you feel you need to do, but the secret lies in letting go.\nNOTE:\nAfter completing this course, you will receive Meditation Certification of Completion from my side, which you can share with your family, friends, relatives, co-workers.

      "description": "You are going to die.\nAlso, everyone you know and love will also die at some point, some possibly sooner than you.\nPerhaps worse still, you are going to experience hardships during the course of your life on your way to death. Some may be quite painful. Whether you live for ten years, fifty years, or one hundred, makes no difference. Death makes no exceptions.\n\nEach of us can expect to have things not go our way at several points during our lives and the sad fact is that most people will lead lives that will be completely unpleasant and consistently experience great pain and suffering.\nOur reality is such that at any moment we could lose our lives or have our loved ones taken away from us; around every corner could be an accident waiting to happen that could irrevocably change us for whatever amount of time we have left; that we will build things and have them unfairly taken from us or watch them be destroyed.\nThe question is not how do we stop these things, because we can’t, the question is, how do we best live in a world where these events are not a possibility, but a reality.\nThe masses cope with the harsh nature of life by burying their heads in the sand and either pretend like the realities of death and hardship don’t exist, or (and as evidenced by the modern rampant use of prescription drugs) build around themselves an impression of reality that is dangerously incorrect.\nWarriors instead, stare death, hardship, and life trials directly in the face in order to confront it totally prepared. This is done through the ancient practice of subjective pathworking meditation.\nMost warrior cultures across the world developed these pathworking meditation traditions to deliberately induce states of consciousness in order to deal with and accurately adjust or overcome such harsh realities.\nThis was done a number of different ways including the use of rhythmic drums, breathing, meditation, prayer, psychoactive drugs, or the performance of feats or quests that couldn’t be successfully completed without tapping into alternative ways of operating.\nThe term pathworking itself refers to the art of changing a warrior’s consciousness to rebuild, repair, or maintain aspects of your life and self.\nIt provides those on the warrior’s path with the tools, mindset, and practices needed to live a happy, purposeful, and tranquil life…\nRegardless of how much pain and suffering that warrior may experience or how long or short their lives end up being.\nWarrior’s who embrace and practice pathworking meditation on a consistent basis find that their mental picture of reality becomes such a powerful force for overall stability, that it eventually creates the circumstances that maintain it. Almost as if it where a self-fulfilling prophesy.\nPerhaps you’ve heard of or read about the law of attraction, positive thinking, or affirmations.\nPerhaps you’ve experimented previously with guided meditation, prayer, or psychological reflection.\nThat is all well and good, but chances are that like most warriors, you concluded and found such techniques to be unsustainable, ineffective, and unproductive.\nThat’s because for those with the warrior’s mind and heart to live, to achieve, or even to conquer, “escaping” or “fleeing” from reality goes against every fiber of our very being.\nWarriors fight and warriors battle. Retreating to recalibrate and regroup is always a viable and acceptable option, but removing focus from the task on hand is not the way of the warrior.\nInstead warrior pathworking meditation focuses directly on the issues as needed through visualization of symbolic conversion. In essence altering very real situations and problems into symbolic associations in order to explore difficulties, challenges, and life trials from alternate angles.\nThroughout this program you will be guided through warrior pathworking meditation techniques, quests, and journeys to explore, repair, and protect the fortress that is your mind.\nYour memory will vastly improve, as will your problem solving and creative abilities.\nAny social or situational anxiety will rapidly dissipate, and both your mental and spiritual well-being will swiftly become impervious to outside manipulations.\nYou will at any moment be able to remove yourself completely from reality in order to focus fully and without distraction on conquering whatever obstacle stands in your way.\nWarrior pathworking meditation is the most powerful practice I’ve ever discovered, but there is a certain amount of danger to it because it a form of willed disassociation.\nIt can be abnormally addicting, particularly for those not on the warrior’s path as they will see it as a means of escape from their tortured reality rather than as the means to change it.\nTherefore it is your duty as a warrior to use pathworking meditation only for good purposes and intentions, to apply your own usage only to combating or fixing issues in the real world, and to practice it with respect and responsibility.\nThis is the WAY OF THE WARRIOR.",

      "description": "How can we deal with being bombarded by infinite stimuli and not go crazy?\nWe know the importance of physical exercise for the body, but what about exercise for the mind?\nEnter this 7-day meditation challenge and see for yourself how meditation can aid you in your life.\nYou don’t need to be a monk in a monastery or believe in God or take long and complicated training to be able to meditate and have peace of mind.\nThe scientific benefits of meditation are bringing this ancient discipline out of the monasteries, and into the hands of everyday people of the western world. I've tried to simplify the art of meditation into easy-to-digest pieces for everyday usage that can bring the gifts of meditation to practicality.\nThis course is perfect for beginners but also for those that want to deepen and enhance their own practice. I created this training with respect to the tradition of meditation but shaped it for use within our busy lives.\nI invite you to this 7-day meditation challenge, where every day you can set aside at least 12 minutes to do a meditation (that's how long the guided meditations in this course are, or shorter!) I want to show you that you do not need anything special or complicated to start something as simple as meditation.\nMeditation training allows us to essentially accept ourselves, others, and the conditions that we are in without spiraling and succumbing to our minds- without judgments or without trying to force some specific feelings that we think we \"should\" feel. In a magical sense, through meditation, one can realize the completeness and perfection of the present moment.\nBonus Content\nAs a guest, we have Greg Burdulis, a former monk and current meditation teacher, and we talk about some practical aspects of meditation and their benefits.\nFREE Bonus Gift to you: 70-page E-Book - \"Here and Now: How to Meditate\"\nDo you want to gain enhanced awareness of your body and mind to feel more relaxed, learn how to deal with stress and feel happy and fulfilled? You can enhance your performance in school, work, training, or with relationships.\nWhatever your reason to start meditation is, I will show how simple it can be and give you tips on how to create your own meditation routine. I will share everything I know about meditation that helped me, in the hope that you can benefit from it too.\nIncluded Guided Meditations\nBreathing\nBody relaxation\nSelf-value\nMindfulness\nBeach\nLoving-kindness\n\nYou will learn:\nWhat is meditation and how to meditate?\nIs there a best way to meditate?\nWhat are the different types of meditation?\nHow to \"hack\" the meditation?\nHow to reprogram your brain\nWhat is mindfulness?\nWhat is the path of the witness?\nHow do you breathe?\nHow meditation can help with managing stress?\nHow to create your meditation routine?\nWhat are micro-meditations?\n\nand much more...",

We all know someone who has died, too many of us have been divorced, and each of us, somewhere along the line, has lost their innocence. When we lose, we grieve. It's a universal theme. In Guided Mindfulness Meditations to Heal Grief and Loss, I use the power of contemplation and meditation to help ease you through the grieving process and into a space of empowered acceptance and peace.\nThis course includes:\nLectures discussing the importance of learning how to enter states of DEEP RELAXATION, and INSIGHTS INTO THE GRIEVING PROCESS.\nOne CONTEMPLATION to help you gain new perceptions into healing your grief.\nThere are time-tested GUIDED MEDITATION TECHNIQUES to help you RELEASE PAINFUL EMOTIONS and move into a place of EMPOWERED PEACE.\nOne true story of a MIRACULOUS RECOVERY FROM GRIEF.\nA VERIFICATION SHEET to help you chart your progress.\nOn a personal note, I've been through the grieving process myself more than once. I know what it's like. I'll be there to help and assist you through the process, so you won't be going it alone.\nWhat students are saying:\n…I wanted to tell you that I’ve taken a lot of online courses & yours are some of the best I’ve come across.… Lauren Carter\n…the meditations are next-level awesome. Courtney Seard\nThis course was delivered in a simple-to-follow fashion. I especially enjoyed the meditations and feel as though I really connected with and was able to truly feel a presence and full-body energy vibrations from each of them. This is a huge plus for me! So many courses and meditations out there that you end up not really connecting with and you leave feeling empty or dissatisfied with. This was not the case with this course. If you are in the early stages of a spiritual journey that you give this a try. You need to be connected with yourself and in the right frame of mind and this course walks you through each stage clearly and with easy to follow exercises. So worth it! Kevin Dickens\nDrumheller asks me to go deep right off. He is gentle in his delivery, providing a safe space for me to resolve stuff I thought I had taken care of. I am looking forward to the rest of the course. Susy Goins\nExcellent clarification and just amazing. Wow!! Mollie Shannon Rama",

Because Sri Vishwanath is truly a master of these two things. For example in 2016 he taught a small group of students with no prior meditation and spiritual experience six thousand years of wisdom in less than six hours… Some claim another master holds this record but its disputable.’\nAnyway, Sri Vishwanath’s teaching worked so well, that people would listen to his live facebook videos three times a day. He had over half million people watching his videos in less than 3 months.\nAnd during the same period his kindle books were downloaded more than quarter million times in less than six months. Infact he had to hire 4 full time people to sort out the daily questions that was hitting his email from spiritual seekers.\nNot only that he started a whole show Ask Sri Vishwanath show to answer the questions which became the number 1 video podcast in Itunes USA in Religion…\nHowever that’s one success story. Since then, Sri Vishwanath has racked up an almost unbelievable track record of amazing successes. But instead of marvelling you with how wonderful he is .. I want to get to the heart of the matter.\nAnd it’s this. For a limited time, I’m going to re-release the complete step by step videos of his April seminar. This is the same stuff which others paid $7500. And as a special deal for you … I am going to offer it for a two digit figure.",

      "description": "Tantra is called the left hand path of god, the right hand path is called as dakshinchara. Robert svoboda who writes a tale of aghori but was living in the city caught hold of many people imagination. Many of them have got misguided that one can drink, smoke and do what ever one likes .\n\n\n\n\nThe basics of tantra\nTantra comes from the atharvana veda. The athravana veda is broken into many pieces and forms the root book of tantra. The shiva shakthi dialogue with the author name is withheld. Yoni tantra talks about how to use women's yoni in tantra. The yogini tantra talks about how to use yoginis in sadhana. The guhyasamaja tantra and kalachakra talks about how to see the patterns of the time. I have never seen many people talk about the root books. For example bala tripura sundari comes from gandharva tantra. The shree rudram is there in the rudrayamala tantra .\n\n\nIt can be broadly divided as\nTantra books\nTantra techniques\nTantra experiences\nUltimate understanding of tantra.\n\n\nThe many books written on tantra including the book by Robert Svoboda gives a different picture about what tantra really is.\n\n\nTantra is not about drinking smoking or having sex with many women. If you really go to a tantric teacher you will find it.When I asked my Guru Shri K.B.G he beautifully said just like how there aren't enough words to define love, Tantra is also a way of life and a different path to attain god.\n\n\nTANTRA can be defined as a path of women or a path of the devi to reach God. He says\n\"you can learn the very essence of tantra only from a women, just like how the Great Saraha learned the path of tantra from two women as his guru, it is the yinish path of nature to reach god\"\n\n\nThough the book on aghora and various tantric books and so called present day gurus think tantra is all about drinking, using drugs and sex it is much more of merging with the beloved to see God the ultimate within.\n\n\nThis book seeks to explain the various aspects of tantra. Tantra can be seen in the form of energy which is classified as two the white vortex and the black vortex\n\n\nSimilarly tantra, can be experienced with the opening of the black vortex in particular events of death, sleep and chod.\n\n\nThis book will give you a vast detail on what tantra is really about.\nMay this book be a lamp in the life of any searching for answers which are not available in the library of a common man but the library of higher beings\n\n\nMy guru always said this when I asked him a question about how he came to know so many things about tantra?\nHe simply said if it was I who was learning then my life would have been limited , it was the divine higher beings of the astral who come through me and teach me.\n\n\nHe has penned down his learnings long back, it is now that he found time to put it together and present it as a book.",

      "description": "Kundalini- Practice Chakra Balancing & Kundalini Awakening\nRaise Kundalini Shakti, Kundalini yoga ,Kundalini Awakening Techniques ,Explore Kundalini to awaken your full potential\nThe basic premise is to encourage the flow of Kundalini energy up the spine and toward the top of the head—the crown chakra—thus projecting your awareness into the higher heavenly dimensions of the universe. The result is an indescribable expansion of consciousness into spiritual realms beyond form and thought.\nThis Kundalini Awakening Course is for everyone who wants to learn about the mysterious phenomenon of kundalini and use it to reach the pinnacle of human development - enlightenment. The Kundalini Awakening is also for those who are going through an involuntary awakening and seeking help to alleviate their symptoms and make the best of this event.\nKundalini is a power that identifies the springing up of power and focus, which has been coiled at the base of the spine because of the start and is the source of the lifestyle pressure (pranic energy, chi, bio-strength) . Yogic science shows that this energy caused the formation of the kid within the womb and then coils three ½ instances at the bottom of the backbone to preserve the strong discipline in stasis till we die when it uncoils and returns to its supply.\nWith the help of the Kundalini, we can open us and experience the life around us more directly and in a process of identification. The Kundalini teaches us to see the beauty, but our dark sides as well – and to accept them. It teaches, urges, forces us to correct them. It brings light into the twilight of our soul. In this light it is possible to come closer to the divine principle. With every step that we take, the divine cosmic consciousness comes three steps closer to us. If we are ready, we can also sense the proximity of the divine, even perceive it – as the goddess in appearance of our Shakti or as a male spiritual guide. Kundalini teaches in different ways\nKundalini Energy!\nWhen we awaken her infinite Shakti power for the first time, we receive a spiritually enlightening experience that can last for days. We then realize who we are something much bigger than before. We see we are this energy, enthusiasm, inspiration and begin to realize we are responsible for the divine creation of our life exactly the way it is. Kundalini is the supreme cosmic enlightening energy that resides inside us, deep at the core of our being. Kundalini is the most powerful force in the Universe, and brings enlightenment to our world. Your Kundalini awakens the manifesting being in your life! Anything you wish to manifest is possible with an awakened Kundalini. The Kundalini goes against the force of gravity. It rises on its own, like fire. It purifies, consumes and cleanses all that is useless (ideas, desires, feelings that take us away from spirituality). It doesn’t absorb imperfections—it removes them. This is why we sometimes feel heat.\nWhat Is Kundalini Awakening Energy?\nKundalini is an еnеrgу, whiсh iѕ tied tо thе соnѕсiоuѕnеѕѕ. Coiled within thе bоdу, it rеmаinѕ dormant in the sleeping bоdу. Thiѕ рѕусhо-ѕрirituаl force iѕ аwаkеnеd through vаriоuѕ ѕрirituаl рrасtiсеѕ, оftеn tiеd to уоgа. Kundаlini iѕ tied tо thе сhаkrаѕ, residing in the rооt сhаkrа. Oftеn related tо a ѕеrреnt, it will rise up frоm the bаѕе оf thе ѕрinе whеn аwаkеnеd. Aѕ thе Kundalini riѕеѕ, it will pass thrоugh each chakra or energy сеntеr, сrеаting a high-energy fоrсе throughout thе еntirе body. Kundalini Yoga iѕ the mоѕt common рrасtiсе in which tо аwаkеn the power. Althоugh much оf thе hiѕtоrу оf Kundаlini аѕѕосiаtеd practices iѕ unknоwn, thеrе is ѕоmе еvidеnсе that mеntiоn hаѕ bееn mаdе of thе еnеrgу fоrсе in many аnсiеnt tеxtѕ. Found in writingѕ frоm the Tibеtаnѕ, Chinеѕе, Egyptians, and Native Amеriсаnѕ, there iѕ аlѕо rеfеrеnсе tо this tуре оf роwеr in the Biblе and the Qurаn.\nWhat you will Learn from this Kundalini Course?\n· What Is Kundalini Awakening Energy?\n· Kundalini Awakening Benefits\n· Kundalini Awakening Symptoms\n· Kundalini Awakening Mantra\n· Kundalini Yoga Asanas & Mudras\n· Kundalini Awakening Technique Step By Step\n· Chakra Kundalini Meditation\n· How To Know If Kundalini Is Awake\n· Pranayama Kundalini Yoga Breathing Techniques\n· Preparation for Kundalini Activation\n· What Happens When Kundalini Is Awakened\n· Chakras & the Kundalini\n· Benefits to Awakening Kundalini\n· Signs of Kundalini Awakening\n· Kundalini Awakening Techniques\n· Troubleshooting Your Awakening\n· How To Do Kundalini meditation\nThough Kundalini awakening is the greatest prize on the spiritual quest, the blessed soul receiving this grace is on its way to the realization of the highest, the awakening and its attendant process of renewal is not without peril. When the dormant or potential aspect of the Kundalini arises, Her single intent is the transformation of individual consciousness with its vehicles - mind and body - into fully expanded Consciousness of the Divine. That process of transformation and purification is marked by both beatific sublime experiences of the Divine, as well as by dark nights of the soul, by physical, emotional and mental states of ecstasy as well as periods of purgation and distress\nKundalini and Chakras\nA chakra is thought to be an energy node in the human body. The word comes from the Sanskrit chakra meaning “wheel, circle”, and sometimes also referring to the “wheel of life”. The seven main chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the spine to the top of the head. Each chakra is associated with a certain color, multiple specific functions, an aspect of consciousness, a classical element, and other distinguishing characteristics. The chakras are thought to vitalize the physical body and to be associated with interactions of both a physical and mental nature. They are considered loci of life energy, or prana, which is thought to flow among them along pathways called nadis. Traditional Chinese medicine also relies on a similar model of the human body as an energy system.\nActivated Kundаlini energy riѕеѕ uр thе ѕрinаl соlumn (Kundalini Rising) аnd 'асtivаtеѕ' аll chakras in it'ѕ path, eventually lеаding tо Kundаlini Awakening. Chakras аrе еnеrgу 'whееlѕ' thаt еithеr spin left or ѕрin right. There аrе ѕеvеn mаin chakras that hаvе vаriоuѕ roles in thе mаintеnаnсе our health аnd wellness.\nBriеflу, thе ѕеvеn chakras аrе:\n• Sаhаѕrаrа / Thе Crоwn Chаkrа.\n• Ajnа / Thе Brоw Chаkrа.\n• Viѕhuddhа / The Thrоаt Chakra.\n• Anаhаtа / The Hеаrt Chаkrа.\n• Mаniрurа / Thе Sоlаr Plеxuѕ Chakra.\n• Swаdhiѕthаnа / The Sacral Chakra.\n• Mulаdhаrа / The Rооt Chаkrа.\nChakras are аlwауѕ ѕрinning, рrосеѕѕing еnеrgу, аnd асtivе. Whеn they are 'аwаkеnеd' by the Kundalini force, thеir рrореrtiеѕ ѕurgе аnd begin operating at еlеvаtеd lеvеlѕ. Activating сhаkrаѕ can tаkе dауѕ, months оr years оf рrасtiсе, оr can еvеn happen spontaneously, knоwn аѕ Sроntаnеоuѕ Kundalini. The Kundalini nourishes any of our chakras that are out of balance and corrects them. When the chakras are clear enough for the Kundalini to rise without obstacles, we can feel the peace and enjoy thoughtless awareness. The Kundalini can be understood as consisting of many strands of energy. The more we meditate, the more strands rise, and the stronger our central channel becomes. This helps us to live more in the present.\nWhat are the benefits оf Kundаlini awakening?\nThе benefits are еxреriеnсеd оn рhуѕiсаl аnd spiritual level and саn lеаd to реrfесt hеаlth, slower аging, аnd increased sexual роwеr. Grеаtеr ѕеnѕuаlitу, аffесtiоn, аnd kindnеѕѕ are also a dirесt result оf the аwаkеning, аѕ wеll as thе асhiеvеmеnt of fаmе and thе accumulation оf wеаlth.

The energy ascends to the height, which correlates with the crown chakra and the pineal gland.\nKundаlini cleanses thе ѕоul, thе mind and thе рhуѕiсаl body and it iѕ normal to experience some ѕоrt оf рѕусhоlоgiсаl diѕturbаnсе аnd роѕѕiblу physical disturbance. But уоu muѕt аllоw Kundalini tо do what it hаѕ tо dо, ѕurrеndеr tо it, dо not рut uр rеѕiѕtаnсе аѕ thiѕ will оnlу mаkе thе experience mоrе unсоmfоrtаblе and trаumаtiс. Dо not be аfrаid оf it, welcome аnd nurture it, аnd the process will unfоld in a much mоrе hаrmоniоuѕ way.\nThеrе аrе certain methods аnd techniques whiсh you саn uѕе yourself tо аwаkеn Kundаlini, including сеrtаin tуреѕ оf mеditаtiоn аnd brеаthing tесhniԛuеѕ.

It is the complete yoga for the mind and body and offers numerous benefits. The general motivation behind Kundalini yoga is to raise the vitality of the individual and interface it with the widespread vitality. Kundalini yoga practice joins breathing activities, physical postures, hand positions, sound and contemplation. This mix of components is called 'Kriya', which imp\nKundalini Awakening Signs and Symptoms\nInvоluntаrу jеrking movements оf the body inсluding vibrаtiоnѕ, spasm, shaking аnd соntrасtiоnѕ: Aѕ thе Kundаlini еnеrgу mоvеѕ from thе bаѕе of the ѕрinе аnd up thrоugh the bоdу, it clears deeply hеld blосkаgеѕ аnd whilе thiѕ iѕ hарреning thе person mау еxреriеnсе еmоtiоnѕ аnd mеmоriеѕ from injuriеѕ аnd trаumаѕ ѕuffеrеd in the раѕt.

You will learn that kundalini is like the fuel that will carry the vehicle of your body and mind towards your highest potential of love, wisdom and bliss. If you have not yet had a kundalini awakening, I will show you a pathway of awakening that is extraordinarily safe, so that you can use this wonderful energy to further and enrich your spiritual life. The path I will be teaching is slow but you will feel its benefits pretty much from day one.\nKundalini awakening and chakra balancing are ancient practices rooted in spiritual traditions that date back thousands of years, particularly in yogic and tantric teachings. The concept of Kundalini is described as a dormant spiritual energy located at the base of the spine, often symbolized as a coiled serpent. Once awakened, this energy rises through the chakras, or energy centers, along the spine, leading to a profound transformation of consciousness and a deeper connection to the universe. The process of awakening Kundalini is believed to result in spiritual enlightenment, increased awareness, and greater inner peace.\nHistorically, the practice of awakening the Kundalini energy was reserved for advanced yogis and spiritual seekers who undertook years of disciplined meditation, physical postures (asanas), and breathwork (pranayama) to prepare the body and mind for the powerful awakening process. These teachings, passed down by revered gurus and spiritual teachers, were often seen as sacred knowledge, shared only with a select few who were ready for the deep spiritual journey. The practice was believed to lead to higher states of consciousness, inner balance, and even liberation (moksha), breaking the cycle of suffering and reincarnation.\nIn modern times, Kundalini awakening has been adapted to suit the needs of contemporary spiritual seekers, offering a safe and structured approach for anyone wishing to experience its profound benefits. Through this course, students learn various techniques designed to awaken and channel Kundalini energy in a controlled, mindful manner. These techniques include specific meditations, breathwork, and visualization practices that can be integrated into daily life. By balancing and aligning the chakras, students experience emotional healing, mental clarity, and spiritual growth. The benefits of Kundalini awakening are vast and deeply transformative. On a physical level, it can improve health by reducing stress, enhancing vitality, and promoting greater self-awareness. Emotionally, it allows individuals to clear blockages, heal past traumas, and establish inner peace. Spiritually, it opens up the channels for deeper intuition, a more profound connection to the divine, and a heightened sense of purpose. As the Kundalini energy rises through the chakras, individuals may experience heightened creativity, better decision-making, and a greater understanding of their true self.\nThis course offers a comprehensive introduction to the principles of Kundalini awakening and chakra balancing, providing a powerful set of tools for those interested in personal transformation and spiritual enlightenment. Whether you are a seasoned yoga practitioner, a spiritual seeker, or someone new to these practices, this course will guide you through the journey of awakening your Kundalini energy, bringing about lasting change in your life. Through dedicated practice, students can unlock the deep spiritual and physical benefits of this ancient wisdom, cultivating harmony, balance, and fulfillment in all areas of life.",

      "description": "Embrace The Power Of Guided Meditation\nLet The Healing Begin\n\n\nExperts advise that most of the population suffers\nfrom some form of dysfunction and issues…\n\n\nAccording to eNotAlone...\n\"In the United States today, more people come from dysfunctional families than healthy families. It is estimated that approximately 70 to 80 percent come from dysfunctional families.\"\n\n\nAccording to DoSomething…\n\"About 20% of teens will experience depression before they reach adulthood.\"\n\n\n7 in 10 girls believe they're not good enough in some way\n(Dove Self-Esteem Fund, 2008)\n\n\nOnly 2% of women believe themselves to be beautiful\n(Confidence Coalition, n.d.)\n\n\nThe above are just a few examples of the need for healing from within\nThere are also issues such as…\n\nGreif And Loss\nDivorce\nRelationship Break Ups\nLack of confidence\nResentments\nAnger issues\nDifficulty processing pain\nLack of healthy coping skills\nAnd many more\n\n\nWhat issues are you facing at this moment?\n\n\nHealing begins with you!\nYou can heal from your issues and the root causes of your pain.\n\n\nAll healing begins from within ourselves. We must take personal responsibility for our own healing if we are ever to heal, be emotionally and psychologically healthy, enjoy inner peace and live prosperous and joyous lives.\n\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU HAVE THE POWER TO HEAL YOURSELF.\n\n\nAll healing starts from within and is accessed\nthrough the subconscious mind!\n\n\nThe subconscious mind is the aspect of our minds that lies below the surface of our awareness. The subconscious controls all the decisions we make. It holds the beliefs we have about ourselves and all that we are.\n\n\nThe subconscious mind can hold onto negative experiences we had in the past that can drive who we become today and how we live our lives. These experiences mold us. And even if the pain occurred twenty years ago, it could have a negative effect on you and your life today.\n\n\nSo, we sometimes get stuck in a cycle of repeating past choices or actions even though we thought we had learned our lesson.\n\n\nWhen we experience something difficult or traumatic in our lives, we often are subject to remnants of the event that stay lodged in our mind and body.\n\n\nThese experiences create conditioned responses that can affect the way we make decisions and can impact aspects of our lives we are unaware of.\n\n\nWhen we experience stress or other events that seem to be out of our control, we can experience a level of fear over what is to come.\n\n\nAccessing and reprogramming the subconscious mind is essential for creating a new reality with greater patience, clarity and success that is of our true nature and is not forced or faked.\n\n\nIt's possible to Reprogram Your Mind With Guided Meditation.\n\n\nAccording To The Good Body,\nAbout 500 million people worldwide meditate\n\n\nAccording to Mindful\n\"Meditation is identified as the fastest-growing trend\".\n\n\nGuided meditation is a practice where you meditate through guidance provided by a trained practitioner, where an instructive voice leads you through a meditation on a set topic.\n\n\nGuided meditation is ideal for the beginner to meditating, or for anyone seeking to meditate on a certain topic or theme.\n\n\nWhen we participate regularly in guided meditation, we can access the subconscious mind and create a new underlying program for our lives.\n\n\nThe subconscious mind is responsible for our underlying belief systems and ideologies.\n\n\nInstead of allowing our subconscious mind to rule our existence, we can start to program our minds with new healthy and positive beliefs.\n\n\nMeditation calms and quiets the mind.\n\n\nMeditation is a practice of contemplation that allows us to pay attention to what is going on deep inside of ourselves.\n\n\nMeditation is the highest level of self-awareness.\n\n\nMeditation allows us to experience our deepest thoughts and beliefs.\n\n\nMeditation allows us to understand ourselves on the deepest level.\n\n\nWhen we can clearly see the mental experiences that we are having in our minds, we can begin to understand ourselves more fully. When we take time to understand ourselves, we can offer ourselves greater compassion and honesty.\n\n\nGuided mediation offers a voice that guides us to a healthier and more positive place which helps to reprogram our minds and beliefs which in turn changes our behaviors.\n\n\nAll this empowers you to…\nForgive yourself and others\nExperience more self-compassion\nProcess and heal pain and inner turmoil\nStart again with a fresh perspective\nReprogram negative beliefs you have about yourself and the world\nLearn self-trust\nBoost self-confidence and self esteem\nWork through your issues\nBoost emotional health\nReduce anxiety\nGrow on the deepest level\n\n\nAND HEAL FROM WITHIN\n\nLET THE POWER OF GUIDED MEDITATION\nHEAL YOU FROM WITHIN\n\n\nStart Now.\n\n\nHere is what it's Included In this Life-Changing Audio Course:\n\n\nHEAL FROM WITHIN\n14 GUIDED MEDITATIONS\nwith MRS JOY\nOver 3 Hours Of Healing Audios\n\n\nWeek 1: I Healing the Past and Letting Go\n\n\nGuided Meditation 1: I Believe in Myself - 15 minutes\nGuided Meditation 2: Emotional Healing - 20 minutes\nGuided Meditation 3: I Forgive - 15 minutes\nGuided Meditation 4: Child Within - 20 minutes\nGuided Meditation 5: I Heal Myself From Within - 20 minutes\nGuided Meditation 6: Let Go Of Toxic Relationships - 20 minutes\nGuided Meditation 7: Healing Pain - 15 minutes\n\n\nWeek 2: Empowering Myself and Becoming Who I Truly Am\n\n\nGuided Meditation 8: Releasing Negative Self-Image Beliefs - 10 minutes\nGuided Meditation 9: I Love Myself - 5 minutes\nGuided Meditation 10: Living My Truth - 10 minutes\nGuided Meditation 11: Increasing Compassion - 10 minutes\nGuided Meditation 12: Manifesting Abundance - 6 minutes\nGuided Meditation 13: Law of Attraction - 8 minutes\nGuided Meditation 14: Expanding Joy - 8 minutes\n\n\nUsing guided meditations allows you to reprogram the subconscious mind in order to align with the conscious mind so you can make changes to your outlook, mindset, and your experiences.\n\n\nThe best part about guided meditation is that you can relax and let a trusted guide lead you to a space of mindfulness.\n\n\nCreate new images, ideas, and beliefs in your mind to set a positive outlook and implement changes in your life that will allow you to heal and engage in healthy and positive experiences.\n\n\nThe regular practice of listening to this guided meditation series, with its phrases and guidance will begin to create a new reality that will in turn allow you to not only heal but to react differently to your pain, suffering and issues.\n\n\nIt's time to let go of negative ideas and beliefs\n\n\nIt's time to Reinvent Yourself!\n\n\nLet MRS JOY's guided meditation series lead you to a new reality.\n\n\nHEAL FROM WITHING AND START LIVING\nTHE LIFE YOU DESERVE TODAY.\n\n\nGET IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO\nHEAL FROM WITHIN\n14 GUIDED MEDITATIONS with MRS JOY\nOver 3 Hours Of Guided Healing Audio\n\n\nStart Your Self-Healing Now!\n\n\n\n\nMRS JOY is Founder of Joyful Minds Training, Wellbeing Time & MRS JOY's Academy\nThe World's Best Online Self-Development Academy for Wellbeing & Mental Health,\nMeditation & Mindfulness, High Performance & Success.",

      "description": "Pregnancy can be a tough and sensitive time, and it is too easy to forget the beauty of the miracle that is transpiring inside of you.\n\nThis course has a number of sections to help you throughout the entire pregnancy, and properly prepare you for birth. Pregnancy deserves a multi-factorial approach to make sure that you and your baby are healthy physically, mentally and spiritually. As the baby grows inside of you, there is an incredible opportunity to connect, and provide them with an environment which allows them to grow and thrive in this critical time. Give your baby what they deserve and need, and do this by taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually.\nThis course was put together by an extensive team including medical professionals, yoga/pilates instructors, physiotherapists, as well as doulas. This team got together to create a course which brings you the essentials of pregnancy from every direction that you need.\n\nWhat's in this course?\n- Pregnancy Education:\nWhile pregnancy can be new and exciting, often physical and hormonal changes can be scary and unknown. In this guide we take you through all of the changes that you go through, and what to expect. We also provide tips and tricks to minimize the discomfort, and keep you healthy throughout. In addition to this we go through all of the medical check ups that you might go through, talking about what to expect, how important the test is and to help you understand the importance of some of the results.\n\n- Meditation:\nStress runs high during pregnancy, as this can be an emotionally charged time in your life. Our guided lectures will help you reduce the stress in your life, create incredible connections with your baby, as well as help you sleep better!\n- Yoga:\nWe have a complete section in this course which combines techniques from the teachings of eastern yoga and physiotherapy, providing your body with the appropriate exercises and techniques to keep yourself balanced, strong and stable, as well as physically connected to yourself.\n- Preparing for Birth:\nWhen you get to the hospital it is too easy to let the medical team make the generic recommended decisions for you, and it's too easy to be passive in this situation. Giving birth how you want requires understanding the process that you go through from the medical side, and understanding what you need to ask for ahead of time. This way you can create a plan that's right for you, taking control of the birth how you want it to be. This can only be done if you are informed, and this section of the course will guide you through that.\nWhat you can expect:\nThis course will introduce you to topics that you may have not heard of, but are essential to understand in order to take your own fate into your hands. With our course you can expect to be much better prepared for the pregnancy, and for the birth itself. Our exercises and recommendations will give you the best chance of staying healthy, preventing complications and providing an environment which is best for you and your growing baby. Along with the lectures, we have many additional resources including articles, studies and Q&A support throughout.\nTake control of your fate, and the fate of your baby with this course. Click the enroll button, and we'll see you in the first section!\nCongratulations and see you soon,\nThe MedScreen Team",

Most importantly, each view is of a whole, not a collection of parts.\nWe will unfold the spiritual aspects of The Sefirot, which are not finite and measurable, they are not, static objects, like fixed, solid rungs on the ladder of the progressive revelation of the divine attributes. They are dynamic forces, ascending and descending, and extending themselves within the area of the Godhead.\n\n\nDuring this course we will learn about the teachings of the Tree of Life according to the wisdom of Kabbalah, we will use two beautiful sources. The book of creation - ספר יצירה, the knowledge in this book was given to Avraham directly from the entity we call the first Adam that got it from the archangel Raziel before leaving the garden of Eden. This book explains the power of the 22 Hebrew letters as interface tools between us and the divine, Havaya.\nThe second article is called the Tree of Life - עץ החיים, this article opens us to the wisdom of the structure called the Tree of Life so we can channel and balance the infinite light in our day to day lives.\nWe will explore the structure of the Tree of Life. We will talk about the Gematria of the Hebrew letters and see what are the three aspects that the book of creation tells us to observe each and every letter. What are the divinity names in each of the Sefirot, which entity and which angle are influencing each Sefira how the Hebrew letters are channeling the vibrational frequencies of the divine light within this structure.\nWe will learn how to activate the vibrational frequencies of this structure using an ancient prayer that invokes divinity 42 letters explicit name.\nWe will experience a powerful Kabbalistic guided conscious thinking process of activation of the Tree of Life\n\n\nBlessings to all.",

This course will make it simple and easy for you to meditate.\nIn doing so you will be able to greatly relieve stress and anxiety, help to heal pain and suffering, and live with a wonderful sense of calm and well-being.\nAutomatic Writing\nAutomatic writing is a lesser known but equally powerful technique. You will discover how to examine your inner most thoughts. In doing so you will find solutions to everyday challenges, as well as answers to bigger questions like, \"What is the meaning of my life\"?\n\nBetween these two techniques you will experience life with a new sense of calmness, less negative emotions, much more positive energy, and a greater sense of purpose and significance.",

Here you are going to learn :\n\n\nRelaxation\nMeditation\nCleaning\nThese techniques will help you relax, focus, rejuvenate, reduce stress and change through meditation. Change and constant change is natural to the human being, yet we struggle to change. Our way of persisting in old unproductive, inefficient ways is exactly what makes us more stressed, and so caught up in our daily life. Here, through these guided meditations you ll be able to have a moment for yourself that will help you enormously for your daily life.\n\nEveryone wants to achieve their goals.I am often asked questions like:\n\nHow do I become a better person?\nHow do I improve my relationships?\nHow to move from thinking about me to feeling about others?\nIs there a way to transform intellect into wisdom?\nCan ego make way for humility?\nThe answers lie in the infinite skies of super-consciousness and in the deepest oceans of sub-consciousness.\n\nAn expanded consciousness is the gateway to inner perfection.\nJoin me on this journey of personal transformation. Awaken the inner potential by accelerating your practice with the help of meditation.\nI invite you to leave your beliefs at the door as you enter this experiential practical journey where your brain will be rewired to function more effectively with more harmony and sync.\nI am waiting for you, and I hope truly you re going to exploit all the benefits of these meditations.\nThree years ago, with much “healthy” scientific doubt I began studying the effects of Hemi-Sync on electrocortical activity of human subjects. Study after study, I have been impressed by the effectiveness and the versatility of this audio technology to guide and entrain the brain to enter a variety of states of consciousness. These days, brain entrainment modalities are in vogue. Unfortunately, however, in my view, entrepreneurs and business people selling these gadgets and tapes seem to benefit more from them then the consumer. Therefore, it is quite refreshing to know that there is a brain-entrainment modality that actually works. In fact, I am convinced that Hemi-Sync goes beyond “blind” entrainment and consequently avoids some of the danger of underdeveloped technologies that clearly have the potential to do harm to those using them.\nAlthough there is a wealth of clinical data with regard to the beneficial effects of Hemi-Sync, there is a lack of empirical theories explaining the phenomenon. And yet without sound and testable theories, we are liable to lose momentum in our research and clinical work, and something that we know has great value is likely to be considered a fad, a gimmick, something unscientific. As Louis Pasteur, the great scientist once stated to a group of medical students, “Without theory, practice is but routine born of habit. Theory alone can bring forth and develop the spirit of invention. It is you especially who are obliged not to share the opinion of those narrow minds who reject everything in science which has no immediate application” (in Reik, 1948, p. ix). Hemi-Sync has many applications, and there are even more applications ready to be unveiled by us as we attempt to construct now theories.\nBased on my empirical research, I wish to propose two theories of Hemi-Sync, in this paper. But before introducing these theories, by merely reflecting on the obtained data and observations in our laboratory, I wish to address a few questions raised in the scientific community with regard to the effectiveness of Hemi-Sync. Dr. Lester Fehmi one of the foremost authorities in the field of applied psychophysiology and brain research once stated that he believed Hemi-Sync could drive the brain to enter certain states, but at the same time he emphasized, “. . . but it doesn’t teach you how to got there. It’s like a pill; in a way you don’t know how the pill works . . . and you may end up somewhat refreshed but if you had the option to got on a device that would allow you to learn to create the permissive conditions for the creation of this synchrony, then you’d be in much better shape, because then you could apply that anywhere without the tools and begin to learn how to function in everyday activity while doing that” (in Hutchison, 1986, V. 222). Also, another prominent scientist, Dr. Elmer Green remarked that we should not try to drive the brain but to help people learn to achieve hemispheric synchronization without external sources of brain entrainment (in Hutchison, 1986).\nThese are indeed legitimate and important questions that require scientific and data-based answers. Is Hemi-Sync a pill? Are we promoting dependency on a tape and a tape recorder for the rest of a patient’s life? Based on solid electoencephalographic data that we have collected in our neuropsychological laboratory, it is quite clear that after a brief period of exposure to Hemi-Sync frequencies, subjects can summon the beneficial effects of this technology at will without the use of any external sources of entrainment. In several studies, it was clearly demonstrated that subjects by merely counting up from one to eleven and simply saying, “access channel open” were able to achieve full bilateral synchrony (see Sadigh, 1990 and 1991a). Furthermore, unlike EEG biofeedback training which is limited to training in a specific state of consciousness (i.e. cognitive or somatic relaxation), Hemi-Sync can promote training in a variety of states ranging from active concentration to sleep. To those who have understandably questioned the effectiveness of Hemi-Sync and its potential to be more than an external driver we offer our data and findings–let them speak for themselves.\nTheories of Hemi-Sync\nBased on the findings of several studies presented in the Hemi-Sync Journal (see Sadigh, 1990,1991a, and 1991b), I wish to propose two theories of Hemi-Sync namely, the State Enhancement Theory, and the Hemispheric Communication Theory.\nThe State Enhancement Theory\nOne important observation that we made in a number of Hemi-Sync studies was that subjects exposed to the same Hemi-Sync signals achieved bilateral synchronization at different frequencies. One explanation for this phenomenon is that Hemi-Sync goes beyond “blind” entrainment. That is to say, unlike other brain-entrainment modalities which force the brain to produce certain frequencies, Hemi-Sync actually collaborates with the brain to enhance its naturally dominant state.\nIn summary, according to this theory:\nWithin a relatively defined frequency range, Hemi-Sync guides the brain to enhance and synchronize itself at its own dominant and naturally occurring frequency and state.\nShould we be able to continue to support this theory with further research, we may conclude that Hemi-Sync is indeed a technology beyond entrainment and for that matter it is one of the safest modalities for health improvement and enhancement.\nThe Hemispheric Communication Theory\nA second Hemi-Sync theory in that of the Hemispheric Communication Theory. Based on studies observing the electrocortical activity of patients undergoing psychotherapy, it appears that moments of insight and “clarity” are preceded by moments of bilateral synchrony (see Sadigh, 1991b). This is an important observation since in psychotherapy insight denotes an integration of cognition (LEFT BRAIN) and affect (RIGHT BRAIN).\nIn summary, this theory may be stated as follows:\nCertain Hemi-Sync frequencies allow various unconscious ego-defense mechanisms to be transcended which will in turn facilitate communication between the two hemispheres. This therapeutic communication is likely to allow physical and psychological healing to follow.\nAgain further research is required to support and expand this theory. Should this theory withstand the text of time, it will provide us with a now way of understanding the human mind and how we may promote its healing.\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this paper was two-fold. First, a number of questions have been raised in the scientific community with regard to the effectiveness and the potentials of Hemi-Sync. I believe it is time for us to address some of these questions by reflecting on empirical data that has already been collected and analyzed. Secondly, two theories of Hemi-Sync were presented in this paper. In my view, based on these theories, it is imprudent to think of Hemi-Sync as a mere entrainment audio technology. It is a phenomenon worthy of thorough scientific research since it may provide us with many answers about the functioning of the human mind.\n\n\nAn adventure into the self: What is that? What would be the results of such a journey? How would it affect your life?\nThe Self is our core. It exists within us, and is more central to who we are than our personality, our appearance, our occupation, our health, or our relationships. The Self is more real than all of our achievements, all of our suffering, and all of the other things with which we identify and become consumed. It exists as a safe and solid place at the base of all that goes on in our lives.\nWhen we focus our awareness on the Self, this core of who we are, we discover our true nature, separate from and greater than anything and everything that we are manifesting externally in our lives. To discover the Self is to discover the haven that has always been there, even when we have been distracted with all of the events and activities of life. When we give our attention to that core, we are living our lives connected to our vital essence. When we experience the Self, personality issues lose their power, for we perceive our lives from the perspective that we are unconditionally acceptable, lovable, and perfect.\nWhat’s interesting is that our Self is perhaps the greatest resource we have or could imagine. It is closer than our next breath, yet we have become so culturally attuned to seeking resources outside of ourselves, that we often would not even consider an internal resource.\nWhen we are confused, scared, feeling lonely, thinking of ourselves as unsuccessful, wondering which way to turn, not sure of how to make a decision, or otherwise caught in our external world, we tend to seek out experts, someone else whom we may deem to know more about us than ourselves. We often count on therapists, doctors, educators, lawyers, and spiritual leaders to tell us the “truth,” the “right way” to create in our lives. While these resources can offer support, they cannot and should not replace the inner wisdom and knowing we each have. The Self can also better handle what we cannot handle with any one of a number of externally oriented solutions or addictions—TV and computers, substances (from chocolate to cocaine), shopping, being a workaholic, eating, etc. Unfortunately, each of these may take us further and further from the Self—not closer.\nSo how do we discover this illusive Self, this aspect of ourselves that is ever present and constantly supportive, but to which we may actually have no conscious relationship at all?\nThe answer lies in being willing to be who we are. The simplicity of it is absolutely stunning. While we all tend to get caught in the physical world–the world outside of our core–still, our greatest access to everything we can imagine lies inside of us, not outside.\nCan you imagine a world where everyone could first tap their inner resource and be more guided out of a sense of self-respect and inner knowing, before they turned to physical or material solutions? Can you imagine it being standard procedure for each person to attune to the Self to find a sense of balance and self-love before relating to other people? Wouldn’t that create an interesting culture!\nBut, admittedly, sometimes it is hard to find that core, that place of safety in the midst of any storm. How can you possibly find the quiet of the eye of the hurricane when you’re too busy battening down all the hatches and scurrying for safety?\nThe trick is to remember where the source actually is–inside. Then, it is simply a matter of attuning to that place. But HOW? It sounds so darn simple, and yet, it can remain frustratingly illusive!\nHere are some suggestions that will help you discover the Self and utilize the greatest resource you can imagine, which resides in your own being:\n1. Become the observer of your own system. Watch your thoughts, watch your emotions, watch your reactions to events and people in your life. Learn how to hold a little part of you apart from engaging, a part that is able to just see yourself objectively–not judge, but only notice. You might want to set aside a certain amount of time each day to practice this; soon it will become a habit.\n2. Remember your dreams and greatest aspirations. Connect to your own greatest visions of your magnificence. Imagine and visualize yourself in all of your fullness. See yourself fulfilled, doing what you most love, regardless of what anyone else might think or judge. Know that you are a unique expression of humanness on this planet. Honor and enjoy this about yourself.\n3. When hurts and pains find their way into your life, train yourself to do the opposite of your normal inclination, which is probably to try to avoid anything unpleasant. Instead, dive to the core of what you would resist. Allow yourself to feel completely that which you would avoid. Let yourself experience it and hear the message it has for you. Immerse in feeling of the pain rather than trying to avoid it–until it dissolves. People often think that avoiding something will make it go away, but generally the opposite is true: it becomes imbedded within us due to our resistance to it. The real way to make something go away is to give it our attention fully until it reaches resolution, which can happen very quickly.\n4. Take a little time each day to connect to the Self, to that internal source. A good way to do this is to watch your thoughts. Keep watching them for a while, and then start tracking them back to who is thinking those thoughts. Who is thinking these thoughts? Put your focus now, on the source of the thoughts, and you will find the Self. Interestingly enough, when your awareness is focusing on the thinker, it cannot also think! In this silence, you will experience who you really are: The Self. Why not try it right now?\nThere are number of Hemi-Sync® titles to help you achieve more self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-knowledge.",

      "description": "People sometimes ask, \"Why do you meditate?\"\nThey also ask, \"What do you do in meditation? Are you trying to empty your mind? What is the goal of meditation?\nSometimes people ask if meditation will help them with their challenges: stress, fear, doubt, grief, depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, low self-worth, a lack of confidence, a desire to love more, a longing to be loved more, relationships, work, career, finances, concentration, school.\nSome people also come to meditation because they have a spiritual yearning. They wonder if spiritual awakening is real. If so, what is awakening like, how does one realize awakening, and is awakening possible for us all?\nMany forces can draw us to meditation. Reason can compel us. Intuition can also draw us. For most of us, both the mind and the heart bring us to meditation. There is an intellectual knowing that meditation will help us. There is also an intuitive sense that meditation will help us.\nA great blessing of my life was that I was born into a culture of meditation, mindfulness, and personal growth. I learned different forms of meditation, different mindfulness techniques, and different modalities for personal growth. Through this process, I realized there were fundamental skills common to all approaches. This course will teach you these fundamental skills. It will also give you the knowledge necessary to direct your personal growth and transformation.\nThere are seven fundamental skills that you practice in meditation. These skills are what you \"do\" in meditation. As you gain proficiency with these skills, they become the outcomes you realize. These skills include balance, presence, focus, choice, relaxation, resting in stillness and silence, and doing nothing.\nMeditation allows us to cultivate more BALANCE\nbetween the mind and the heart\nbetween thinking and feeling\nbetween doing and being\nbetween controlling and allowing / accepting / loving / flowing\nBy gaining more balance between the mind and the heart, we live a more embodied life.\nMeditation also allows us to cultivate more PRESENCE so that we are more present in our life: for a conversation, for a cup of tea, for a business meeting, for a significant other, for our family. With more presence, we show up more fully for our own lives.\nMeditation also allows us to cultivate more FOCUS. With focus, we prioritize that which is important and spend time on it. Focus allows us to build a life that we value.\nMeditation also allows us to cultivate the power of CHOICE. The only place freedom is ever found is in choice. By cultivating the power of choice, we become more empowered, develop more self-efficacy, and have a stronger internal locus of control.\nMeditation also allows us to cultivate RELAXATION. Knowing how to calm our bodies, soothe ourselves, and be more relaxed helps us in all situations.\nMeditation also helps us cultivate the skill of RESTING IN STILLNESS AND SILENCE. So often, our best answers come when we are no longer trying to find them. We listen more deeply, and access the universe's unlimited creative potential, by resting in stillness and silence.\nMeditation helps us also to cultivate the skill of DOING NOTHING. This advanced skill allows us to discover our true nature.\nPeople sometimes ask me, \"What type of meditation should I learn? There are so many types of meditation: Vipassana meditation, Transcendental Meditation, mindfulness meditation, Zen meditation, and metta meditation, also known as loving-kindness meditation. Which form of meditation should I practice?\"\nRegardless of form, all true meditation practices have shared skills and outcomes. The methods might differ, but the skills and outcomes are the same. When you understand the fundamental skills of meditation, everything becomes clear. You will know what you are working to realize, regardless of the form. Ultimately, the technique doesn't matter. Many roads lead to the same destination. This course will teach you the skills common to all forms of meditation.\nHighlights of this course include:\nlearn and practice THE SEVEN SKILLS OF MEDITATION\nbalance\npresence\nfocus\nchoice\nrelaxation\nresting in stillness and silence\ndoing nothing\nrealize more connection with your feelings and your heart\ndiscover more enjoyment by having more presence in your life\nacquire clarity on that which helps you create a happy and fulfilling life\ntap into the power of relaxation to realize high-performance in all endeavors\novercome challenges by gaining a larger perspective of yourself and this existence\nheal trauma by discovering the abiding love of conscious awareness\nrealize how transformation and growth are possible for all of us\nlearn to transmute knowledge into knowing\ngain access to helpful resources\nnormalize the importance of receiving help and of helping\nunderstand the actions to take if you are in dire circumstances\nlearn to integrate the left and right hemispheres of the brain\ndiscover a technique used by Navy Seals to optimize brain performance\naccess and cultivate phrases that are helpful to personal growth and transformation\nlearn about Nelson Mandela's favorite poem and the importance of grit\nbecome more resilient so that you bounce back faster from life's challenges\ngain the ability to assess the efficacy of both teachers and teachings\nmore fully understand and access your sovereignty and authority\ndevelop healthy boundaries which will protect you and keep you safe\ndrop the victim mentality and engage more fully in building your best life\nbecome more responsible, accepting full accountability for your life\nlay the foundation for understanding and realizing spiritual awakening\ncultivate more patience, kindness, compassion, and love for yourself and others\nlearn to meditate using the world's most popular meditation technique\nunderstand how to physically sit in meditation using traditional meditation posture\ndiscover how different meditation gear can help you sit in meditation\nacquire insight into the difference between meditation and mindfulness\ndevelop the ability to be more mindful in all aspects of life\ngain the skills of diligence, persistence, effort, and grit\nunderstand the importance of devotion and practice\nlearn the skills necessary to grow and transform\ncultivate a warrior spirit within yourself\ndiscover your life's purpose\nrealize more happiness\nDescribed as “fun,” “entertaining,\" and “delightful,” this course will teach you how to meditate and practice mindfulness.

Hypnosis is a very powerful tool that teaches you to communicate with the subconscious mind by bypassing the analytic conscious mind. However, after working with others for many years I discovered that everyone does not learn the same way or at the same rate. The same techniques do not necessarily work for everyone. I was determined to create a program that was more than just hypnosis that would work for anyone and achieve the desired results.\nAs I am trained in what many alternative health experts believe are some of the most effective self-help approaches to alternative health, I decided to combine these programs into a single power-packed approach.\nBy combining\n- self-hypnosis with the powerful NLP techniques\n– EFT or tapping as it deals with the emotional issues\n--Mindfulness-it keeps us focused in the here and now\n--Reiki because it can help the body emotionally heal by working with this “vast energy stores” in our bodies,\n--Combined with meditation,\nand combined with more than 40 years of experience of helping others leave their addictions, I have created the multi-method program for leaving addictions or unwanted habits behind.",

The whole universe exists within the conscious mind space of the creator, and it is all in your mind.\nour universe is not a physical universe, it expands infinitely - from a place of void or emptiness into a pattern.\nOur inner world has the potential to reach infinity to that place in consciousness where no pattern exists, so we can experience the oneness of the universe in a complete and whole present.\nWe are just going through a journey in consciousness and experiencing conscious movements of divinity.\nThe text and the story in the book of Torah is here to guide us and teach us about this journey and about the forces that exist within our consciousness, it is a mathematical code that once unfold and become visible you see all the cards, know the name of the game and understand the rules of this reality.\n\n\nBlessed you are.",

You will grow your awareness, stabilize your emotions, learn how to feel, and open the portal for the love to flow.\n\n\nSelf-love is easier said than done. It takes not only affirmations e.g. “I love you” but daily actions to prove it to yourself. By using meditation & our innovative therapeutic healing method, we build a solid foundation for ourselves. We take action to build self-trust, self-respect, and self-love.\n\n\nRelease anger\nTo love ourselves, we need to first let go of any residue of anger in our psyche. Most suppressed anger is unconscious. You may not even be aware you have anger inside especially if you are programmed to be a people pleaser. When we let our anger go, self-forgiveness and love come naturally as the by-product.\n\n\nCutting-Cord\nHaving toxic ties with people and circumstances that no longer serve your life is unhealthy. This is not an act of self-love but self-abuse. It is sometimes hard to let go when the relationship is co-dependent. We love ourselves enough to draw healthy boundary-cutting ties physically and energetically\n\n\nFeely our emotions\nWhen we love ourselves, we embrace our emotions no matter if it is a good feeling or bad feeling. We want to listen to ourselves, and nurture our emotions like a baby that needs to be hugged. That is all we need for the ultimate road to self-acceptance and self-love\n\n\nIn this course, we will\nbe your personal mediation coach\ngentle therapeutic way to love ourselves effortlessly\nbuild a solid foundation in different aspects of life\nrelax and calm our bodies\nlearn to trust & respect yourself\nfeel your body & stabilise your emotions\ncut all toxic relationships & ties\nlearn to release anger, resentment & frustrations\nand much more..",

      "description": "This Kundalini Awakening course is for everyone who wants to learn about the mysterious phenomenon of kundalini and use it to reach the pinnacle of human development - enlightenment. The Kundalini Awakening is also for those who are going through an involuntary awakening and seeking help to alleviate their symptoms and make the best of this event.\nKundalini is a power that identifies the springing up of power and focus, which has been coiled at the base of the spine because of the start and is the source of the lifestyle pressure (pranic energy, chi, bio-strength) . Yogic science shows that this energy caused the formation of the kid within the womb and then coils three ½ instances at the bottom of the backbone to preserve the strong discipline in stasis till we die when it uncoils and returns to its supply.\nWith the help of the Kundalini, we can open us and experience the life around us more directly and in a process of identification. The Kundalini teaches us to see the beauty, but our dark sides as well – and to accept them. It teaches, urges, forces us to correct them. It brings light into the twilight of our soul. In this light it is possible to come closer to the divine principle. With every step that we take, the divine cosmic consciousness comes three steps closer to us. If we are ready, we can also sense the proximity of the divine, even perceive it – as the goddess in appearance of our Shakti or as a male spiritual guide. Kundalini teaches in different ways\nKundalini Energy!\nWhen we awaken her infinite Shakti power for the first time, we receive a spiritually enlightening experience that can last for days. We then realize who we are something much bigger than before. We see we are this energy, enthusiasm, inspiration and begin to realize we are responsible for the divine creation of our life exactly the way it is. Kundalini is the supreme cosmic enlightening energy that resides inside us, deep at the core of our being. Kundalini is the most powerful force in the Universe, and brings enlightenment to our world. Your Kundalini awakens the manifesting being in your life! Anything you wish to manifest is possible with an awakened Kundalini. The Kundalini goes against the force of gravity. It rises on its own, like fire. It purifies, consumes and cleanses all that is useless (ideas, desires, feelings that take us away from spirituality). It doesn’t absorb imperfections—it removes them. This is why we sometimes feel heat.\nWhat Is Kundalini Awakening Energy?\nKundalini is an еnеrgу, whiсh iѕ tied tо thе соnѕсiоuѕnеѕѕ. Coiled within thе bоdу, it rеmаinѕ dormant in the sleeping bоdу. Thiѕ рѕусhо-ѕрirituаl force iѕ аwаkеnеd through vаriоuѕ ѕрirituаl рrасtiсеѕ, оftеn tiеd to уоgа. Kundаlini iѕ tied tо thе сhаkrаѕ, residing in the rооt сhаkrа. Oftеn related tо a ѕеrреnt, it will rise up frоm the bаѕе оf thе ѕрinе whеn аwаkеnеd. Aѕ thе Kundalini riѕеѕ, it will pass thrоugh each chakra or energy сеntеr, сrеаting a high-energy fоrсе throughout thе еntirе body. Kundalini Yoga iѕ the mоѕt common рrасtiсе in which tо аwаkеn the power. Althоugh much оf thе hiѕtоrу оf Kundаlini аѕѕосiаtеd practices iѕ unknоwn, thеrе is ѕоmе еvidеnсе that mеntiоn hаѕ bееn mаdе of thе еnеrgу fоrсе in many аnсiеnt tеxtѕ. Found in writingѕ frоm the Tibеtаnѕ, Chinеѕе, Egyptians, and Native Amеriсаnѕ, there iѕ аlѕо rеfеrеnсе tо this tуре оf роwеr in the Biblе and the Qurаn.\nWhat you will Learn from this Kundalini Course?\n· What Is Kundalini Awakening Energy?\n· Kundalini Awakening Benefits\n· Kundalini Awakening Symptoms\n· Kundalini Awakening Mantra\n· Kundalini Yoga Asanas & Mudras\n· Kundalini Awakening Technique Step By Step\n· Chakra Kundalini Meditation\n· How To Know If Kundalini Is Awake\n· Pranayama Kundalini Yoga Breathing Techniques\n· Preparation for Kundalini Activation\n· What Happens When Kundalini Is Awakened\n· Chakras & the Kundalini\n· Benefits to Awakening Kundalini\n· Signs of Kundalini Awakening\n· Kundalini Awakening Techniques\n· Troubleshooting Your Awakening\n· How To Do Kundalini meditation\n\n\nThough Kundalini awakening is the greatest prize on the spiritual quest, the blessed soul receiving this grace is on its way to the realization of the highest, the awakening and its attendant process of renewal is not without peril. When the dormant or potential aspect of the Kundalini arises, Her single intent is the transformation of individual consciousness with its vehicles - mind and body - into fully expanded Consciousness of the Divine. That process of transformation and purification is marked by both beatific sublime experiences of the Divine, as well as by dark nights of the soul, by physical, emotional and mental states of ecstasy as well as periods of purgation and distress\nKundalini and Chakras\nA chakra is thought to be an energy node in the human body. The word comes from the Sanskrit chakra meaning “wheel, circle”, and sometimes also referring to the “wheel of life”. The seven main chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the spine to the top of the head. Each chakra is associated with a certain color, multiple specific functions, an aspect of consciousness, a classical element, and other distinguishing characteristics. The chakras are thought to vitalize the physical body and to be associated with interactions of both a physical and mental nature. They are considered loci of life energy, or prana, which is thought to flow among them along pathways called nadis. Traditional Chinese medicine also relies on a similar model of the human body as an energy system.\nActivated Kundаlini energy riѕеѕ uр thе ѕрinаl соlumn (Kundalini Rising) аnd 'асtivаtеѕ' аll chakras in it'ѕ path, eventually lеаding tо Kundаlini Awakening. Chakras аrе еnеrgу 'whееlѕ' thаt еithеr spin left or ѕрin right. There аrе ѕеvеn mаin chakras that hаvе vаriоuѕ roles in thе mаintеnаnсе our health аnd wellness.\nBriеflу, thе ѕеvеn chakras аrе:\n• Sаhаѕrаrа / Thе Crоwn Chаkrа.\n• Ajnа / Thе Brоw Chаkrа.\n• Viѕhuddhа / The Thrоаt Chakra.\n• Anаhаtа / The Hеаrt Chаkrа.\n• Mаniрurа / Thе Sоlаr Plеxuѕ Chakra.\n• Swаdhiѕthаnа / The Sacral Chakra.\n• Mulаdhаrа / The Rооt Chаkrа.\nChakras are аlwауѕ ѕрinning, рrосеѕѕing еnеrgу, аnd асtivе. Whеn they are 'аwаkеnеd' by the Kundalini force, thеir рrореrtiеѕ ѕurgе аnd begin operating at еlеvаtеd lеvеlѕ. Activating сhаkrаѕ can tаkе dауѕ, months оr years оf рrасtiсе, оr can еvеn happen spontaneously, knоwn аѕ Sроntаnеоuѕ Kundalini. The Kundalini nourishes any of our chakras that are out of balance and corrects them. When the chakras are clear enough for the Kundalini to rise without obstacles, we can feel the peace and enjoy thoughtless awareness. The Kundalini can be understood as consisting of many strands of energy. The more we meditate, the more strands rise, and the stronger our central channel becomes. This helps us to live more in the present.\nWhat are the benefits оf Kundаlini awakening?\nThе benefits are еxреriеnсеd оn рhуѕiсаl аnd spiritual level and саn lеаd to реrfесt hеаlth, slower аging, аnd increased sexual роwеr. Grеаtеr ѕеnѕuаlitу, аffесtiоn, аnd kindnеѕѕ are also a dirесt result оf the аwаkеning, аѕ wеll as thе асhiеvеmеnt of fаmе and thе accumulation оf wеаlth. Thе nеw and purified mind саn аlѕо lеаd to achieving ѕuссеѕѕеѕ in ѕсiеntifiс аrеаѕ аnd bring upon intellectual роwеr аnd academic асhiеvеmеntѕ.\nWHAT happens when YOUR KUNDALINI AWAKENS?\nIf Kundalini is awoken, the energy is stated to rise from the bottom of the backbone from the root chakra, which within the parable has been called the base of the mountain. The energy ascends to the height, which correlates with the crown chakra and the pineal gland.\nKundаlini cleanses thе ѕоul, thе mind and thе рhуѕiсаl body and it iѕ normal to experience some ѕоrt оf рѕусhоlоgiсаl diѕturbаnсе аnd роѕѕiblу physical disturbance. But уоu muѕt аllоw Kundalini tо do what it hаѕ tо dо, ѕurrеndеr tо it, dо not рut uр rеѕiѕtаnсе аѕ thiѕ will оnlу mаkе thе experience mоrе unсоmfоrtаblе and trаumаtiс. Dо not be аfrаid оf it, welcome аnd nurture it, аnd the process will unfоld in a much mоrе hаrmоniоuѕ way.\nThеrе аrе certain methods аnd techniques whiсh you саn uѕе yourself tо аwаkеn Kundаlini, including сеrtаin tуреѕ оf mеditаtiоn аnd brеаthing tесhniԛuеѕ. If you сhооѕе to try аnd аwаkеn it уоurѕеlf thеn уоu ѕhоuld рrераrе уоur mind аnd bоdу fоr whаt iѕ in store, аttеmрt tо сlеаr аѕ mаnу toxins from thе bоdу аѕ роѕѕiblе, eat well, and аvоid аlсоhоl and recreational drugs аѕ these can аll hаmреr thе рrосеѕѕ and саn lеаd tо рrоblеmѕ. Kеер active, уоu must find ways оf releasing еxсеѕѕ energy otherwise it will become stagnant аnd could cause рrоblеmѕ. A good way to соmbinе physical activity with thе process iѕ thrоugh Kundаlini Yoga which wаѕ ѕресifiсаllу created tо аwаkеn Kundаlini аnd iѕ reported tо bе оnе of the еаrliеѕt fоrmѕ of yoga.\nIf wе gо through thiѕ process with lоvе,соmраѕѕiоn and fоrgivеnеѕѕ in оur hеаrtѕ and embrace thе process fullу thеn it is truly thе ultimаtе gоаl in оur ѕрirituаl dеvеlорmеnt, thе truе path to Enlightenment аnd аn еvоlutiоn of соnѕсiоuѕnеѕѕ.\nWhat is Kundalini Yoga?\nKundalini yoga is considered the mother of all yoga, as it incorporates various techniques, such as body poses, breathing techniques, meditation, and chanting. It is the complete yoga for the mind and body and offers numerous benefits. The general motivation behind Kundalini yoga is to raise the vitality of the individual and interface it with the widespread vitality. Kundalini yoga practice joins breathing activities, physical postures, hand positions, sound and contemplation.

Beautiful footage and incredible in-depth teaching, filmed recently in the redwood forest of Northern California.\nTai chi chuan is a kind of moving meditation with ancient roots in Chinese martial arts. Beyond the bare-hand tai chi form awaits the elegant and highly effective tai chi sword, which has long been considered the highest achievement in tai chi training. The flowing and powerful tai chi sword form will strengthen your body, sharpen your mind, and raise your spirit.\nThis Yang-style tai chi sword is taught step by step by Master Yang, Jwing-Ming, and shown with front and rear views. The exact technique and true purpose of each movement is taught with clarity and precision. Your development of Qi (energy) will increase, improving your health and immunity and sharpening your mind.\nYou will learn:\nthe complete 54-posture tai chi sword form\ntai chi sword qigong\nseldom-taught sword applications\n15 video lessons / 120 minutes / 2 hours 2 minutes\n\n\n“The ultimate or final goal of tai chi sword training is to gain a deep understanding of yourself in order to lead a more enlightened life.”\n—Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming\nFeatures YMAA President Nicholas Yang. Dr. Yang's tai chi can be traced back to the Yang family through Grandmaster Kao, Tao (高濤) and his teacher Yue, Huanzhi (樂奐之), an indoor disciple of Yang, Chengfu (楊澄甫).\nThere are no references to sword in the Taijiquan Classics or Yang Ban-hou’s family documents, the two most important manuscripts in the Yang-style tradition. The Daoist priests and monks of Wudang mountain specialized in the art of swordsmanship, and this is considered the root of Tai Chi Sword. Daoism is a philosophy of peace and following the way of nature. In the violent early days of Chinese history, the Daoists came to rely on straight sword for self-defence. Eventually, sword was considered the Daoists’ weapon, as staff is considered to be the weapon of Shaolin (Buddhist) monks. The ancient Chinese internal martial arts date back to 550AD and focus on first developing the practitioner's internal Qi and then circulating abundant energy to enliven every movement, with the ultimate goal of leading the Qi beyond the tip of the sword.\nIt is recommended that a practitioner have some experience with a Tai Chi barehand form before exploring the art of the sword, which is considered the highest achievement in Chinese martial arts. It is said \"100 days of barehand, 1,000 days of staff, 10,000 days of sword.\"",

      "description": "\"I feel so much more focused and relaxed. I love how this is based on movements of the body, not on just focusing the mind. I’ve done Sarah's whole Movement Meditation course, and I’ve noticed that my sleep is better, so I can focus better on my work in the daytime. Very different and very cool!\"    -Mila Popovic Geoui, BSc., MBA\nWelcome to Movement Meditation with Sarah! I’m Sarah Templeton, and my aim is to cheer you up and calm you down. This course contains 10-minute movement lessons that can help you to calm your nervous system, regain your focus, and bring more optimism to your thought patterns. The lessons are based on my work, over the past 25 years, both studying and teaching the Feldenkrais® Method, Voice and Speech, and Laughter Yoga.\nHow are these mini-lessons different from many meditation and yoga practices?\nThey are different in three main ways:\n1) These lessons use small, gentle movements of the body to calm your nervous system, helping you to create new habits of moving with a calmer quality. People then report a calmer mind, as a result of the pleasant quality of moving.\n2) In these lessons, we don’t stretch the muscles, like in some yoga practices. We find new options for movement that feel agreeable, smooth, and easy, so that you want to repeat the quality later, in your everyday life.\n3) I use humour and a sense of light-heartedness throughout the lessons, honouring the fact that that is how learning occurs best.\nEach lesson is different, and, once you get to know the lessons, you’ll be able to choose what you want or need, in the moment. Maybe you’ll need to relax your jaw, or rest your eyes, or regain your focus, or find more comfort sitting at your desk, maybe feel more grounded, deepen your breath, or even just have a laugh!\nYou can do many of these lessons in a chair, but for some of them, you can lie down on the floor, on a rug or a yoga mat. If you’re in a chair, it’s best if it’s fairly flat and firm. But, it you feel like sitting on the edge of your bed, or in your office chair, or lying in bed, that’s all fine, too.\nTry all of the lessons once each, and then pick and choose what you feel like you need, on any given day.\n\n\nThere are so many reasons you might do the lessons in Movement Meditation with Sarah!\nHere are some of them:\n· You need 10-minute breaks from your work, that calm your body and mind\n· You want to try body-based meditations that use small, gentle movements to calm the nervous system. Calmer movements lead to a calmer mind. I NEVER ask you to calm your mind.\n· You don't like being told to RELAX in guided meditations.\n· You are a musician or music lover who cannot ignore the background music that exists in most guided meditations.\n· You want to calm yourself down with a teacher who uses a sense of light-heartedness. I have discovered that this is how learning happens best.\n· You are a teenager (or adult) who wants to improve your focus, or de-stress, or wind down before sleep, in a way that is body-based, which gives you something concrete to focus on (not just being told to calm your thoughts, which is very difficult for some people).\n· You are familiar with Feldenkrais® lessons, and want potent, 10-minute lessons that will help you really refine some ‘classic’ moments from some of Sarah's favourite Awareness Through Movement® lessons\n· You want to do something relaxing for your body that does not involve stretching. These lessons help you find a quality of moving that feels agreeable. Therefore you will want to keep doing things with that quality in your everyday life.\n· You want to be able to quickly choose the lesson that you need that day; they serve different purposes, including relaxing your jaw, resting your eyes, regaining your focus, finding more comfort sitting at your desk, feeling more grounded, deepening your breath, and even just having a laugh!\n· You are elderly, and want a gentle movement practice.\n· You are a singer or actor who wants to relax your jaw, feel more grounded, or improve your breathing.\n\n\nMany of the lessons in Movement Meditation with Sarah are based on Sarah’s work with singers. Here are some testimonials of Sarah’s Feldenkrais® for Singers course, which contains 45-60 minute lessons:\n\"After each lesson I just feel so aware but calm. I feel like this is what people mean when they talk about the benefits of meditation but I’ve never been able to keep focused on meditation. This is what I assume meditation is like for normal people! Not only was this non-judgemental and soothing, the main point is not just to be aware of yourself, but to have fun. And I had so much fun. It was such a joy and delight to be able to experience these lessons, and I’m very grateful for them… Sarah has the most soothing and nonjudgmental voice I’ve heard in a long time. Even when I wasn’t at my best mentally or physically, there weren’t any lessons that I couldn’t do or modify to my ability. Sarah has such a soothing voice and periodically reminds you not to overdo it, which is such a beautiful change from most classes where straining or struggle is expected for you to overcome. I found myself gaining more benefit than I would normally just because I wasn’t stressed about what I couldn’t do or felt like I wasn’t doing well enough. I felt *safe* and well taken care of. I appreciate that more than I can begin to express.\"\n-Brittony LeFever, B.A.H.\n\n\n“I sensed an increase in my body awareness, easing of tensions, and found a greater sense of balance within my own body. At the end of each session, I felt greater freedom of movement within my own body as well as a more mindful and calm attitude.”\n-Danielle Cyr, M.Mus.\n\n\n“Sarah's gentle kindness and enthusiasm kept me wanting more! I was always surprised at how quickly the time passed in our lessons! The session flew by in the blink of an eye.\nI felt much more balanced after the lesson. Paradoxically, by learning to let go and let be, I felt more powerful. It's a wonderful feeling!\nI feel like I've let go of tension I've been holding for a surprisingly long time. My shoulder, which has been hurting for so long, is suddenly much less painful, and much more mobile. I'm so grateful for that!! Because we are turning our curious attention towards how and why our bodies are behaving in a certain way, it seems we are able to get much longer lasting benefits from the adjustments that Sarah guides us through.\"\nChris Mayell, M. Mus.\n\n\nAnd finally, a note from Sarah about demonstrating movements:\nYou’ll notice that the lessons in the course are mostly audio, meaning you are just hearing my voice, and not seeing me, and there’s a simple image showing on your screen. This is deliberate. You see, in live classes, Feldenkrais® teachers usually don’t demonstrate things. I find, when I don’t demonstrate the movements, students are able to focus on themselves and their own process with the lesson. And their learning is better, and lasts longer. And besides, my version of the movement is just one option; it’s not the ‘ultimate’ version of it. But, just in case you are confused about the main movement of the lesson, I have demonstrated each one at the beginning of the lessons.  And, please ask questions about any of the lesson content in the Q and A's of each lesson!\n\n\nPlease note: These lessons are very gentle, but, please consult with your doctor before beginning any new physical activity. Sarah Templeton will not be held liable for any injury or loss sustained during, or as a result of, these lessons.",

About\nIn this course I am presenting the learnings and insights of my 20-year-long journey with breathwork and spirituality.

I owe so much in my life to these precious practices and my mission with this project is to share these gems with many more people so we can all experience the profound impacts of an awakened breath. Many of these practices are very simple yet they can have very powerful effects. They have survived over millennia and are now being re-discovered for their potential to help us navigate the challenges of modern life that we face as individuals and as mankind on this planet. I feel excited and honored to be a part of sharing these practices and I know that they will give each one of YOU exactly what you need.\n\n\n6.

      "description": "The Gateway Experience® In-Home Training Series is dedicated to developing, exploring and applying expanded and altered states of awareness. This popular series was developed directly from the world famous Gateway Voyage®. Beginning with Discovery, there are six “albums” called “Waves of Change.” Each Wave (3 CDs, 6 exercises) contains special Hemi-Sync® exercises designed to gently lead the listener into profound states of altered consciousness. While in such states, one has available a broader range of perceptions with which to solve problems, develop creativity or obtain guidance.\n\n\nIn addition to achieving altered states of consciousness in which perception comes into another reality, are these special recordings designed for training conditions favorable to leave the physical body, and thus the possibility realize astral travel and out of body experiences. English is a out-of-body state termed as OBE, sometimes OOBE - Out of Body Experience.\nExtracorporeal experience maybe come maybe not. You may enjoy experiences outside the physical body, maybe not. Out of Body experiences can not be guaranteed. Your ability to feel extracorporeal experiences may depend on many factors that are unique to each individual. But the Gateway Experience® is designed to make you gently introduced into deep states of expanded consciousness and contribute to the development of your human potential on many levels and perhaps even come Out of body Experience.\n\n\nEach album is progressive in nature, building on the tools and techniques from the previous albums. Therefore, the albums must be used sequentially. The Gateway Experience Guidance Manuals, included with each Wave, prepare you for these exercises which help you to know and better understand your Inner Self so you might enjoy a more fulfilling life.\nThe Gateway Experience® albums contain verbal guidance in English! Similarly, also enclosed instructions for exercises are in English!\n\n\nYou probably already know that meditation has been clinically shown to help relieve anxiety, aid sleep, increase concentration, reduce depression and provide numerous therapeutic benefits. The wealth of independent clinical research on the effects of meditation, not to mention the amount of attention it gets in media and from wellness gurus like Gwyneth Paltrow and Amanda Chantal Bacon, make a pretty convincing argument for why it will probably help with issues you’re dealing with (and improve your overall quality of life).\nDon’t Be Scared\nEven knowing all this, meditating can seem as intimidating as levitating if you don’t know where to start. Chances are, if you’re dealing with the stress of juggling work, a social life, and a million other worries, you don’t have the time to sit cross-legged in silence while you try to figure it out. If you’re a chronic multi-tasker with a diagnosis of A.D.D., like me, the idea of sitting still for that long is anxiety-inducing in itself. If bingeing on Netflix with a bottle of Pinot isn’t giving you the relief you need in the moment, or the long-term balance you seek, it’s probably worth investigating your alternatives.\nThe Sounds of Silence\nBefore I started meditating, I resented hearing it discussed in pop culture as a panacea for everything – it’s not that I didn’t believe it would help me, it just seemed remote and inaccessible. What I didn’t know was that I didn’t have to drastically change my lifestyle and have a formal meditation practice to experience the short- and long-term benefits of meditation. All I had to do was listen.\nHearing is Believing\nMy introduction to meditation was through sound. I had agreed to try a few mindfulness exercises with my therapist, though I was skeptical that it would take. I started with trying to hear and distinguish all of the layers of sound I could hear at any given moment – while walking, in waiting rooms, wherever. I’m no scientist – I can’t explain to you how or why this technique was so effective in familiarizing and making me comfortable with the basics of meditation; all I can tell you is that I, too, have joined the ranks of those annoying people who tout meditation as a cure-all. I got into Hemi-Sync® because sound has always worked as an anchor for me, and now I feel like it is fully integrated into my routine. I can put on a pair of headphones while doing dishes or opening emails, listen to binaural beats, and experience a feeling of serenity and balance that I once doubted was possible.\n\n\n\nWe wish to dedicate this paper to Robert A. Monroe: a man whose love and compassion for humanity have forever changed and expanded the definition of human consciousness.\nIntroduction\nBilateral hemispheric synchronization is a phenomenon which has been attracting the attention of researchers and clinicians for sometime. It has been approximately thirty years since a number of studies showed that adept meditators tended to bring about a state of phasic hemispheric synchrony while in deep meditation (see Carrington, 1977). In a classic and often cited study, Banquet (1973) demonstrated that advanced TM meditators could indeed achieve total brain synchrony after minutes of repeating a mantra. However, even in adept meditators the dominant brain-wave frequency in which the state of synchrony takes place is almost impossible to predict and/or control.\nBanquet (1973) suggested that during meditation a greater equalization of the functioning of the hemispheres tends to take place. This relative shift in hemispheric dominance (from left-brain dominance to whole-brain dominance) may result in therapeutic effects which are likely to enhance mind-body integration and overall improvements in physical and emotional health. Because of a reduction in cognitive activities during moments of whole brain synchrony, it is believed that negative thinking, self-punitive thoughts and excessive worrying are apt to slow down and consequently a reduction in cognitive anxiety is experienced (Carrington, 1977; Sadigh,1991; Schwartz, Davidson, & Goleman, 1978).\nDelmonte (1984) suggested that creative intelligence requires the synthesis and collaboration of both the analytic and the spatial/intuitive halves of the brain. Again, it appears that this left-brain-right-brain synthesis can be achieved almost at will by adept meditators, especially those who practice TM.\nGreen and Green (1989) believed that long term biofeedback and relaxation training resulted in a harmonious relationship between the two hemispheres which facilitated control of the autonomic nervous system. This control can especially be helpful in the treatment of a variety of stress related and psychosomatic disorders. The authors also suggested that such states of bilateral synchrony may indeed bring about positive changes in psychophysical health as well as therapeutic alterations in underlying personality characteristics which may interfere with healthy growth and development.\nOrnstein and Thompson (1984) criticized the Western emphasis on intelligence in terms of written or spoken word. They believed that perhaps the reason we have difficulties expanding our standards of education is because of this overemphasis on the potentials and abilities of the analytic/verbal brain. Studies investigating whole-brain synthesis clearly suggest that human knowledge, intelligence, and well being may very well be achieved as the two brains begin to function as one–in unison and in synchrony. Table 1 summarizes some of the documented characteristics of the two hemispheres.\n\n\n\n“We all are so deeply interconnected; we have no option but to love all. Be kind and do good for any one and that will be reflected. The ripples of the kind heart are the highest blessings of the Universe.”\n—Amit Ray, Yoga and Vipassana: An Integrated Life Style\nMatters of the heart are often thought of in terms of romantic liaisons, especially during the valentine month of February. But there is an ideal, pure love that knows no boundaries, has no expectations, and is extended to all beings, including ourselves. This is known as loving-kindness.\nLoving-kindness is an unconditional love; inclusive, tender and wise. The concept stems from the Buddhist tradition, but can be cultivated by anyone who wishes to experience deeper levels of compassion and genuine, heartfelt goodwill toward other living things.\nLoving-kindness begins with ourselves…breaking away from any negative feelings we may harbor about ourselves, letting go of the negative stories we tell ourselves, and participating fully in what it means to be human. Cultivating true tenderness and concern for ourselves is the first step in truly opening our hearts to others.\nWe hope you will experience and extend loving-kindness for yourself and others, to help make the world a more compassionate place in which to live our earthbound lives.",

In this course I show you why meditation is precisely the study that you want to begin with when approaching the spiritual paths for the first time.\nSimilar to Vipissana, this observation-based journey of self-exploration focuses attention first on self-inquiry and the sensations created by the mind-body connection. But more than that, in the tradition of the Himalayan Yogin, I'm going to show you from the start how to dive deep into your being and discover yourself, immediately allowing you to unlock hidden potential and reveal unimaginable clarity. Meanwhile you will find your health improving and your stress reduced. The keys to relaxation and calm introspection will be given to you and channels of communication between your conscious and sub-conscious mind will open to provide inspiration and intuitive knowledge to aid you in your journey to full self-realization.\nThis training represents only the first three of seven stages in Step 1 of the Seven Steps to Samadhi, but even if Samadhi isn't your goal - and let's be honest, not everyone is looking for that - each Step and Stage has been designed to stand alone, immediately empowering and enabling you to achieve your own self-determined goals along your chosen path of mastery. Meditation will always be central to the goal and that's why I've brought it up front and center in the beginning. Learn this one and all the rest fall smoothly into place!",

      "description": "Welcome to the world of Mindfulness!!\n\n\nBuddhist meditation is the practice of meditation in Buddhism. The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are bhāvanā (\"mental development\") and jhāna/dhyāna (mental training resulting in a calm and luminous mind). Buddhists pursue meditation as part of the path toward liberation, awakening and Nirvana and includes a variety of meditation techniques, most notably asubha bhavana (\"reflections on repulsiveness\"); reflection on pratityasamutpada (dependent origination); sati (mindfulness) and anussati (recollections), including anapanasati (breath meditation); dhyana (developing an alert and luminous mind); and the Brahma-viharas (loving-kindness and compassion). These techniques aim to develop equanimity and sati (mindfulness); samadhi (concentration) c.q. samatha (tranquility) and vipassanā (insight); and are also said to lead to abhijñā (supramundane powers). These meditation techniques are preceded by and combined with practices which aid this development, such as moral restraint and right effort to develop wholesome states of mind.\n\n\nVipassana Meditation\nVipassana is one of India's most ancient meditation techniques. Long lost to humanity, it was rediscovered by Gautama the Buddha more than 2500 years ago. The word Vipassana means seeing things as they really are. It is the process of self- purification by self-observation. One begins by observing the natural breath to concentrate the mind. With a sharpened awareness one proceeds to observe the changing nature of body and mind and experiences the universal truths of impermanence, suffering and ego-less-ness. This truth-realization by direct experience is the process of purification. The entire path (Dhamma) is a universal remedy for universal problems and has nothing to do with any organized religion or sectarianism. For this reason, it can be freely practiced by everyone, at any time, in any place, without conflict due to race, community or religion, and will prove equally beneficial to one and all.\nBenefits\nIncreased awareness\nRemaining equanimous\nImpermanence\nDetox from life\nHappiness\nLearning to Fail\nCalmer\nBroader perspective\nImproved efficiency with time\nImproved mobility\n\n\nAdnapana Sati Dhayn Yoga\nAnapana is the first step in the practice of Vipassana meditation. Anapana means observation of natural, normal respiration, as it comes in and as it goes out. It is an easy to learn, objective and scientific technique that helps develop concentration of the mind. Observation of the breath is the ideal object for meditation because it is always available and it is completely non-sectarian. Anapana is very different from techniques that are based on the artificial regulation of breath. There are no rites or rituals involved in the practice or presentation of Anapana. Anapana provides a tool to deal with the fears, anxieties and pressures across all age groups. Besides helping to calm and concentrate the mind, Anapana help people to understand themselves better and gives them an insight into the workings of their own minds. Because of its simplicity, the technique is easy to understand and practice.\nBenefits\nEffective tool to deal with fear, anxiety, stress, tension, nervousness\nIncreased concentration of mind\nImproved awareness and alertness of the mind\nMemory becomes sharp\nDecision-making power improves\nIncreased self-confidence\nIncreased capacity to work\nBetter ability to understand and express oneself\nMastery over the mind\nMind becomes healthy, wholesome and strong\nOne becomes full of good wishes for others\n\n\nBody Scan Meditation\nBefore beginning a meditation session its necessary to bring yourself or call yourself into the present moment, which can be done very effectively by body scan meditation. This meditation is meant to aware your mind and senses about your each and every body part and how they feel and react to your emotions at present. You are not supposed to try and move any body part or create pressure there it's just about taking all of your consciousness at one body part at a time and to observe how to body part feels both as an individual entity and part of body as a whole. To experience mindfulness and give attention to physical body place your awareness on each part of body as the meditation progress.\nBenefits\nImproved sleep\nAnxiety and stress relief\nGreater self-awareness\nIncreased self-compassion\nReduced pain\nअप्प दीपो भव: (BE THE LIGHT OF YOUR OWN LAMP) - BUDDHA",

      "description": "Based on the ancient Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, this course teaches you about the Eight Limbs of practice required to rid the mind and body of agitation and to settle into a state of elevated consciousness free from suffering.\nWe use the mantra \"Still the Mind and Feel the Force.\"\nThis is not an exercise in theory - you will learn to meditate.\nWe keep it as practical and comprehensible as possible.\nThe course is designed for people who are looking for a way to calm an excited or busy head or to deal with nagging questions about the best way to live in a complicated world.\nIt helps with:\n* Anxiety\n* Addictions\n* Anger Management\n* Concentration\n* Creativity\n* Intuition\n* Finding Meaning and Purpose in Life\nThe Ancients believed that our suffering was the result of a failure to appreciate that we are not in truth separated individuals battling for resources in a cruel world ending in a painful death but that we are all connected through a common unified field of energy - The Force. This discovery leads us to conclude that compassion and refinement of the intellect are the way to make progress.\n\nThis mystical revelation or Enlightenment is open to all and is the end point of our evolution. It is given many names because it is beyond normal comprehension. We simplify everything and make it accessible through the use of metaphor and analogy.\nWe look at each of the Eight Limbs in turn, laying emphasis in the same way as Patanjali, on the rules of living and the art of mental focus and concentration rather than on the already well covered yoga postures.\nThe course suggests a numbers of seeds for meditation and urges you to experiment and discover what works best for you. We have also done our best to soften the any religious interpretation instead focusing on the spiritual aspects of meditation but supported by scientific speculation as well.\n\nHaving been a person with a head like a washing machine I know your pain. A lifetime of meditation practice gives me the opportunity to teach you how to steady everything down to live well and happily.\n\nYou have nothing to lose and everything to gain by starting your journey into meditation.\n\n\nEnrol NOW.",

This comprehensive course delves into the mystical world of ascending through the elements from gross to sublte, guiding you through a journey of self-discovery and inner alchemy.\n\n\nCourse Highlights:\n\n\n1. Master the Tattwas (Five Elements): Dive deep into the five essential elements that shape the universe—Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether. Understand their significance in both the macrocosm and microcosm and how to dissolve them back into their source of Cosmic Energy (Shakti) and Pure Consciousness (Shiva).\n\n\n2. Balancing and Purification: Learn powerful techniques to balance the five elements within you. Through visualization, bija mantra chanting, and meditation, discover how to cleanse and harmonize these elements, promoting physical, mental, and spiritual equilibrium.\n\n\n3. Amplify Your Spiritual Power: Uncover how Tattwa Shuddhi can amplify your spiritual potential. By aligning with the elemental forces, you'll awaken dormant energies and transcend the ego-mind, allowing you to have a powerful experience of your spiritual nature as Shiva-Shakti.\n\n\n4. Return to Cosmic Consciousness: Experience the profound effects of dissolving the elements. Witness the dissolution of the gross and subtle body back to mind, and the mind back to pure Cosmic Energy and Consciousness. Embrace a deeper connection with the universe and your true self beyond all duality.\n\n\n5. Guided Meditation and Yoga Nidra: Immerse yourself in six complete Yoga Nidra sessions, designed to guide you into a state of deep relaxation and heightened awareness. These sessions offer a space for personal experience of the subject matter to unfold.\n\n\n6. Four Stages of Tattwa Shuddhi Guided Meditation: The final session is the full form of the meditation, which leads you through the four stages of Tattwa Shuddhi. This allows you to transition from mere intellectual understanding to full internalization and realization of the subject matter through direct personal experience.\n\n\nJoin me, your instructor Devatma Saraswati, for a transformational journey of self-purification and spiritual evolution with this in depth Tantric course on Tattwa Shuddhi. Whether you're a seasoned practitioner or new to esoteric traditions, this course offers a comprehensive and accessible guide to harnessing the elemental forces within you. Step into a world of profound harmony, higher consciousness, and boundless spiritual potential.\n\n\nEnroll now and embark on a path of inner alchemy that will reshape your understanding of yourself and the universe!\n\n\nHari Om,\nDevatma",

      "description": "A course on returning to contentment using meditation. In this course, we learn to use 'sitting in contentment' to find an emotional comfort-spot - and from that spot begin to understand those parts of us that cannot sit still. We will learn the two steps of first finding contentment each day in mediation and then to find a deeper contentment through bring those parts of us that are unable to meditate to healing rest.\n\n\nWhat is Meditation??\n\n\nMeditation is simply ‘sitting in contentment’ and if we cannot remember how this feels we can simply begin by pretending – but we are not pretending. We simply have been discontented so long we cannot remember our original state of being of being content.\nMeditation allows us to ‘sit in contentment’ in the present moment for a few minutes each day and watch those parts of us that cannot sit with us. And how can they? These are the parts of us that cannot sit in contentment because they require more to feel content, requirements we formed in the past. So, our thinking created these energies making us the perfect self-healer.\nMeditation allows us to first watch from a place of safety, then to understand how these energies form, and then to heal our energies that now compete for control of our present moment. This leaves us sitting in contentment permanently, our original state before we became discontented.\nYou see, we have 100 percent potential. But if 60% of our potential, our thinking is tied up in these energies that are monitoring, protecting, and searching for past experiences, only 40% of our potential is available as energy in the present moment to be anything new. We are weak even though we have expended lots of potential. 100 percent of our potential – to produce a 40% result.\nMeditation builds cooperation where conflict was, and this can increase our present consciousness to 100 percent very easily.\nWatch first, understand next, and then heal. This is the power of meditation.",

Life moves in cycles of activity, and we are no different.\n“Slowing Down” means a couple of things right off the bat:\nLess Rushing.\nMore Intentionality, Attentive Breaths, and Noticing of the Present Moment.\nFewer obligations.\nDoesn’t sound too bad, does it?\nSlowing down isn’t about not doing anything, although that’s sometimes included. Slowing down is about having the capacity to meet the moment appropriately. To know when to - and how to - rest. To sensitize to authentic energy levels that are infinitely more impactful that contrived energy.\nThis practice is founded on the principle that every breath counts, so even spending one breath per day not rushing is a total win. Two breaths is great, too, but I believe one is enough to get everything started. One intentional breath per day - feeling the breath in your body. It’s like a powerful magnet and will build capacity to slow down, which builds health and resilience in the body.\nPlease consider driving without brakes. It would be dangerous and terrifying. And I sortof feel that is what modern life feels like for a lot of us. Constant expectation of growth and achievement. If you’re caught in the web its sticky and you’re just exhausted... Slowing Down in a Busy World will help you keep your brakes in top working order so that your activity has dexterity and confidence fast or slow.",

      "description": "Meditation is a big word and is defined as any practice that brings about some benefit to the mind of the practitioner. There are so many different kinds of meditation practices and teachers out there...this course will focus on the simple and essential to make sure that meditation is a helpful practice in your life.\nI will use my fifteen years of experience meditating through happy times and bad times to teach you everything important about meditation. I have meditated through cancer, depression, ocd, and autoimmune disease. I am confident I can help you meditate according to your own uniqueness.\n\nThere is much more to the practice of meditation than simply learning to sit quietly. While many meditation courses focus almost entirely on relaxation, there is much more to the world of meditation and we will explore some of that here.\n\nMeditation indeed does reduce stress and improve our lives but what are the mechanisms behind that? How do we ensure we are meditating properly? Is there a specific posture or secret that makes meditation effective for everyone?\n\nMany meditation courses only provide information from one lineage or one tradition, such as mindfulness. Here, we will work to integrate all traditions of spirituality to find out what is essentially needed for an effective meditation practice.\nA meditative mind creates a joyful, happy and free life.\n\n\nTestimonials:\n\n\"I’ve lived with crippling anxiety ever since I can remember. This all consuming feeling in me, that I never fully understood, would affect my self confidence, my performance at school, my relationships, career and so much more. It’s created a lot of depression and frustration with myself that has made me ask myself over and over again, “What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I feel normal?” This harsh self judgement became something that grew even worse when I would seek help and these thoughts were reinforced in me by healthcare professionals. I had one counsellor ask me, “Why are you so depressed when you’re such a pretty girl?” or an acupuncturist tell me, “You’d be a really cool person if you just chilled out.” As if I WANT to feel or be like this, or don’t have the right to what I’m feeling. Over and over again the belief was instilled in me that anxiety is just not alright and I really beat myself up for struggling with it for years and years.\nThis year I hit a huge breaking point, that almost cost me my job and took a huge hit to my health. A worried friend in the health profession suggested I see Larry at Action Compassion. I have to say, the last four weeks have been life changing.\nThe name Action Compassion really rings true to the work, because very few have given me as much compassion and understanding for my feelings and struggles the way Larry has. I’ve been made to feel as though my anxiety is neither good or bad, it just is. Because of this, I no longer judge myself for it. It's something we can work on together and that will make me so much stronger as a person. I no longer feel alone or shame the way I used to and have been given so many tools and personal support. Larry is a truly beautiful and inspiring person who has given me so much in such a short amount of time. Thank you Larry for being you. I feel so much stronger and have a clear vision of my journey now. I look forward to this journey together.\"\n\n\n\"I vividly remember the very first moment I met Larry Li. He's the real deal. Raw, walking truth and love. A rare soul. When he first told me of his energy and meditation service, I immediately knew I wanted to work with him. His guidance and insights have been invaluable to me and my business vision. If you're on a path to find your truth and peace of heart, I highly, highly, highly recommend Larry and his unique, powerful service.\"\n\n\nAbout Me\n\nI am 38 years old, born in Taiwan, immigrated to Canada, and have been practicing the healing arts for the past fourteen years. As a teacher I value greatly your time and energy so I ask myself often, how can I best serve my students?\nI have meditated through anxiety, OCD, depression, suicidal periods, rage from family abuse, weird chronic disease, cancer...I can confidently say it is true when Ayurveda says \"Meditation is the first and last medicine\" and I want to share the joyful insights from my journey with you. There is a light and lesson in everything we go through. Even our most difficult periods of suffering are sacred.\nI have studied with meditation masters in Taiwan, Canada, USA, Indonesia, and Germany. I have also completed many meditation curriculums in USA and Canada to see how the west has presented meditation as well.\nI have been teaching meditation for fourteen years and truly it is an amazing journey to see how each student uniquely finds his or her own peace and center.\nI have two masters that I keep in touch with on a yearly basis. Dr. Tang is from a Tibetan Buddhist Healing Lineage practicing in USA and the Master Chen is a teacher of Taoism and Energy Healing based out of Taiwan. Out of all the teachings I have received I find theirs to be the most balanced and clinical, ready to be integrated into modern society. I have practiced their teachings in earnest ever since they saved my life from Lung Cancer at age 24.\nMeditation is unique for everyone and your personal conditions need to be considered. Despite this what are the essentials of practice I can confidently share with you my\nI can speak meditation to you in whatever context you wish. There is a way inward whether we use emotions, logic, energy, or some form of faith. I teach meditation while respecting your individuality.",

      "description": "We are living in a time of constant technological advancement. While improving our lives in many ways, technological progress also makes us accessible and so easily distractible and interruptible throughout the day.\n\n\nIn this digital age, most of us are struggling with our ability to concentrate and it becomes even more vital to have the practice to get back that lost art of concentration.\n\n\nConcentration is the ability to deliberately maintain the focus on something without being affected by internal and external stimuli.\nIn the Material sphere Concentration assists in studying, enables faster comprehension, improves memory, helps in focusing on a task, job or goal, and enables us to ignore meaningless and irrelevant thoughts.\nNow In the spiritual sphere, The terminology used for 'Concentration' is 'Dharna '. Patanjali the father of Yoga psychology, explains Dharana as, ‘the binding of attention to the object of concentration while excluding everything else. Dharna is the 6th Limb of Patanjali's Ashtanga or Eight limbic path to the enlightenment.\nThe person who brought first time the spiritual path of Yoga and Vedanta to the west and world stage, Swami Vivekananda saw concentration as the very core of education and had this to say:\n“To me, the very essence of education is the concentration of mind, not the collecting of facts. If I had to do my education over again and had any voice in the matter, I would not study facts at all. I would develop the power of concentration and detachment, and then with a perfect instrument I could collect facts at will.”\nHe also said that the\" difference between an ordinary person and a great person lies in the degree of concentration.\"\nIn This Course, the meditation practice we are to follow is called Ajapa-Japa Dharana.\nIt is a traditional Dharna practice to improve concentration.\nThe word ‘Japa’ means, ‘the continuous repetition of a mantra’. When the suffix ‘a’ is added, it implies that the process of mantra repetition becomes spontaneous. Ajapa Dharana is, therefore, one-pointed concentration on the spontaneous repetition of a mantra.\nIn this, we Use breath and mental chanting or repetition of mantras as a tool to develop concentration of mental energy.\nOrigins of this practice can be found in ancient Indian Upanishads, like Yogashiksha Upanishad, its reference can also be found in the Gita.\n\n\nThe Ajapa Japa Dharana is complete in itself and through it, one can have direct experience of samadhi, enlightenment, or everlasting bliss, even without the help of a guru.",

      "description": "Experience calmness of mind with this sitting practice of mindfulness meditation based on natural breathing. In this course you will learn how to meditate from a genuine Himalayan siddha monk, His Holiness Swami Vidyadhishananda. Overcome internal chatter and find inner peace as you sink into a calm state of mind effortlessly.\n\nWe will explore the relationship between a calm breath, our lifeforce energy (prana), and our own subtle desires, to begin to understand how to still the mind through mindfulness meditation. You will be given stepwise guided meditation practices that increase in duration to allow you to develop the practice and slowly build up to longer meditation sessions.\n\nBeginner students will find the practice natural and innate, allowing them to tap into a calm state of being. Advanced practitioners will reconnect to the roots of mindfulness that are essential for advanced techniques and study.\n\nThis practice is traditionally known as Aham Graha – a contemplative mindfulness practice that first focuses on overcoming subtle desires related to worldliness that seize the heart. The first part of this Aham Graha contemplation is the mindfulness meditation practice related to attaining calmness by watching the natural breath. Higher steps of Aham Graha progressively build upon the energy of mindfulness attained through the initial sitting meditation practice.\n\nThis course offers learners both the guided meditation practice and its theory (philosophical basis) required to develop a daily mindfulness meditation practice. You will practice transcending the restlessness of the mind by breathing without the intentionality of control. The chapters lay the foundation for deeper practices of Aham Graha and prepare you for higher yoga of meditation.\n\nThe equanimous observance by the practitioner begins by watching the natural breath fully without the sense of agency arising from controlling the breath. Releasing the intentionality behind the act of control slowly allows the practitioner to imbibe the energy of mindfulness and accept things as they are without being reactive.\n\nThe separate guided meditation sessions of increasing duration progressively add elements that guide the practitioner along the path. It is advisable to start with the shorter duration and then try the longer sessions.\n\nIn the module Going deeper with your meditation you will find videos that explore the conceptual framework of the initial phases in Aham Graha reflective contemplation – a meditation of being, by letting go, loosening the shackles of the subtle desires, where there is emphasis on non-duality. Aham Graha contemplation develops understanding of what burdens the heart, how to experience inner peace, and how to become free from the sensations or recollections of pleasure and pain that hold us back from launching a deep meditation.\n\nBenefits from Taking this Course\nCalmness by simply watching the flow of natural breathing\nPeace without occupying the mind on any particular breathing technique\nBetter awareness of your natural breath\nA daily mindfulness meditation practice\nIncreasing your understanding of mindfulness\nLearn how to let go through a sitting mindfulness practice\nDiscover why watching the breath without controlling allows for freedom from volitional impulse\nLearn how the calm breathing can be used to loosen the grip of subtle desires\nUnderstand the meaning of ancient Aham Graha self-observation process from Vedanta philosophy\n\n\nImages used with permission: Himalaya photo in the course banner graphic (pink hue) is by Ashok Dilwali.

The core is a series of easy to follow instructions into four different meditation techniques, progressing in difficulty from those that develop mental precision to the final module for expanding awareness.\n2. The background module is filled with short, topic-specific videos that provide more in-depth treatment of some of the nuances of meditation, posture, location, eyes, and so on. You don’t need to look at these to get started; these are here for those people who have extra questions.\n3. The background module also includes longer videos and mp3s that are designed to be a conceptual guide to meditators as they progress through different levels of awareness and begin to have different questions about their experiences. Again, if you just want the core, it’s a stand alone set of instructions.\nIn addition to the content videos, each instruction module includes loads of guided meditations, both as videos and as downloadable mp3s, for you to use as you develop your practise. Supplemental videos of challenging physical activities, for example some yoga poses, to use for your active meditation practise are continually being added.\nPick and choose which aspect of the course you want to focus on. When you start out you might just want simple instruction, but after some months or years, you will have more questions. This course will grow with you and is designed as a lifelong companion meditation practise.\nWhy Am I Teaching this Course?\nI had been trying to meditate on and off for a large part of my life and never had much success. Then, some years ago, because of my research in cognitive science and philosophy of mind, I became interested in mindfulness from a theoretical perspective.\nI really learned to meditate then and haven’t looked back.\nAfter receiving lots of student feedback from my course Brain Training++ and from students at the university where I teach, I realised that a course like this one is needed!\nI have tried to present everything I have learned — tips that work for me and for others, motivation to keep at it, and background concepts that help make sense of the changes you will experience — in a way that is accessible to everyone AND that goes much deeper than most meditation courses do.\nIf You’ve Ever Asked any of these Questions, this Course is for You!\nHow could meditating make me happy?\nHow could meditating ever make my life more meaningful?\nShould I be trying to empty my mind of thoughts during meditation?\nWhat is the difference between thinking about something and being aware of it?\nIs there a difference?\nWhat is going on in my brain/mind when I am in the flow of the moment?\nIs there a difference between being in a flow state and being mindfully aware?\nWhat are thoughts anyway?\nCan we ever get rid of thoughts completely?\n\n\nBasically, if you have ever wondered about some of the mental experiences you are having, both on and off the cushion, this course offers videos and MP3s of more in-depth discussion of the phenomenological effects of meditation, of what these experiences mean in the context of your life, and how these changes can move you toward developing a more personally meaningful, happy life.\n\nWhat You will Learn in this Course\nFour meditation techniques, each designed to develop a particular aspect of mind: stability, precision, presence, and finally awareness\nWhy meditation affects our brains/minds positively, from a neurological level\nWhy meditation affects our brains/minds positively, from a psychological level\nThe brain/body effects of an on-going meditation practice\nThe psychological effects of an on-going meditation practice\nConcepts of mind and consciousness that will give you the tools to think more deeply about your own experiences, not just during meditation\nLinks to resources, both online and paper, on meditation, mind, neuroscience, including an up-to-date list of the current studies of meditation’s effect on the brain, body, and mind\nIntroduction to various physical activities to meditate during — yoga, martial arts, dance … I will keep adding classes as I receive suggestions\n\n\nDeveloping these aspects of mind will pay you back tenfold with an increase in ...\nhappiness, good feelings, calmness, confidence, control, mental focus, memory, problem solving, creativity, groundedness.\nWhat you Will Get from this Course\nA Happier Life\nMental Precision\nMental Focus\nMental Presence\nMental Calmness\nMental Stability\nMental Awareness\nSelf-Awareness\nBody Awareness\nSelf-Confidence\nCourage\nOther-Awareness\nCompassion for Others\nA Happier Life\n\n\nIf you only ever take one meditation course, this is the one to take because it will grow with you — when you are ready to move on to the next step, or have new questions, it will all be there waiting for you.",

      "description": "Do you find that you have trouble focusing when you're working or learning online? Do you regularly get the compulsion to procrastinate, check Facebook and consume new information when you would rather be doing something more meaningful?\nOr do you find that you have a lots of creative ideas but then you struggle when it comes to executing and implementing them so you earn a steady income from them? If you answered YES to any of these questions, then I designed this course for you.\nI have suffered from ADD most of my life and I know how hard it is in this day and age to stick with perplexing problems and ideas long enough to develop creative solutions for them. I also know what it feels like to never seem to achieve your potential and really create the life that you know in your heart is possible.\nI have spent a big part of the last decade traveling the world, studying and practicing different forms of meditation while creating online courses that teach people today's most in-demand digital skills. I embarked on this journey because I was determined to find a natural way to overcome my ADD so I could channel my creativity into meaningful endeavours. I wanted more than anything to be a creator of my own reality, rather than a consumer of other people's second-hand insights and experiences.\n\nMy search has culminated in the ideas and practices in this course. I designed this course for people like me, who are energetic, distractible and creative, the kind of people who would normally struggle with sitting still and quieting their minds. The way meditation is usually taught is difficult to apply in our fast-paced, hyper-connected society. So, to solve this problem I've tailored this course for people who need the focus and presence of meditation but would normally struggle to build the habit.\nI strongly believe that if meditation is to be truly transformative, it needs to be approached with the spirit of play, lightheartedness and curiosity.To really get amazing results, we need to take ourselves less seriously and embrace our natural flow. Meditation is a tool for exploring our inner worlds and channelling our creative energy in the stream of consciousness we call the moment. It is the controlled expansion of our minds and awareness.\nI want to demystify meditation for you and help you actually build a daily meditation habit that sticks. I will also teach you mindfulness techniques you can use throughout your daily life to overcome distractions, channel your creative energy into flow states and overcome the mental drains of stress, anxiety and uncertainty.\nI recommend you watch the first few videos that are provided free so you can learn more about this course. The outcome of applying the practices in this course is you will experience much better focus, you'll understand how to trigger creative flow when you're working online and you'll be able to recognize how and why you procrastinate and become distracted by directly observing your own mind and body. This will empower you to overcome negative emotional feedback loops and live a more creative, carefree and relaxed life.\nHere is a quick summary of what you will learn in this course:\n\n1. The Internet Age is changing our brains and transforming the way we live, work and learn. You will learn how to develop the three characteristics that are disproportionately rewarded in today's innovation economy: focus, creativity and self-awareness.\n2. You will learn how to increase your attention span and dramatically improve your ability to focus and stay present with problems and creative work through the practice of mindfulness.\n3. Many people who learn to meditate don't stick with it. I'll teach you how to \"hack the habit\" of the daily practice of meditation using a simple 3-step system for habit forming that is backed by the latest neuroscience research.\n4. The time you really want the focus and presence of mindfulness is when you're at work, in difficult social situations and when you're enjoying your free time. You'll learn mindfulness In action practices to stay focused and present in any situation.\n5. Creative flow states are the secret to optimal performance in creative endeavours. You will learn how to trigger flow states when you're working and learning online so you can learn faster and manifest your ideas more rapidly.\n6. You will learn about the latest digital tools and iPhone/Android apps for focusing at work, blocking out distractions, quantifying your performance over time and reducing the natural tendency to be constantly multitasking.\n7. You will learn how to strengthen your emotional intelligence, short-circuit emotional reactive loops that lead to addictive behaviour and how to unlearn your negative habits and thought patterns.\n8. Most office workers who work on a computer (in fact, most modern people) breathe incorrectly. You will learn a simple diaphragmatic breathing technique to increase your energy levels, overcome anxiety when it arises and reduce afternoon productivity dips.\n9. The secret to leadership and getting people to like you is listening to them mindfully. Learn how to focus your awareness when you meet new people so you are relaxed and engaged in important conversations.\n10. Discover a simple way to increase your happiness and well-being by practicing gratitude each day. This is an essential practice for reminding us of our good fortune and helping overcome our evolutionary bias toward negativity, fear and cynicism.\nI'm really proud of this course and I believe the practices taught can change your life in really impactful ways. This course isn't just about absorbing thought-provoking information and factoids. It is about helping you learn and apply actual practices that will transform your life.\nGiven that mastering focus and creativity is such a crucial factor in today's fast-paced digital society, this course is an investment in your future that you can't afford not to make.",

      "description": "Discover The Power of Breathwork and How it Can Radically Transform Your Life\nAre you pursuing enhanced mental, physical, and spiritual well-being without the commitment of lengthy mindfulness courses or regular yoga classes? Discover the effectiveness and efficiency of scientifically proven Breathwork techniques – a transformative approach easily applied to your everyday life.\n\n\nWelcome to the most practical, and efficient breathwork course on Udemy! This course is designed for YOU in mind. This course will cover ALL the necessary areas of breathwork, in order to equip you to build a strong, efficient and transformative breathwork practice in your life. There isn't long, drawn out lectures. Rather, we dive straight into the science and practice of breathwork so you can begin to experience the benefits right away, whether in the comfort of your own office, or at home.\n\n\nWhat is Breathwork and How Does it Work?\nBreathwork is an ancient and proven set of techniques that significantly improve your mental, physical and spiritual well-being through regulated and controlled breath. Its origins are from ancient India, Tibet and China. By regulating and controlling your breath you can activate, at will, your fight-or-flight and rest & digest nervous systems. This allows you to energize, focus, and improve performance or relax, rest and rejuvenate for the day or tasks ahead. With some kinds of breathwork, you can do both which is an excellent way to improve performance.\n\n\nBreath is the most effective and efficient way to regulate the nervous system and is also the way we can connect our conscious mind to our unconscious mind. Because of this, we can learn to create physiological changes by controlling our breath in different ways. The benefits from this are enormous and include:\nStress reduction\nMood improvement\nIncreased immunity\nImproved focus, memory and concentration\nIncreased energy\nDetoxification\nTension release\nTrauma release\nImproved heart health\nImproved lung health\nLowered blood pressure\nOptimized sleep\n\n\nWho is Breathwork For?\nAnyone with a nervous system! No matter who you are, breathwork can have a positive impact on your mental and physical health. People who are experiencing high levels of stress, low energy and burnout. Those suffering from poor sleep, reduced focus and dwindling levels of performance and satisfaction. Breathwork also significantly helps with anxiety, depression and other mental health challenges. Individuals who would like to optimize endurance, increase their immunity and optimize their heart and lung health can greatly benefit from breathwork. Lastly, breathwork can help with those struggling with pain, muscle tension, PTSD and trauma. Specifically for:\nExecutives, entrepreneurs and leaders\nPhysicians, psychologists and service workers\nProfessionals seeking to transform their overall well-being\nStudents, parents, teachers or ANYONE!\n\nWhat Does Science Say?\nWe breathe around 23 000 times per day. This is mostly an unconscious process but if we learn to regulate our breathing, it can have enormously positive impacts on our overall well-being. Although breathwork originates from China, Tibet and India and its positive benefits have been understood for centuries, Western science has researched and proven the physiology behind the techniques. This is not an exhaustive list and the research is extensive. For example, breathwork has been shown to decrease stress, reduce anxiety, improve symptoms of depression, and treat PTSD. In addition it has positive benefits on memory, attention and focus.\n\nBreathwork has also been shown to improve our physical health including sleep health, heart health, blood pressure, low energy, pain management, immune function and endurance.\n\n\nSo, I invite you to dive in, engage with the material and begin your transformation today!",

With the help of intellect, we take decisions and make all logical conclusions. Right from Goal setting to achievement, we rely heavily on its capability. However, our intellect also relies on our emotional state as well. The working of our intellect depends on how well our ability to manage our emotions is.\nSo we all know that without the help of emotional management, we cannot use our intellect to the best of its abilities.\nAll geniuses like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Albert Einstein, etc. never allowed their emotions to come in the way of their goals. This was due to their way of managing their emotions.\nWhat if we tell that even you can have that awesome way of tackling your emotions. You can channel your emotional energy to attain Material and Spiritual Goals. Yes!!!! This is very much possible. In this course we are going to teach you how to use a simple Mandala art form and completely turn around your emotional state of being. It means multiply your positive emotions and release all negative emotions. This course has the ability to help you attain highest emotional intelligence.\nWhat this course has to offer:\n-This course is like a medicine which is used as anti-stress, anti-anxiety, anti-depressant and remover of all tendencies.\n-Not just negative tendencies, you can exactly understand what your strengths are and then you can start building on the strength with the help of Mandala Art.\n-You will learn to map your emotional state with the help of simple yet powerful techniques.\n-You will learn how to understand the state of confusion if you are stuck into any kind of confused state.\n-You will also learn how to locate physical toxins and how to release those toxins which is responsible for emotional drainage.\n-You will learn how to maximise or expand on your positive emotions and use it to the best of your advantage.\n-You will learn how to heal yourself with the help of Mandala Art\n-After substantial practise of these techniques, you will exactly understand how to access your intuitions and take decisions with the help of intuitions.\n-There are many more. But we would want to hear from you once you have finished this course and have practised this for a good amount of time.\nMandala Art Form is an art form that represents the theory of consciousness. It tells you exactly how from quantum the entire universe gets manifested and then unmanifests back to quantum. This is pure physics.\nHowever when we talk about Mandala Art Meditation, it means how to use the facilities like body, mind, intellect, emotions and memory to the best of its abilities with the help of Mandala Art. You need not be an artist or a learner of art. This course belongs to everyone who is working constantly on improving oneself.\nIf you think, you have the patience and drive to improve your life then this course is for you. It will take sometime.

Samatha is a great tool to familiarize and make friend with what we call \"monkey mind\", and to use anything we experience as support for meditation. We will use this meditation to change the relationship with negative emotions and thoughts, transforming them into a way to know better our own mind. In the classical meditation and mindfulness teaching it is said that via meditation we transform poison into medicine. Negative emotions can be transformed into a tool for growth.\nWe will then cover meditation approaches to cultivate important positive emotions: love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. In particular, love is the aspiration that ourself and other experience happiness. Compassion is the aspiration that ourself and others are free from suffering. Joy is the contentment and appreciation for what we have right now. Equanimity is the freedom from excessive craving and aversion. Connecting with those emotions is of key importance to develop a more open and workable mind.\nIn the third part of the course we will practice analytical meditation, in order to work with conceptual distortion and fixations of mind.",

I will teach you, how to unravel life-long patterns stored in your body through meditation.\n\n\nOur life is not just what we know in our daily lives. We have something very precious inside us — an inner self which knows why we are here and where we want to go.\n\n\nThrough meditation we awaken this Self, connect with it, and allow it to guide us to a greater understanding of who we are. If you are ready to look at yourself and you desire to live more fully and with greater awareness, then you may be interested in my open your heart meditation course\n\n\nThe circumstances of life, however mundane, can challenge our efforts to cultivate our spiritual nature and transcend the small self, become better people and help others. When we meditate we are seeking purification through the blending of our personal energy with the energy of the Universe and through the circulation of spiritual energy through our physical bodies. The spiritual energy cannot communicate directly with our physical bodies, nor can it communicate with our egos, our intellects or our rational minds. It must communicate with our Inner Selves — our own spiritual aspects — our hearts.\n\n\n\n\nThrough Meditation We Learn To Surrender\nSurrender involves faith, humility, and acceptance of fate. We must understand that our knowledge of how we fit into the great scheme of life is extremely limited. We do not know why we are confronted with certain situations, why we end up having to do a certain kind of work, or how what we say or do to other people might affect their lives. We cannot see into the future or know what we are being prepared for. We must simply live on faith that our struggles have some meaning, that our efforts are not in vain. We must surrender have faith in the forces that impel our lives. Through the practice of meditation you learn to surrender to this divine part of ourselves, and trust in the process of life.\n\n\nIn the course I will show you how you can create maximum healing for yourself through meditation and understanding the Ancient Taoist Dan Tian energy elixir rooted in Chinese Medicine. We are responsible for our own healing and well-being, and when you learn to tap into this energy elixir it can penetrate and can help unravel layers of pain, anxiety, and fear that are creating limitations in your life. You replace this pain and anxiety with new feelings of love, compassion, connection, freedom, and possibility.\n\n\nIn this course I will teach you how to awaken your heart and go deeper into who you really are. This is a complete meditation and mindfulness training course' it is easy to follow and has practical meditation techniques. its great for beginners and advanced meditators. There is a 30 day meditation and chakra cleanse challenge that can help you break old patterns and empower you to connect to the divine within. The course is filled with easy to follow guided meditations and theory. You will get a deeper understanding of the workings of the mind and emotions and the nature of who you really are. If you are looking to balance the mind, body, & spirit then this course is for you.",

      "description": "Meditation should be a practice that anyone can benefit from. Unfortunately, there is a lot of confusion and complication around this simple practice. This course will make it clear, simple and easy for you to meditate.\n\nMeditation techniques are often taught in a very rigid way.  These leads people to believe that the only way to meditation is through a Buddhist meditation practice, zen or somatic meditation.\nThis course will teach you simple, effective meditation practices that transcend a specific discipline, giving you a clear way to understand and utilize any meditation practice you come across.\nThis is currently a Best-Selling Meditation Course on Udemy!\nWhat people are saying...\n\"I found this course very helpful. The explanations are very clear. The instructor really cares about the students. He talks with a passion and provides a good deal of motivation. In the past I tried to start meditation many times, but could not practice consistently. For some reason this course did it for me. There is no \"beating around the bush\". All explanations are strictly to the point. I am thankful to Ken for creating this course.\"\n-Anna Plotkin\n\"Wonderful course! It really is amazing the benefits that you experience as a result of meditating. I'm an atheist/non religious person and of all of the groups of people on the planet, I would say that I belong to one of the most critical and skeptical bunch. I used to think meditation was a sort of mystical thing - a nonscientific structure. And I couldn't have been more wrong. Ken Wells is able to wonderfully translate meditation out of the mystical world and show how to apply it in a \"tangible\" - if you will, sort of way. I no longer take ambien, Xanax, nor my antidepressants. Now keep in mind, it was not meditation alone that brought about these results but it is certainly a powerful tool. A way to observe one's thoughts, without being consumed by them, brings about peace of mind. This peace of mind enables one to clearly see what changes need to be made in your life to bring yourself into alignment with your purpose, which leads to self-actualization and happiness. I highly recommend this introductory course. Ken will build you an unbreakable foundation for which to build your understanding of this wonderful practice.\"\n-Brandon Burkhardt\n\"Everyone knows the amazing benefits of meditating, this course is the absolute best guide to start your meditation habit.\"\n-John Camboli\n\"Excellent course!\nThe information in the course is great. I was looking for some time now on a meditation course and I got exactly what I wanted :D\"\n-Mirela Voinescu\n\"How to Relax Your Body and Mind - Quickly & Easily!\nI took this class with impatience and all my expectations were fulfilled. The course is very well organized, the lectures are clear, the explanations are easy to follow and you will put all the advice into action in no time.\nThere are so many tips shared inside this program that you will not believe how easy it is to take action. You will learn the exact techniques to use while meditating to be at peace with yourself and relaxed ... and it takes just 10 minutes per day.  So, Jump In!.\"\n-Silviu Marisca\n\"Great course\nInteresting lectures, knowledgeable instructor, good pace. I recommend this course for those who want to break myths about meditation and start to practice meditation now. Don't waste any more time, this is the course for you!\"\n-Luciane Cardassi\n\"This is no idle or self serving compliment; I have been exposed to many seminars, classes, etc. and although each had something to offer, Ken Wells, presents the material in an easy to follow format.

      "description": "This course teaches you the Vedic approach to astral projection and how to use yoga nidra to build the astral body and explore other planes of existence.\nYoga teaches us that we exist within three bodies; the physical, astral and causal. In this course I teach you how to use yoga nidra to build the astral body, find your astral guide, travel the astral realms and safely return.\nAs it turns out, yoga nidra is an incredibly useful method for learning to develop sensitivity to subtle dimensions. This can be achieved through prolonged practice of yoga nidra for extended durations of time, or by using the five elements to transcend the physical dimension much more quickly (as is taught in this course).\nAstral projection is a technique that allows your soul to leave the physical body and explore the multiverse, other dimensions as well as the realms both above and below our own. Astral traveling is a natural ability you can learn to master in a short amount of time if you practice with sincerity.\nUsing this method you can have more vivid interactions with the Akashic Records, visit the upper and lower worlds through the World Tree, communicate with astral entities, reconnect with deceased loved ones, visit Seventh Heaven (Brahmaloka) or Shambhala, speak to deities, yogis, ascended masters, and much more.\nYoga teaches us that there are seven upper worlds, as well as seven lower worlds. This knowledge is encoded in the World Tree and similar concepts can be found in many various spiritual traditions around the world; from ancient Egypt to the shamanic teachings of tribes from Siberia to South America.\nThis course gives you both the complete theory and practices needed to begin developing this skill of astral travel for yourself (and even includes five full length guided yoga nidra sessions).\nBenefits of this course:\n• Learn the theory of astral projection according to Vedic science.\n• Achieve your first out of body experience (OBE).\n• Discover your internal stargate.\n• Learn to build your astral body.\n• Safely explore other dimensions.\n• Fulfill your unspoken secret desires and fantasies.\n• Find your astral guide.\n• Reveal your hidden greatness and soul qualities.\n• Realize that you are an immortal soul, and not merely the mortal body!\n• Receive sacred knowledge from astral beings, ancestors, demigods, etc.\n• Enjoy a safe journey that you can remember upon returning.\n• Included: Five full length yoga nidra sessions for astral travel.",

I began experiencing the healing benefits that arise from a routine meditation practice in my mid-teens, in the midst of struggling with anxiety. From that point on, I've been committed to continuing the practice, as well as sharing with others the gifts that arise from sitting still.\nMy hope is that by teaching mindfulness meditation, it can help ground, nourish and expand others in the same way that it has done so for me.\nOn this path, I've been fortunate enough to study with many wonderful teachers. My primary teacher is Hoben Kim Hansen from the White Plum Lineage of Soto Zen. My secondary teacher is the late Buddhist & yoga teacher Shoken Michael Stone, from whom I've received certification to teach.\nRemington Cooney (M.Ed) - Mindfulness Meditation Coach\nCredentials:\n- Mindfulness Meditation Facilitation training (90 hour)\n- Master's in Education (Contemplative Inquiry)\n- Hatha Yoga teacher certification (200 hour)\nFeel Your Meditation Come Alive as Your Use of Breath and Gravity Comes Alive\nMany traditions teach that your meditation deepens as the length of your exhalations deepens.\nLengthening exhalations comes out of an exploration of the connection between your breathing and the ways in which every part of your body experiences gravity.\nOne way to explore that connection is through practice with a sword.\nAnother way is to split firewood with a splitting maul.\nWhen done properly both of those practices strongly reinforce the use of breath and gravity when doing Zen meditation.\nThe work of Zen meditation is to resolve duality – the simplest duality to begin working on is the mind and body duality.\n\n\nDear friend, as we are doing this class for free right now, we ask only one thing from you, after you finish this course and if it brings you usefulness, please write for us a great review! Thank you a lot dear!",

It's essential for any type of personal growth. Because to grow you have to step outside of your comfort zone—and it's not always easy.\nBut what happens when circumstances beyond your control overwhelm you with stress—things like jobs, relationships, kids, money, traffic, health challenges, overpopulation, or massive accelerated global change? Or what if your stress is fueled by your over-active inner critic, or from suppressed emotions from somewhere in the darkened recesses of your past?\nWith stress coming at you from every direction, is there anything you can do?\nThe answer is: Absolutely. In this course, Stress Relief, A 14-day Hypnotherapy Program we'll be disarming stress and creating internal peace. We'll start, very simply, by slowing down, breathing, relaxing, learning, healing, and generating inner calm. This process will help you overcome stress and replace it with tranquility.\nThroughout the course, I'll be providing useful lecture material, one contemplation, and deep guided meditations to help you learn to relax and establish inner peace as the foundation of your being.\nTopics in this course will learn how to:\nDISCOVER BREATH as the foundation for a life with less stress.\nENTER states of DEEP RELAXATION.\nCALM your INNER CRITIC, which for many of us, is a common contributor to stress.\nUTILIZE CONTEMPLATION to gain insight into healing and releasing stress.\nHEAL STRESS with FOUR PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTHERAPY TECHNIQUES.\nA VERIFICATION SHEET to help chart your success.\nIn these times of global uncertainty, it's my hope that this course will help guide you through periods of transition, whatever they may be while remaining in a state of calm.\nWhat students are saying about Joseph’s courses:\n…I wanted to tell you that I’ve taken a lot of online courses & yours are some of the best I’ve come across… Lauren Carter\nIt is my second course with an amazing teacher. Thank you! Sandra Bar\n…the meditations are next-level awesome. Courtney Seard\nYour delivery was warm and natural and your sincerity and love of meditation shines through. I can see how much work has gone into this course and I'm sure it will reach and help many, many, many people. It's so nice to 'meet' someone with very similar views on meditation and an approach to teaching that chimes with my own. I wish you every success! Linda Hall\nJoseph Drumheller's practical, earthy approach to meditation, along with his soothing voice and approachability provides a comfortable place to begin a new practice or gain deeper insights into those more established. Speaking as a lifelong meditator myself, I recommend his work. Judy Blackwell\nI will say that the main thing I look for in someone in such a course is that they exude calm, and joy....and you do......and that they look trustworthy, good energy when you look at their eyes.... when they speak....and you do…Marika Marks\nVery professional and I loved the videos! If this is your first class online, I wouldn't have known it. You did a great job! Judy Lynne",

You will be able to bring immediate calm to your life with a first taste of meditation and five “mini-meditations” which will help you to identify which techniques could work for you.\nMeditation is an exercise for your mind – a type of contemplative practice. This exercise takes different shapes depending on the style of meditation that you are practicing but, in general, it involves:\nRelaxation. Relaxing your body, slowing your breath, and calming your mind\nStillness. Traditionally, meditation involves stilling the body, either in a seated or lying-down position.\nAwareness. In meditation, you become a witness to your mental and emotional states, and let go of thoughts, feelings, and distractions.\nFocus. Most practices involve focusing the attention on a single object, such as a candle flame or your breath (concentration), while others focus the attention on noticing whatever shows up in your consciousness in the present moment (observation).\nMеditаtiоn hаѕ bееn an еxсеllеnt rеmеdу fоr thе over-stimulation, stress аnd аnxiеtу of ѕосiеtу.

As many busy people know, this is often harder than it seems. Once you locate your home, you should insist on a comfortable position to not be toning or shaking to urge to rest. You do not have to sit cross-legged on the ground, as many of us think, but if you want to then you can. You need to clear your mind. How do you clear your mind? You can sit on a chair, you can lie down, all you must do is stay in a stable position and place your palms in a place where they are facing towards the sky. Be present within the moment.\nMeditation is all about being careful of where you are within the world and present within the moment and what is happening around you. You want to become fully aware of where you and your surroundings exist within the moment. It can take some practice in your first few times, but soon you will be an expert with continuous practice and dedication.\nMeditation is a great gift to give yourself. It is a way to experience a higher quality of life just by going inside yourself and touching your center for a moment. It is a brief retreat from the world that lets you reenter the world with a more vivid presence. If you have never meditated before, this Meditation course will be your guide to some of the simplest and most widely practiced meditations in the world. They are all simple techniques you can do on your own; they involve things like paying attention to your breathing, listening to quiet sounds, and tracking the movement of your thoughts. You can start by doing the exercises for one or two minutes at a time, and as you grow more skillful you can meditate longer.\nThis is come-as-you-are meditation. You do not have to be other than you are to begin. There are no impossible-to-do techniques, no uncomfortable postures, no onerous rules to follow. If you invest the time in exploring how your individual nature interacts with these techniques, you will likely develop some powerful tools to enhance your life. The work for you is to engage your curiosity and sense of adventure. The rewards are a greater ability to pay attention to life and to love.\nThis Meditation course also incudes!\nGuided meditation. Sometimes called guided imagery or visualization, with this method of meditation you form mental images of places or situations you find relaxing.\nYou try to use as many senses as possible, such as smells, sights, sounds and textures.\nMantra meditation. In this type of meditation, you silently repeat a calming word, thought or phrase to prevent distracting thoughts.\nMindfulness meditation. This type of meditation is based on being mindful, or having an increased awareness and acceptance of living in the present moment.\nIn mindfulness meditation, you broaden your conscious awareness. You focus on what you experience during meditation, such as the flow of your breath. You can observe your thoughts and emotions. But let them pass without judgment.\n\n\nKeywords!\nmeditation, meditation music, transcendental meditation, guided meditation, mindfulness meditation, meditation for anxiety, morning meditation, meditation definition, what is meditation, benefits of meditation,5 minute meditation,10 minute meditation, types of meditation, chakra meditation, meditation benefits, daily meditation, meditation room, healing meditation, meditation techniques, meditation videos\nYou can meditate anytime, anywhere, and with anyone.

      "description": "Power of the Mind in Health and Healing: (Family Oriented Course)\n\n\nTo quote Meher Baba:-\n\"A mind that is fast is sick.  A mind that is slow is sound.  A mind that is still is divine.\"\n\n\nThe above quotation is the basis of this entire course.\nTo reach a Divine state of the Mind, we must first learn how to slow down our mind to the point that it is standing still.\nCertainly, in today's world, of busy and fast-paced lives this will prove to be a challenge for most people.  However, with proper training and guidance, it can be achievable.\n\n\nSo why would you choose a Divine Mind?\nIt is very simple, to reach a level of closeness to God, Our Creator, that enables us to tap into His Guidance.  For Him to open more doors of knowledge for us to enter through.\nThis is one of the greatest of all gifts that we can receive from Almighty God, the gift of knowledge.\nNow, you may be asking, well hey, I can read the encyclopedia and gain all sorts of knowledge.\nYes, you are correct, but this is not the knowledge that we seek.  We seek a \"Special\" kind of knowledge that God does not hand out to everyone.  You can say it is a special ability, the ability to determine between Truth and Falsehood.\n\n\nDepending upon which Guru or Master that you choose to listen to, their interpretation of a Divine Mind will differ.\n\n\nMy objective with this course is several, first to teach you, through a series of special customized exercises to increase your Mind's Focus, while at the same time, lowering your Heartbeat.  There is a direct connection between the Mind and the Heart, which then impacts the body.  So if we can control the two (Mind and Heart) it will show in our body and our health.\n\n\nThe second objective, through a specific set of breathing exercises, is to help us reach a place of peace and serenity between us and our Creator so that he can open doors of \"Special\" knowledge to us, whenever we need it.\n\n\nThird, to increase the Chi (Electrical) Energy that flows through our body.  This expansion of Chi, will reverse the age of time and make us younger but also help to heal our bodies.\n\n\nThis course is 10 weeks of training that builds upon the previous week for a desired outcome.  A Divine Mind.  For some people, it may take 10 weeks, for some 10 months the duration and results will be directly proportional to their efforts.\nAs I mentioned at the onset, this is a family-oriented course, and I highly recommend involving your spouse and children.  The exercises are simple and even an 8-year-old can do them easily and well.\nDuring my own personal Chi Energy training, I have involved my family from the onset and our energy keeps getting stronger and stronger.  I have used the same breathing techniques with them and the results speak for themselves.  With practice and time, you and your family will be more relaxed, and calm, and will be able to handle stressful situations with ease.\n\n\nSo if you are ready to set forth on this journey to the path that few have been, please join my course.\n\n\nThank You so much\nGrand Master Ali",

There's something magical about these meditations. Thank you. Gerardine Lemercier\n…I wanted to tell you that I’ve taken a lot of online courses & yours are some of the best I’ve come across… Lauren Carter\n…the meditations are next-level awesome. Courtney Seard\nThis course was delivered in a simple to follow fashion. I especially enjoyed the meditations and feel as though I really connected with and was able to truly feel a presence and full-body energy vibrations from each of them. This is a huge plus for me! So many courses and meditations out there that you end up not really connecting with and you leave feeling empty or dissatisfied with. This was not the case with this course. If you are in the early stages of a spiritual journey that you give this a try. You need to be connected with yourself and in the right frame of mind and this course walks you through each stage clearly and with easy to follow exercises. So worth it! Kevin Dickens\nDrumheller asks me to go deep right off. He is gentle in his delivery, providing a safe space for me to resolve stuff I thought I had taken care of. I am looking forward to the rest of the course. Susy Goins\nExcellent clarification and just amazing. Wow!! Mollie Shannon Rama",

      "description": "This webinar is specifically designed for breathwork practitioners to guide the use of touch and bodywork in breath sessions. One of the six key elements of BBTRS is TOUCH. Touch can be used in many different ways: for the purpose of resourcing; activating the parasympathetic rest and digest response, activation of the sympathetic nervous system for flight or fight and also myofascial bodywork for structural alignment. The energetic residues of our traumatic events, experiences, emotions or accidents are stored in the soft tissue in the fascial network of our bodies. Skilful use of bodywork along with conscious breathing can tremendously support clients in trauma resolution. The contents of this webinar cover strokes and bodywork techniques for all seven major belts of tension as well as the necessary anatomical, structural and physiological knowledge to apply them safely and with confidence. The download also includes a short quiz that all BBTRS students need to complete in order to receive credit towards their certification. The recording of this webinar is 1.5 hours in total. It is part of the required Curriculum for the BBTRS practitioner certification program and the information covered will also benefit massage therapists, yoga teachers, and others in the healing professions.\n\n\n\n\nTopics covered in this webinar are:\nUse of different types of touch in BBTRS sessions\nFour stages of conscious touch\nExplanation of the Fascial network\nThe importance of the Iliopsoas muscle and its relationship to trauma\nBodywork & Anatomy for\nOcular belt\nCervical and Oral belt\nThoracic belt, including shoulder, arms and hands\nDiaphragmatic and Abdominal belt\nPelvic belt, including legs and feet.",

Our approach is essentially three-fold: First, the most essential foundation principles are introduced and explained. Second, the eight rungs (ashtanga) are each explained. Third, explanations are given on what to do with the eight rungs in conjunction with those foundation principles. This journey includes practical principles on the outcomes of the practices, and the levels of direct experience that come as a result of practicing traditional Ashtanga Yoga. The course is meant for a wide range of practitioners, including those who are new to Yoga, and those with years of experience who wish to explore the subtler, more interior aspects of Yoga. This course is a great introduction to the traditional principles and practices of Yoga before its traditional orientation was largely abandoned starting in the early 1900s.\n\nWe are passionate about these principles and practices and offer these to you from the depth of our hearts. May your Ashtanga Yoga practices bring you peace, happiness, and bliss.\nIn loving service,\nSwami Jnaneshvara (Swami J)",

The Six Healing Sounds is an ancient qigong method that uses sound vibration to transform negative emotions into positive virtues. In the “YoQi: Six Healing Sounds” video, master instructor Marisa Cranfill will guide you through the postures, sounds and visualizations and help you clear your body of toxins and stress to create long-lasting transformation.\n\nThe Six Healing Sounds Method (Liu Qi Fa) dates to the 4th century CE. There are many applications and interpretations of the sounds. Marisa leads you through the classic postures, sounds and visualizations designed to regulate the Qi flow through the five Yin organs and Triple Warmer.\nThe method of the 6 Healing Sounds is a purging and regulating formula that is practiced in this order:\nCombine the sound, posture and intention to clear out the negative emotion.\nRecycle negative energy into mother earth.\nSpiral the hands over the target organ.\nVisualize colored light to infuse the organ with healing energy.\nSmile and activate the virtue of the organ.\n\nYou will learn\n• The sounds, postures, and visualizations according to the classic 6 Healing Sounds method.\n• Become aware of your internal organs and “listen” to how they feel.\n• Delete the negative memory link between your mind and organs and remove the root cause of the emotion.\n• How to transform old negative energy into positive virtues.\n• Can be practiced sitting or standing.\n• Choice of long or short workouts, with music or without / 120 total minutes / 2 hours\nThis video contains two routine options: a shorter form (23 min) and a long form (32 min). The long form incorporates eye movements to help release distressing memories and beliefs.\nSix Healing Sounds, Liu Zi Jue, first appears in the book \"On Caring for the Health of the Mind and Prolonging the Life Span\" written by Tao Hongjing (420 - 589), a taoist renowned for his profound knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine. \"One has only one way for inhalation but six for exhalation”.\nMarisa Cranfill is the founder of YOQI yoga+qigong. She has been practicing meditation, qigong, yoga and breathing techniques since 1999. Her purpose in life is to live fully awakened in every moment and her aim is to transmit the safe and powerful techniques she has learned from Chinese masters, Buddhist monks, nuns and Thai shamans, for everyone's benefit.

Qi has the characteristics of movement, and the Qi stimulates and regulates the body's metabolism with its continuous operation, and promotes the life process of the human body. The movement of Qi ceases, and the process of the body's metabolism is stopped, which marks the termination of the life process. The movement of Qi is called a Qi function. The human body's Qi is  extremely delicate substance that is constantly moving. It is circulating throughout our body, and reaches the internal organs, and reaches the muscles and skins to exert its physiological functions, promoting and stimulating various physiological activities of the human body.  Qi is the source and vitality of life. If the blood and Qi  circulations are strong, then the various physiological activities of the human body will also be strengthened. Human hormones such as male and female hormones also increase. The quality of sperm and eggs will also increase. The combination of sperm and egg produces life. Life is derived from 1+1. Chinese Taoists pay attention to the cultivation of \"essence, pneuma (breath, energy, vital force), spirit\" and \"refining the essence\".   (YAO 20191022)\nQi Gong practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow-flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and a calm meditative state of mind.

If so, welcome!  Trying to rise above our emotions is a sure way to struggle with, and ultimately give up on meditation, missing out on the countless benefits of this amazing practice. No more !\nThis course will meet you exactly where you are and teach you to work with, instead of fight, the energy of your emotions so you can ease into a meditative state.\nIn this course, you will:\nPractice an individualized approach to meditation, based on your current emotional\nIdentify your emotions by their dominant element (air, ether, fire, water, earth)\nPractice meditation techniques to balance your energy, whether you are feeling high, low or all-over\nFind out your Ayurvedic mind-body constitution (dosha) and what you need to do to keep yourself balanced\nUse your breath to relax, focus, cool down, warm up, energize or lift your spirit, according to your needs of the moment\nClarify your intentions for meditating, in order to get results\nDiscover which diet is most supportive to your meditation practice\n\n\nWhy learn about meditation?\nIn a world where everything is changing so rapidly, knowing how to stay grounded in yourself is of the essence, for your health and life enjoyment. Meditation is a profoundly grounding practice. It will help you access a state where you feel calm, clear-minded, and able to navigate your life's circumstances with ease. As such, it truly is a life skill.\nMeditation has been shown to lower high blood pressure, relieve stress, anxiety, depression, increase focus, creativity, productivity, and more.\n\n\nWhy focus on my emotions?\nIf you are human, you most likely experience a bunch of emotions daily! Emotions have so much energy in them, but that energy needs to be channeled and circulated efficiently, otherwise it can turn destructive and make it difficult for your meditation practice to get off the ground. Conversely, one might be able to \"sit down to meditate\", yet do nothing but battle with thoughts, restlessness, or boredom. In this course you will learn how to meet and regulate the energy of your emotions in order to ease into meditation.\n\n\nSome of the exercises you will complete:\nClarify your intention(s) for your meditation practice, to get results\nPractice progressive muscle relaxation\nLearn abdominal, or diaphragmatic breathing\nTake a questionnaire to determine your ayurvedic constitution (or dosha)\nTake a questionnaire to determine your current emotional state based on the Five Elements, and how to balance it out\nPractice breathing techniques to ground yourself, when you feeling are worried, restless, anxious...\nPractice breathing techniques to help you chill when you are feeling stressed, impatient, irritable...\nPractice breathing techniques to energize you, when you are feeling stuck, down, uninspired...\nLearn and practice a total of 6 guided meditations, 2 for each category of emotions (air, fire or earth-dominant)\n\n\nWhy this meditation course is different?\nNo meditation technique works for everyone, every time. This course teaches an individualized approach to meditation, informed by Ayurveda, itself an individualized system of healing. Meditate for How You Feel takes into account the student's unique mind-body constitution, as well as their current emotional state, for a more authentic experience of meditation.\n\n\nEnroll now and join me on this meditation journey!",

This course is designed to be an introduction to that process, to the fact that yoga really does mean \"union\" of the individual self with the universal Self.\nYoga is a whole life process.

Our Spiritual Heart as well.\nThe Four Spiritual Chambers of the Heart are:\n· The Strong Heart chamber\n· The Clear Heart chamber\n· The Full Heart chamber\n· The Open Heart chamber\nTo live our life fully, to experience the deepest expression of Love, we need all these qualities in our heart.\nWe need courage, to be able to speak our truth, to stand for what we believe is right and to be authentic.\nWe need clarity to know who we are, our own unique design and not to get influenced by other´s dreams or lives.\nWe need to be able to nurture ourselves with love and compassion to accept the wholeness of who we are.\nWe need to open ourselves to love, to allow ourselves to receive so that we can share our light and love with others.\nThe truth is that we all hold grudges, traumas, fears around our heart expression. There are deep shadows that we will explore together that are blocking our heart to express itself fully.\nIn this class, we go in-depth in the expressions of the Four Spiritual Chambers of the Heart so that we can identify which aspects of our lives need healing and transformation, so that we can change our perception and let go of the old stories that are not serving us anymore.\nWe will use Quantum Grids that I created to help us through guided meditations with the intention to create a movement in these chambers, so that we can transform ourselves and heal. These grids connect you with different resources and essences to support your transformation and healing.\nWe will as well learn how to invite ideal potential futures in our lives and receive an integration grid.\nYou will be able to use these grids for yourself later to deepen the movement and transformation.\n\n\nWhat will you receive and learn?\n· The definition and exploration each chamber of the Spiritual Heart\n· 4 Quantum grids, one for each chamber (Strong Heart-Clear Heart-Full Heart and Open Heart)\n· 1 Quantum grid for integration\n· A guided meditation to open yourself to ideal potential futures\n\n\nAre you ready to dive deeper into your own Spiritual Heart?\nAre you ready to open yourself to a deeper expression of Love?\nThen join us for this sacred journey into the Heart.\n\n\nDemian Haye",

Marco helps people that have fallen foul of the modern day lifestyle of sitting, poor diet and poor exercise. And now he is going to help you to quickly and easily retrain yourself and in the process you'll discover a permanent solution for preventable challenges of our modern world and lifestyles.\nAs you would know the modern world is full of all types of unnecessary health problems, chronic diseases and preventable illnesses. The first symptom of many of these preventable problems often shows up in a the way that person breathes.\nOn this course you will discover that deliberate, structured and focused attention to your breath, and the way that you move, can create health benefits that were previously never experienced, or even totally unknown, to the person practising these simple techniques.\nAbsolutely any one can follow these steps, and with some practice, and a very short amount of time the health benefits will show up.\nUsually after the first session of deliberate reconnection with your breath you will feel a whole lot better than you did before you started.\nThe good news about this course is that it creates an incredible positive feedback loop in your life. The more you practice it the better you will feel and that will make you want to learn more and practice more because it leaves you feeling just so good!\nReconnecting with your breath is not something that a person would necessarily ever think about. Why would they? After all they are already living so they must be breathing right? They are all natural questions, however once you discover the many ways you can alter the chemistry of your body with deliberate and focused breath, you will be awakened to the incredible possibilities that this can do for you.\nThis course is not about meditation, although there seems to be some parallels, it is totally different and nothing like meditation. This course is about the connection between your breath, your body, your brain and your emotions. This is much deeper than mediation and the physical health benefits are far easier to measure than emptying your mind or contemplating upon something that you cannot measure physically.\nOnce you master the daily rituals that are taught to you in this course you’ll see fast and noticeable changes to your physiology, it will reframe your nervous system and it will reintroduce your senses and invigorate your life in ways you may never have experienced before.\nNow let's get you started and reconnected to the very essence of your life, your breath...",

Thank you for getting me started on meditation. Your voice is so good for guidance. Thank you!\n-Justin N.\n\nEver since I started to doing the daily meditations Tharyn organizes, it has been a huge help for me. First of all encouragement and motivation to actually take the time to meditate, which for me is the biggest challenge. The meditations Tharyn took us through were amazing, it feels great to clear your head after a long day of work, and it makes me more energetic, focused and creative during the day. The meditations are very soothing and helpful for me. Keep up the great work :-)\n- Daniel G.\n\nI would like to start off by saying that I have always had trouble meditating on my own. Constant chatter in my head, distractions from everything around me. But I was fortunate enough to do a 3 guided meditations with Tharyn live. They worked wonders on me and I figured out my problem areas. I was able to relax faster and fall into a peaceful meditative state.\n- Eugene H.\n\nTharyn is an amazing meditation coach. He knows everything about meditation and can always help with advice if you have any questions. He has a wonderful voice that gets you into the meditative level very quickly. Definitely recommend to everyone who is interested to bring his meditations to another level.\n- Georgiy O.\n\nI feel that I'm addicted to meditations with Tharyn. I can't imagine feeling so grounded, relaxed and peaceful without Tharyn's daily 30-minute guided meditation sessions.\n- Laura V.\n\nTharyn's guided meditations helped me connect better to my source, strengthen my focusing muscles and clear my mind of all worries. Whenever I meditate, I can always feel that everything is going to be okay and that nothing is more important than how I feel.\n- Ng Khai Y.\n\nTharyn! Thank you for this. Your guided meditations are the part I wait for by the end of the day. Thank you for taking this initiative. You're awesome!\n- Thabit H.\n\nTharyn's daily meditations always leave me refreshed and awakened. His signature compassion for people and the earth is characteristic in his guided mediations.

I can see how much more aware and relaxed I am, his advice is valuable and honest.\n- Miriam L.\n\n\nStart Your Journey Today...\nMy goal is to get this simple course and the benefits of meditation into the lives of as many people as possible. As an entrepreneur, I know that free stuff isn't perceived as valuable, nor taken as seriously, as something you actually paid for. Since I want you to take this course and your practice seriously and get the most benefit, then I believe that paying for it is a better idea.\nBesides, a course in meditation like this can cost up to hundreds of dollars from giant meditation teaching companies. They bog you down with extra material that isn't necessary to get started. This course is simple, to the point, and reasonably priced. Just $39. That's the same price as a good book. I believe it's very fair for the simple techniques that I took years of practice to hone.\nTry the course essentially for free with the 30 day money back guarantee. How cool is that? Take the course now, consume everything in under 3 hours, learn the techniques - and if you still don't think it's worth $39, then I'll give back every penny. :)\n\nMeditation has changed my life, boosted my creativity, and given me hundreds of my most incredible business and marketing related ideas. I believe everyone can benefit from this practice.\n\nStartup Meditation today. Click Take This Course above to get started now.\nCheers,\n- Tharyn Taylor",

      "description": "Improve your focus and productivity with Ajapa Japa Dharana, a traditional concentration practice from India. Through the repetition of a mantra and a one-pointed focus on the breath, Ajapa Dharana helps you tap into a state of flow and access the hidden depths of your spiritual nature. Like a muscle, the more you practice concentration, the stronger it becomes. In this advanced course, you'll learn proven techniques and habits based on modern psychological research to enhance your ability to concentrate and achieve your goals. Enhance your mental energy and tap into your full potential with Ajapa Japa Dharana\n-----------------------------\nThe ability to consciously and deliberately, focus the mental energy on one thing for as long as we require, without being influenced by anything else, is concentration.\nBe it studying, a job, creativity, a goal, or anything else, the ability to concentrate the mind at will enables us to channel all our efforts into our purpose and ignore meaningless irrelevant thoughts.\nMany pieces of research conducted in the field of modern positive psychology have concluded that being able to achieve high levels of concentration allows us to enter a state of flow, which makes the task both more enjoyable and more productive.\nConcentration in Sanskrit is called Dharana and is central to the philosophy of yoga. It is said that only in deep concentration can you discover the hidden depths of your spiritual nature.\nConcentration is like a muscle — the more you exercise it, the stronger it becomes.\nIn this course, the meditation practice we will be delving into is called Ajapa Japa Dharana. It is a traditional Dharna practice to improve concentration. The word ‘Japa’ means ‘the continuous repetition of a mantra’. When the suffix ‘a’ is added, it implies that the process of mantra repetition becomes spontaneous.\nAjapa Dharana is, therefore, one-pointed concentration on the spontaneous repetition of a mantra. In this, we use the breath and mental chanting, or repetition of mantras as a tool to develop concentration of mental energy. The origins of this practice can be found in ancient Indian Upanishads, like Yogashiksha Upanishad, its reference can also be found in the Gita.\nThis course is a follow-up to the course, 'Regain The Lost Art Of Concentration With Ajapa Japa'. Here, we will do deeper and more advanced levels of Ajapa Japa meditation. As in the previous course, we will learn about some more tools and habits based on modern psychological research, that we can adopt in our daily lives to improve our ability to concentrate.",

      "description": "Welcome to YOUR 28-Day Meditation Experience!\nThis series of guided meditation practices were carefully sequenced to build the skills of meditation, improve your self-awareness and support you in establishing a daily practice.\n\n\nJoin me for a curated 28 Day Meditation Experience. Each practice consists of a 15-minute guided meditation using a different \"anchor\" to cultivate focus and presence. The practices are grouped into themes and sequenced intentionally to build your meditation skills. Each practice follows a framework to strengthen self-awareness, connect you to your inner wisdom and cultivate a focused mind.\nThe framework for each meditation consists of a: self-check-in, a themed reading, and time working with a specific \"anchor\" or point of mental focus. This framework brings together the key features of a well-rounded daily practice like a road map for your practice.  Each practice has an attached PDF so you can refer back to the reading from that session.\n\n\nThe Anchor Techniques are grouped into 5 Modules:\n\n\nBreath Focused Meditation\nAwareness of the 4 Parts of Breath\nBreath Cycle Counting\nBreath Length Counting\nBox Breathing\nPursed Lip Breathing\nHumming Breath\nMantra Meditation\nSo Hum\nI am Here\nSat Nam\nSa Ta Na Ma\nPeace Begins With Me\nHumee Hum Brahm Hum\nBreath + Focus Word\nMindfulness Meditation\nSight\nSound\nSmell\nTaste\nTouch\nBody Scan/ Somatic Awareness\nVisualization\nFinding your still point\nZooming Out\nNatural Sanctuary\nGathering Healing Light\nLight in the Spine\nEmbracing the Seasons of Change\nSelf Inquiry\nWhat do I need?\nWho am I?\nWhat is my most Heartfelt Desire?\n\nCountless students have come to me over the years with difficulty establishing a regular meditation practice.  One of the best ways to overcome that challenge is to have a teacher guide you and show you the skills of meditation. There are so many different meditation techniques and resources out there- it can be confusing and overwhelming to figure out where to start.  Following this set series of practices offers clear direction and a progression of skills that will support your practice into the future.\n\n\nIn this course, you get access to 28 different meditation practices for a total of over 8 hours of content!  Each module has an introduction video to explain the type of meditation we will be practicing, how it can be helpful, and any challenges that may come up. As you work through the 28 meditation practices you will learn the type of practice that you find to be the most helpful. You can return to those videos over and over to support your regular practice- as you retain access to the course information forever.\n\n\nI also created this course as a way to show what a normal daily practice looks like. You don't need a fancy meditation room, a beautiful spot perched on a mountain or a special cushion. Each morning I make my coffee, sometimes I am still in my pajamas...I walk over to the couch and start my meditation timer. My dog Redford usually decides to join me for a nap.\nIve been on retreats, meditated at beautiful lakes, and stayed at ashrams, but it is this very normal daily practice that has done the most to change my life.\n\n\nWhen we let go of what we think our practice is supposed to look like -we can finally settle into what meditation actually is :)\n\n\nContinuing education credits are available to Registered Yoga Teachers with Yoga Alliance and for Yoga Therapists.\n\n\nI have two other Meditation Courses here on Udemy that go together well as a series:\nFoundation Skills for a Successful Meditation Practice (Free intro to meditation)\nBuild YOUR Successful Meditation Practice (an information and skills-based course to overcome the challenges of meditation)\n\n\nI hope that you will join me in this 28 Day Meditation Experience- your practice will never be the same!\n- Laura",

I started meditating 8 years ago. I was severely struggling with chronic stress, burnout and anxiety.\nIt took me years to become aware that I was chronically stressed and burnt out. And that I was repeating a pattern that was making me ill every 3 months.\nMy body wasn’t listening. My mind was consumed with negativity and unhealthy thoughts. My awareness was low and I wasn’t connected to my body.\nI was acting and living like a machine in New York, working hard and feeling miserable. And allowing the misery into my life.\nI had created a monster that I couldn’t escape until I found meditation.\nOnce I started meditating, I naturally started to heal my chronic stress and burnout. I began to slow-down. I began to rest more. I learned to relax more.\nThe more time and energy I put into meditating instead of worrying or constant overthinking, I found something that worked perfectly for me.\nMy anxiety reduced. My unhealthy thoughts began to reduce.\nI learned to relax my nervous system.\nI learned to honor my emotions and be kind to myself.\nAnd most of all, I started to feel calm, peaceful and happy.\nI finally could say, that I was happy.\nThrough meditation, I found my calling. I found my purpose. I found deep emotional, mental, physical and financial freedom.\nAnd now, I want to help you find the happiness, fulfillment and freedom you are seeking.\nI will guide and teach you the tools necessary to release traumas, gain clarity and build confidence. You will learn how to use meditation to self-heal, manifest and create your dream reality.\n\n\n**Student and client wins, testimonials and success stories:**\nKanwal’s meditations are powerful and super soothing. I can’t believe how calm and relaxing her voice is. It’s like everything disappears and healing just starts to happen. I love working with Kanwal. I am doing her second program now “Meditation Mindset” and it’s helping me heal old wounds and traumas. I did the “Life Clarity” program first which really gave me clarity in every area of my life. Now, I wanted to do a deep dive to heal my traumas, release old patterns and habits and reprogram my subconscious. I highly recommend working with Kanwal. You will see what a gift it is to realize your purpose and dream. You will also find comfort and joy in being present. -- Callie B., New York\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKanwal is an incredible coach. She’s extremely intuitive coach and mentor. I had the pleasure of working with her most of last year and I can honestly say, her teachings have left a huge impact. She combines many modalities in her teachings keeping the learning curious, fun and creative. I highly recommend working with it. It’s totally worth it. You see changes immediately! -- Sheila M., New York\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKanwal truly is an incredible and inspiring coach. She brings out the best in you. Every session is insightful, filled with aha moments. I always get some major breakdown in each session and feel like I am making progress. I no longer feel held by my limitations and childhood traumas. The meditation coaching has been insanely powerful. Thanks Kanwal. I can’t thank you enough. -- Allen S., Los Angeles\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI was going through a spiritual awakening I wasn’t aware of when I spoke to Kanwal. She explained to me the phases of the awakening and how most it was normal. She told me to feel into all of it and welcome it. The resistance I felt and the need to control my outcomes and reality was holding me back from surrendering and trusting in the universe. We continue to have our sessions weekly and I learn more about myself and my spiritual awakening. It’s such an amazing experience. -- Samantha K., New York\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI was skeptical at first because I had never tried coaching like this. After one session with her, I realized how much I was lying to myself and that it was time to be honest with myself. I was letting my fears hold me from achieving my dreams and realizing my purpose. I can’t believe I didn’t start sooner. I am so so so so grateful to Kanwal for her wisdom, knowledge, love and support. She does this thing about “acknowledging” which makes such a huge difference. I have learned so much, where do I even begin with. :)  -- Hailey S., London",

      "description": "A FEW OF MELISSA'S TESTIMONIALS\nAbsolutely loving Melissa C and all of her courses! This is a Perfect follow up to her Basic Meditation course!!! – Heather\nWow! Thank you Melissa for this course! Amazing work, information, book and videos. The lectures are well worded and comprehensive. I will keep practicing. – Greti\nAnother brilliant course by Melissa, filled with an abundance of knowledge and practical components I can now put to excellent use in my Meditation Practice. - Melissa\nI loved this course! It is well organized, to the point (short videos, including only pertinent information) easy quiz's to review knowledge. Melissa has a very pleasant, calming voice, along with an in depth knowledge of the subject. Thank You! – Susan\nThis was my twelfth course with Melissa.. That should speak volumes. - Karen\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nAs the course name implies, you're about to 'round out' your existing meditation skills in what I consider more ‘advanced’ techniques than what I teach in my introductory course, Learn to Meditate in Minutes & Guide Others, Too.\nThe aim of this Advanced Meditation course is to help the meditator move towards the inner door they seek to open – then beyond. Thus the 'rounding out' of foundational knowledge, further learning, and clear step-by-step processes (which are highly effective and easy to follow) will act like 'guide rails' in that journey.\nFor those who wish to help others achieve and maintain this more advanced state of meditation, I provide tips and a template on how to create one's own meditations. I also include suggestions on how to guide others on deeper meditations.\nIt's time to take your meditation practice to a new level of inner-knowing, calm, and divinity – and I hope you enjoy it! Namaste.\nPrerequisite note: To understand the contents of this course and be able to reference some of the more fundamental information I refer to in it, you must also have completed my introductory meditation course: Learn Meditation Basics with Certification to Guide Others and already hold the Natural Healer \"Meditation Guide\" certification.\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nOnce enrolled, you'll need to download the course book: Advanced Meditation (PDF). The book covers everything in great detail, including the step-by-step processes for easy reference offline.\nAs you progress through this course, your 'foundational' knowledge will be rounded out and will practice a variety of techniques to help enhance deeper, more advanced meditative states.  Then to help ensure you have everything you need to get the most out of this course, you'll be practice with my Guided Advanced Meditations so it's easier for you to achieve your meditation goals!\nThen after you've completed the entire course, you'll have all that you need to take your meditation practice to a whole new level - for yourself and for others!\nOnce you've completed the entire course, gone through all the lectures and practiced when prompted, if you choose to, you'll be able to take my Advanced Meditation Final Exam.  Upon successful completion, you'll receive a beautiful Certificate of Completion (PDF) and a Digital Seal of Completion (JPG)!\nEnjoy your journey sweet friend. Big love!",

Guided by Spiritual insights, this journey will illuminate your soul's path, awakening a profound sense of purpose and connection. Embark on this celestial exploration and embrace the infinite possibilities that await.

However, it is actually a completely physical response to EMFs, which are, of course, very real electrical frequencies, within our atmosphere.\nEMF radiation has been linked to diabetes, obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome, and even cancer.\nLearn what the telecommunications industry do not want you to know, and what the medical community are no longer being taught...\nInfluenza is an electrical disease! That is the claim that we are making. However, whereas in the past, it was observed how we could be 'influenced' from celestial and natural atmospheric electricity, making us ill, since the rollout of electricity in 1890, the flu has become an annual seasonal event.\nIncredibly, every influenza pandemic outbreak correlates exactly with the launch of new electrical technology, which emits a new EMF frequency into our atmosphere. The launch of Radio, Radar and Mobile Phone Telecommunications, have all coincided with a pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic coincided exactly with the rollout of 5G Telecommunications across the planet, and the new powerful EMF frequencies along with it.\nThere has never been any concrete evidence that influenza is a contagious disease, in fact it never used to be considered as such..\nSo you don't need to live in fear from the flu virus anymore!\nLearn how to protect yourself from these harmful radiations, and actually transform them into positive energies!\nLearn how to use cutting edge and fringe technology to transform EMFs, and negative energies from people, devices and places.\nExperience powerful Kundalini Yoga techniques, to ramp up your own energetic force field, to keep you vibrating high.\nExperience how meditation can help you master your mind, your physical body, as well as your emotional, mental and even spiritual well-being.\nLearn how to raise your vibration above lower energies, and become a vibrational match to positive people, experiences and energies.\nEnhance your health to the max and feel vibrant, alive and radiant!\nEnrol Now!",

Are your thoughts constantly clashing in your head, making it impossible to find stillness?\nDo anxiety, anger, and sadness lead you around, even though you know inner turmoil harms your health but still can't stop it?\nAre sleepless nights haunting you with unfinished work or unresolved conflicts, trapping you in a cycle of \"the more I want to sleep, the more awake I become\"?\nHave you tried countless methods to find inner peace, only to find nothing truly works?\n\n\nAuthoritative Insights Reveal: Why You Need to Practice Pure Mindfulness\nModern psychology shows that most people live with hyperactive minds—regretting the past or worrying about the future—rarely present in the now. This constant mental drain leads to fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, lowered immunity, and poor focus.\nBut we are not helpless.\nThis course combines the Taoist classic Qingjing Jing with modern mindfulness psychology to present a simple, practical system of Pure Mindfulness Practice.\n\n\nWhat Is It?\nInspired by the ancient Chinese classic Qingjing Jing, this course helps you cultivate inner peace in modern life through self-awareness and conscious breathing. These practices were once used by sages over 2,000 years ago to remain centered amidst life’s ups and downs—and today, they are more relevant than ever.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn:\nCalm your tense body and mind through breathing\nUnderstand your inner desires and thoughts through observation—not repression or avoidance\nPractice mindfulness during everyday activities like eating, walking, and working\nNo religious background or special equipment is needed. With just a few minutes a day, you can find clarity and stillness even in a fast-paced life.\n\n\nWe’ve Turned Ancient Wisdom into Practical Tools:\n\n\nSelf-awareness: Learn to observe your thoughts and emotions without judgment so they no longer control you\nBreathing techniques: Use breathwork to quickly regain calm—whether you're anxious about an exam or overwhelmed by a packed schedule\nDaily balance: Stay focused during daily activities and make mindfulness a natural part of life, not a burden\n\n\nWhat You’ll Gain\n4 Core Modules to Build a Complete Practice System\nModule 1: Foundational Awareness – Understand the root of anxiety\nLearn the \"Desire Tracing Method\" to find the true emotional triggers\n\n\nModule 2: Breathing Foundations – Use breathing to regulate emotions\nMaster posture (standing/sitting/lying) to make breathwork safe and effective\n\n\nModule 3: Awareness Practice – Discover the real you\nExperience inner observation, external form awareness, and distant object awareness\n\n\nModule 4: Daily Application – Practice mindfulness in everyday life\nMorning: 5-minute mindfulness wake-up\nWork: Pomodoro-based mindfulness\nEvening: Emotional clearing exercise\n\n\nAdvanced Meditations: Explore emptiness visualization and resonance with nature—release full-day tension in 30 minutes of meditation, equal to 2 hours of deep sleep.\nFollow-Along Videos: Guided audios/videos for breathwork, inner observation, and complete meditation routines, available anytime.\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Do I need any religious or philosophical background?\nA: None at all. The course removes ritual elements and explains Taoist wisdom in modern terms—perfect for anyone seeking mental clarity.\n\n\nQ: How much time do I need to practice daily?\nA: Beginners should start with 20–30 minutes per day. With practice, it easily fits into short daily moments.\n\n\nQ: Can I take this course if I struggle with emotional issues?\nA: Yes, the course focuses on awareness and acceptance. For severe anxiety or depression, please consult a professional while practicing.\n\n\nStart Now\nWith simple awareness and breath, reclaim your inner peace.\n\n\nNo background needed, no special tools required—just begin with a breath, a meal, or a walk. You'll gradually learn how to stay grounded, reduce mental friction, and build balanced strength in a busy world.Let mindfulness become your soft but steady support against anxiety, exhaustion, and pressure.",

      "description": "Inspired by the notion that it takes 21 days to create a habit, each 21-Day Meditation is ideal for beginners as well as for advanced practitioners.\nwith this course, the body becomes still and the mind experiences peace.\nOur mind is like a little child. If you order a child to do something, he will quite often do the opposite. There appears to be a rebelliousness, a need to defy. The mind acts in the same way. If you force the mind to forget the body and be aware of another subject, it seems to suddenly develop a fascination for the body. The more you try to forget the body, the more difficult it becomes.\nKnowing this tendency of the mind, this course adopts a contrary approach. That is, it almost forces the mind to be aware of the body for a long period of time. The mind, as usual, rebels. The mind automatically tries to think of something else and it forgets the body. And this is exactly the aim of meditation practices. After practicing intensely every day you will find that the awareness spontaneously directs itself inwards and the Mind is calm and with peace.\nThe Meditation technique followed in this course is traditionally known as Kaya Sthairyam.\n\n\nMeditation is a state that arises when following a meditation technique.\nMeditation techniques usually consist of one sitting still in one of the classical meditation postures.\nOne ensures the body is still and comfortable.\nOne’s awareness is withdrawn from the senses and is directed inwards.\nOne begins to steady the mind by the process of Kaya Sthairyam.\nThen one gives a ‘concentration method’ to the mind such as ‘watching the breath or repeating a mantra mentally to oneself.\nIn time and with practice, one’s awareness begins to merge with the object of meditation. If one is fortunate the state of meditation and bliss arises which is beyond the ability of words to describe.\nThe first stage is Pratyahara or detachment from the senses.\nThe second stage is Dharana or Steadying the mind\nThe third stage is Dhyana or mindless attention… merging.\nThe fourth stage which arises of its own accord is Samadhi or Bliss which defies description\nKaya sthairyam is a basic practice of concentration on the steadiness of the body.",

      "description": "Singing bowls amplify your intentions for helping those who need extra comfort and care due to cancer, sickness, ill health, disability, surgery, or other conditions. Even if you only have one bowl, you can open the door to truly helping someone that needs pain relief, deep relaxation, centeredness, comfort, and caring.\nBLISSbowls Sound Healing Methods will help you use the powerful sound and vibration from singing bowls to boost the effectiveness of your work with those who are unwell or dealing with complex health issues. Singing bowls are therapeutic tools that are used in hospitals, assisted living facilities, homes, hospice; most any place is open to the musical medicine from the singing bowl.\nAs those in the healing/helping professions know, many times it is hard to know what to do for someone struggling with health issues. We ALL want to help \"make it better\" but healing journeys are complicated. A singing bowl can unravel and diffuse anxieties on the part of the client, practitioner, care-givers and loved ones. With just one singing bowl, you can produce calming sounds that create a healing space, no matter where you are. In addition, you can ignite the body's relaxation response, taking it out of anxiety and fear-mode, and into a more relaxed state where healing can take place on many levels.\nThis video offers creative bowl techniques for helping people who are \"health-challenged\" and going through Cancer/chemo, surgery, debilitating pain, physical restrictions, and so much more.\nFor thousands of years, cultures from around the world have used vibrational medicine to treat illness, revitalize the body, and elevate the spirit. Sound healing is powerful, therapeutic, and restorative; harmonizing the entire being. And now you can equip yourself with the right approaches and techniques for YOUR unique practice. Ann Martin is a sound-healing innovator with vast experience in practical singing bowl skills, as well as powerful insights into the applications of sound healing. Anyone doing healing-type work can benefit from incorporating a singing bowl. Bowls provide a \"double healing\" experience as you receive all the benefits of the healing vibrations at the same time your client does. A singing bowl will expand your capacity to effect change in the body, mind, and spirit while offering undeniable benefits to you and your clients...using just ONE BOWL!\nDISCLAIMER: The BLISSbowls program offers a contemporary, leading-edge approach to sound healing, while providing a platform to integrate the unique talents of each student. This class will offer general concepts that can be applied to many situations. It will not delve into the physiological specifics of certain diseases or cover every situation that you could run into. It is up to you how to use the concepts and apply them to your specific clients and patients.\nIMPORTANT: To get the most out of this course, please watch the prerequisite courses listed below.

      "description": "Come learn from Master Clinical Hypnotherapist, Joseph Drumheller!\nOver 16,000 online students in 147 countries\n40+ online courses\nConducted 2,000+ private healing sessions\n4-time award-winning author\nWorked 6 years in a cancer radiation clinic as a Clinical Hypnotherapist\nWelcome to Meditations for Problems & Solutions of the 21st Century. Humanity is currently on the doorstep of massive unprecedented changes, not only in our world but within ourselves.\nThe external evidence is easy to see: accelerating technology that controls us, overpopulation, and the insatiable greed that's helping fuel climate change and the accompanying disregard for our planet.\nThere's also a parallel evolution going on inside of us. Our awareness is exponentially expanding because we're learning how to tap into our vast inner worlds, in a way that's never been done before. Furthermore, the challenges facing us on the planet today are inspiring us to discover our inner realms and explore beyond the limits of the three-dimensional physical world. Many people are calling this the Golden Age of Awareness.\nIn this experiential and thought-provoking course, I'll provide lectures, contemplations, guided meditations, and homework. These will help you gain personal insight and expansion into your experience of the higher aspects of yourself, during these evolutionary times.\nTopics in the course will include:\nThe art of DEEP RELAXATION.\nLectures and contemplations to help you generate PERSONAL INSIGHTS into the GLOBAL CHALLENGES we are facing.\nLectures, contemplations, and meditations to INSPIRE SOLUTIONS that will lead us into the GOLDEN AGE of AWARENESS.\nA VERIFICATION SHEET to help chart your progress.\nAlthough there are no prerequisites for this course, some experience in meditation will be helpful. But more than anything, what you really need is a burning desire to take a realistic look at our world, then take the necessary action to expand yourself and your experience of reality.\nWhat students are saying:\nThis is a lovely course to do. There's something magical about these meditations. Thank you. Gerardine Lemercier\n…I wanted to tell you that I’ve taken a lot of online courses & yours are some of the best I’ve come across… Lauren Carter\n…the meditations are next-level awesome. Courtney Seard\nThis course was delivered in a simple-to-follow fashion. I especially enjoyed the meditations and feel as though I really connected with and was able to truly feel a presence and full-body energy vibrations from each of them. This is a huge plus for me! So many courses and meditations out there that you end up not really connecting with and you leave feeling empty or dissatisfied. This was not the case with this course. If you are in the early stages of a spiritual journey give this a try. You need to be connected with yourself and in the right frame of mind and this course walks you through each stage clearly and with easy-to-follow exercises. So worth it! Kevin Dickens\nDrumheller asks me to go deep right off. He is gentle in his delivery, providing a safe space for me to resolve stuff I thought I had taken care of. I am looking forward to the rest of the course. Susy Goins\nExcellent clarification and just amazing. Wow!! Mollie Shannon Rama",

      "description": "Meditation is a transformative practice that empowers individuals to cultivate inner peace, clarity, and well-being. It involves training the mind to focus on the present moment, fostering deep self-awareness and a profound sense of calm.\nThrough meditation, individuals can reduce stress and anxiety, enhance concentration and creativity, and develop emotional resilience. It's a powerful tool for managing the demands of our fast-paced lives, fostering a profound connection to our inner selves, and promoting overall mental, emotional, and physical health.\nIn our Meditation Teacher Training course, you'll gain the knowledge and skills to not only experience these benefits for yourself but also to guide others on their journey towards a more balanced and harmonious life through the practice of meditation.\nYou will learn:\nExplore the diverse cultural contexts of meditation, from Hinduism to Buddhism, Taoism, and Christianity.\nGain a deep understanding of meditation theory and its various definitions, including its role as an altered state of consciousness.\nDiscover the wide range of meditation techniques, from focused meditation to mantra meditation, and learn how to practice and teach them effectively.\nExplore the extensive health benefits of meditation, including stress reduction, relaxation techniques, and its application in mental health.\nDive into the world of meditation research, from its early origins to the modern mindfulness revolution, and understand the challenges in researching meditation.\nDevelop teaching skills and a structured approach to guide students through their meditation journey, utilising the Kolb learning cycle and effective class structures.\nPrioritise safety and well-being in meditation practice, learning to address adverse experiences, mitigate risks, and follow best practices for a safe and supportive learning environment.\nWe’ll explore different meditation techniques through practical exercises so you can get hands-on experience with different types of meditation. For each one, you’ll get an introduction, practice and list of teaching points. We’ll cover:\nLoving-kindness meditation (Maitrī, mettā)\nFocused meditation (breath, object-focused)\nMantra meditation\nGazing meditation (Trataka)\nOpen monitoring meditation (mindfulness)\nEach module is assessed by a multiple-choice exam. By the end of the course, you'll earn a certificate accredited by the International Association of Therapists.\nThe course is thoughtfully designed, featuring video lectures, downloadable resources, quizzes, practical exercises, and a comprehensive course handbook. Students undertaking this course should have an interest in meditation. However, no formal training is required to undertake this course as all concepts are explained from the ground up.\nLooking to decide between this and our best-selling Mindfulness Teacher Training course? The mindfulness course goes deeper on that subject and is perfect for students who want an approach that concentrates on evidence-based approaches and mental health. This course is more suited to students who want to explore the historical context of meditation and a wider range of techniques. Both courses complement each other and all of the lessons are individual to each course.",

As many busy people know, this is often harder than it seems. Once you locate your home, you should insist on a comfortable position to not be toning or shaking to urge to rest. You do not have to sit cross-legged on the ground, as many of us think, but if you want to then you can. You need to clear your mind. How do you clear your mind? You can sit on a chair, you can lie down, all you must do is stay in a stable position and place your palms in a place where they are facing towards the sky. Be present within the moment. Meditation is all about being careful of where you are within the world and present within the moment and what is happening around you. You want to become fully aware of where you and your surroundings exist within the moment. It can take some practice in your first few times, but soon you will be an expert with continuous practice and dedication.\nMeditation is a great gift to give yourself. It is a way to experience a higher quality of life just by going inside yourself and touching your center for a moment. It is a brief retreat from the world that lets you reenter the world with a more vivid presence. If you have never meditated before, this Meditation course will be your guide to some of the simplest and most widely practiced meditations in the world. They are all simple techniques you can do on your own; they involve things like paying attention to your breathing, listening to quiet sounds, and tracking the movement of your thoughts. You can start by doing the exercises for one or two minutes at a time, and as you grow more skillful you can meditate longer.\nThis is come-as-you-are meditation. You do not have to be other than you are to begin. There are no impossible-to-do techniques, no uncomfortable postures, no onerous rules to follow. If you invest the time in exploring how your individual nature interacts with these techniques, you will likely develop some powerful tools to enhance your life. The work for you is to engage your curiosity and sense of adventure. The rewards are a greater ability to pay attention to life and to love.\nNOTE:\nAfter completing this course, you will receive Meditation Certificate of Completion from my side, which you can share with your family, friends, relatives, co-workers. Certificates of completion help demonstrate your accomplishments. Plus you will also receive another certificate from Udemy as well. I will see you in the course Lectures.\nALL THE BEST!",

He spent many years providing support to terminally ill cancer patients. Highly recommended. Phil Strong\nYou know, Joseph, I really appreciate the reminder that unresolved emotional charges INFLUENCE  our decision making and behavior. I can see that this has played out in my life to my great misfortune. At this stage of my life, it is very important for me to take charge of these ancient emotional triggers, and create a much healthier and happier existence.

Speaking as a lifelong meditator myself, I recommend his work.

      "description": "A 2-day seminar for those interested in spiritual enlightenment and the highest attainment of the yogic journey.\nIn the Seminar, we are going to delve into the secret of the powerful Tibetan Buddhist Tummo Meditation (inner fire meditation). This technique was kept secret for many centuries – but is gradually revealed to western practitioners.\n\nWe will study and practice the process, layer by layer, moving from the most basic elements of breathing and visualisation, to the most advanced.\nBut this is much more than a one-technique seminar. Since Inner Fire contains within in it all the subtle secrets of our body, kundalini, and energy transformation, this will also be an opportunity to engage in long and deep talks about the finer dynamics of enlightenment.'\nAncient Buddhist traditions are rich with secrets and hidden teachings.\nIt was only after significant depth of practice and insight that students were initiated into certain 'secret' techniques — practices said to be particularly powerful in supporting the pursuit of spiritual transformation and enlightenment.\n\n\nOne such originally secret technique is Tummo meditation which comes from Tibetan Buddhism. According to Shai Tubali, it is the ultimate enlightenment practice - a practice so pure and essential that it is the closest one can get to the fully realised yogic state itself.\n\n\n'Inner fire is like shooting a rocket along a completely straight path. It deals only with what is essential. It is the most powerful way to achieve blissful, indestructible samadhi.'\n- Lama Yeshe\n\n\nFortunately for us, this meditation has now become world renowned. In fact, today, Tummo is one of the most researched meditation practices, proven to be highly beneficial in boosting self-esteem, confidence, and general wellbeing.\n\nThis may be due to a special side-effect: this practice increases our body temperature in a measurable way, so much so that it allows monks to meditate for hours in the snow…So, the 'inner fire' is much more than just a metaphor, It is a living, transformative potential within you.",

The codes of our evolution and desires are within us and as we grow up, we naturally develop our inner knowing and compass. Our parents and society in general should support us fully in this early and fragile period of life, instead of transforming us into something that we might not want to become.\nSadly, this is how our society and parenting models are designed. Things are changing for the better and we learn better ways, but what to do with the suppressed and often wounded child that screams from within?\nOf course, liberate and activate him/her again! And this is what this video course and powerful guided meditation does for you!\nThe secret to be alive again, to be eager to live an be joyful is to heal and activate the inner child within.\nAre you ready to bring your inner child home again?",

      "description": "Intro to Mikkyo, the Secret Teachings\nPathway to Personal Power\n\nThis course will guide you to the practices and uses of previously secret Mudras (hand postures) and Mantras (short chants)\n\nMaster clearing, energizing, and connecting the chakras, meridians, and the energetic body.\n\nLearn the Mikkyo Mudras, Mantras and Meditations used to clear the chakras, meridians, and energetic body.\nUse Mikkyo to energetically connect the chakras and meridians to strengthen the energetic body\nApply your new inner power and focus to cut the Mikkyo Grid\nUse the Mikkyo Grid to energetically charge people, places, and things.\nImprove everything in your external world by developing more inner calm, power, and focus thru Mikkyo.\nMikkyo is the ancient system of clearing, strengthening, and focusing the chakras, meridians, and energetic body with simple hand Mudras and short Mantras. The inner strength and focus are then projected outside of yourself to energetically charge people, places, and things and bring them in harmony and resonance with yourself.\n\nIn this course, you will learn and apply the Mikkyo Mudras, Mantras, and Meditations previously only taught in Temples, to create inner clarity, focus, and power. You will also learn how to cut the Mikkyo Grid and the energy projection technique. You will know how to use these energetic tools to charge people, places, and things in your external environment and bring them in harmony with your inner calm.\nThis course is unique because these techniques have only been handed down in private Temples and monasteries before now. The methods are easy to learn and apply to make your life better now.\n\nContent and Overview\nI studied the Mikkyo system in the Shingon Temple in Honolulu personally with Masters from Japan and Hawaii for over eight years. In this 'Intro to Mikkyo, the Secret Teachings' course I use five video lectures, several e-books, and meditation guides to share what I learned. I use detailed photos, audio, and video so you can quickly understand and apply the easy-to-learn Mudras, Mantras, the \"Mikkyo Grid\" and the Mikkyo energy projection technique.\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to apply Mikkyo to create for yourself clearer, stronger chakras, meridians, and energetic body. You will be able to use the Sword Hand Mudra to cut the Mikkyo Grid and project your focused awareness outside of yourself to energetically charge people, places, and things. You will have the ability and understanding to project your new inner calm and awareness outside of yourself into your external environment and bring it into harmony and resonance with yourself.\nA few of the many things you can use Mikkyo for; improve your relationships, clear negative energy out of rooms, and perhaps most importantly, bring yourself more inner calm and focus.\nNo longer hidden in Temples, you can use Mikkyo to make your life better now. \"Intro to Mikkyo, the Secret Teachings\" can open you up to whole new worlds of power and possibilities within yourself.",

        "Mikkyo is for people with open minds. During their study of Mikkyo, the students will be encouraged to look at life, energy and the control of energy through a whole new, different perspective. Mikkyo is also for those interested in radiant health by clearing stuck, stagnant energy from their chakras, meridians, physical and energetic bodies. Mikkyo also helps develop a strong, calm center. People with strong limiting beliefs that keep them from learning new ways of looking at life, should NOT take this course.",

      "description": "Kriya Yoga, also known as the \"Art of Active Practice,\" is a unique form of meditation and yoga that emphasizes movement and action. Unlike other practices that require strict mental control, kriya yoga encourages practitioners to let go of concerns about the mind.\nIn kriya yoga, the mind is not seen as a hindrance. Even if the mind is filled with distractions and unable to maintain focus, one can continue the dedicated practices. Growth and transformation can occur effortlessly without the need to confront or manipulate the mind. By staying relaxed and allowing the mind to flow naturally, inner awareness flourishes and the mind becomes centered and focused.\nAwakening the kundalini energy is a challenging task that demands self-discipline and austerity. However, for modern individuals dealing with the complexities of life, strict adherence to discipline can be overwhelming. This is where kriya yoga shines as an ideal practice. It accommodates the distractions of work, family, and society while providing profound power and effectiveness.\nThe ultimate goal of kriya yoga is to activate the chakras, cleanse the energy channels, and awaken the dormant kundalini shakti. The kriya techniques follow a gradual progression, gently awakening the kundalini instead of abruptly forcing it.\nThrough these practices, consciousness can expand, and dormant areas of the brain can be activated in a smooth and risk-free manner.\n\n\nIn this course, we will be covering the following:\n\n\nChakra Anusandhana.\nNada Sanchalana.\nPawan Sanchalana.\nVipareeta Karni Mudra.\nArohan and Awarohan\nUjjayi Pranayama\nKhechary Mudra\nLocation of Chakras",

Courtney Seard\nThis course was delivered in a simple to follow fashion. I especially enjoyed the meditations and feel as though I really connected with them and was able to truly feel a presence and full-body energy vibrations from each of them. This is a huge plus for me! So many courses and meditations out there that you end up not really connecting with and you leave feeling empty or dissatisfied. This was not the case with this course. If you are in the early stages of a spiritual journey that you give this a try. You need to be connected with yourself and in the right frame of mind and this course walks you through each stage clearly and with easy-to-follow exercises. So worth it! Kevin Dickens\nDrumheller asks me to go deep right off. He is gentle in his delivery, providing a safe space for me to resolve stuff I thought I had taken care of.

This is a life-changing transformational energy elixir called The Dan Tian that the Chinese have used in the 8 branches of Chinese Medicine for thousands of years. When you learn to tap into your own energy field it can penetrate and help you heal things physically, emotionally, it can unravel layers of pain, anxiety, and fear that are creating limitations in your life. You replace this with new feelings of love, compassion, connection, freedom, and healing possibilities on all levels.\n\n\nDo You Want to be Healthy Inside and Outside? Do you want to balance & heal your body? In this course, you will learn to align your energies & maximize the healing power inside Mind, Body & Spirit. Let’s take the healing journey together.\n\n\nSum Faht is a form of meditation, Qigong, Tai Chi and energy work in which we activate the divine energies of the heart. The name comes from the Cantonese phrase “soi sum peen fah faht,” which loosely translated means whatever the heart desires will manifest. When we mediate, connect to our dan tain we are seeking purification through the blending of our personal energy with the energy of the Universe and through the circulation of spiritual energy through our physical bodies. The spiritual energy cannot communicate directly with our physical bodies, nor can it communicate with our egos, our intellects, or our rational minds. It must communicate with our Inner Selves — our own spiritual aspects — our hearts. If you are looking to balance the mind, body, & spirit.",

      "description": "Meditation Therapy is a system of guided meditations that enable you to tap into your deeper thought processes and change your habitual thinking, the way you emotionally react and therefore your whole life.\nAfter a lifetime of studying and teaching philosophy & ideas in comparative religions, both ancient and modern, Sifu. Mark Ringer has a unique ability to bring together the principle concepts of ancient traditions with modern therapeutic practices. Following a decade of being Head of Faculty for Philosophy and Ethics Sifu. Ringer has spent the last decade entirely focussed on teaching Kung Fu & Chi Kung with all its esoteric mind training techniques. As a certified Hypnotherapist & Master practitioner of Neuro Linguistic Programming it would be difficult to find any one better able to guide you through your personal, emotional and spiritual transformation.\nWith an easy and friendly style, Sifu. Ringer has recorded these meditations and wisdom teachings that, until recently, were only available to his Kung Fu students. Following the tradition of the ancient Kung Fu Masters, his teaching encompasses a philosophy of life that is supremely practical, making it easy to learn & apply, enabling you to master the art of living by understanding how to master yourself.\nIn this series of 10 days of meditations, you will discover some of the most useful wisdom hidden within the symbolism of the Ba Gua, though you need to know nothing about it before you begin. Using recent developments in neuroscience, you will be able to easily assimilate and make the most use of these ideas in your everyday life.\nThe programme consists of two videos every day.\nA guided morning contemplation will encourage you to spend some time each day considering and understanding these, often life-changing, concepts. These morning contemplations present predominantly axiomatic ideas, that is truths that you perceive to be evident once you understand them, and therefore are easily assimilated into your individual philosophical approach to life.\nThe evening guided meditations will teach you how to easily meditate and will follow on from the morning’s thoughts and are designed to help you embed the wisdom you have considered and enable you to derive the most benefit from these teachings.\nYou will discover a different way to think about your world. Simply, a more philosophical approach to life. This is practical philosophy that will enable you to take control of your habitual thinking as well as your emotional responses to different situations. This means you will be able to choose your predominant emotional state and know how to mitigate your emotional reactions to different stimuli. You will know how to begin changing yourself from the inside out.\nThese ideas progressively enable you to transform your life by developing your attitudes, expectations and even, should you choose, aspects of your own personality. Remember your personality creates your personal reality. That is to say, the way you habitually think not only reflects the world you believe you live in, but is hugely responsible for creating the world you believe you live in, for perception is everything.",

      "description": "Most people give, and give, and give until they begin to feel empty or exhausted. The answer is meditation.\nBut so many get discouraged because they try meditation and don't see the benefit. Either they can't get their brain to still, or all sorts of negative emotions and thoughts come to the surface that were lurking under the busy going-going lifestyle.\nThey begin to wonder, “what’s the point of meditation anyway? I feel like I'm just making negative progress. It’s not worth it. I don't have time for this anyway.”\n\n\nMost of the meditation programs on the market are aimed toward:\n1. Relaxation and stress relief.\n2. A stilling of all thoughts.\n3. Energy work.\n4. A guided journey where they talk, talk, talk..... talk some more, making it impossible to truly train and make REAL progress in your inward journey into stillness and your own inner wisdom.\nAnd most meditation programs don't align with what I wish for you, which is\n... for you to feel deeply lovable, loving, and loved and to be able to take this energy of loving kindness and higher awareness into your daily life.\n\n\nSo, I set out on a mission:\nTo help as many people that struggle to start and maintain a daily meditation practice to begin a journey inward into stillness, serenity, a connection to love, and all things, so they get up afterward refreshed, feeling lovable, loved, connected, and elevated.\n\n\nThis meditation program is six weeks. There is a new meditation video to do daily each week, as well as a self hypnosis guided meditation you can listen to right before you fall asleep or when you first wake up in the morning. As a bonus, I have created a beautiful meditation journal pdf you can download and use.\n\n\nI firmly believe in my heart of hearts that it is part of my purpose to give you this program. I was meant to come here to heal, evolve, and give. Part of that is sharing a new secret with you....\nReady?\n\n\nI believe we are not all meant in meditation to clear our heads of thoughts and enter a void. We're meant to leverage the emotion of loving kindness, to train it along with the strength of our focus to guide us on the inward journey to connect with energy flows and enter the LOVE Frequency.\n\n\nI almost didn't make this program and start teaching meditation because I thought, WHO AM I TO DO THIS?\n\n\nI'm not some perfect angel. I'm not different than you. I'm a mom of three beautiful kids who still gets grumpy sometimes. I get overwhelmed. I feel sad and angry. Challenges arise and negative emotions arise. I make mistakes and fail. I am in process, as we all are :)\nThe difference is, now I know how to sit down in meditation, connect, bliss out, fill up with energy and love, and come back with that love halo uplifting me. I know how to re-enter the love frequency when I get out of alignment and take it back into my daily life with me.\n\n\nSo can you. Meditation doesn't need to be something you do in silence once a day. It can become the centering force that supports and aligns you into the love frequency.",

I had a rough couple of months with a lot of stress and anxiety and didn’t think that something could help me to feel better, especially online. So if you like me hesitating - should I? Yes! Yes and Yes! All instructors lead you through the classes and it’s very easy to follow, you can do it in your own time and you even can repeat it later, like me, ecstatic dance, loved it, did it 4 times in one week, it really helped me to feel much better and sleep better, helped me to look inside, find my fears, helped me to realize my anger and disappointment, helped me to reset my mind and focus on my inner peace during the retreat.\n\n\nAnastasia: Our couple has very different interests. I am more inclined towards spiritual practices and self-knowledge through analysis. For Dima, it is much more familiar to know himself through the physics of the body. When I want to go to the theater, he wants to go to the sports field. Therefore, when I saw the peace inside me Retreat program, I realized that I had found the very joint kind of leisure for us.\nDima: This is all new to me. My wife suggested that we have a good time on the weekend, but she didn’t say what exactly we would do. It was a surprise to me. Honestly, I thought it would be a trip to a museum, to a cinema, or to some kind of art exhibition. But I was wrong and was pleasantly surprised. We spent this weekend with practicing online retreat. I want to say thank you to those who developed this program. The combination of spiritual and physical development is especially valuable for us. We found something that could interest both of us. We will advise our friends!\n\n\nAnu: Very nice retreat. Relaxing and enjoyable. In todays stressful times, meditation and mindfulness is not a luxury but a necessity. peace inside me is the best way to take a pause and think about ourselves. Highly recommended for all levels of experience!\n\n\nAcker: I like how this retreat course has multiple teachers. Normally in this type of meditation courses you practice a particular type of meditation vs at peace inside me you experiment with different approaches! Lots to learn!\n\n\nTatyana: I would like to thank peace inside me for this experience. The retreat is truly amazing and life-changing. I was a little bit lost in my career search and I needed time and the right practices to listen to my heart and understand what will make me happy in the next steps. I was able to spend quality time with myself. Practice after practice I had deeper conversations with myself and I am very thankful for that. I love that all practices are so different. And each practice opens you up from a different side. This is a very unique retreat where you can find the best teachers/coaches in one place!\n\n\nTHANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO MAKE YOUR SOUL HAPPY!",

      "description": "*******Over 10,000  students are enrolled in this course*******\nThis course is a Summary of traditional Yoga Meditation Practices, which explores a 1-page outline of the practices of our Abhyasa Ashram and Himalayan meditation tradition. Your guide in the course is Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati (Swami J or Babafor short).\nThroughout this course we emphasize the Antar (Inner) Yoga principles and practices of the ancient sages of meditation and contemplation, particularly as transmitted to us through Swami Rama of the Himalayas, and the long lineage of predecessors. We use the word Yoga in its traditional meaning as a path of liberation or freedom from the bondage of attractions, aversions, and false identities, systematically revealing the eternal, unblemished Center of Consciousness and its Union with the One absolute, Nondual Reality.\nThis one page Summary is a brief, yet thorough outline of the central themes of the practices of our ashram and tradition; practices which lead you in the direction of Self-realization or Enlightenment. The course is a practical expansion of that one-page Summary that we have widely used in online meetings, at our ashram in the US, as well as in meditation retreats and classes around the world.\nOur immediate goal is to lead you to directly intuiting your true nature, as a center of pure consciousness, and then allowing the depth and breadth of meditation to naturally come over time.\nMost of the course is video lectures, complemented by several extensive PDF files and audio Resources. The course has four major sections: Self-Observation, Internal Dialogue, Systematic Meditation, and a fourth section on Complementary and Evolving Practices.\nPlease approach the course with the view of it being a practical tool for deepening your Meditations, and that this is not a mere intellectual study. We encourage you to expeditiously, yet comfortably move through the course, watch the video portions, and then, once familiar with the principles, come back and reflect on the many attached Resources more deeply. In other words, please remember that while there is a lot of depth here, which can make the process seem to be not easy, there is always an underlying simplicity.",

The practices passed down the Daoist lineages Wang Yun holds can enhance our physical and mental health, sustain our equanimity and happiness, and, most importantly, keep our mind and body relaxed during challenging times, helping to relieve stress while facilitating more natural breathing – basic tenets of a healthy life, often overlooked, and perhaps more necessary now than ever before.\n\n\nIn this qigong series, you will learn exercises to promote general well-being and maintain physio-skeletal fitness, as well as others that target specific areas and health benefits, focusing particularly on spine mobility and relaxed breathing. They can be practiced safely by students of all ages and previous experience in fitness and exercise.\n\n\nWe invite you to take some time to discover these simple, effective practices, to breathe and move in new (yet ancient!), more efficient ways, with us.\n\n\nModern Wisdom Translation Group (MWTG) is the international community of students of Wang Yun’s, based in Taiwan, training in qigong, meditation, Daoism and Buddhism.\n\n\nIn addition to continually deepening our own practice, we teach qigong and meditation classes in English to a wide variety of clients. We pride ourselves on serving as a bridge between these ancient wisdom traditions of East and Central Asia, and English speakers pursuing these rich teachings in the modern world.\n\n\n———————————————————\n\n\nThese practices and exercise videos are a complement to Wang Yun’s qigong books in the “Qingcheng Mountain” series, published by Singing Dragon / Hachette, and available worldwide wherever books are sold.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Qigong is intended to be a complementary therapeutic practice. While its psychophysical benefits are numerous and time-tested, it is not meant as a replacement for professional and timely medical care. As with any exercise routine, consult a specialized physician before beginning in case of pre-existing chronic pathologies and psychophysical issues.",

His music is an attempt to pick up these inner pieces, to put them back together and create something beautiful.\nThe music of Inner Pieces is well suited for meditation, contemplation and yoga. The dulcet tones of the Hang, RAV drum Native American Style flute and Sansula help to bring the mind to a state of calm repose. Andrew can be found running music meditation sessions in yoga studios and also performing in hospitals and care homes.\nRikk Smith\nRikk has been creating and playing Native American flutes for over 28 years and his connection with these incredible instruments runs deep in his heart and soul.

      "description": "People sometimes ask, \"Why do you meditate?\"\nThey also ask, \"What do you do in meditation? Are you trying to empty your mind? What is the goal of meditation?\nSometimes people ask if meditation will help them with their challenges: stress, fear, doubt, grief, depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, low self-worth, a lack of confidence, a desire to love more, a longing to be loved more, relationships, work, career, finances, concentration, school.\nSome people also come to meditation because they have a spiritual yearning. They wonder if spiritual awakening is real. If so, what is awakening like, how does one realize awakening, and is awakening possible for us all?\nMany forces can draw us to meditation. Reason can compel us. Intuition can also draw us. For most of us, both the mind and the heart bring us to meditation. There is an intellectual knowing that meditation will help us. There is also an intuitive sense that meditation will help us.\nA great blessing of my life was that I was born into a culture of meditation, mindfulness, and personal growth. I learned different forms of meditation, different mindfulness techniques, and different modalities for personal growth. Through this process, I realized there were fundamental skills common to all approaches. This course will teach you these fundamental skills. It will also give you the knowledge necessary to direct your personal growth and transformation.\nThere are seven fundamental skills that you practice in meditation. These skills are what you \"do\" in meditation. As you gain proficiency with these skills, they become the outcomes you realize. These skills include balance, presence, focus, choice, relaxation, resting in stillness and silence, and doing nothing.\nIn this course, we will learn and practice the first four of these seven skills.\nMeditation allows us to cultivate more BALANCE\nbetween the mind and the heart\nbetween thinking and feeling\nbetween doing and being\nbetween controlling and allowing / accepting / loving / flowing\nBy gaining more balance between the mind and the heart, we live a more embodied life.\nMeditation also allows us to cultivate more PRESENCE so that we are more present in our life: for a conversation, for a cup of tea, for a business meeting, for a significant other, for our family. With more presence, we show up more fully for our own lives.\nMeditation also allows us to cultivate more FOCUS. With focus, we prioritize that which is important and spend time on it. Focus allows us to build a life that we value.\nMeditation also allows us to cultivate the power of CHOICE. The only place freedom is ever found is in choice. By cultivating the power of choice, we become more empowered, develop more self-efficacy, and have a stronger internal locus of control.\nHighlights of this course include:\nlearn and practice the four fundamental skills of meditation:\nbalance\npresence\nfocus\nchoice\nrealize more connection with your feelings and your heart\ndiscover more enjoyment by having more presence in your life\nacquire clarity on that which helps you create a happy and fulfilling life\novercome challenges by gaining a larger perspective of yourself and this existence\nheal trauma by discovering the abiding love of conscious awareness\nrealize how transformation and growth are possible for all of us\nnormalize the importance of receiving help and of helping\nunderstand the actions to take if you are in dire circumstances\nbecome more resilient so that you bounce back faster from life's challenges\ngain the ability to assess the efficacy of both teachers and teachings\nmore fully understand and access your sovereignty and authority\nbecome more responsible, accepting full accountability for your life\nlay the foundation for understanding and realizing spiritual awakening\nlearn to meditate using the world's most popular meditation technique\nunderstand how to physically sit in meditation using traditional meditation posture\ndiscover how different meditation gear can help you sit in meditation\nacquire insight into the difference between meditation and mindfulness\ndevelop the ability to be more mindful in all aspects of life\ncultivate a warrior spirit within yourself\ndiscover your life's purpose\nrealize more happiness\nDescribed as “fun,” “entertaining,\" and “delightful,” this course will teach you how to meditate and practice mindfulness. In addition, this course will give you the knowledge necessary to direct your personal growth and transformation. This course will provide you with the skills to build a better life, enjoy your life more fully, and realize more happiness.\nOne student wrote, \"The only training most of us receive for the mind is arbitrary, capricious, and partial. This course will change that for you. This course is a user’s manual for the mind.\"\nTry this course for yourself and see how fun and easy it is to learn about meditation, mindfulness, and personal growth.

We are kept down with our life stresses, lack of this type of education and things like  fast processed foods we are actually going in the wrong direction just look at the steady increase in the modern world illness rates! If we are not careful between A.I. and modern age illnesses we are going to be left behind unless you decide to stay ahead and the first step to do this is through meditation and in today's society it has never been easier. The knowledge of the old with the new technologies used in this meditation course we can do this effortlessly. The time to start evolving is now.\nI have not just studied a simple weekend course in Transcendental Meditation and then claim I know how to mediate and teach meditation. I have been researching this along with other mind techniques for well over 2 decades. When studying and researching like I said I did not just read a book or take a weekend meditation course, I went to the top I have studied with Yogacharyas and Zen Roshis.\nI have researched the mind and its abilities and I have mastered many techniques. I do (not am) ADD and due to this I needed to master my mind to be able to do things like:\nOvercome my constant insomnia.\nCombate stress, which has been proven to be x10 times worse for ADDers over regular people.\nI had real reasons to go above and beyond to truly understand the mind and how we work. On this journey I have not only done this but I have discovered many, many amazing things.\nI quickly discovered that regular meditative techniques just did not cut it for me when in periods of high stress or once insomnia had crept back in for any period of time.\nI had to keep looking further than just some standard meditation technique or breathing exercise.\nNow I am not saying these cannot be great little tools however for me they are not enough!\nIn this meditation course you will be using some of these techniques as a addition to the main exercises as when done in the right way, at the right times can be very useful additional balancing tools.\nI have studied many, many styles of meditation.\nI am a Raja Yoga Teacher, Raja Yoga is not some modern fad Yoga but is one of the Original 4 types of Yoga from India and is the Mental Yoga or the Yogic path via the mind.\nI have studied many forms of Chi/Qi/Ki: Qi Gong, Tai Chi, Reiki, Tao chi, etc..\nI have studied the ancient: Buddhism, Zen, Kabbalah, Taoism, Cristian \"Prayer\", Hinduism, Shamanism, Wicca and other Pagan systems, etc .....\nI have studied the more modern: Psychology & Philosophy, From Plato via Freud to Wilber, Neurolinguism, Hypnosis & Hypnotherapy, Neuro-feedback, Sound Frequency Therapies and many more.\nWhen talking about my person situation as an ADDer I have not only learnt to dominate my mind, I have learnt to turn on and off the H at will. Or turn my ADD into ADHD. (I do not much enjoy the H so I rarely do it).\nIf I can turn the H on the is it not possible for an ADHDer to turn it off? I digress.\nThis meditation course combines various systems & techniques, from both the east and west and from the ancient world and the latest modern technologies to enable you to go from 0 to 100 in no time at all.\nTraditionally it takes a Zen monk decades to get his mind to the levels of meditation required by his practise. We know this, thanks to modern Neuro-feedback techniques. We can literally see what his brain is doing when at these levels. Knowing where a Zen monk goes we can replicated these states using certain technologies to show us where we want to be in no time at all. And once we learn these this mastery becomes possible within a very short amount  of time.\nHow long will this course take to go from 0 to 100 or from beginner to advanced to mastery?\nLike I have mentioned a Zen monk will take years or even decades to get there. However with daily practise and a little dedication you can get there in months and possibly even weeks with this meditation course! By the end of this meditation course you will be able to meditate like a Zen monk and more!\nWe will discussion how we do this at length within the course...\nSo how much time will you need each day for this meditation course?\nI have students in over 70 countries and I am not going to sell you a meditation course that says \"learn mediation in 3 minutes a day\" because if you simply breath fully and deeply for 10-20 breaths which takes about 3 minutes, is this meditation? Or a little relaxation technique? It really annoys me when people sell relaxation as meditation. Not because the techniques are not the same thing:\nCan you train to deadlift a 300 kilogram barbell by lifting a 90 kilogram bar? Lifting 90 kilos is good but it is not the same as lifting 300kg!\nCan you train to run a 50 km marathon by jogging 1km a day? Jogging 1 km can be a fair amount of exercise for some people yet it will not enable you to run a 50k.\nThis is a serious meditation course for people who are serious about wanting to learn meditation fast and effectively.\n\nThis meditation course starts at level zero at just over 15 minutes a day and if you wish to stay at 15 minutes because you find it enough for your needs that is absolutely okay!\nHowever if you wish to become and advanced meditator or to even master meditation to reap the true benefits, this meditation course will take you up to 1 hour a day, if you so wish.\nWith this said, once you have mastered meditation:\nCan use practise it for 3 minutes at a time? Oh Yes! A 3 minute meditation is amazing and the difference between that and a 3 minute little relaxation technique is, well..... incomparable!\nTo be able to have a constant mindfulness we need calm. To have a calm mind at all times we need to be in control and be the master of it. So mindfulness truly only comes when once we have mastered our minds. Then from here we can go from constant mindfulness to constant enlightenment.\nSo if you have read all of this page and as I know many people will not I will to throw in a little bonus tip for those of you that have got here:\nOnce you have enrolled in the meditation course. If you have a cold or when you get one, meditate with track 7, for the length you have time for. Do this concentrating on your totem, focusing your attention to either your navel area (your belly button) and or the root of your tongue (sort of the front of your throat). See how you feel afterwards. And please let me know through Udemy's internal messaging service. (Using this meditation on myself is worth many times over what the course costs)!!!\nThank you and see you in my meditation course.\nSome reviews of people who have taken the course:\n\"Loved the course. I am a teacher and have a very high stressed job. I listened to the first audio and I must say it was a little strange. But I definitely felt better afterwards. Very funny feeling. Guess it will take some getting used to. As for the course, it was well explained and the teachers views are very different from what I am used to but they make sense. They mention more courses are in the works. And I am looking forward to them.\"\n\n\n\nThis course will help you by:\nBEGINNERS will be able to meditate like a Zen monk, (it will take less time than you think with this course).\nYou will UNDERSTAND how to meditate at any time and in any place.\nDominate your own mind. YES, Dominate your our mind!\nMASTER meditation very quickly and efficiently.\nNot just do basic meditation but be able to meditate at the LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS of your choosing.\nEASE stress, anxiety and depression.\nMASTER & Control your states of mind even if you have ADHD, dyslexia or the like\nThis course comes with downloadable meditation music to help you in your meditations as you begin and to train your mind\nADVANCED meditators will be able increase the understating of themselves and their minds\n0 to 100, MASTER mediation in 6 months or less!\nOnce you have finished the course you will be able to do 5 minute meditations, 10 minute meditations, or even 1 minute meditations!\nTo have mindfulness one must have a calm mind which need mastery through meditation that you will get here!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncluye 36 pistas de audio de meditación. Última actualización enero 2018\n¿Has tratado de mediar y has fallado?\nHay tantos cursos sobre meditación por ahí.\nEntonces, ¿qué hace que este sea diferente?\n¿Qué hace que este sea mejor?\n¿Te gustaría poder meditar sin esfuerzo sin perder el tiempo con tu mente constantemente preguntando?\n¿Has tratado de meditar solo para descubrir que no puedes hacerlo?\nTal vez piensas que estás meditando cuando de hecho solo estás relajándote.\n¡En este curso aprendes cómo meditar, correctamente y sin perder tu valioso tiempo practicando para sentarte o calmar tu mente!\nEn este mundo de avances de la Inteligencia Artificial, ¿por qué no avanzamos como humanos?\nHemos tenido el conocimiento básico durante miles de años, sin embargo, estamos ocupados siendo hormigas obreras. Nos mantienen a raya con el estrés de nuestra vida, la falta de este tipo de educación y cosas como los alimentos procesados de manera rápida, en realidad estamos yendo en la dirección equivocada, ¡solo observemos el aumento constante de las tasas de enfermedades en el mundo moderno! Si no tenemos cuidado entre A.I. y las enfermedades de la edad moderna nos van a quedar atrás a menos que decida seguir adelante y el primer paso para hacerlo es a través de la meditación y en la sociedad actual nunca ha sido tan fácil. El conocimiento de lo viejo con las nuevas tecnologías usadas en este curso de meditación lo podemos hacer sin esfuerzo. El momento de comenzar a evolucionar es ahora.\nNo acabo de estudiar un curso simple de fin de semana en Meditación Trascendental y luego afirmo que sé cómo mediar y enseñar meditación. He estado investigando esto junto con otras técnicas mentales durante más de 2 décadas. Cuando estudiaba e investigaba como dije, no solo leía un libro o tomaba un curso de meditación el fin de semana, sino que iba a la cima. He estudiado Yogacharyas y Zen Roshis.\nHe investigado la mente y sus habilidades y he dominado muchas técnicas. Hago (no soy) ADD y debido a esto necesitaba dominar mi mente para poder hacer cosas como:\nSuperar mi constante insomnio.\nEl estrés de los combates, que ha demostrado ser x10 veces peor para los ADDers que las personas normales.\nTenía razones reales para ir más allá y comprender mejor la mente y la forma en que trabajamos. En este viaje no solo he hecho esto, sino que he descubierto muchas cosas increíbles.\nRápidamente descubrí que las técnicas de meditación regulares simplemente no me servían cuando estaba en períodos de mucho estrés o una vez que el insomnio había regresado por un período de tiempo.\nTenía que seguir buscando más allá de solo una técnica de meditación estándar o ejercicio de respiración.\n¡Ahora no estoy diciendo que estas no pueden ser pequeñas herramientas, pero para mí no son suficientes!\nEn este curso de meditación utilizará algunas de estas técnicas como complemento de los ejercicios principales, ya que cuando se hace de la manera correcta, en el momento adecuado pueden ser herramientas de equilibrio adicionales muy útiles.\nHe estudiado muchos estilos de meditación.\nSoy un profesor de Raja Yoga, el Raja Yoga no es una moda moderna de Yoga, pero es uno de los 4 tipos originales de Yoga de la India y es el camino del Yoga Mental o el Yoga a través de la mente.\nHe estudiado muchas formas de Chi / Qi / Ki: Qi Gong, Tai Chi, Reiki, Tao chi, etc.\nHe estudiado lo antiguo: budismo, zen, cábala, taoísmo, Cristian \"Oración\", hinduismo, chamanismo, Wicca y otros sistemas paganos, etc.\nHe estudiado lo más moderno: Psicología y Filosofía, de Platón a través de Freud a Wilber, Neurolinguismo, Hipnosis e Hipnoterapia, Neuro-retroalimentación, Terapias de Frecuencia de Sonido y muchos más.\nCuando hablo de mi situación de persona como ADDer, no solo he aprendido a dominar mi mente, he aprendido a activar y desactivar la H a voluntad. O convierta mi ADD en ADHD. (No disfruto mucho la H así que rara vez lo hago).\nSi puedo encender la H, ¿no es posible que un ADHDer la apague? Estoy divagando.\nEste curso de meditación combina varios sistemas y técnicas, tanto del este como del oeste y del mundo antiguo, y las últimas tecnologías modernas que le permiten pasar de 0 a 100 en muy poco tiempo.\nTradicionalmente, un monje Zen necesita décadas para enfocarse en los niveles de meditación requeridos por su práctica. Sabemos esto, gracias a las modernas técnicas de retroalimentación de Neuro. Literalmente, podemos ver lo que hace su cerebro cuando está en estos niveles. Sabiendo a dónde va un monje Zen, podemos replicar estos estados usando ciertas tecnologías para mostrarnos dónde queremos estar en ningún momento. Y una vez que aprendemos esto, esta maestría se hace posible en muy poco tiempo.\n¿Cuánto tiempo tomará este curso pasar de 0 a 100 o de principiante a avanzado a dominio?\nComo he mencionado, un monje Zen tardará años o incluso décadas en llegar allí. Sin embargo, con la práctica diaria y un poco de dedicación puedes llegar allí en meses y posiblemente incluso semanas con este curso de meditación. ¡Al final de este curso de meditación podrás meditar como un monje Zen y más!\nHablaremos de cómo hacemos esto extensamente dentro del curso ...\nEntonces, ¿cuánto tiempo necesitarás cada día para este curso de meditación?\nTengo estudiantes en más de 70 países y no te voy a vender un curso de meditación que diga \"aprender mediación en 3 minutos al día\", porque si simplemente respiras profunda y profundamente durante 10 a 20 respiraciones que duran aproximadamente 3 minutos, es esto ¿meditación? ¿O una pequeña técnica de relajación? Realmente me molesta cuando las personas venden la relajación como meditación. No porque las técnicas no sean lo mismo:\n¿Puedes entrenar para elevar peso muerto a una barra de 300 kilogramos levantando una barra de 90 kilogramos? ¡Levantar 90 kilos es bueno, pero no es lo mismo que levantar 300 kg!\n¿Puedes entrenar para correr una maratón de 50 km corriendo 1km por día? Correr 1 km puede ser una buena cantidad de ejercicio para algunas personas, pero no le permitirá correr un 50k.\nEste es un curso de meditación serio para personas que toman en serio el deseo de aprender meditación rápida y efectivamente.\nEste curso de meditación comienza en el nivel cero en poco más de 15 minutos al día y si desea permanecer en 15 minutos porque lo encuentra suficiente para sus necesidades, ¡está absolutamente bien!\nSin embargo, si desea convertirse en un meditador avanzado o incluso dominar la meditación para obtener los verdaderos beneficios, este curso de meditación le llevará hasta 1 hora por día, si lo desea.\nDicho esto, una vez que hayas dominado la meditación:\n¿Puede usarlo por 3 minutos a la vez? ¡Oh si! Una meditación de 3 minutos es increíble y la diferencia entre eso y una técnica de relajación de 3 minutos es, bueno, ¡incomparable!\nPara poder tener una atención constante, necesitamos calma. Para tener una mente tranquila en todo momento, necesitamos tener el control y ser dueños de eso. Entonces, la atención plena solo se produce una vez que dominamos nuestras mentes. Entonces desde aquí podemos pasar de la atención constante a la iluminación constante.\nEntonces, si has leído toda esta página y sé que mucha gente no querrá darles una pequeña propina extra para aquellos de ustedes que han llegado aquí:\nUna vez que te hayas matriculado en el curso de meditación. Si tienes un resfriado o cuando tienes uno, medita con la pista 7, por el tiempo que tengas. Haga esto concentrándose en su tótem, enfocando su atención ya sea en su área del ombligo (su ombligo) y / o en la raíz de su lengua (una especie de frente de su garganta). Vea cómo se siente después. Y házmelo saber a través del servicio de mensajería interno de Udemy. (Usar esta meditación en mí vale muchas veces más de lo que cuesta el curso)\nGracias y te veo en mi curso de meditación.\nAlgunas reseñas de personas que han tomado el curso:\n\"Me encantó el curso. Soy un profesor y tengo un trabajo muy estresado. Escuché el primer audio y debo decir que fue un poco extraño. Pero definitivamente me sentí mejor después. Muy gracioso. Supongo que me llevará algo Solía hacerlo. En cuanto al curso, fue bien explicado y las opiniones de los profesores son muy diferentes a las que estoy acostumbrado, pero tienen sentido. Mencionan que hay más cursos en preparación. Y los estoy esperando. \"",

It will enable you to understand how the Chakra system helps in increasing our body’s vibrations and frequencies and what are the different Chakras and how they affect our existence.\nThe course will enable you to have a basic understanding of the relationship between energy, energy bodies and Chakras. It is only when they are aligned together that we can achieve balance in our existence. You will also understand how the study of the Charka system is a scientific practice and not merely a spiritual or religious one.

      "description": "Meditation Teacher / Guide Certification (ACCREDITED) 2024\nTeaching others requires more than understanding how to meditate. Debra has been teaching meditation since 2008 India study travels and has taught at retreat centers, yoga studios, and coaching 1-1 online. She is certified in Instructional Design curriculum development which means this course has all material to become the best meditation teacher. This is for those wanting a thorough curriculum to teach others not just learn meditation themselves. Nothing was overlooked in creating this course from guiding in-person diverse groups - writing - recording - marketing. This course is a deep dive into teaching many styles including mindfulness, silent, mantra, and guided. Be the absolute best meditation teacher you can be with this accredited certificate course from a trained meditation teacher with experience in teaching in person and creating recordings. Learn to intuitively teach your best style of meditation (or send samples in to Debra) and get the best training possible to best help students. You can become a well-trained meditation teacher and learn to use the tools of microphones, software recording, stage presence, and publishing in the 64+ lessons. Get Q&A with all subjects and help finding your own voice and style. No matter the style of meditation you prefer, the thorough (yet straight-to-the-point) lessons of this course will help you. Do not stay stagnant with guided meditation practice only- explore many types of mindfulness and meditation.\n\n\nWith personal experience with PTSD and neurodiversity, Debra understands why meditation should be lead with knowledge how to speak and lead those. Tone of voice and safe space are often left out of training and group meditations... yet it is quick to learn. Many of the tools can even help people that say they can't practice due to ADHD (we all have distracted minds now).\nSeveral mental health providers have praised this course for how well it helps them with guiding patients or groups. An important take away is how to lead those with anxiety or in a large group. That is important work.\n\n\nThere are over 64 lessons discussing meditation and guiding. Why to practice, how to meditate, how to sit, how to put your hands, whether to lie or sit, where to look, and how to even schedule this in your busy day.\n\n\nThe second half of the course teaches you how to offer meditation to others. It covers all of the main things needed to teach. The subjects of teaching, finding space to teach, guiding those in class with traumas, finding your voice, speaking with confidence, energy healing voice, recording for apps, and how to sell and market yourself are covered. It also details why to teach meditation and that it is not all about money... but why it is okay to charge to meditation. There is a proper certification exam with a meditation recording approval at the end of the course.\nAfter completing, you can send messages to get intuitive, knowledgeable coaching about what type of meditation teaching suits you. Past students have developed creative meditations to share with the entire world on YouTube and apps.\n\n\nNot just Udemy recorded lessons! Live video Q&A to help your learning and add on to any style of meditation you wish to hear more about.\n\n\nHow this course stands out:\nThrough the Udemy message board, you have the ability to get advice from the teacher always within 24 hours and other students- about scripts or YouTube or meditation apps or to connect to a meditation teacher community. This allows us to learn together. This course was designed by an instructional designer to be very thorough in teaching everything you need to know in a visually pleasing manner with nearly 4 hours content.\nCertification:\nA Udemy certificate is given automatically after completion. A 2nd accredited certificate is offered for free through the submission of a simple recorded meditation sample to Debra (not required for certification but adds proof you tested). Do not worry- audio quality is not judged unless requested by the student. **Again, 2nd certificate or sample submission is not required to get Udemy branded certificate but Udemy is not an accredited school.**\n\n\nHow to get a better practice yourself? Get tips in setting a practice. Recorded meditations from Debra Wilder are included to practice with. Learn how to meditate silently without guided meditations or music. Learn tips that can help you think less in meditation.\n\n\nHeal your body and increase energy with relaxing breathing exercises, chakras, and visualizing meditations.\n\n\nAll of the main styles of meditation are covered. You can also use it to assist in teaching another style. The tips work for all.\n\n\nThe technical parts of teachings are covered such as choosing microphones and how to edit audio specifically for guided meditation.\n\n\nAs a teacher of meditation, you will have a grounded spot to offer your style of teaching. You can teach in-person at studios, retreats, your workplace or go strictly online. I cover everything I have learned in my teaching since 2009.\n\n\nWhat is mindfulness? How is it different than meditation?\n\n\nHow do you teach classes with trauma or PTSD students? Why is it highly important to know especially after 2020? Should they have eyes open or closed? Are group classes for everyone? Is chanting for everyone? Silent? People with higher anxiety and PTSD have special needs normally ignored in meditation programs. Even guided meditations can be too much for introverts unless done in a certain manner. Let's make meditation accessible for all.\n\n\nThe transitional time of 2022 requires knowledge of how to teach for transitions... leaving work-from-home, making new friends, crowded areas, new careers, dating, and mindfulness around challenging transitions.\n\n\nHow do you instruct in a pleasant way rather than jarring way or uncertainty?\n\n\nThis course teaches deeper than other courses: focus, rewiring the brain, PTSD, anxiety, teaching in office settings, and making more money teaching private coaching.\n\n\nWith the course, you will expect a high level of broad knowledge, a certification that includes a listening of your meditation sample with insight and support. You will have gone through everything to be an excellent teacher or guide of meditation. Studios, phone apps, tech offices, and workshop students will be gifted with your expert offerings in this thorough course. You will receive a Udemy certificate and one from Debra's school.\n\n\nThis would cost high ticket elsewhere, but it is offered here at a price to make it accessible worldwide per country to everyone.\n\n\nDebra Wilder has been teaching meditation since going to train in India in 2008 and later opening a meditation center. She is certified as a teacher trainer through Laughter Yoga International University (India) and several yoga teacher training programs as well as a Tantra meditation teacher. She began practicing meditation in 2003 from books, local yoga ashrams and Buddhist centers. In 2008, she traveled to India and Asia learning meditation and then teaching in retreat centers. Meditation not only helped her in self-development but her career in E-Learning instructional design which requires high amounts of detailed focus. She practices and teaches many different types of meditation, but her primary two are silent meditation and Tantra energy movement meditations (which she is one of few in the world who teaches). No matter your background or your student's background, she can offer a style of meditation that works. She believes that as meditation guides we help people and help the world be better. You can count on the most thorough course possible with quick responses to questions and samples. She lives in St Pete, Florida offering meditation.",

I had the pleasure of working with her most of last year and I can honestly say, her teachings have left a huge impact. She combines many modalities in her teachings keeping the learning curious, fun and creative. I highly recommend working with it. It’s totally worth it. You see changes immediately! -- Sheila M., New York\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKanwal truly is an incredible and inspiring coach. She brings out the best in you. Every session is insightful, filled with aha moments. I always get some major breakdown in each session and feel like I am making progress. I no longer feel held by my limitations and childhood traumas. The meditation coaching has been insanely powerful. Thanks Kanwal. I can’t thank you enough. -- Allen S., Los Angeles\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI was going through a spiritual awakening I wasn’t aware of when I spoke to Kanwal. She explained to me the phases of the awakening and how most it was normal. She told me to feel into all of it and welcome it. The resistance I felt and the need to control my outcomes and reality was holding me back from surrendering and trusting in the universe. We continue to have our sessions weekly and I learn more about myself and my spiritual awakening. It’s such an amazing experience. -- Samantha K., New York\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI was skeptical at first because I had never tried coaching like this. After one session with her, I realized how much I was lying to myself and that it was time to be honest with myself. I was letting my fears hold me from achieving my dreams and realizing my purpose. I can’t believe I didn’t start sooner. I am so so so so grateful to Kanwal for her wisdom, knowledge, love and support. She does this thing about “acknowledging” which makes such a huge difference. I have learned so much, where do I even begin with. :)  -- Hailey S., London",

      "description": "Meditation: Complete Meditation Guide For Beginner’s\nMeditation should be a practice that anyone can benefit from. Unfortunately, there is a lot of confusion and complication around this simple practice. This course will make it clear, simple and easy for you to meditate.\nMeditation techniques are often taught in a very rigid way. These leads people to believe that the only way to meditation is through a Buddhist meditation practice, zen or somatic meditation.\nThis course will teach you simple, effective meditation practices that transcend a specific discipline, giving you a clear way to understand and utilize any meditation practice you come across.\nWhat is Meditation?\nFirst, meditation is a balancing and focusing technique. We experience life through polarities relative to us, Here/There, Good/Bad, Inner/Outer, Me/Other, and so forth. The balance between our Inner Self and the Outer World is most important for a complete or whole life experience. Unfortunately, for most, we spend the vast majority of our time focused on the outer world, like on our devices, with little time spent getting to know and understand our inner world.\nWhen balance increases, our inner world awareness expands, and all the benefits of meditation begin to unfold. When you meditate, it is an internal focus held consciously in duration, opposed to an external focus.\nMost of us live a fast-paced modern lifestyle with a focus on the objective or out there world. The result is that we miss our inner experience happening simultaneously. Meditation, with its internal focus, emphasizes the inner, subjective polarity of experience. A consistent meditation practice, then, helps create a balance between our external and internal experience.\nAs you create more balance, you gain insights about yourself. The separation between yourself and the outer world diminishes, and you begin to see your connection between the inner me, and the outer them. Differences continue to reduce as you see and feel your connection to everyone and everything. Unity begins to emerge as a moment-to-moment, living experience.\nWith consistent balance from meditation, you become more aware and present in the moment to whatever is happening in your life. You will continue to watch the external world as you develop the capacity to remain aware of your inner world simultaneously. The illusion of separation gives way to the experience of being one with the world.\nTime given to daily practice and the time it takes to get into a meditative state are crucial considerations, especially when you have to factor in our fast-paced world. What you give is what you get. The more you meditate; you will experience the transformation within and see it reflected in your outer life.\n\n\nWhy learn about meditation?\nIn a world where everything is changing so rapidly, knowing how to stay grounded in yourself is of the essence, for your health and life enjoyment. Meditation is a profoundly grounding practice. It will help you access a state where you feel calm, clear-minded, and able to navigate your life's circumstances with ease. As such, it truly is a life skill.\nMeditation has been shown to lower high blood pressure, relieve stress, anxiety, depression, increase focus, creativity, productivity, and more.\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN?\n· How to Establish the Correct Mindset for Meditation\n· How to Calm Your Mind Through This Easy Practice\n· How to Clear the Obstacles to Meditation: Eliminating the 7 Most Common Myths\n· How to Prepare for Effective Meditation\n· How to Overcome All the Common Distractions and Obstacles to Meditation\n· How to Meditate Effectively by Understanding & Applying the Key Attitudes of Meditation for Deeper Practice\n· How to Practice Meditation in Your Everyday Life for Greater Peace & Daily Relaxation\n· How to Meditate for Beginners\n· How to Deal with Anxiety in Meditation & Day to Day\n· How to Correctly Develop a Consistent Meditation Practice\n· How to Practice Meditation the Easy Way\n· How to Practice the 4 Main Types of Meditation\n· How to Sharpen Your Concentration for Greater Mental Clarity & Focus\n· How to Establish Trust for Better Meditation & Greater Peace of Mind\n· Mindfulness Meditation Techniques for Daily Relaxation & Greater Self-Awareness\n· Guided Meditation: \"Your Journey to Peace & Stillness\"\n· Guided Meditation: \"Opening Your Heart and Learning Unconditional Self-Love\"\n\n\nI welcome you to learn these powerful breathing techniques to heal yourself naturally with minimum effort in a smart way to create a healthy, vibrant and peaceful life for yourself.",

The conference was a confluence of all service providers & researchers willing to contribute to and discuss solutions for the Mental Health issues that the American society is facing today. The attendees included Medical Personnel, Yoga Instructors, Meditation Experts, Researchers and a wide array of alternate therapy providers.\n\nThe consensus of the conference was that Meditation could be the key to solving the crisis that the American Society (and the world in general) is facing to tackle Mental Well-Being.\n\nExcept, the concept of Meditation is considered esoteric in the west. And a systematic demystification is needed for people to understand that Meditation is well studied in the scientific literature.\n\nThis course summarizes the available key research on Meditation and its benefits. The student is walked gently through the various steps and offered motivation to learn this important Self Help skill of Meditation.",

      "description": "This course is run by renowned five-time author and international teacher Suryacitta Malcolm Smith. Suryacitta is known for his simplicity and clarity of teaching.\n\"Suryacitta, probably the best mindfulness teacher in the UK.\" Ed McBain\nThis is not just another mindfulness course. Its purpose is not just to tell you about mindfulness but to support and encourage the transformation of yourself, and thereby your relationships.\nMindfulness is often taught as a way to fix your life as though life were a problem and it can be fixed. The problem is not life but the fact that our minds are confused. Because of this basic confusion, we suffer in many ways. One way, for example, is that without fail, have a very fixed picture in our heads of how life should be. Not only that, we also have a picture of how we believe we should be and how other people should be. This is the problem. Life will never meet our picture of it for very long because life is unpredictable and uncertain and when it doesn’t meet our demands we get upset, angry, sad, frustrated and so on. We cling to our limited and fixed view of life and this is the problem.\nOn this course, Suryacitta will show you how you create and cling to your picture of life, and more importantly how through mindfulness you can begin to let go of this picture. Once you begin to see your picture as a simply a picture, you naturally relax, and are able to enjoy the richness of life and be at ease with the unpredictability of it.\nDuring this course, Suryacitta takes profound truths of life and makes them accessible and easily understandable for all. The teachings are simple, direct and practical without jargon and unnecessary complexity.\nOn completion of this course, you will receive a certificate of completion from Mindfulness CIC Suryacitta's non-profit mindfulness company in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nWHO THE COURSE IS FOR\nThe course is suitable for complete beginners who are interested in learning mindfulness from an experienced practitioner and teacher.\nIt is suitable for those with a practice who feel stuck and want to shift their practice to a deeper level.\nIt is suitable for anybody wanting to learn mindfulness then to move onto Suryacitta’s How to teach mindfulness with confidence and ease teaching training programme on Udemy.\n-----------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS\nThe course is organised into eight teaching sessions with a guided meditation for each. The themes covered include:\n\n\nThe Jewel in the ice - we start the journey with a beautiful image, that of a jewel in a block of ice. The jewel representing your essential nature of ease and joy. And the ice representing your barriers to accessing this precious jewel of joy. Suryacitta shows how to melt the ice and gain access to your birthright of joy and ease.\nBeing at Home - Your body, this present moment is your true home, however, most of the time you are away from home living in your head.

You can easily incorporate these highly effective methods into your daily lives and benefit from them. And also teach others once you have fully experienced them deeply.  You will learn about Mantras, Chakras, Sound Healing, and Breathing meditation. Each chapter has Guided Meditation as part of it, and the course makes you experience wellness, relaxation, healing and bliss. Practicing these techniques regularly helps remove stress, tension from the mind and eventually from the body.\n\n\nMeditation is a powerful tool for healing, calming the mind and soothing the soul. By focusing inward, we release emotional blockages and quiet the noise of the world. Regular practice reduces stress, anxiety, and pain, promoting inner peace and balance. As we breathe, visualize, and let go, our energy shifts, allowing us to heal on a deeper level. Meditation nurtures self-awareness, compassion, and resilience, helping us navigate life's challenges with greater ease. Through stillness, we find the strength to heal, renew, and emerge transformed, more whole and at peace. Inner calm becomes a sanctuary.\n\n\nAfter you finish the course, do find time everyday to meditate.",

Mindfulness also lowers anxiety, blood pressure and stress levels. Meditation helps you sleep. All fundamental pieces for high performance at any task in life. Although the main reason to have a mindfulness practice is to understand the nature of conscious awareness. This part is sometimes clouded by overly spiritual meditation practices and teachings. Some of which are a bit \"out there\". In this course you will learn about the best way to get into mindfulness meditation. All based on concrete science and established experience.

My main goal is to simplify MEDITATION for anybody!\nThe objective is to share with you the spirit of meditation for you to infuse the essence, the spirit of it the ins, and the outs to assimilate better.\nI will share my 20 years of practice through the main currents and schools:\n1-Vipassana,\n2-Zazen,\n3-Meditation Transcendental,\n4-Mindfulness,\n5-Visualization.\nAmong them, I will give you a maximum of tips, advice to avoid the main obstacles: like the difficulties to focus and concentrating on something in order not to be a victim of your overthinking mind (the monkey mind). We will see many different technics and themes clearly explained with some different supports: pictures, oral explanations, music, and videos.\n\n\nThis class is a synthesis of the major techniques of meditation on the planet (having been taught in different temples in the world: India, China, Sri Lanka, Laos…) (still and in motion…) with the desire to facilitate your teaching and to save time.\n\n\nThe objective is that you love meditation and it becomes a part of yourself, a physiological need bringing you new perspectives, a new grid of reading the \"Great book of Life\". The main goal of learning meditation is to give you a source of inward and outward harmony for you to come back to your center (“medium” = \"the center\" in Latin > to meditate): to dig down your inner self and activate your higher self which is a bridge with the outer world.\n\n\nIn the end, meditation will change your existence bringing you a good balance of life and more inner peace.\nNB: In addition to that, as a kind of bonus and for free, I share with you my YouTube channel\nJust type “Aurelien Millot Master Key(s)” you will find it. It is for opening your mind, discovering new perspectives of life in general for those who are on a certain quest for the meaning of life… to continue this Awakening adventure.\nWishing you all the best\n\n\nWith Light & Love\nAM",
