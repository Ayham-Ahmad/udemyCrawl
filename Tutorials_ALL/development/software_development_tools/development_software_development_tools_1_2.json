Once a feature is working well locally, or maybe its a completed bug fix, we push the code to whatever GitHub branch that is managing the code. Our remote instance then pulls the code from GitHub.\nThere are two ways for getting the code to the live server from GitHub. You can either Pull the code manually or you Automate with GitHub actions. Either way, this is a very effective process that will ensure your custom app is safe and any customization you do is being launched smoothly.\nThis is all taken care of in this series.\nTOPICS COVERED\nIntroduction\nWalk-through\nFinalizing the installation of Local and Remote Instances\nCreating a custom app and pushing the code to GitHub\nCreating a DocType and pushing its code to GitHub\nGetting custom app from GitHub to our remote/cloud server\nMaking a change to the DocType and deploying the changes to the cloud server with bench migrate",

It provides version control through Git, which allows developers to keep track of changes to their code, collaborate with others, and easily roll back to previous versions if needed. GitHub also offers a range of features, such as issue tracking, project management tools, and code review capabilities, to help teams work together more effectively. It has become a popular platform for open-source software development and hosts millions of projects, ranging from small personal projects to large enterprise software.\n\n\nWhy GitHub is used for software development:\n\n\nVersion Control: GitHub uses Git, which is a powerful and widely used version control system. It allows developers to keep track of changes to their code and collaborate with others, ensuring that everyone is working on the same version of the code.\nCollaboration: GitHub provides a platform for developers to work together on projects, whether they are in the same office or on opposite sides of the world. Teams can easily share code, review changes, and collaborate on new features.\nCommunity: GitHub is a hub for open source projects, providing a platform for developers to contribute to projects created by others. This fosters a community of developers who can share knowledge and collaborate on projects.\nCode Review: GitHub provides tools for code review, allowing team members to easily review and comment on each other's code. This helps ensure that code is of high quality and meets the project's requirements.\nProject Management: GitHub provides tools for project management, including issue tracking and milestones. This allows teams to keep track of project progress, identify and prioritize issues, and set goals for the project.\nIntegration: GitHub can be integrated with many other tools and services, such as continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools, which help automate the development process and ensure that code is deployed to production environments quickly and efficiently.\n\n\nHigh-level overview of what you will learn:\n\n\nGit: Git is a popular version control system that allows you to track changes to code and collaborate with others.

Students will emerge at the end with a very solid understanding and hands-on experience with Git and GitHub.\nCourse Organization\nThe course is divided into four major components:\nIntroduction and Setup\nLearning Git Source Control\nAll About GitHub\nEach one of the above components spans multiple sections in this course.\nIntroduction\nThe Introduction provides a welcome to the course including some useful tips for getting the most out of taking the course and how the course is designed. That is followed by the Core Concepts which go over some critical theory before diving straight into Git.\nAfter the introduction and core concepts, the first thing we do is a Quick Installation for both Windows and Mac.\nLearning Git Source Control\nIn The Basics, we walk through all the foundational commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable Git for an existing project) all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files. We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally being committed and how to review your repository's history.\nWith a strong foundation in place, we explore some more Advanced Git topics like comparing differences, branching and merge resolution, tagging special events, saving work in progress, and even a bit of time travel.\nAll About GitHub\nThe main part of this course is all about GitHub. We will explore GitHub in-depth from a source control hosting repository perspective.\nIn Welcome to GitHub, we start off exploring some of the basic features of GitHub by creating a fresh repository and associating our local repository with it. Then, we prepare for the remainder of the course by setting up SSH Authentication, which we will use from this point forward. After that, we continue looking at the GitHub Repository, including many of the same operations we performed locally but done directly within GitHub. Then in GitHub Repository Branches, we dive into how Branches on GitHub and our local system work with each other.\nAfter we have comprehensively covered how GitHub repositories work, we focus on how GitHub Tags and Releases work and their relationship with local tags in Git. We can then use tags/releases while Comparing Differences on GitHub.\nWe start tying things together in Social Coding where we join other projects on GitHub by forking and then submitting our contributions back using pull requests.\nOnce part of a team, you might use GitHub Issues to track defects or enhancement requests.\nSometimes you just need to share small parts of a file or a set of files but don't want to bother with a full Git repository. That is where GitHub Gists help out -- share just a snip of code or entire files.\nFinally, group related GitHub repositories with GitHub Organizations and manage permissions and access using teams.\nCourse Features\nAll tools have installation and configuration sections to ensure no one is left behind.\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide presentations are kept to a minimum.\nScreencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There are nearly 2 hours of screencast based video training in order to step through each command or action in sufficient detail.\nAll videos are available in high-quality 1080p / Full HD resolution for sharp and clear viewing on modern desktops and tablets.\nSeveral attachments and document lectures throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.\nMoving Forward\nThis course will expand periodically to include more topics, supporting materials, and first-class content! Some content may be in direct response to student feedback or discussions -- so get engaged with the course discussions feature!",

In addition to parametric objects and variants, recurring work steps can be automated.\nSuitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 10 lectures and 3 hours of content, you’ll learn all of the ALLPLAN PythonParts fundamentals and establish a strong understanding of the concept behind object-oriented programming.\nStudents completing the course will have the knowledge to create functional and useful Allplan PythonPart tools.\nComplete with working files and code samples, you’ll be able to work alongside the author as you work through each concept.\n\n\nWhat is Allplan Interactor?\nAn interactor is a simple, single-purpose object. Interactor provides a common interface for performing complex user interactions.\nThis PythonPart has a simple workflow, if you select any point in the Planview, it will create the model. To support these interactive request, Allplan have another type of Pythonparts, You can find them in 'Interactor Examples'.\n\n\nGetting started! - Get python!\nThe required Python version is already installed together with Allplan. The standard Python installation of Allplan contains all parts of the Python framework that are required to run the PythonParts supplied by Allplan. You can find it in the Allplan program directory under ...\\Prg\\Python.\nThe current Python version used by Allplan are:\nAllplan Version 2021:  Python Version 3.8.8 (64-bit)\nAllplan Version 2022:  Python Version 3.8.8 (64-bit)\nAllplan Version 2023:  Python Version 3.8.8 (64-bit)\nNote: Since Python package is already delivered with Allplan, you don't need to install it separately. If you however want to install it in your environment, make sure you have the appropriate version.\n\n\nINCLUDE THE TOOLS AND EXAMPLES IN LIBRARY:\nThere are many useful PythonPart tools and examples included in the Allplan installation. They are located in the folders:\n....\\etc\\Examples\\PythonParts for the pyp files\n....\\etc\\PythonPartsExampleScripts for the py files\nThe easiest way to start using them is to include them in Allplan's Library Palette. To do that, add the path of the pyp files to the External folder.\n\n\nINSTALL THE RIGHT IDE\nYou can edit your Python code with a normal text editor but for a better effinciency we strongly reccomend using a proper Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. Those will help you by the development by checking and debugging your code. There are many IDEs available but in this tutorial we are going to focus on the two most common ones.\n\n\nWe reccommend following extensions to be installed for the development of PythonParts:\nPython: extension for code formating, refactoring, unit test and more\nPylance: a performant, feature-rich language server for Python\nPython Indent: for correct Python intendation\nPylint: tool for linting your python code\nStudio Icons\nWith Allplan PythonParts, the scripting of reinforcement is far more efficient.",

SPAs….. SPAs…..\n\nSPAs….. SP Apps…..  Single Page Apps……\nMost of Web Apps & Mobile Apps are Single Page Apps. And, We have famous UI frameworks for building SPAs like AngularJS,  KnockOut, BackBone, Mercury etc.\nWhat about Salesforce? That is why we have the “LIGHTNING EXPERIENCE” UI in the salesforce.  (The old UI which we have been using is “classic experience”.).\nThen, What is this Lightning Component Framework?\nThe Lightning Component framework is a UI framework for developing dynamic web apps for mobile and desktop devices. It’s a modern framework for building single-page applications engineered for growth.\nThe framework supports partitioned multi-tier component development that bridges the client and server. It uses JavaScript on the client side and Apex on the server side.\nWhen there are famous JS UI Frameworks such as AngularJS,  KnockOut, BackBone, Mercury etc, Why should I choose “Lighnting Component Framework”  ?\nBecause..\nThe benefits include an out-of-the-box set of components, event-driven architecture, and a framework optimized for performance.\nOut-of-the-Box Component Set\nComes with an out-of-the-box set of components to kick start building apps. You don't have to spend your time optimizing your apps for different devices as the components take care of that for you.\nRich component ecosystem\nCreate business-ready components and make them available in Salesforce1, Lightning Experience, and Communities. Salesforce1 users access your components via the navigation menu. Customize Lightning Experience or Communities using drag-and-drop components on a Lightning Page in the Lightning App Builder or using Community Builder. Additional components are available for your org in the AppExchange. Similarly, you can publish your components and share them with other users.\nPerformance\nUses a stateful client and stateless server architecture that relies on JavaScript on the client side to manage UI component metadata and application data. The client calls the server only when absolutely necessary; for example to get more metadata or data. The server only sends data that is needed by the user to maximize efficiency. The framework uses JSON to exchange data between the server and the client. It intelligently utilizes your server, browser, devices, and network so you can focus on the logic and interactions of your apps.\nEvent-driven architecture\nUses an event-driven architecture for better decoupling between components. Any component can subscribe to an application event, or to a component event they can see.\nFaster development\nEmpowers teams to work faster with out-of-the-box components that function seamlessly with desktop and mobile devices. Building an app with components facilitates parallel design, improving overall development efficiency.\nComponents are encapsulated and their internals stay private, while their public shape is visible to consumers of the component. This strong separation gives component authors freedom to change the internal implementation details and insulates component consumers from those changes.\nDevice-aware and cross browser compatibility\nApps use responsive design and provide an enjoyable user experience. The Lightning Component framework supports the latest in browser technology such as HTML5, CSS3, and touch events.",

Con este curso podrás adquirir o poner al día tu conocimiento sobre Git para saber cómo desempeñarte con esta herramienta que, si bien promete ser fácil, a veces presenta retos.\nPor otra parte, la facilidad con la que GitHub permite compartir software con el mundo en la forja de código más utilizada en este momento ha conseguido colocar a esta aplicación web como una de las formas favoritas de mucha gente de publicar software de código abierto, comunicar sus capacidades a reclutadores y entrevistadores cuando se busca empleo, y también moverse en el día a día una vez ya se tiene uno, tanto que muchos equipos de trabajo también lo utilizan en su día a día para realizar sus actividades.\nEste curso te contará lo que necesitas conocer sobre Git y sobre GitHub utilizando una manera de enseñar cercana y que te proporcionará conocimientos útiles que podrás aprovechar en tu día a día para mejorar como desarrollador, optar a puestos de trabajo, o moverte correctamente una vez tienes uno.\n\n\nTe invito a ver el temario completo, comprobarás que no es el típico curso donde únicamente se enseña las conceptos fundamentales sino que hay información extra\n\n\nAquí tienes una idea global de lo que se abarca en el curso a través de sus diferentes secciones\n\n\nIntroducción al curso\nEl propósito de este apartado es introducir al espectador a Git y GitHub, y razonar por qué son tecnologías tan importantes y competitivas hoy en día en las empresas, y de qué forma les pueden ayudar a hacer búsquedas de empleo o a ser más productivos en su día a día. Además, hay gente que tiende a confundir Git con GitHub, de modo que se incluye la diferencia entre Git y GitHub y se enseñan otras forjas que también usan Git pero que no son GitHub.\nPrimeros pasos con Git\nEste es el punto de partida en el cual se va a enseñar cómo instalar Git en el ordenador, se esté usando el sistema operativo que se esté usando. Además, veremos las distintas interfaces que tenemos para interactuar con Git según nuestras necesidades: gráficas, de terminal…\nIntegra Git en tu día a día\nEl propósito de este apartado es enseñar Git. Es la piedra angular sobre la que descansa el resto de contenido, por lo que es importante ser capaz de entender los conceptos clave, como las ramas, los commits o en general cómo realizar el trabajo usando Git. En este capítulo se incluyen tanto las tareas más esenciales que se van a necesitar con más frecuencia con Git, como tareas que no son tan importantes en el día a día pero que pueden ayudar a comprender mejor algunas partes o a mantener nuestro repositorio limpio\nUtilizando GitHub\nEsta es la sección en la que conectamos Git con internet y presentamos la forja de GitHub, donde el código se vuelve social. En este apartado creamos cuentas, repositorios, y hacemos sincronización en ambas direcciones entre el código del ordenador y el que hay subido a GitHub, y mostramos una a una las partes más importantes que tiene un proyecto de GitHub cuando estamos en su página web.\nFlujos de trabajo basados en hechos reales\nEn empresas y organizaciones que usan Git, suele existir una serie de protocolos o rituales que unifican la forma en la cual el equipo realiza su trabajo. En el caso de empresas que usen GitHub, este tipo de protocolos en muchos casos involucran usar la web, por ejemplo, para realizar una code review. Basándonos en la forma real en la que muchas empresas han adoptado hoy en día Git y GitHub aquí se presentan varias formas de realizar una tarea en su sitio web que nos pueden ser necesarias en el día a día.\nFlujos de trabajo típicos en empresas y proyectos Git\nUna visión sobre la forma en la que las empresas que han adoptado Git lo están usando en el día a día. Este apartado es útil para personas que vayan a trabajar en empresas o proyectos donde se use Git, para poder hacerse a la idea de cómo está estructurado el repositorio y así saber cómo navegar por el mismo o realizar su trabajo.\nMejora tu proyecto open source o portafolio\nNo todo es trabajar para empresas. Bien sea porque quieres contribuir al código abierto participando en proyectos establecidos que aceptan contribuciones a través de todo internet, compartir con el mundo un programa de software que has creado, o darte a conocer para mejorar tu imagen u obtener incluso la aprobación durante un proceso de selección, GitHub también puede ser una herramienta útil para trabajar de forma social en tus proyectos.\nSocorro, algo se ha roto\nUno de los principales inconvenientes de Git es que pese a su simpática interfaz inicial en los casos más favorables, cuanto peor vayan las cosas, más complicado será entender por qué. El propósito de esta sección es ofrecer algunas explicaciones y procedimientos para reparar los problemas más habituales que se suelen dar en repositorios de Git.\n\n\nA quién va dirigido este curso\nEste curso va destinado a personas que quieran aprender a utilizar Git, porque quieran o porque les sea necesario para el trabajo, la escuela o similares. Este curso también va destinado a personas que quieran aprender a integrar Git y GitHub en su día a día y aprovechar sus flujos como parte de procesos agile en el trabajo o también, por qué no, en la escuela.\nRequisitos mínimos\nPara poder seguir este curso deberías tener a mano código fuente con el que vayas a practicar, bien sea tuyo para integrarlo con Git, o bien sea algún proyecto de código abierto o de un equipo en el que te encuentres trabajando. Es ideal aunque no estrictamente necesario que sepas usar una terminal, ya que aunque en este curso se presenta el uso de Git desde entornos gráficos (fundamentalmente, Visual Studio Code), buena parte de la potencia se obtiene desde la terminal y se usan algunos comandos. Si no sabes usar una terminal, tengo un vídeo de anexo para ti para que le pierdas miedo, aunque es recomendable que tengas a mano recursos extra por si necesitas más ayuda. Para poder seguir este curso es muy recomendable conocer inglés.\n\n\nNos vemos!",

      "description": "ActiveMQ is a powerful yet easy to use open source message broker developed in Java. It is used to automate all kinds of communication between apps today. ActiveMQ can send messages in different formats along with providing you useful dashboards to get a birds eye view on who got which message!\nWhether your systems are built on monolith or Microservice based architecture, you need you data moving from one point to another and in good time. ActiveMQ does the job. ActiveMQ is like central hub where you send messages from all your applications, and the recipients pickup the messages, and process them. ActiveMQ can be compared to something like the Hub and Spoke model. Like a post-office it takes in, organizes, and delivers messages.\nWe will learn about the four key components of ActiveMQ -\n1)ActiveMQ Concepts: We will discover what messaging means and how it affects our architectural decisions and design considerations. Topics in this section range from understanding the different components of ActiveMQ to the different algorithms that can used to pick up messages. We learn about messages, queues and exchange patterns.\n2)ActiveMQ setup: Install and setup ActiveMQ. Integrate ActiveMQ with Java Spring applications to transfer messages.\n3)ActiveMQ features: Utilize the different options and capabilities of ActiveMQ. This includes features like authorization, topics, client acknowledgments, different messages types etc. We try to implement these features in practice and optimize them to best suit our needs.\nWe also utilize the ActiveMQ UI to understand the status of our messages and detect errors, if any.\nThe course will explain to you not only the theory of ActiveMQ messaging, but also provide a lot of hands-on coding exercises to get your hands dirty and your mind moving. Whether you are a messaging enthusiast, beginner, or experienced developer, this course will surely brings great value for you!\nEverything is well documented and separated, so you can find what you need. Assignments and Quizzes will make sure you stay on track and test your knowledge. The course will have a combination of theory and practical examples.",

Whenever a product is designed, it might a game, an Android app, iOS web, web project using Django, node, ruby etc, that product is not finished in one go. Every product needs revision that we commonly know as updates. In order to push those updates and test out many such features, a proper version controlling system is a must.\n\n\nWithout such a version controlling system, it tough to release anything new and keep track of it. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project, that was originally developed by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux operating system kernel. Git is so popular now that most IDE supports it as default.\n\n\nIf you want to work in any product based company, Git is an essential thing that you should be aware of. And git is way more than just 4 commands that most people are aware of. GIT comes with a lot of features like code tracking, branching, merging, stashing, forking, tags and lots of others.\n\n\nOne more thing, nowadays most companies are looking at uses Git online profile. It’s the easiest way to check your coding skills. You can upload your projects in the public domain and can prove your authority over that subject matter and can prove your skills even if you don’t have a company working experience. It’s something like you are creating your own experience and proving it with your git profile.\n\n\nAnother great feature of it is team collaboration. To build any great product you have to work in a team. Managing code files, while working in a team can be a nightmare. But with proper knowledge of GIT, you can work with your teammate. But remember, just by knowing 4 commands on GIT, you can make a mess for your entire team. Don’t be that person and understand what GIT is in detail.\n\n\nFurther, we will also explore about online repo’s of git such as Github, bitbucket, GitLab etc.\n\n\nSo, join me up and catch you inside the course.",

      "description": "Für diesen Kurs wird Docker Desktop von Docker benötigt (werden wir gemeinsam installieren). Wird der Kurs im Unternehmensumfeld eingesetzt, sollte vor dem Herunterladen von Software die Zustimmung des Arbeitgebers eingeholt werden.\n\"Auch außerhalb von Udemy, der mit Abstand beste Kurs um docker zu verstehen und für eigene Projekte nutzen zu können. Der Aufbau des Kurses ist super. Vielen Dank dafür!\" (★★★★★, Stefan Zöllner)\nLerne jetzt 2 der gefragtesten Technologien in der IT in einem Kurs: Docker und Kubernetes\nMit Docker kann deine Anwendung in einem \"Container\" ausgeführt werden. Was bedeutet das? Ein Container ist eine Umgebung, die von deinem Computer (Host) abgegrenzt ist, und in der dann deine Anwendung ausgeführt wird.\nDer Vorteil dabei ist, dass sich dieser Container einfach auf ein anderes System übertragen lässt - inklusive der gesamten Software & Konfiguration. Das spart dir eine zeitaufwendige Konfiguration des Produktiv-Servers.\nZudem ist durch den Container die Software-Umgebung der Anwendung genau spezifiziert. Sie wird dadurch überall genau gleich funktionieren - aufwendiges Debuggen nach Installation auf einem neuen System kann daher oft entfallen.\n\n\nDocker und Kubernetes:\nNeben Docker bekommst du in diesem Kurs auch einen Einstieg in die Welt von Kubernetes. Mit Kubernetes kannst du anschließend eine Anwendung aus Microservices in einer Cloud laufen lassen - eine hochmoderne und skalierbare Software-Architektur.\n\n\nFür wen ist dieser Kurs?\nDieser Kurs ist ideal für dich, wenn du als Entwickler oder Systemadministrator deine Arbeitsprozesse mit Docker verbessern möchtest. Als Entwickler kannst du mit Docker z.B. binnen ein paar Sekunden Python in einer spezifischen Version starten, und du kannst die Abhängigkeiten deiner Anwendung genau spezifizieren. Als Systemadministrator ermöglicht dir Docker ein vereinfachtes Deployment von deiner Anwendung.\n\n\nWas lernst du in diesem Kurs?\nDocker Grundlagen (was ist ein Container, ein Image)\nDateimanagement in Docker (Bind Mounts, Volumes, docker cp,...)\nNetworking in Docker (Port weiterleiten,...)\nDockerfiles: Baue eigene Images und führe deine eigene Anwendung in Docker aus\nDocker compose: Verwalte eine Anwendung aus mehreren Images\nDocker swarm: Führe deine Anwendung in einem Cluster aus\nKubernetes: Administriere eine komplexe Cluster-Architektur und führe dort Microservices aus\n\n\nDas hier ist ein Praxiskurs: Es gibt unzählige Beispiele, Übungen und Quizze. Dadurch enthält dieser Kurs keine trockene Theorie, sondern alles ist anschaulich und wird am Beispiel erklärt.\n\n\nSUMMA SUMMARUM\n\n\nDieser Kurs lohnt sich für alle, die ihren Workflow mit Docker optimieren möchten.\nLerne Schritt für Schritt Docker und Kubernetes, mit einem guten Mix aus Theorie, Praxis und Quizzen. Dieser Kurs bietet dir über 18 Stunden Video-Lektionen, die alle aufeinander aufbauen.\nSo lernst Docker und Kubernetes Schritt für Schritt und mit System.\n\n\nKlingt gut?\nDann würde ich mich sehr freuen, dir noch heute die Tür zu Docker und Kubernetes öffnen zu können.\nDu lernst mit dem erfolgreichsten, deutschsprachigen Dozenten auf Udemy.\nSchau dir auch meine Video Nachricht an, oder lies dir noch ein paar Bewertungen durch - überzeuge dich einfach selbst :)",

They look for consistent solutions to increase stability, quality, and profits. With DevOps and its Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery principles, companies have witnessed exponential business and technological growth. Most progressive startups and mature companies routinely implement the CI-CD principles in their automated software build pipelines. This ensures that their code is cleaner, deployments are faster, and delivery is reliable. As a result, business growth is guaranteed.\nSoftware enterprises that implement the CI CD strategy in their regular development lifecycle, gain higher profits and an edge over others. They are able to display their scale of innovation and growth in the field of technology.\nWhich tool underlines the significance of continuous integration and delivery in software development? Jenkins!\nJust look at these amazing numbers:\nAccording to a new research by TechBeacon, 2018, there is a strong demand for DevOps professionals as a growing number of organisations are implementing the development model in their organisations.\nAccording to recent data from jobs site Glassdoor , the national median salary for a DevOps engineer in the US is $110,000.\n60% of hiring managers are looking to fill DevOps engineer positions, according to the 2017 Open Source Jobs Report, a study conducted by The Linux Foundation and tech jobs site Dice.\n42% of companies responding to the Open Source Jobs study want to add DevOps skills across their hiring portfolio\nDevOps engineer ranks #2 on Glassdoor’s 50 Best Jobs in America rankings\nThere is already a shortage of cloud talent and this gap is growing rapidly. Simply put, there’s a massive opportunity for people like you to equip yourself with the right skillset so that you can:\nJoin talent-hungry tech companies and be at the forefront of global innovation\nLaunch unique businesses or cloud application development services for the next generation\nEnjoy plush paying cool DevOps projects\nWhatever your choice may be, cloud computing is going to be YOUR KEY to financial success and growth and for the success of the community as a whole!\nJenkins is a vast, highly efficient automation platform. You can accomplish a lot with Jenkins, and it requires minimal configurations. A dynamic, stable tool that gives you the freedom to explore and automate a wide variety of tasks. Using Jenkins, you can simplify sophisticated software processes through automated builds and test executions. You receive immediate feedback on the automation processes on Jenkins.

We give you step by step instructions and in fact, we hand hold you through all the exercises together with you. So you can follow along and understand exactly how everything comes together and what each step means.\nPractical demo tutorials – Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding of not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we focus on building up your understanding of the inner working of the Jenkins  for infinitely better results down the line.\nReal-world knowledge – We work with real startups and real projects every day. We know first hand the problems engineers and architects face on daily basis. All this real-world experience is passed on to you in the courses. Each module comprises of in-depth demos and walk-throughs, meaning you’ll garner enough skill to build your own container application adaptable to any environment, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.\nStudent support – We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven Jenkins course on the planet. So we are there for our students whenever you need our help. You can contact us any ask any question at any time - you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours.\nWhat if I don’t have any need for Jenkins course right now? - As the statistics and figures show – Cloud Computing and DevOps is rapidly expanding into our lives each and every day, meaning even though you may not be directly using Jenkins right now, sooner or later you will run into it inevitably. Can you imagine when Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity and people around him ignored it as an irrelevant phenomenon - how much the world will be missing out on? Same thing goes for tech – you would have been puzzled by the need for a “Smartphone” ten years ago, yet now we can’t imagine our lives without one. The true potential only becomes apparent in time, do you want to risk missing out?\nIs it too difficult for me to understand? - Not at all. We’ll take you step by step from a novice level to an expert on Jenkins. We work as technology leaders and mentors to several engineers every day. We know how to explain things and use the lingo. We just choose to teach in ways that are a lot more fun (and less headache-inducing). By the end of this course, you’ll be able to job scheduling and much more with Jenkins in your project and achieve amazing results.\nI am not an engineer, will this course still benefit me? - Whether you are a startup founder, a product manager or a project manager - it is quite likely that your organization is already using or will be using these technologies. Going through these courses will give you a deeper understanding about how your engineering team is using all the new technologies. You will be able to discuss the pros and cons of their technical approach with higher confidence.\nIs your IT career on the right track?\nWell, if you invest your time and bring an eagerness to learn, we guarantee you real, actionable education at a fraction of the cost you can demand as an IT engineer or consultant. We are confident your investment will come back to you in no time.\nSo, if you're ready to make a change and learn how to simplify sophisticated software processes through automated builds and test executions get instant feedback, click the \"Add to Cart\" button below.\nLet’s do this together!",

También aporta muchos beneficios y soluciona muchísimos problemas, por lo que sería más que interesante realizar nuestro curso de Node.js para obtener las bases, conceptos y habilidades necesarias que nos motiven a profundizar en sus opciones e iniciar la programación.\nNode.js fue creado por los desarrolladores originales de JavaScript. Lo transformaron de algo que solo podía ejecutarse en el navegador en algo que se podría ejecutar en los ordenadores como si de aplicaciones independientes se tratara. Gracias a Node.js se puede ir un paso más allá en la programación con JavaScript no solo creando sitios web interactivos, sino teniendo la capacidad de hacer cosas que otros lenguajes de secuencia de comandos como Python pueden crear.\nTanto JavaScript como Node.js se ejecutan en el motor de tiempo de ejecución JavaScript V8 (V8 es el nombre del motor de JavaScript que alimenta Google Chrome. Es lo que toma nuestro JavaScript y lo ejecuta mientras navega con Chrome). Este motor coge el código JavaScript y lo convierte en un código de máquina más rápido. El código de máquina es un código de nivel más bajo que la computadora puede ejecutar sin necesidad de interpretarlo primero, ignorando la compilación y por lo tanto aumentando su velocidad.\n\n\n¿Listo para aprender uno de los lenguajes más demandado en la industria de la programación?\n\n\nEl 89% de los estudiantes del curso también ha mejorado su situación laboral.\n¡Inscríbete ahora y desarrolla esa habilidad que te hace falta!\nTe garantizo que este curso es todo lo que necesitas para volverte un profesional en JavaScript. Estos son los pasos del éxito:\n1. Tomar todas las lecciones del curso.\n2. Realizar los ejercicios prácticos.\n3. Estarás listo para desarrollar soluciones con NodeJS en cualquier caso de la vida real.\n\n\nPreguntas frecuentes:\n1. ¿Necesito un software especializado o de pago para poder tomar el curso?\nR: No. Te guiaremos paso por paso en la instalación de cada una de las herramientas necesarias para el desarrollo adecuado del curso.\n3. ¿Necesito algún conocimiento previo para tomar el curso?\nR: No. Te guiaremos desde cero hasta desplegar tu proyecto en la nube como un profesional.\n4. ¿Qué podré hacer después del curso?\nR: Aprenderás los conceptos y fundamos de JavaScript, crearas un proyecto REST API con Node JS, lo conectarás a una base de datos en la nube y podrás concluir desplegando tu proyecto en el mundo real, internet.\n\n\nDeja de perder las oportunidades laborales por no tener mas habilidades.\nAñádete las habilidades que te harán brillar en el desarrollo de software.\nJavaScript es el lenguaje numero uno de internet, con los fundamentos que dominaras aquí lograrás introducirte también en el mundo del desarrollo web frontend con marcos como React, Vue o Angular. Después de este curso, te será sencillo comprender otros frameworks JavaScript.\n\n\n¡INSCRÍBETE AHORA y empieza a potenciar tu carrera!",

Learn how to run and manage Docker containers, build docker images, debug Docker issues and use Docker Compose to run multiple containers together.\nHave you encountered situations when an application worked on a developer's local machine but failed on other devices? Have you spent time diagnosing issues caused by misconfiguration? Are you frustrated with being unable to run code deployed in production on your local machine to diagnose production issues? Docker is here to help you in fixing these issues.\nContainerization is a way to run applications in an isolated environment called a container. Docker is a tool designed to make creating, deploying, and running applications using containers easier. Containers and Docker have become popular ways to package, deploy and run applications. They enable you to standardize the development workflow by codifying the instructions for building and packaging your applications.\nContainers and Docker can be confusing to beginners. There are a lot of concepts to learn, and it can be challenging to see how these concepts fit together. In this course, I have summarized my years of experience automating development workflow with Docker so that you can learn the essential skills faster and become productive from day one. This course helps you learn faster by explaining the bigger picture and the problems they solve and focusing only the on the essential skills used in the development workflow.\nEnroll now and begin the journey to becoming a more productive developer.",

We’ll then see the role of terraform in the today’s IT Infrastructure. We’ll then learn how to install Terraform, This is followed by the basics of HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Next we have our first lab where you’ll get your hands dirty with HCL syntax. We will then learn the basics of Terraform such as Providers, Input and Output variables, Resource Attributes and Dependencies.\nAfter this we take a look at state in terraform – what it is, why it is used and considerations to follow when working with state. We then dig deeper in to the fundamentals– starting with the different commands provided by Terraform. This is followed by a lecture where we understand the difference between Mutable and Immutable infrastructure. This is followed by lifecycle rules in terraform where we will learn how to manage the ways in which resources are created. This is followed by other basic topics such as datasources, meta arguments such as count and for each and finally understand version constraints in Terraform.\nAfter this we have a dedicated section on AWS. This section begins with optional lectures and demos where we learn the basics of AWS. – such as setting up an AWS Account and learning about some of the basic AWS services such as IAM, S3, DynamoDB. We will then see how to provision and manage these services using Terraform. Each of these topics, including the ones for AWS are followed by hands on labs where we get to practice the concepts on a real infrastructure.\nWe will then learn concepts such as remote state and state locking with Terraform and then see how to store state in a remote s3 backend. Next we will see how to use terraform state commands to manipulate the state file. We then have a few lectures and demos where we get introduced to EC2 service and learn how to provision it using terraform. Finally we will learn about provisioners in terraform - what they are, the different types, behaviour and considerations to follow when working with provisioners. We then look at resource taints, learn how to enable debugging and then import other resources in the management of terraform, Terraform modules - what they are, how to create them and also how to make use of modules available in the public terraform registry. We will then learn about functions and continual expressions in Terraform and how to test them using the terraform console. We will then learn about workspaces in terraform – what they are, how to create them and when to use them. We will wrap up the course with an introduction and high level overview of the features offered by Terraform cloud.",

To update records in the target table\nB. To perform calculations on data\nC. To search and retrieve related data from a dataset\nD. To sort data based on a specific condition\nCorrect Answer: C. To search and retrieve related data from a dataset\nExplanation: The Lookup transformation in Informatica PowerCenter is a powerful feature used to search and retrieve related data from a specified dataset. This transformation allows the mapping to access data in a relational table, view, or synonym. It can also access flat file sources. The primary use of the Lookup transformation is to perform lookups by joining data in input ports with columns in the lookup source. The lookup process involves matching input port values with lookup table column values to retrieve one or more related values. This capability is crucial for tasks such as validating data against a reference dataset, populating fields based on other fields in the input data, and implementing slowly changing dimension (SCD) logic in data warehousing scenarios. Unlike option A, the Lookup transformation does not update records in the target table; it is used for data retrieval. Option B and D, performing calculations and sorting data, respectively, are not the primary functions of the Lookup transformation.\n\n\nQuestion 2: In Informatica Administration, what is the purpose of creating a Repository Service?\nOptions:\nA. To enable version control for development objects\nB. To manage user access and security\nC. To execute workflows and sessions\nD. To organize and provide access to metadata\nCorrect Answer: D. To organize and provide access to metadata\nExplanation: The Repository Service in Informatica Administration plays a critical role in organizing and providing access to metadata within the Informatica domain. It is responsible for maintaining the Informatica repository, which stores metadata for Informatica objects such as mappings, workflows, and sources/targets. The Repository Service ensures that users can access this metadata for development, execution, and management purposes within the Informatica PowerCenter environment. It supports operations like checking in and checking out objects, viewing object history, and managing dependencies among objects. While version control (option A) is a feature supported by the repository, it is not the primary purpose of the Repository Service. Managing user access and security (option B) is handled by the Informatica domain's security model and the Administration Console, not directly by the Repository Service. Executing workflows and sessions (option C) is the responsibility of the Integration Service, not the Repository Service.\n\n\nQuestion 3: What is Data Profiling in Informatica Data Quality (IDQ)?\nOptions:\nA. Transforming data to meet quality standards\nB. Cleansing data by removing duplicates\nC. Analyzing the content, structure, and quality of data\nD. Loading data into a target data warehouse\nCorrect Answer: C. Analyzing the content, structure, and quality of data\nExplanation: Data Profiling in Informatica Data Quality (IDQ) refers to the process of analyzing the content, structure, and quality of data. This process involves examining the data available in a given dataset and assessing its quality and integrity before it is used in data integration or data quality projects. Data profiling helps identify inconsistencies, anomalies, and patterns in the data, such as missing values, duplicate records, and data type discrepancies. It provides valuable insights into data quality issues that need to be addressed, enabling organizations to make informed decisions about data cleansing, enrichment, and transformation strategies. Data profiling is a critical step in ensuring that data meets quality standards and supports accurate and reliable data analysis. While transforming data (option A) and cleansing data by removing duplicates (option B) are important aspects of data quality management, they are actions taken after data profiling. Loading data into a target data warehouse (option D) is a task associated with ETL processes, not directly related to data profiling.\n\n\nQuestion 4: Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using Pushdown Optimization in Informatica?\nOptions:\nA. Reducing the load on the Informatica server\nB. Minimizing network traffic between the Informatica server and the database\nC. Increasing the data processing speed by utilizing database resources\nD. Guaranteeing data consistency across multiple databases\nCorrect Answer: D. Guaranteeing data consistency across multiple databases\nExplanation: Pushdown Optimization in Informatica allows ETL processing to be performed within the database by generating and executing SQL statements. This feature leverages the database's processing power, which can lead to significant performance improvements, including reduced load on the Informatica server (option A), minimized network traffic (option B), and increased data processing speed (option C). However, Pushdown Optimization does not inherently guarantee data consistency across multiple databases (option D). Data consistency involves ensuring that data across different databases or systems remains synchronized and accurate, which is managed through other mechanisms and practices, such as data integrity constraints, transaction management, and data replication strategies. While Pushdown Optimization enhances performance by executing transformations in the database, ensuring data consistency across databases requires a comprehensive data governance and synchronization strategy.\n\n\nQuestion 5: What is the main purpose of the Change Data Capture (CDC) technique in Informatica?\nOptions:\nA. To archive old data that is no longer needed for analysis\nB. To perform real-time data integration and analysis\nC. To capture and process data changes in source systems\nD. To generate reports on historical data changes\nCorrect Answer: C. To capture and process data changes in source systems\nExplanation: The Change Data Capture (CDC) technique in Informatica is designed to capture and process data changes in source systems efficiently. CDC is a method used to identify and capture changes made to data in a database, such as inserts, updates, and deletes, without requiring a full data load. This technique allows for the incremental loading of data changes into the data warehouse or target systems, enabling more timely and efficient data integration processes. By using CDC, organizations can reduce the volume of data that needs to be processed and transferred, which minimizes the impact on system performance and enhances data freshness. The main purpose of CDC is not to archive old data (option A) or generate reports on historical data changes (option D), although it can indirectly support these activities by ensuring that only the most recent data changes are processed. While CDC can support real-time data integration and analysis (option B), its primary goal is to capture and process changes in data efficiently, rather than performing analysis per se.\n\n\nEnroll Now:\nJoin us on this journey to mastering Informatica and securing your dream job in the field of data integration and quality.

Of course, I made this course and want to sell it to you for profit, but that is not the first reason I made this course! I made this course for myself first. The main purpose of making this course is that it is like a notebook for my programming career path, firstly. In this notebook, I will always take notes of the experiences that I have learned during my study and work. The content of the course will always be updated by me in the way I keep a daily and weekly diary. I also want to share this notebook of mine with you by selling this course. Coming to this course, you will have a notebook recording all the experiences in the learning and working process of a developer in the profession (that's me - up to now I have more than 10 years working in the programming profession), and moreover, you will have this course will continue to be updated until I am still on this programming career path. Rest assured, I will stick with this programming path for a very long time, because it can be seen that I have been attached to it for more than 10 years, it has become an important part, a hobby, a passion in my life. If you are also curious or interested in this course, I invite you to open this diary of mine. Sincerely, thank you!\n\nAugment Code AI from Zero: Full Feature Tour and Android App Build\nBuild faster, ship better, and learn smarter with an end-to-end, hands-on course that takes you from first contact with Augment Code AI to delivering a production-ready Android feature. Designed for both newcomers and experienced developers, this course shows how a modern AI coding assistant can collaborate with you—explaining unfamiliar code, proposing refactors, generating tests, and even planning multi-file changes.\nYou’ll start by setting up Augment Code in your preferred IDE (Android Studio/IntelliJ, VS Code, or Vim/Neovim). From there, you’ll master the platform’s core capabilities: intelligent code completion, chat-based code understanding, semantic search and navigation across large repos, automated refactoring, and agent-driven task execution (from creating files to opening pull requests). You’ll also learn how to tailor the assistant to your project with Memories, Rules, and extended context (e.g., docs, schemas, design assets) so suggestions align with your architecture and standards.\nThe second half of the course is fully practical. We’ll integrate Augment Code into an Android project and use it to: scaffold UI with Jetpack Compose, navigate complex module layouts, diagnose crashes from stack traces, spot performance smells, generate unit tests, and automate repetitive edits. The capstone is a guided case study using Google’s open-source Now in Android app, where you’ll add a real feature, review the AI’s changes, and iterate to production quality.\nBy the end, you will be able to:\nInstall, configure, and confidently use Augment Code across popular IDEs.\nQuery and understand large codebases in minutes, not days.\nApply agent workflows to plan, implement, and review multi-file changes.\nAccelerate Android development with Compose, ViewModels, DataStore, and Navigation.\nImprove code quality via AI-assisted refactors, tests, and documentation.\nIntegrate external context (designs, specs, API docs) for higher-fidelity suggestions.\nWho this course is for\nBeginners who want a guided “pair programmer” to explain code and generate boilerplate.\nWorking developers who want to boost velocity, reduce defects, and standardise code at the team scale.\nFormat & Prerequisites\nHands-on demos, live coding, and guided labs; Android Studio recommended.\nBasic Kotlin/Java familiarity helpful, but not required—AI support keeps the learning curve friendly.\nOutcome\nWalk away with a clear, repeatable workflow for pairing with Augment Code AI—plus a functioning Android feature you built with an AI agent as your round-the-clock collaborator.\nThis course is assisted by Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools.",

This means that complex workflows can be created and executed completely in a Kubernetes cluster.\nIt provides a mature user interface, which makes operation and monitoring very easy and clear. There is native artifact support, whereby it is possible to use completely different artifact repositories (Minio, AWS S3, Artifactory, HDFS, OSS, HTTP, Git, Google Cloud Service, raw).\nTemplates and cron workflows can be created, with which individual components can be created and combined into complex workflows. This means that composability is given. Furthermore, workflows can be archived and Argo provides a REST API and an Argo CLI tool, which makes communication with the Argo server easy.\nIt is also worth mentioning that Argo Workflows can be used to manage thousands of parallel pods and workflows within a Kubernetes cluster. And robust repetition mechanisms ensure a high level of reliability.\nThere is already a large, global community that is growing steadily. Just to name IBM, SAP and NVIDIA. It is mainly used for machine learning, ETL, Batch - and data processing and for CI / CD. And what is also very important - it is open source and a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.\n\n\nUpon successful completion of the course, you will be able to create workflows using the core concepts of Argo Workflows. You will be confident to use the kubectl CLI and the Argo Server UI in order to communicate with the Argo Server and manage your workflows.",

This application is always used in organizations to manage employees. Some features of this application:\n\n\nAdd a new employee to the application\nNew/Existing users can add/edit personal information or skillset information by adding new skills to it.\nDepending on the skill set of an employee, allocate an employee to a project or allocate some percentage of the employee's work to a project\nRemove an employee from the application\n\n\n... and so on...\n\n\nSo, I've taken an example of the above application which I also made from scratch in one of the previous organizations. Hence, in this course, I'm trying to showcase a mini version of the above-explained application which is to:\n\n\nCREATE EMPLOYEES\nDELETE EMPLOYEES\nUPDATE EMPLOYEES\nVIEW EMPLOYEES\n\n\nThis course will really help you to gain exposure to what real-time applications look like.",

I designed it for anyone who has some basic DevOps and cloud (AWS) experience but they need hands-on labs to practice what they've learned.\nGet ready to take your Kubernetes, AWS, and DevOps knowledge and experience to the next level by exploring how real-world companies use these technologies\nIn this class, you will find very little theory and very much hands-on. It's important to understand how this course is designed before making the decision to enroll in it. For example, you will find many practical use-cases for Helm. But you will not find a reference to all Helm commands. I assume you already have some experience with that. I also assume that you have some Kubernetes and AWS knowledge so topics like StatefulSets, Deployments, Pods, and IAM roles, EC2 instances, and S3 buckets will not be explained from scratch.\nHaving said that, let's explore what this class covers:\nMore than one way to deploy Kubernetes on AWS. Although most companies choose the easy option which is using EKS for deploying Kubernetes, there are other ways available like kops. If you don't want to use a tool, you can even do it the hard way using kubeadm. We'll see how we can semi-automate the process using Terraform and Packer.\nWhen it comes to app-provisioning in Kubernetes, the list goes long. In section 2, we explore the most well-known app-provisioning tools. We start with Kustomize, then we move to Helm. Finally, we dive into the most sophisticated (yet, most powerful) way of Kubernetes app-provisioning: using operators. We'll learn about Kudo, which takes care of a lot of the heavy lifting for us.\nFor the rest of the class, we could not just continue with a Hello-World type of application. We needed something more complex yet easy to digest. So, we developed an application specifically for this class called \"The Weather app\". It's a microservices application that consists of three components. Written in Go, JavaScript, and Python, The Weather App will help you understand the DevOps concepts laid out in the rest of the course\nIn the CI/CD part of this class, we explore Gitlab, which is one of the most prominent tools out there. We create a simple CI pipeline then we gradually make it more complex by introducing continuous delivery and deployment.\nFinally, we explain how we can establish disaster recovery and data protection using EBS volume snapshots as well as using a third-party tool called Velero.\nI hope you will enjoy watching this class and doing the labs inside. As always, you have 30-days money-back guarantee, no questions asked. Go ahead and have a look at the preview videos, and enroll now!",

      "description": "Bienvenido al curso de Microservicios, aprenderás línea a línea y desde cero a construir un arquitectura de microservicios con Docker, Docker Compose, Multi-Container, Kubernetes, Spring Boot 3 y Spring Cloud Kubernetes, desde los conceptos más básicos hasta un completo ecosistema de servicios interconectados mediante el registro y escalamiento dinámico con Kubernetes (Integrado con Spring Cloud), Spring Cloud Gateway (puerta de enlace), balanceo de carga con LoadBalancer. Además de automatizar, escalar y desplegar en producción los microservicios en contenedores Docker y Kubernetes en Amazon AWS ECS y EKS.\nTambién aprenderás a dar seguridad y proteger las rutas endpoints de los diferentes microservicios con Spring Security OAuth2, JWT y nuevo Spring Authorization Server. Además aprenderás a centraliza toda la configuración de los microservicios utilizando Kubernetes ConfigMap y Secrets y muchos mas.\nDurante el curso también trabajaremos con varios componentes del ecosistema de Spring como IoC, Spring Boot, RestController, Servicios Web RESTful, cliente HTTP con Feing, Spring Data JPA e Hibernate para la persistencia y CRUD (crear, leer, actualizar y eliminar), usaremos bases de datos MySQL 8 y PostgreSQL, entre otros temas más.\nEl curso es completamente funcional con versiones de Java 8 y 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 y superiores.\n¿Qué son los microservicios?\nSon un enfoque de arquitectura y organización para el desarrollo de aplicaciones compuestas por pequeños servicios autónomos que se comunican a través de API RESTful, en otras palabras, nos permiten dividir nuestro gran sistema en una serie de componentes más pequeños e independientes que colaboran entre si.\nLa arquitectura de microservicios hace que las aplicaciones sean más simples de escalar, más rápidas de desarrollar y más fácil de reutilizar. Donde cada servicio está diseñado para un conjunto de funciones y se enfoca en resolver un problema específico, por ejemplo un servicio desarrollado para una determinada función se puede usar como un componente básico en otro microservicio.\n¿Porqué elegir nuestros cursos?\nAcceso 7 x 24 a nuestra Plataforma e-learning.\nSoporte online con profesor Java\nAl finalizar recibes un certificado digital\nSomos pioneros en brindarte este tipo de acceso para darte la libertad que necesitas para estudiar, donde quiera que te encuentres.\nExcelente relación calidad-precio.\nConocimiento aplicable a proyectos reales del mercado laboral.\nAtención rápida y satisfactoria a las dudas por parte del profesor.\nInteractividad del curso ya que contiene foros y comunicación para resolver dudas.\nTodos los materiales del curso están en español y al finalizar recibes un diploma UDEMY digital certificando tu aprobación con validez internacional y LinkedIn.\nSi quieres ser un desarrollador de arquitecturas de microservicios con Spring Boot 2 y Spring Cloud y avanzar al siguiente nivel, es casi obligatorio este curso, te invito a que te inscribas, nos vemos adentro.",

Group Policy and Active Directory are core components of Microsoft Windows Server, providing centralized management and configuration capabilities for networked computers and users. Together, they form the backbone of enterprise-level IT infrastructure, enabling administrators to control user environments, enforce security settings, and manage resources efficiently.\nActive Directory (AD) is a directory service that stores information about objects on a network, such as users, computers, printers, and groups. It is organized hierarchically into domains, trees, and forests. AD allows administrators to manage permissions and access to network resources. At its core, it supports authentication and authorization, ensuring that only approved users can access specific resources based on their roles and credentials. Domain Controllers (DCs) are servers that host AD services and respond to authentication requests from users and computers.\nGroup Policy (GP) is a feature of Windows Server that works closely with Active Directory. It allows administrators to define configurations for both users and computers within the domain. These configurations are specified through Group Policy Objects (GPOs), which can be linked to sites, domains, or Organizational Units (OUs). OUs are containers within Active Directory used to organize users and computers logically, making it easier to apply and manage policies.\nActive Directory and Group Policy are vital tools for managing Windows-based networks. While Active Directory provides the structure and authentication framework, Group Policy empowers administrators to enforce consistent and secure configurations across the environment. Together, they form a powerful combination for enterprise IT management.",

The services communicate via RESTful APIs or JMS messages.\nYou will learn how to compose each service into a Kubernetes Deployment. And then use Kubernetes Services to expose the microservices to each other.\nWith Kubernetes, it is a best practice to configure Readiness and Liveness probes. Since our services are persisting data, we will also configure a graceful shutdown to prevent any data loss.\nOne common issue with Microservices is logging. Each running instance will generate its own log output. Thus, it is common to use consolidated logging.\nA very common approach is to use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Elasticsearch is a full-text search engine. Logstash is used to get log data into a common format for Elasticsearch. And Kibana is a power data visualization engine. Together, these tools allow you to consolidate and search through your log data.\nIf you wish to see a realistic example of Spring Boot Microservices being managed in a Kubernetes environment, enroll in this course today!",

      "description": "**Note: Course in Beta Release, more lectures are being added and this is not the final release**\nHello and Welcome, this course is aimed to give you the basics you need to start working with windows IoT. Windows IoT was newly released by Microsoft which aimed to give you the ability to target and provide applications for your mini pc such as Raspberry Pi. Windows IoT supports the UWP (Universal Windows Platform, code once target many platforms) so you can have the ability to create apps that has the ability to run on different type of devices no problem what so ever. Also, this way you can save a lot of time since you code only once and target multi platforms.\nIoT recently been a big thing, having the ability to use cheap devices that is connected to the internet and being able to send and receive data. Since the raspberry pi and similar devices cost does not cross a 50 or even 100 USD they are a great choice to develop IoT projects and will provide enough flexibility and support so you can develop your project without any limitation.\n\n\nWindows IoT can make things a lot easier for .NET developer who aims to develop IoT projects. You can develop your project in C# and have it running on multi platforms. Windows IoT can be a great alternative instead of using the Linux operating system and trying to learn Python or other similar languages to develop IoT Projects.\n\n\nNow, of course you will be wondering is it worth it to take this course? According to Forbes (Source: Roundup Of Internet Of Things Forecasts And Market Estimates, 2016), the size of the IoT market will be 3.7 Billion Dollar. This number isn't small at all. And the field is relatively new and there are hardly a strong competition or a market leader. So you have a huge chance to rise quickly in this field.\nIn this course:\nYou will be able to install and control Windows IoT\nYou will learn how to develop IoT Applications\nSee some advanced commands that you can use in Windows IoT\nHow to connect to sensors and modules to read values\nSo, what you are waiting for? Join us now and learn Windows IoT and start your IoT Project.",

      "description": "This course will help you understand the basics of SRE, a methodology for application development and service operation proposed and practiced by Google, and will be a great reference for promoting cloud computing in your company.\n\n\nIn recent years, some companies have begun to consider implementing site reliability engineering (SRE) or have already done so and found it to be effective for their business.\n\n\nFor example, what would you do if you were in charge of operations team and faced with a situation where a service that is currently running with 5 operations team members and 4 servers needs to handle a 20-fold increase in users in 2 years? Even if you manage to achieve it, it is easy to see that it will be impossible to keep doing it this way for good. Google's SRE approach is a very rational and practical way to maintain current scalability while continuing to release more and more services every day, serving over 2 billion users worldwide.\n\n\nSRE is not something that can only be applied to Google, but is a very useful concept for all companies and engineers who use the cloud to develop, release, and maintain their products. This presentation is designed to help those who are currently in charge of or leading DevOps, engineers who actually write code and develop applications, and those who have no programming or development experience understand the new concept of SRE in an easy-to-understand manner. I hope that you will be able to follow along with me to the end.",

      "description": "This course is a comprehensive and hands-on guide designed to take you from an absolute beginner to an intermediate LabVIEW programmer, step by step. Whether you're a student, engineer, or hobbyist, this course provides a complete foundation in LabVIEW—the industry-standard graphical programming language used in test, measurement, automation, and industrial control applications.\nStarting with the basics, you will become familiar with the LabVIEW environment, its tools, and its visual programming structure. From there, the course gradually introduces core programming concepts such as data types, Boolean logic, arithmetic operations, loops (for and while), case structures, and arrays. You’ll learn how to manipulate arrays using LabVIEW’s powerful built-in functions and how to read/write data to and from text files—critical for data logging and report generation.\nThe course then progresses to intermediate and LabVIEW-specific concepts such as the creation and use of SubVIs, property nodes, and event-driven programming. You'll also explore data acquisition (DAQ) using simulated and real signals, preparing you to interface with external hardware like sensors, actuators, and measurement devices.\nYou will gain insight into professional practices such as why sequence structures should be avoided in industrial applications, and how state machines are used to ensure modularity, maintainability, and safety in complex systems. These are the same design principles used in high-reliability industrial and medical systems.\nThroughout the course, learning is reinforced through interactive quizzes, coding exercises, and three real-world projects that consolidate multiple skills into practical applications.

MongoDB as a NoSQL database has many advantages over traditional software such as the dynamic structure that allows you to store different shapes of data.\n\n\nMongoDB will allow you to store data in JSON format like where you have the ability to add different sets of JSON documents that do not look alike in the same collection. Collections are like tables where you store the data that you desire. After storing document you can query them inside a collection like a SQL database but with a unique query syntax.\n\n\nMongoDB can be used for different project types. But, it recommended for Big data projects. Also, Content Management and Social Networks. If you find yourself cannot decide on a certain structure for the database you can use MongoDB where it gives you the most flexibility for your work.\n\n\nMongoDB can be used for .NET Core Projects and .NET Framework projects. For MongoDB, you can either host it's database server locally or uses online MongoDB cloud providers.MongoDB can be replicated easily and also scaled out. Many features available for you that you can use to optimize the database to suit your needs and work.\n\n\nMongoDB's main difference is the structure of the stored data. But, the query is like any SQL database where you can limit your selection of columns or add where clauses to your selections to limit data retrieval. Also, you can order by the results just as you do with SQL.\n\n\nThis course will help you with MongoDB basics where you will be able to create a .NET application that will connect to MongoDB to save and retrieve the data. Also, we will add an ASP.NET Core Application where you can save and retrieve data to MongoDB via ASP.NET Core API.",

Most guys have confusion that only devops openings are there but it's not true...Generally devops guys set up CICD Pipeline or Set Release pipeline over kubernetes environment.

I would like to call this Big Data and Hadoop for Dummies. It covers basics as well as advanced concepts in a very unique way. Hands on examples gave me clear direction about how to use Hadoop in production environment. I strongly recommend this course to all levels of data engineers and Big data enthusiasts.Production quality is good.\" - Ashrith\n\n======================================================================\nMaster the Fundamental Concepts of Big Data, Hadoop and Mahout with ease\nUnderstand the Big Data & Apache Hadoop landscape\nLearn HDFS & MapReduce concepts with examples and hands on labs\nLearn Hadoop Streaming\nUnderstand Analytics with Hadoop using Pig and Hive\nMachine Learning Concepts\nCollaborative Filtering with Apache Mahout\nReal world Recommender System with Mahout and Hadoop\n\nBig Data and Data Science Foundation to empower you with the most specialized skills\nThe core concepts are stressed upon and the focus is on building a solid foundation of the key Hadoop, Map Reduce and collaborative filtering concepts upon which you can learn just about every other technology in the same space. Preliminary Java and Unix knowledge is expected.\nContents & Overview\nThrough 47 lectures and 8 hours of content, we will take a step-by step approach to understanding Big Data and related concepts from scratch.\nThe first few topics will focus on the rise of Big Data and how Apache Hadoop fits in. We will focus on the fundamentals of Hadoop and its core components: HDFS and Map Reduce. We will then setup and play around with Hadoop and HDFS and then deep dive into MapReduce programming with hands on examples. We will also spend time on Combiners and Partitioners and how they can help. We will also spend time on Hadoop Streaming: a tool that helps non-Java professionals to leverage the power of Hadoop and do POCs on it.\nOnce we have a solid foundation of HDFS and MapReduce, in the next couple of topics we will explore higher level components of the Hadoop ecosystem: Hive and Pig. We will go into the details of both Hive and Pig by installing them and working with examples. Hive and Pig can make your life easy by shielding you from the complexity of writing MR jobs and yet leveraging the parallel processing ability of the Hadoop framework.\nIn the next few lectures we will look at something very interesting: Apache Mahout and Machine Learning. Apache Mahout is a Java library that lets you write machine learning applications with ease. We will learn the basics of Machine Learning and go deeper into Collaborative Filtering and recommender systems, something that Mahout excels that.\nWe will look at some similarity algorithms, understand their real-life implications and apply them when we will build together a real world movie recommender system using Mahout and Hadoop.\nAfter taking this course, which includes slides, examples, code and data sets, you will be at ease with playing aroundwith HDFS, writing MapReduce jobs, analyzing data with Hive and Pig, and building a recommender system using Apache Mahout. So go ahead and enroll to crack that Big Data/Data Science interview and clear that certification exam!",

Além disso, as requisições são feitas em um API Gateway (Zuul), responsável por rotear e autorizar as requisições.\nVocê vai aprender a trabalhar com autenticação e autorização, usando OAuth e tokens JWT. Além disso, vai aprender como gerar e testar os containers Docker para deixar os microsserviços e as bases de dados aptos para implantação.\nO objetivo deste curso não é esgotar todos recursos do ecossistema Spring, mas sim apresentar uma introdução, de forma bem didática, de algumas das principais ferramentas do Spring Cloud, de modo que o desenvolvedor se familiarize com o processo básico de construção dos microsserviços, sua configuração e comunicação, e possa depois seguir se especializando se assim desejar.\nOs conteúdos do curso incluem:\nFeign para requisições de API entre microsserviços\nRibbon para balanceamento de carga\nServidor Eureka para registro dos microsserviços\nAPI Gateway Zuul para roteamento e autorização\nHystrix para tolerância a falhas\nOAuth e JWT para autenticação e autorização\nServidor de configuração centralizada com dados em repositório Git\nGeração de containers Docker para os microsserviços e bases de dados\nEste curso é de nível iniciante do ponto de vista de microsserviços e do ferramental Spring Cloud, mas vale ressaltar que não é para iniciantes em Java ou Spring Boot.

      "description": "Are you struggling to land a DevOps job because you lack hands-on experience? My step-by-step DevOps course teaches you how to build and architect your own pipelines from scratch, so you can finally break into the DevOps field.\nThis step-by-step DevOps course is intentionally designed for you to build your own DevOps pipelines from scratch because there’s no better way to truly learn than by doing. Research shows that actively creating something engages multiple areas of your brain, helping you not only learn faster but also retain the information more effectively. By constructing the pipeline from the ground up, you’ll develop a deeper understanding of each component and its role in the overall process, making the knowledge more intuitive and practical.\nThis approach goes beyond rote memorization—it trains you to think critically and adapt the principles you’ve learned to new scenarios. The process of problem-solving, troubleshooting, and making decisions while building a pipeline helps reinforce neural pathways, strengthening your long-term memory and understanding. By the end of the course, you’ll have built a fully functional pipeline that automatically builds, packages, and tests the Java Spring Boot Application – PetClinic.\nHaving built the pipeline yourself will prepare you for job interviews in a unique way. You’ll feel confident discussing your hands-on experience and be ready to answer technical questions with real-world examples. Knowing you’ve successfully implemented the pipeline yourself will not only boost your confidence but also help you stand out to potential employers as someone who can independently create and manage DevOps systems. This experience equips you with the skills and mindset to excel in any DevOps role.\n\n\nWhat Past Students Are Saying\nI liked this course on DevOps, because at work, we are in the process of establishing a DevSecOps and going through this course gave me hands-on experience, and I appreciate that very much.\n- Derick\n\n\nThe best part was demystifying several DevOps tools and getting real experience using them. Having hands on access to the tools instead of watching someone else do it was good also.\n-Shahram N Vaziri\n\n\nThe best part of the class is the various aspects of DevOps and the CI/CD pipeline. I learned a lot. Thank you!\n-Kuowen\n\n\nJust an outstanding instructor. Keenly knowledgeable in a cutting-edge field, yet available for consultation and approachable across the range of coding experience amongst a wide range of experience in the student group. The course is exceedingly well-organized, and gives great \"bang-for the buck\".\n- Rafa\n\n\nThis class was fantastic for me! It helped to fill in gaps in my experience - I was familiar with some of the tools and practices, but not all, and putting together the final project facilitated my understanding of the mechanisms of a working CI/CD pipeline.\n-Todd\n\n\nI really liked that the course focused on the hands-on learning (labs) evenly with the theoretical. For this topic especially, the hands-on learning is critical and is something that is missing in other courses.\n- Rick\n\n\nNorma is an expert in the field of DevOps. She has a pleasant personality also. Whenever we encountered any problems, she would try to address it.\n- Jacob\n\n\nI really liked the approach the instructor took to help and assist my learning and development throughout the course. The instructor was very friendly and approachable. She has immense amount of knowledge and experience in DevOps and it shows. I will keep in touch with her for further coursework for myself as well as my team. I appreciate her hardwork and great attitude!\n- Alex\n\n\nThe best part of the course is all the various aspects of DevOps and the CI/CD pipeline. I learned a lot!\n- Rukhsana Matin\n\n\nI like the hands on experience.\n-Vidya Rangaswamy\n\n\nI like the class materials - format in both videos and step by steps instructions.\n-Tyng Kao\n\n\n\n\nWhat you will learn:\nIn this course, you will learn techniques, processes, and tools to achieve continuous delivery by connecting and automating all phases of software delivery, including configuration management, automated acceptance testing, dependency management, and the creation and management of testing environments. These techniques are widely applicable to all sorts of different software projects—big, small, highly technical, or short sprints to early value.\nUsing a practical approach, the course covers the DevOps tools, strategies, and concepts that will allow you to complete your own DevOps Project in your own AWS Environment.  You will provision your own EC2 instance, install your own Jenkins Server and create your own Jenkins Pipelines to build, test and deploy jobs as well as integrate Jenkins with other DevOps tools such as Maven, JUnit, GitHub, JMeter, Packer, and Terraform on AWS.\n\n\nPrerequisites: Knowledge of AWS Environment is desirable but not required. Students should have knowledge of basic System Integration and Test methods, tools, and terms.\n\n\nSoftware:\nAWS account\nPDF Reader / Google Word Access\nOpen-source software (download links will be provided)\nHardware:\nA personal computer terminal\n\n\nInstructor Teaching & Software Experience:\n648 - Number of students taught using this course material in a Virtual Instructor Led Training (VILT) course\n5+ Years Teaching at Private Technical Companies and UCSD University\n25+ Years of working in the Software Industry\nInstructor Education & AWS Certifications\nBS in Computer Science (SDSU)\nAWS Architecture Certification\nAWS Developer Certification\nAWS System Integration Certification\nAWS DevOps Professional Certification",

The course starts with basics about CICD and then covers topics that are needed for typical industrial applications. Many of the jobs explained here can be simply copy-pasted to your projects to serve the purpose, for other jobs you will be expert enough to implement them yourself with the understanding of various concepts for creating jobs. The related code will be available for your reference.\nIndustrial examples are covered so that you will get an introduction to typical CICD jobs and their relevance in making projects stable and deployments or delivery fast. You should try out these examples in order to truly master it.\nMy policy is to make things simple and always have simple examples on each topic for a quick understanding of the concept and then build on top of it as we progress. CICD is a blessing when it comes to ensuring code stability, I will be covering how to set up tests such that this code stability is achieved. There are a lot of videos on YouTube as well on topics covered here, but most likely you will be on top of it by the time you have gone through this tutorial.\nEvery developer should master CICD, not only DevOps engineers so that everyone can contribute to code stability, quality of code, automating any repetitive jobs, and delivering in an agile fashion. There is a learning curve involved in understanding how to set up decent CICD for a complex project and this tutorial is intended to make this learning easier. Learn the best practices and apply them in your projects, it will help your organization and yourself in moving to the next level of development and delivery.\nFor further exploration of features, you can refer to the official documentation of GitLab. I will be covering how I typically start implementing a new challenging CICD job, avoiding complicated scripts as complicated jobs are hard to read and hard in maintaining as well, eventually leading to the removal of that job, wasting time and effort. Simple jobs are the key to maintainable configuration files.\nTowards the end of tutorial, there is a case study of Yolov3 based face detection in GitLab with CICD. It will help in understanding real world CICD requirements.\nSubmodule is also added as its used in many project. You will find hands-on for same.",

      "description": "If you’re a developer curious about AI but overwhelmed by the hype, this course is for you.\nThis course follows a realistic developer workday, from 8 AM to 5 PM. Each hour introduces common tasks you face already, and shows how AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot can help you move faster, think clearer, and get better results with less context switching.\n\nWhere it makes sense, we use multiple tools head-to-head so you can see how they work. First, I walk you through some foundational concepts to help you avoid pitfalls, then we start our day as a software developer.\n\nHere's how it unfolds:\n8 AM: Morning Inbox Triage\nStart your day with a mess. Your boss sent a vague, stream-of-consciousness email. Use AI to extract tasks, identify what's unclear, and write a clean reply without switching out of developer mode.\n9 AM: Write What You Mean, Not What You Say\nTake rough dev notes or Jira tickets and turn them into polished updates. AI helps you translate shorthand into clear, professional communication for stakeholders or product teams.\n10 AM: Fix Ancient Code\nYou've inherited a legacy codebase. Let AI explain what the code is doing, find bugs, suggest improvements, and even rewrite it. You’ll compare output from different tools to see where they shine or fail.\n11 AM: Regex and Other Crimes\nStop suffering through regular expressions. Use AI to write, explain, and debug regex patterns with real-world test data and examples. Learn how to tighten your prompts and validate the results.\n12 PM: Lunch and Data Migrations\nMigrate content between databases. AI maps schemas, writes SQL, flags risky fields, and reminds you to hash those passwords. You’ll get real help instead of random Stack Overflow links.\n1 PM: The Database Doctor Is In\nImprove your schema. AI helps spot design flaws, propose normalization, and generate optimized CREATE TABLE statements with constraints, keys, and indexes.\n2 PM: Screenshot Says What\nExtract work from screenshots. AI turns whiteboards, Jira tickets, and Slack screenshots into actionable checklists or development tasks. Then it helps you delegate or document them.\n3 PM: Canvas Playground - Tic Tac Toe\nBuild a working HTML5 Canvas game from scratch. Let AI generate, review, and improve your code. Watch it refactor its own work and explain the logic behind each improvement.\n4 PM: To Vibe Code or Not To Vibe Code\nUse AI as a coding partner. Build a small commodity trading app using an agent inside VS Code. Learn how to guide the AI, fix its mistakes, and avoid over-editing too soon.\n5 PM: Docs, Notes, and Final Polish\nClose your day with clean documentation. AI summarizes commits, formats release notes, and even rewrites your update email for execs, marketing, or your changelog.\nI want you to have the superpowers of AI, without drowning in the hype-swamp. Join me!",

We learn how to get the most out of containers Docker, Dockerfiles, Docker Registries (Docker Hub and Elastic Container Registry (ECR) from AWS), and container management by the Elastic Container Service (ECS).\nInitially, we will do a brief review of what Docker is and what Docker Compose is and how to install them on your machine, be it Linux or Windows. Then we will integrate Docker into a Java application with Spring Boot, exploring Docker on AWS at a high level. We will learn how each of the main \"pieces\" works separately, bringing together all the essential parts of a Docker infrastructure in a Linux instance based on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), including installation, Dockerfiles, Docker Images and Docker Hub. Next, we'll learn how to create clustered environments with Amazon ECS.\nAt this point, we will understand how all moving parts can be brought together in a real, publicly accessible deployment. Throughout the course, we will gradually add support for Continuous Integration. We will start by automating simple tasks that will gradually evolve into a Continuous Integration pipeline involving Github, Travis CI, and an ECS Cluster on Amazon AWS. It will be incredible you commit the code, push to Github, Travis CI builds the Docker Images, and deploy it on Amazon \"Automagically.\"\nIn addition to the Spring Boot application in the last sections of the course, we will Dockerize an ASP.NET Core application making it able to perform this type of task in more than one technology/language. By the end of this course, you will have learned fundamental knowledge about Continuous Integration and how to use Docker on AWS.\nSo don't waste any more time going to classes!",

Esto implica que su contenido no recibirá actualizaciones adicionales y nuestro equipo de Co-instructores no continuará proporcionando soporte a preguntas relacionadas a este curso.\nTe recomendamos que consideres tomar nuestro curso NodeJS de Cero a Expert. Este nuevo curso ha sido desarrollado desde cero, siguiendo estándares actualizados y con un temario renovado. También te invitamos a unirte a nuestra comunidad en Discord, donde podrás recibir apoyo y resolver tus dudas.\nAgradecemos tu comprensión.\n\n\n¿Qué es Node?\nEs muy posible que si llegaste al curso es porque alguien te mencionó sobre Node, alguien lo usa o bien tienes curiosidad de lo que Node puede hacer... aquí aprenderemos muchas cosas que te explicarán porque Node están popular hoy en día.\n\n\nObjetivo del curso:\nMi objetivo con este curso, es enseñar Node con ejercicios reales y aplicables en la vida real, aprender haciendo aplicaciones, incrementando la complejidad de las mismas poco a poco, y sin darte cuenta estaremos trabajando con bases de datos, sockets, consumiendo servicios y mucho más.\nMeta final del curso:\nAl terminar el curso no sólo tendrás la base, sino que podrás aplicar todos los conocimientos adquiridos para trabajar allá afuera en el campo laboral. Tengo como meta, que al terminar el curso tu puedas agregar a tu currículo y con fundamento que sabes Node.\nPre-requisitos del curso:\nEste curso aunque parte de cero Node... es necesario que conozcas un poco de JavaScript y de ser posible algo de lógica de programación básica... hay temas que son sumamente importantes que preferí incorporarlos en una pequeña sección para que todos hablemos el mismo idioma a la hora de empezar a trabajar con Node... pero no enseño JavaScript básico.\nInformación importante del curso:\nComo mencioné anteriormente, aprenderemos Node de muchas formas y con muchos ejemplos, algunas veces usaremos frameworks y otras veces lo haremos todo nosotros... pero aparte de aprender Node, lo mezclaremos con los siguientes temas que son sumamente usado en el mundo de hoy en día, entre estos temas puedo mencionar:\nMongoDB\nSocketIO\nHandlebars\nMongo Atlas\nJWT\nGit\nGitHub\nJSON\nGoogle Services\nGoogle APIs\nHeroku\nMySQL\nTypeScript\nPostMan\nExpress\nYARGS\nAplicaciones de consola básicas e interactivas\nMongo Compass\nPaquetes\nNPM\nRESTServer\nSocket Server\nConsumo de servicios\nCreación de archivos\nDespliegues\nY mucho más\n\n\nNode debe de ser una herramienta que debes de conocer hoy en día, su popularidad y uso va creciendo cada día más y debemos de estar preparados para implementar todas sus bondades para el beneficio de nuestros proyectos o trabajo, para poder crear aplicaciones modernas escalables que nos permitirán estar siempre a la vanguardia con la tecnología.",

All you need to do is set it up and watch your job with JavaScript become easier and quicker.\nLearn to automate your work.\nUsing GRUNT you will not have to focus as much on routine tasks.\nMake team work more comfortable by bringing your code to a single standard.\nIf you work with JavaScript and avoid using GRUNT, you are making a big mistake. Some of the things you can simplify by using it are concatenating files, linting and testing your code, and minification. There are many other tools that can do these jobs but none can do all of them.\nComplete this course and start working smart. The course consists of 6 video lessons, a little under 1 hour in total. After completing them you will know enough to install and configure GRUNT.",

      "description": "The new Lightning Experience combines three major components—Lightning Design System, Lightning App Builder, and Lightning Components—to enable anyone to quickly and easily create beautiful, modern enterprise apps. If you wish to take up the challenges that Lightning throws at you head-on, then look no further because this practical course will be your faithful companion and ensure that you make best use of the Lightning platform.\nWith this practical course, you'll initially explore the art of working with standard components and build a basic layout for the application. Then, you will add more advanced components using the Lightning framework. Finally, you will also build and migrate reports and dashboards to make your app look more professional. Than you will learn how to roll out to Lightning in an existing organization and work with some really amazing point-and-click features to enhance your application’s user interface. Finally you will create custom Lightning components and custom Lightning events and communicate between components using events, make calls from Lightning components to remote methods, and handle server responses asynchronously using callback functions.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Salesforce Lightning Recipes starts by walking you through the three major Lightning components and will help you enable and configure a Lightning solution. You will explore the art of working with standard components and build a basic layout for the application. Then, you will add more advanced components using the Lightning framework. Finally, you will also build and migrate reports and dashboards to make your app look more professional. Towards the end of the course, you’ll make use of the Design System to work with Salesforce data and lay out the entire page with the components that you’ve built, before integrating Visualforce in your application.\nThe second course,  Hands-On Salesforce Lightning Development  entails all out-of-the-box functionality available in Lightning Experience. You will learn how to roll out to Lightning in an existing organization and work with some really amazing point-and-click features to enhance your application’s user interface. Lightning App Builder gives you the power to build apps visually, without code, quicker than ever before using custom-built Lightning components. By the end of this course, you’ll be able to build efficient apps based on the new Lightning experience and make your Lightning apps available in the Lightning App Builder.\nThe third course, Complete Salesforce Lightning Application Development will show you how to enable, create, and configure a Lightning solution. You will dig into component attributes, expressions, value providers (and attribute data types and other aspects of attribute definitions) and create an efficient component via attributes and expressions. Then you will create a Lightning-enabled Apex Controller that exposes data and logic to the client application. Next, you will create a Lightning application in the Developer Console, use static resources in your Lightning Application, and preview your Lightning application in the browser. Finally, you will create custom Lightning components and custom Lightning events and communicate between components using events. You will then learn how to create Apex methods that can be called remotely from Lightning component code, make calls from Lightning components to remote methods, and handle server responses asynchronously using callback functions. Towards the end of the course, you'll learn how to manage the state of your Lightning application using the URL's hashtag and use Lightning's Component event and Application event.\nAbout the Author\nSyed Shah is one of the pioneers in delivering trainings on \"Salesforce Lightning and he has worked on Salesforce since the last 7 yrs. He has developed Salesforce applications with SFDC Best Practices including functional gathering and application design for a number of companies like Infosys, Vodafone, HCL, Dell, Wipro, Mindtree, Sony, Nihon and Accenture.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Terraform for DevOps: Automate & Manage Cloud Infrastructure course by Uplatz.\n\n\nTerraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that enables you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources using configuration files. It allows you to automate the process of deploying, updating, and scaling infrastructure across multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, and even on-premises systems.\n\n\nHow Terraform Works\nTerraform operates through a declarative configuration model, meaning you define the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform automatically figures out how to achieve that state. The process is broken down into several steps:\nWrite Configuration Files\nTerraform configurations are written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) or JSON. You describe your infrastructure (e.g., virtual machines, networking components, databases) using these configuration files.\nExample: You may define an AWS EC2 instance, specifying its size, region, and security groups.\nInitialize Terraform (terraform init)\nBefore you can apply your configuration, you need to initialize your Terraform project. This step sets up the working environment and downloads the necessary provider plugins (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).\nPlan Changes (terraform plan)\nTerraform compares the current state of the infrastructure (if any) with the desired state defined in your configuration files. It generates an execution plan detailing the changes Terraform will make to match the desired state.\nThis step is useful for reviewing what Terraform is about to do before making actual changes.\nApply Changes (terraform apply)\nOnce you're satisfied with the plan, you execute terraform apply. Terraform communicates with the relevant cloud providers and makes the necessary API calls to create, modify, or delete resources to align with your configuration.\nTerraform will make real changes to the cloud infrastructure based on the plan.\nManage State\nTerraform maintains a state file (terraform.tfstate) that stores information about the current state of your infrastructure. This file helps Terraform track which resources have been created and their current settings.\nThe state file is critical for ensuring that Terraform can detect differences between the actual state and the desired state, so it knows what changes to apply in future runs.\nUpdate Infrastructure\nIf you change the configuration (e.g., resize an EC2 instance), Terraform will compare the new desired state with the current state and apply the necessary changes (create new resources, update existing ones, or delete outdated ones).\nDestroy Infrastructure (terraform destroy)\nIf you no longer need the infrastructure, you can use terraform destroy to tear it all down. Terraform will safely remove the resources it created.\n\n\nKey Concepts in Terraform\nProviders: Terraform interacts with various APIs via providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). Providers define the available resources you can manage and interact with.\nResources: Represent individual infrastructure components like virtual machines, databases, networks, etc.\nModules: Reusable configurations that simplify complex infrastructure setups. Modules help organize code and make it more maintainable.\nVariables & Outputs: Variables allow dynamic configurations, and outputs allow exposing values to be used elsewhere (e.g., passing information to another system).\nState: Terraform's state file records your infrastructure's current state, allowing Terraform to track changes and ensure your infrastructure is in sync with your configuration.\n\n\nWhy Use Terraform?\nMulti-Cloud Support: Terraform works across multiple cloud providers, making it easy to manage infrastructure in hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\nDeclarative Configuration: You define the desired end state, and Terraform handles the \"how.\"\nConsistency: Infrastructure is versioned and can be reproduced consistently across different environments (development, staging, production).\nCollaboration: Through remote backends and Terraform Cloud, teams can collaborate and share infrastructure definitions easily.\n\n\nTerraform - Course Curriculum\n\n\nModule 1: Introduction to Terraform\n1.

      "description": "Have you heard of Git? Have you been wondering what all the buzz is about? Have you heard about all the open source software projects moving to Github? Have you been thinking that it's time to give Git a try yourself? We think it is too, and we think this course will help.\nThis course is a different approach to learning Git than, say, reading online documentation or buying a book on Git because you'll see not only how Git works, but how you should work with Git. We'll show you the situations that you probably find yourself in as a developer all the time and how Git can help you work faster, work with more confidence, and save yourself and your teammates time by supporting a good workflow. We'll show you how Git works in practice, and also how to practice Git.\nSession One: Git and You\nIn this first session we'll cover getting started with Git and daily workflow which will become second nature to you. We'll get it in your fingers. Not only that, but all the operations we'll use Git for will be completely local to our own systems.\nOne of the things that first piques people's interest in Git is that it's distributed. They wonder what that means and how it affects them. In later sessions we'll understand the answers to questions about the distributed nature of Git, but one side effect of it is that many of Git's operations are completely local to your own computer. A Git repository can live out a useful and completely local life all on one computer, and we'll see that side of working with Git.\nWhen this session is complete you'll understand:\nTheory:\nWhat does Git do?\nWho came up with Git, and who works on it?\nHow Git keeps a history of your project over time\nHow Git stores your files\nWhat are all those really long strings of letters and numbers?\nHow a Git repository is structured\nWhat is Git's index for?\nThe components of Git: trees, refs, and blobs\nPractice:\nWorking with files in Git\nThe standard workflow when committing changes to the repository\nCommits in Git\nWorking with git log\nQuerying the Git repository\nHow to get help on Git\nSession Two: Git and Your Team\nGit has no particular need to work with any repository than the local one on your computer, unlike many other version control systems but that wouldn't be very fun would it? Git really becomes useful when you and your team members use it to facilitate collaborating on a project. We'll start to understand what it means that Git is distributed.\nOne of the first things people wonder when they hear that Git is distributed, or that Git doesn't need a central server, is \"Can I still have a central server for my team?\". Of course you can, and many teams still work the same way they have with other versioning systems. We'll see how to do that as well as share changes with another computer directly. We'll set up an account on Github and use that to learn how to deal with remote repositories.\nWe'll also learn about very important concept in version control systems: branching. Git makes branching so easy that it's time to learn how you should be integrating branching into your workflow.\nWhen this session is complete you'll understand:\nTheory:\nWhat are remotes?\nWhat are some strategies for collaboration with Git?\nHow does Git transfer changes?\nHow does pulling changes work?\nHow does branching work in Git?\nWhat does rebase do?\nWhat is the Git stash?\nHow does tagging work in Git?\nPractice:\nCloning a repository\nPushing, pulling, and fetching changes\nCreating branches\nPushing and pulling from branches\nSetting up a tracking branch\nMerging and dealing with conflicts\nHow and when to rebase\nSeeing who did what with git blame\nSession Three: Git in the Real World\nSession three is all about the how Git works and how you work with Git out there in the wild.\nChances are you first heard about Git and Github almost in the same sentence. In fact sometimes it's easy to forget that Github is just a logical extension to Git itself.\nGithub is a wildly popular way to host and collaborate on Open Source software projects using Git. Some of the most important software tools you may use every day are now hosted or mirrored on Github, such as Rails, jQuery, or Postgres. Github's unique philosophy on forking, or branching off developement on a software project, makes it easy for anyone to contribute to their favorite open source tools. We'll dig deeper into how to work with Github.\nNext we'll go over a whole list of interesting tools Git gives you work a lot faster. Interactive adding, adding using patch mode, interactive merging, and some advanced logging and querying techniques for finding exactly what's been going on in your repository.\nWe'll also cover a very important topic in software development: \"screwing things up\". Not only do we often really mess up the project we're working on, we can also make mistakes in Git itself. Luckily Git is there to help with both of those kinds of problems. Git provides ways to not only commit changes, which is helpful in itself to any software project, but also to fix, reorder, play back, cherry pick, and recover lost commits.\nWhen this session is complete you'll understand:\nTheory:\nHow can I get exactly what I want out of the log?\nHow can I find exactly what I want in the repo?\nWhat is the reflog and what does it do?\nDoes the repository require any maintenance?\nHow does forking work on Github?\nHow can I stay up to date with the original repository?\nHow do I submit my commits back to the original repository?\nPractice:\ngit add -i\ngit rebase -i\ngit commit --amend\ngit reset, hard and soft\ngit revert\ngit cherry-pick\ngit gc\ngit reflog\nForking a repository on Github\nSubmitting a pull request on Github",

      "description": "Neste curso de Git e GitHub completo com certificado, você vai aprender essas ferramentas dos conceitos mais básicos até as aplicações mais avançadas e técnicas para gerenciar e administrar os seus repositórios.\n\n\nA ideia central é trazer uma abordagem prática, onde todos os comandos e recursos serão explicados como são utilizados no dia a dia de um desenvolvedor, ou seja, depois do curso você estará apto a utilizar o Git profissionalmente!\n\n\nVeja alguns dos recursos que o curso possui:\n\n\nGit aplicado a prática de um dev, desde os comandos fundamentais aos mais avançados;\nGitHub completo: Issues, Pull Requests, Code Review, Wiki, Projetos e etc;\nCriação de gists para compartilhamento de código;\nDesenvolvimento de um portfólio utilizando o GitHub Pages;\nCriação de documentos de texto incríveis com Markdown;\ne muito mais!\n\n\nAlém de aprender tudo sobre controle de versão para projetos de desenvolvimento de software, nesse curso Git e GitHub do zero ao avançado, você vai criar o seu portfólio e hospedar nos servidores do GitHub, de forma totalmente gratuita, marcando a sua presença na web.\n\n\nLembrando também que o curso é voltado para a prática, o objetivo é fazer você compreender teoria e prática do versionamento de projetos utilizando Git e GitHub, explicando cada detalhe e pondo os pingos nos is, não deixando nada nas entrelinhas.\n\n\nO que é Git?\n\n\nO Git é um sistema de controle de versão bastante usado. Ele foi criado por Linus Torvalds em 2005, inicialmente para o desenvolvimento do kernel do Linux, e desde então se tornou uma das ferramentas mais populares e poderosas para controle de versão.\n\n\nEle é projetado para gerenciar e controlar as alterações em um conjunto de arquivos ao longo do tempo, permitindo que várias pessoas colaborem em projetos de software de forma eficiente. Ao contrário de sistemas de controle de versão centralizados, o Git opera em um modelo distribuído, o que significa que cada desenvolvedor tem uma cópia completa do repositório em seu ambiente local.\n\n\nQual a diferença de Git e GitHub?\n\n\nGit e GitHub são conceitos relacionados, mas têm funções e propósitos diferentes.\n\n\nO Git é um sistema de controle de versão distribuído que permite rastrear as alterações em arquivos e coordenar o trabalho em equipes de desenvolvimento de software. Ele é executado localmente em seu computador e não requer conexão com a internet. Com o Git, você pode criar ramificações para desenvolver recursos separadamente, mesclar alterações de diferentes ramificações e reverter para versões anteriores do código.\n\n\nJá o GitHub é uma plataforma de hospedagem de código baseada em nuvem que permite armazenar, compartilhar, colaborar e gerenciar repositórios Git. É uma plataforma online que requer conexão com a internet. Além de armazenar repositórios Git, ele oferece recursos adicionais, como rastreamento de problemas, solicitações de pull, controle de acesso baseado em permissões e integração com outras ferramentas de desenvolvimento.\n\n\nNeste curso você aprenderá Git e GitHub do básico ao avançado!\n\n\nPor que usar Git e GitHub juntos?\n\n\nUsar Git e GitHub juntos oferece diversos benefícios para o desenvolvimento de software e colaboração em projetos. Veja:\n\n\nControle de versão distribuído: o Git permite controlar o histórico de alterações de forma distribuída, facilitando a colaboração em equipe.\n\n\nRastreamento de problemas e gerenciamento de projetos: ele possui recursos integrados para rastrear problemas e gerenciar projetos, o que ajuda na organização e na resolução de problemas.\n\n\nIntegração com serviços de CI/CD: O GitHub pode ser integrado a serviços de integração contínua e implantação contínua, automatizando testes e implantações.\n\n\nComunidade e compartilhamento de código: possui uma comunidade ativa de desenvolvedores, permitindo explorar projetos, colaborar e compartilhar código.\n\n\nComo usar o Git no GitHub?\n\n\nPara isso é necessário alguns passos básicos, como instalar o Git, criar conta no GitHub, criar um repositório, cloná-lo, e então executar alguns códigos. Mas nesse curso de Git e GitHub do zero ao avançado você vai aprender tudo!\n\n\nO que é versionamento?\n\n\nVersionamento, também conhecido como controle de versão, é o processo de gerenciar e controlar as alterações feitas em um conjunto de arquivos ao longo do tempo, que é a função do Git. É uma prática essencial no desenvolvimento de software e outros projetos que envolvem a criação e modificação de arquivos.\n\n\nO versionamento permite que você acompanhe e registre as alterações feitas em um arquivo ou conjunto de arquivos ao longo do tempo. Cada alteração é registrada como uma nova versão ou revisão, permitindo que você rastreie o histórico completo de modificações e saiba exatamente o que foi alterado, quando e por quem.\n\n\nEsse processo é utilizado no dia a dia de todos os desenvolvedores, por isso é muito importante aprender a versionar projetos com git.\n\n\nPor aqui já expliquei tudo o que poderia escrever, agora é hora de aprender com esse ótimo curso em vídeo que apresentei!\n\n\nEstá pronto para dominar o versionamento? Então, te espero no curso para explorarmos o Git e o GitHub do básico ao avançado!",

This course will take you from being a beginner to an expert in creating ETL Pipelines on the cloud using AWS Data Pipeline and AWS Glue.\nIn this course you will Learn by example, where we demonstrate all the concepts discussed so that you can see them working, and you can try them out for yourself as well.\nMy step-by-step training will initiate you into the world of AWS ETL Pipelines.\nAmazon provides  ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) tools which integrate with different data storages. Once you prepare the data AWS allows you to query it using Athena and then build dashboards using Quicksight. What is important is you know which tool to use when. EMR is great when used with Hadoop but Glue is great for quick pipeline.\nWhy Learn AWS Data Pipeline/Glue/EMR/Athena?\nAnother Question: What tool should you use for Scalable Data Integration when you have data dispersed in multiple data sources and need it to be cleaned and transformed for analysis?\nAWS Data Pipeline is a web service that allows customers to create automated data transport and transformation operations. In other words, it provides data extraction, loading, and transformation as a service. To use their data, users don't need to build an expensive ETL or ELT platform; instead, they may use Amazon's cloud environment. Data keeps growing as business activity grows, so the scalability of your pipeline is important.\nAWS Glue coupled with other tools like Glue Studio and Glue Data Brew allows you to build pipelines with varying amount of customization. AWS Glue allows you to build custom ETL pipelines while Glue Studio provides a UI tool to monitor everything. AWS Glue Data Brew is a new tool which allows you to build the pipelines without any coding. It has more than 250 transformations you can apply with just a few clicks!\nAWS Glue Data Classify provides a consistent view of your data, allowing you to appropriately clean, enrich, and catalogue it. This also assures that your data is searchable, queryable, and ETL-ready right away. Understand when to use AWS EMR and when to use AWS Glue. From engineering to data to analytics, it offers immense potential for teams across corporate businesses.\nFinally we take a look at some real life examples to study where and how AWS Glue or Data Pipeline can help us. We ensure you learn the best practices at all times.\nBy the end of the course you will have set up and learnt to manage data transformations in AWS like a pro.\nEverything is well documented and separated, so you can find what you need. Assignments and Quizzes will make sure you stay on track and test your knowledge. The course will have a combination of theory and practical examples.",

Cloud computing is rapidly transitioning from a niche technology embraced by startups and tech-forward companies to the foundation upon which enterprise systems build their future. In order to compete in today’s market‐place, organizations large and small are embracing cloud architectures and practices.\nHere, Developers are often left with many questions about the disciplines and practices they should adopt to build applications designed to take advantage of everything the cloud offers. This course around the Twelve-Factor App answers those questions and more.\nThe Twelve-Factor Application is one of these phrases that is gaining traction and is being passed around during planning meetings, discussions over coffee, and architecture review sessions. The problem with shared context and common language like buzz‐words is that not everyone has the same understanding. Twelve Factor to one person might mean something entirely different to someone else, and many viewers of this course might not have any exposure to the 12 factors.\nSo The goal of this course is to provide detail on what exactly TwelveFactor applications are so that hopefully everyone who has takes the course shares the same understanding of the factors. Additionally, this course aims to take you beyond the 12 factors, expanding on the original guidelines to accommodate modern thinking on building applications that don’t just function in the cloud, but thrive.\nSee you inside !",

      "description": "The Course is for those who do not know even ABC of Big Data and tools, want to learn them and be in a comfortable situation to implement them in projects. The course is also for those, who have some knowledge on Big Data tools, but want to enhance them further and be comfortable working in Projects. Due to the extensive scenario implementation, the course is also suitable for people interested to write Big Data Certifications like CCA 175. The course contains Practice Test for CCA 175.\nBecause the course is focused on setting up the entire Hadoop Platform on your windows (for those having less than 6GB RAM) and providing or working on fully configured VM's, you need not to buy cluster very often to practice the tools. Hence, the Course is ONE TIME INVESTMENT for secure future.\n\n\nIn the course, we will learn how to utilize Big Data tools like Hadoop, Flume, Kafka, Spark, Scala (the most valuable tech skills on the market today).\nIn this course I will show you how to -\nUse Scala and Spark to analyze Big Data.\nPractice Test for writing CCA 175 Exam is available at the end of the course.\nExtensive and Real time project scenarios with solutions as you will write in REAL PROJECTS\nUse Sqoop to import data from Traditional Relational Databases to HDFS & Hive.\nUse Flume and Kafka to process streaming data\nUse Hive to view and store data & Partition the tables\nUse Spark Streaming to fetch the streaming data from Kafka & Flume\nThe VM's in the course are configured to work synchronously together and also have Spark 2.2.0 Version Installed. (Standard Cloudera VM has Spark 1.6 Installed with NO KAFKA and requires an upgrade for Spark, while the VM's provided in the course has Spark 2.2 configured and working along with Kafka.)\n\nBig Data is the most in demand skills right now, and with this course you can learn them quickly and easily! You can also learn the components in the basic setup in files like \"hdfs-site.xml\", \"core-site.xml\" etc  They are good to know if working for a projet.\nThe course is focused on upskilling someone who do not know Big Data tools and target is to bring them up-to the mark to be able to work in Big Data projects seamlessly without issues.\nThis course comes with some project scenarios and multiple datasets to work on with.\nAfter completing this course you will feel comfortable putting Big Data, Scala and Spark on your resume and also will be easily able to work and implement in projects!\nThanks and I will see you inside the course!",

We'll also get into containers in development, packaging, and production, with examples and factors to consider for each.\nIn addition you'll get an in-depth look at how you can use Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos, and cloud container solutions to manage your containers effectively.\nContainerization entails placing a software component and its environment, dependencies, and configuration, into an isolated unit called a container. This makes it possible to deploy an application consistently on any computing environment, whether on-premises or cloud-based.\nContainers are a fundamental component of many DevOps processes. They are lightweight, can be deployed consistently in multiple environments, and are easy to transfer from one team to another. In this way, they help foster cross-organizational collaboration.\nThe transition to containers is helping developers and security teams address issues earlier in the development process before they become issues in production environments.",

      "description": "AWS Step Functions is a powerful yet easy to use server-less orchestration service. Step Functions is a state machine under the hood, and its primary abstractions are termed states. A Step Functions configuration contains a visual representation of all potential steps and their transitions.\nStep Functions lets you co-ordinate not only other AWS functions but also your external distributed systems. Use nested workflows to build larger workflows using smaller dependent or independent steps. Schedule and monitor your recurring workflows using a combination of AWS CloudWatch and Step Functions.\nWe will learn about the main use cases of Step Functions -\nData ETLs- With AWS Step Functions, you can automate extract-transform-load (ETL) scripts that move data between your applications  and your data warehouse.\nData Processing- Other types of data processing can also benefit from AWS Step Functions, particularly if both the source and destination are within AWS. This can include data verification, data cleaning, removing of duplicates, null values etc.\nServer-less workflow orchestration- The primary benefit of AWS Step Functions is the ease with which applications requiring the interconnection of several Server-less functions may be orchestrated. Run functions in parallel or sequence. You can ever have a manager give manual approval via SNS into the workflow.\nWe will understand why AWS Step Functions is the perfect workflow automation tool. We will learn about its features & capabilities.\nAWS Step Functions makes life easier for developers by allowing you to quickly design complicated sequences of activities in AWS while also managing error handling and retry logic and decoupling your application's business logic from its technical orchestration logic.\nEverything is well documented and separated, so you can find what you need. Assignments and Quizzes will make sure you stay on track and test your knowledge. The course will have a combination of theory and practical examples.",

Il est présent dans la grande majorité des entreprises de développement et est clairement l’incontournable des projets open source. Alors qu’attendez vous pour rejoindre le groupe?\nGithub est une plateforme de collaboration pour les développeurs basée sur Git. Github va vous permettre non seulement d'héberger vos dépôts Git mais aussi vous fournir de nombreux outils qui vous aideront dans le développement en équipe. Il faut savoir qu’une grande partie des projets open source ont leur dépôt de référence hébergé sur cette plateforme. Pour ne citer qu’un exemple: Vim, qui est un des éditeur de texte le plus utilisé sous Linux.\nPour finir, GitHub à été racheté par Microsoft en 2018, plaçant encore une fois l'outil Git et la plateforme GitHub comme un incontournable pour tout bon développeur qui se respecte.\nAu plaisir de partager cette formation avec vous !\nArnaud\n\n\nQui je suis ?\nJe suis ingénieur informatique spécialisé notamment dans les outils de développement tel que git. J’ai lors de mon parcours professionnel eu la chance d’être responsable des outils logicielle au sein du grand groupe SAFRAN. Pendant près de 3 ans, j’ai donc eu l'occasion de mettre en place et d'administrer Git tout en formant mes collègues à son utilisation.\n\n\nLa philosophie de mes cours:\nApprendre en pratiquant : Comme le dit Richard Branson « La meilleure façon d’apprendre c’est de faire ! » Et oui, il n'y a pas de secret, plus vous pratiquerez, plus vous progresserez ! Vous trouverez alors environs 20% de théorie pour 80% de pratique dans cette formation.\nApprendre en s’amusant : Vous l’avez surement remarqué, mais nous apprenons bien mieux quand les choses sont présentées de manière ludique. Vous trouverez alors dans cette formation un fil rouge sous forme d'une page web que nous ferons évoluer tout au long des vidéos. Cela permettra alors d'illustrer les commandes Git et servira de support pour les exercices que je vous ai préparé.\n\n\nInformations importantes à savoir:\nSi cette formation ne vous satisfait pas alors vous pouvez obtenir un remboursement sous 30 jours.\nUne fois que vous avez rejoint la formation, vous y avez accès à vie.\nVous avez également accès gratuitement à toutes les mises à jour que j’apporterai à cette formation.\nVous pouvez m’envoyer des messages personnels avec toutes vos questions ou suggestions concernant la formation.\nDes extraits vidéos sont à votre disposition.",

We will also discuss the differences between infrastructure and application codes and what can be shared for their respective pipelines.\nTo give a bit more details, we will check Terraform code to build web applications on Azure and use it between different environments. For the business application, we will have an Angular application that will be built as a Docker image, pushed to Docker Hub, and then deployed as a container.\nThe whole exercise is designed to be a real-life scenario, so we will not use IDE to deploy code to “production” – everything will be automated! Those pipelines we cover can be used as a jump-start for bigger enterprise projects (in fact, they are based on my experience and have evolved over many years). They are also a great learning exercise for understanding what DevOps brings to the business.\nThis course is intended for students who want to explore the possibilities of DevOps careers and learn how to build a solid foundation for their day-to-day work.

The course extensively uses animations, figures and real-world examples to make complex Docker concepts easy to understand and engaging to follow.\nSee complex Docker concepts come to life with our engaging lectures!\n\n\nCourse Coverage\nWe will start by discussing how containers and Docker evolved to solve the problem of deployments because deploying applications to production had serious challenges of reproducibility because of issues like configurations, libraries and network settings and how containers make the applications independent of the platform and you can perfectly replicate the same settings in all stages of production.\n\n\nWe will discuss docker architecture and the key components like the Docker Engine which sits on top of the host OS and manages containers.\n\n\nWe will take a deep dive into Docker images and explore layers, how to build custom docker images as well as techniques on how to optimise images for size, efficiency and performance.\n\n\nWe will also learn about container management including common commands, different modes of running containers such as detached and interactive as well, editing live containers as well as best practices.\n\n\nWe will see multi-stage builds in action and understand how multi-stage builds can significantly optimise the docker image size by removing unneeded build tools while still providing key functionality.\n\n\nWe will also discuss Docker networking, primarily the bridge mode as well as creating custom containers. We also explored how docker compose offers an elegant one-shot solution to facilitate the task of creating containers, networks and configurations.\n\n\nHands-on Practice Labs\nAn important aspect of this course is that for every topic that we explore, I will showcase a real-world application and you have several hands-on practice labs to get your hands dirty on how to actually apply the concepts that you have learned. From Dockerising real-world applications, to optimising your Docker images by up to 10 times:\nFrom debugging, to logging to monitoring applications in containers. You will apply hands-on skills to create Docker networks, manage container lifecycle as well as leverage docker-compose to orchestrate containers, networks and configurations.",

      "description": "Are you ready to build the next generation of intelligent, autonomous systems? The world of AI is moving beyond simple chatbots and into powerful, multi-purpose agents that can automate complex workflows and solve real-world problems. The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is the cutting-edge framework that makes this a reality.\nIn this comprehensive, hands-on course, you will go from a beginner with basic Python knowledge to a proficient AI agent developer. We will demystify the ADK framework and its core components, including Agents and Tools with practical, project-based learning.\nWe start with the fundamentals, guiding you through setting up your development environment and building your first intelligent agent. You will then learn how to extend your agent's capabilities by creating custom tools the key to connecting your agent to any external API or data source. Imagine an agent that can book flights, manage your calendar, or analyze financial data, all by using the tools you create.\nAs you progress, you will dive into more advanced topics. We will cover the design and implementation of sophisticated multi-agent systems, where multiple specialized agents collaborate to solve a single, complex task. You'll master orchestration patterns, from sequential to parallel and loop-based agent interactions, giving you the power to tackle any challenge. We will also explore advanced concepts like structured outputs, persistent memory, and the powerful \"agent-as-a-tool\" pattern, which allows agents to call other agents.\nBy the end of this course, you will not only have a deep theoretical understanding of the Google ADK but also a portfolio of projects demonstrating your practical skills. You will be equipped with the knowledge to build, deploy, and scale production-ready AI agents, positioning you at the forefront of the AI revolution.",

It is implemented in Java that makes it platform-independent.\nThe job of Build tools is to perform the compilation, testing, packaging and deployment of the final product. The advantages of performing these steps automatically instead of a human performing these steps is that the build is reproducible, faster and less error prone. Maven can perform these activities, e.g., create web sites, upload build results or generate reports. Maven also supports the creation of the initial folder structure for applications to make it easy to get started.\nFocused on project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.\nMaven is used for projects build, dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process like ANT, infact it's much more advanced. In summary, maven is a tool that can be used for building and managing any Java-based project. Maven make the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java-based project.\n\n\nThe key features of Maven include:\nEasily build a project using maven\nAdd jars and other dependencies of the project easily using the help of maven. It supports the definition and usage of dependencies to other libraries and projects. During the build, the Maven build system resolves the dependencies and it also builds the dependent projects if needed.\nMaven provides project information (log document, dependency list, unit test reports etc.)\nMaven is very helpful for a project while updating central repository of JARs and other dependencies\nBuild any number of projects into output types like the JAR, WAR etc without doing any scripting\nUsing maven we can easily integrate our project with source control system (such as Subversion or Git)\nAvoid as much configuration as possible, by choosing real world default values and supplying project templates\nMaven build system is extensible via plug-ins, which allows to keep the Maven core small. The Maven core does for example not know how to compile Java source code, this is handled by the compiler plug-in.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\n\n\nDownload, install Maven and run a simple build\nUnderstand Maven fundamentals and concepts\nUnderstand Maven configuration essentials\nConfigure and locate dependencies for a project\nConfigure plugins to run unit tests\nCreate and configure Maven multi-module projects\n\n\nApache Maven - Course Syllabus\n\n\nMaven Introduction\nDownloading and Installing Maven\nMaven Repositories\nCreating Maven Standalone Project in CLI\nWhat are JAR, WAR, EAR files\nMaven Build Life Cycle\nDeveloping Standalone Maven Project in Non-Interactive Mode\nRunning Test Cases with Maven\nCreating Maven Web Project in CLI\nCreating Maven Standalone Project through IDE\nCreating Maven Web Project through IDE\nAdding Dependencies to pom.xml\nDependency Chain\nMaven Scopes",

You will learn how to deploy a simple Spring Boot application (in a Docker image) under Kubernetes.\nThe course uses a publically available Docker Image. The image contains a Spring Boot Application, which exposes a simple RESTful API.\nAfter learning how to set up a local Kubernetes environment for development, you will learn how to create a Kubernetes Deployment. A Deployment is how Kubernetes defines a Docker container to run.\nNext you will learn how to configure a Kubernetes Service. A Service is how you direct Kubernetes to expose deployments to network resources.\nSpring Boot has added features to support running in a containerized environment. Two of these are Readiness and Liveness probes.\nThe Readiness probe accounts for startup period of an application. Once the application has started and is ready for work, the Readiness probe will return a positive result.\nThe Liveness probe returns a positive result while the application is in a healthy state. Kubernetes can monitor the Liveness probe for application health.\nFinally in the course, you will learn to configure a graceful shutdown. This allows the Spring Boot application to complete any inprocess transactions before the container is terminated.\nIf you're looking to get started running your Spring Boot applications under Kubernetes enroll today!",

Ainda vou conceituar o que é container, mas a ideia é que o seu software possa ser executado em um ambiente isolado e que fique blindado o máximo possível de interferências externas. Rapidamente você perceberá que uma classe inteira de bugs será eliminada pela padronização entre o ambiente de desenvolvimento e o ambiente produtivo que o software será executado.\nOutra vantagem incrível é a facilidade de replicar um ambiente Dockerizado para dezenas/centenas de desenvolvedores. Esqueça as longas horas para configurar o seu sistema na máquina de um novo dev, Isso sem dúvida será coisa do passado.\nNo curso você aprenderá os principais conceitos do Docker com vários exercícios práticos, todos descritos detalhadamente na apostila que será disponibilizada no curso. Tudo que for ministrado no curso estará disponível na apostila, e ter esse suporte a mais, será um diferencial fantástico.\nPara finalizar, quero convidar você que é desenvolvedor, DevOps, para nos acompanhar nessa caminhada com o Docker, não tenho dúvida que o nível que profissionalismo dos seus ambientes será outro depois das aulas.\nTe vejo no curso!",

      "description": "Python is an open-source community-supported, a general-purpose programming language that, over the years, has also become one of the bastions of data science. Thanks to its flexibility and vast popularity that data analysis, visualization, and machine learning can be easily carried out with Python.\nWith this application development course with Python 3, you'll first learn about variables, control flow statements & much more make use of them in Python programs. Then you will learn to use Python's advanced data structures such as lists and dictionaries. Then you will get a hands-on project building such as build a game that consists of a deck of playing cards, Dice-Rolling Simulator in Python, Building Architectural Marvels & much more. Moving further, you'll learn to troubleshoot your python application where you can quickly detect which lines of code are causing problems, and fix them quickly without going through 300 pages of unnecessary detail.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Begin Python Programming in 7 Days will get you started by setting up your environment and the tools you need to start programming in Python. You will be learning about variables and operators and how to make use of them in Python programs. You will learn all about control flow statements and loops in Python and you will be using them in your programs to solve your coding problems. Then you will learn to use Python's advanced data structures such as lists and dictionaries. You will be able to organize in functions and save time coding by writing code that can be reused. Then, you will learn about Python modules and how to make use of them. On the last day, you will start interacting with files using Python code. The course will give you a strong entry point into programming in general and programming in Python in particular.\nThe second course, Python By Example explores Python basics, data structures, and algorithms. We'll build a die rolling simulator to see how to use Python dictionaries, loops, functions, and control statements. Then, we will see how we can develop dictionaries that contain other dictionaries to build complex data structures. Next, we will use a modular approach to build a game that consists of a deck of playing cards. We will use object-oriented (OOP) Python classes to do so. We will display the playing cards both in a textual form, which we create, as well as via image files. This will lead to our displaying card images in a graphical form using Python's built-in Tkinter package. In the next part, we will use multiple inheritances with OOP classes. While the Java and C# programming languages are limited to only single inheritance, Python classes can inherit from multiple classes. You will learn how to use multiple inheritances with Python. You will also build Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). We will use Python's built-in Tkinter package and delve more deeply into GUI programming. By the end of this video tutorial, you will have built some useful utilities using Python. Python is very strong at searching directory folders, replacing words within modules, and much more. You will find these utilities useful in your everyday work as a developer.\nThe third course, Troubleshooting Python Application Development takes you through a structured journey of performance problems that your application is likely to encounter, and presents both the intuition and the solution to these issues. You'll get things done, without a lengthy detour into how Python is implemented or computational theory. Quickly detect which lines of code are causing problems, and fix them quickly without going through 300 pages of unnecessary detail.\nAbout the Authors:\nColibri Digital is a technology consultancy company founded in 2015 by James Cross and Ingrid Funie.

You’ll get hands-on experience creating Java projects with Maven, first as a JAR app and later as a Web app.\nYou’ll learn about Maven goals, dependencies, repositories, plugins, and the pom.xml file in a clear and practical way. We also explore how Maven integrates with IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse IDE, so you can work in whichever environment you prefer.\nTo make it more practical, we demonstrate unit testing with Maven and finally build a Spring Boot application managed by Maven — giving you real-world confidence to apply Maven in your projects.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a solid understanding of Maven fundamentals. The knowledge you gain here is good enough to start using Maven effectively in your daily development work. We’ve also added Maven notes to help you quickly revise the concepts.\nThis crash course is perfect for Java beginners, students, developers and DevOps engineers who want a quick yet comprehensive introduction to Maven.",

Alexander and I will lead you through the intricacies of creating, managing, and optimizing pipelines tailored to your development needs.\n\n\nAre you ready to dive deep into GitLab pipelines and learn how to automate and optimize your CI/CD workflows?\nDo you want to uncover the secrets behind effective pipeline management and build processes within GitLab?\nAre you interested in learning how to securely manage secrets, deploy applications, and streamline your CI/CD pipeline using templates?\nOr perhaps you're aiming to become proficient in setting up modular and dynamic pipelines that support scalable deployments.\n\n\nIf any of these resonate with you, this course is perfect for you.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nIn this comprehensive GitLab pipeline course, you’ll gain all the skills necessary to elevate your pipeline expertise. From creating basic pipelines to mastering complex scenarios involving dynamic rules and environments, we will cover everything in detail.\n\n\n1. Introduction\nWe will begin by welcoming you to the course and providing a brief overview of what to expect. You’ll also receive valuable tips on how to approach the lessons to make the most of your learning experience.\n\n\n2. Pipeline Skills (Language Agnostic)\nIn this section, we will introduce the core pipeline concepts that apply to any programming language. You will learn how to set up your first pipeline job and make it report test results. We will also cover managing caching and publishing build artifacts. Additionally, you will discover how to define rules to ensure jobs only run under specific conditions. The section also includes handling CI/CD variables to securely pass secrets through the pipeline, protecting sensitive information, and registering a GitLab runner on your local machine. You will further explore the creation of modular pipelines, using templates to promote deployment steps, and implementing inversion of control to standardize templates across applications. We will guide you through setting up and managing environments via pipelines, demonstrate the use of GitLab pipelines to publish a book, and explain how to match commit messages with specific patterns. Finally, you will learn how to group environments to enhance deployment management.\n\n\n3. Hands-on: Building a White-labeled App CI/CD Pipeline\nThis section takes a practical approach, walking you through the creation of a CI/CD pipeline for a white-labeled application. We will begin by presenting the project and introducing the initial steps of the pipeline. You will then deploy the application using SFTP and SSH, explained over three detailed steps. Next, we will simplify the white-labeling process by leveraging templates, which will be demonstrated in two parts. You will also learn how to dynamically register and tear down environments as needed. Furthermore, we will explore the use of dynamic pattern matching rules and demonstrate their application in two stages. Lastly, we will show you how to present the test results in GitLab’s web interface using artifacts.\n\n\n4. End of the Course\nAs the course concludes, we will provide a final message to acknowledge your completion of the course and leave you with one last piece of valuable information. By this point, you will be fully equipped to apply everything you have learned about GitLab pipelines and confidently implement these skills in your own projects.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have mastered GitLab pipelines, from basic setup to advanced configurations, and will be able to manage complex deployment workflows with confidence.\n\n\nWe are excited to have you on this journey with us and look forward to seeing what you will achieve with your newfound skills.\n\n\nThank you for your trust & best regards,\nAlexander & Sascha",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Git and GitHub course by Uplatz.\n\n\nGit is by far the most popular and widely used modern version control system in use today. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds of the Linux operating system kernel fame. A large number of software projects rely on Git for version control, and that includes professional projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).\nGit is a version control tool used widely by developers across the world. It helps individual developers keep track of changes as they work on different features in the same project, and helps teams organize their code. GitHub can integrate with Git - it is a web application that allows users to host, explore, and collaborate on code with their teams and the wider developer community.\nHaving a distributed architecture, Git is an example of Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.\n\n\nWhy Git is popular?\nThere are many reasons why Git is popular. In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind. The performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives. Committing new changes, branching, merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance. Also, the algorithms implemented inside Git take advantage of deep knowledge about common attributes of real source code file trees, how they are usually modified over time and what the access patterns are.\n\n\nGitHub is a cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. In simple words, GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even beginners and new coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line. GitHub is a development platform inspired by how developers work and manage their code. Thus it synchronizes well with Git.\nThis Git and GitHub course by Uplatz provides the foundation of how Git and GitHub work. The course covers the most commonly used Git commands, how and when to use them, as well as how to collaborate with developers using Git and GitHub. The GitHub features that are helpful for teams and enterprises are also discussed in this Git and GitHub course.\n\n\nGit and GitHub - Course Syllabus\n\n\nVersion Control System\nGit Introduction\nGit Installation\nGit Workflow\nCreating Remote Repository\nHow to add existing project to GitHub using Git Bash\nWorking with Repositories\nDeleting Files\nWorking with Branches",

You can jump between lessons, as they don't depend on each other, and our goal is to keep expanding the course with new topics. Also, be aware that Visual Studio Code is not a visual development environment, so at TMS Software we have been adding that functionality through an extension, so you can create applications visually with it.

      "description": "This training helps you implement continuous delivery process for your firmware.\nIn a way, it is also a comprehensive \"Zephyr RTOS Getting Started Guide\".\nHow is this different from existing getting started guide provided by Zephyr? It is aimed at your custom firmware application development in a custom repository outside of Zephyr - while zephyr guide focusing on getting started working ON zephyr - which is not what you are doing every day. So it’s a big difference in focus in this guide.\nWhat is included\nThe training is divided into 6 parts:\nOverview - a quick overview of the course - similar to this page.\nSetting up repository - here we start from scratch and I show you how to configure the repository correctly.\nSetting up GitLab CI - here we create a basic CI pipeline for our firmware repository that will allow us to run the whole build process automatically.\nDirectory Structure - we create a comprehensive directory structure that can accommodate for everything we may add to our project later.\nDocumentation Generation - here we add a documentation generator form Zephyr that will generate good looking reference manual for our project.\nTest Infrastructure - here we build out an automated test infrastructure using renode and CMock.\nRelease Generation - here we generate a release with all files included - docs, software bill of materials and firmware.\nSetting up repository\nIn this section we set up a basic repository from scratch. The advantage of doing this from scratch is that you get to learn how the whole repository is set up. While we are following a similar setup to Zephyr, we are not starting with an already set up repository. Instead we start from zero.\nIn this section the following topics are covered:\nAdding the first robot framework scripts that will serve as the \"definition of done\" for this step.\nAdding the required files: CMake files, Kconfig files, CODEOWNERS, gitignore etc.\nAdding a pre-commit hook that will run checks on changed files before each commit.\nAdding a repository init script that will set up local repository and system after a checkout.\nSetting up GitLab CI\nOnce the repository has been set up, we now need to configure gitlab so that we can move over to working with merge requests. To do this, we do the following:\nConfigure a CI pipeline through .gitlab-ci.yml\nCreate a proper task template (for creating tasks in gitlab)\nBuild docker images so that we can run the pipeline locally through gitlab-runner.\nAdd merge request template\nConfigure repository for trunk based development.\nAdd check to ensure that merge request title contains clickable reference to ticket being solved.\nAdd zephyr compliance checking scripts - so that you can verify content of a merge request before merging it.\nDirectory Structure\nOnce we have a gitlab pipeline working, we can now work through merge requests and in this step we add the rest of the directory structure.\nThis includes:\nAdding an example application - so that you have a template to work from.\nAdding a custom board - so that we can build the application for custom hardware.\nAdding cmake library directory - this will be the place where we later put cmake helper scripts.\nAdding an example device driver - so that we have a template for device driver directories.\nAdding documentation folder - we will add docs to it later.\nAdding global include directory - for public interfaces of libraries and drivers visible across the whole firmware project.\nAdding an example library - so that we have a way of adding libraries shared between multiple applications.\nAdding example samples - so we can later boot them in renode to run user stories.\nDocumentation Generation\nOnce the full directory structure is in place it’s time to add documentation generation. In this module we adopt Zephyr documentation generator so that it works in an external repository - such as the repository where we have our firmware code.\nThis involves:\nMoving the doc generator and adopting scripts so they build docs for our project.\nAdding robot framework scripts for verifying chapter structure - so that we can ensure that docs follow roughly the same structure.\nLinking the docs together so that we can generate a single PDF or HTML output.\nAdding doc build process to CI and making everything pass all CI checks that we have setup earlier.\nTest Infrastructure\nIn this section we focus on testing. There are three main types of tests that we need to add - unit, integration and system tests. Zephyr only has support for integration tests and a limited support for unit tests - so we have to add this. System tests are designed to take to final firmware, run it in a simulator (we will use renode in this training) and run user scenarios against it - this verifies the integrity of the whole system.\nAdding unity - so that we can ditch ZTest and use a standardized testing framework.\nAdding CMock - so that we can mock any function in our unit tests and have the ability to verify our code for logical integrity.\nAdding renode support - so that we can simulate our firmware through renode and write scenarios in robot framework syntax.\nCode coverage checking - so that we don’t allow any source file to be merged unless it has been fully tested.\nRelease Generation\nIn this section we will take everything that we have added so far and build a final release. This involves:\nAdding software BoM generation - so that we can have a list of files that were included in the binary.\nAdding code to generate a final release archive.",

More and more engineers use this powerful technology in their daily work to solve multidimensional and interdisciplinary problems. Simulation is mainly used where classical experiments (under controlled conditions) are not possible due to the size, number and complexity or also because of the impact on the environment. The increasing product complexity of software-defined vehicles (SDV) and their mapping to digital twins (DT) also leads to deep supply chains in the simulation domain.

In this course, we will learn the PineScript language that Tradingview allows us to code in, including its latest version. We will explore many new features introduced with this version together.\nWe will cover working with data from multiple indicators, converting famous indicators into strategies for backtesting, and more.\nYou will learn how to visualize the indicators you've combined or the specific signals you've created and see them on the chart.\nYou'll be able to code tables to see and visualize multiple data points on a single screen.\nWith libraries, you can export your function once and then use it in all your other codes with just one line.\nThrough request methods, you can access data from a different symbol within an indicator.\nWithout a paid account, you will be able to scan 40 instruments based on the data of any time range of the strategy you want.\nIn this training, where I also talk about the underlying thought process behind coding, you will structure your foundation very well. This will enable you to make even the simplest data useful and applicable in great ways.\nWe've covered how to devise strategies, add trailing stops to the strategies you design, and include stop loss and take profit.\nWe did plenty of exercises and progressed from simple to complex.\nThis course will always stay up-to-date.

TeamCity is a free tool up to a certain number of agents but that will not limit you.\nDevOps toolchain focus on different stages: Code, Build, Test, Package, Monitor, Release, Configure, Monitor. Each step will be automatically called by TeamCity. Therefore, we will have a lower time to release and shorten our release life cycle. For example, if we have an ASP.NET project that has a web app along with unit testing and the need to change project configuration to meet target environment requirement such as changing paths and connection string. A full release cycle with these steps will take a high amount of time considering that we have a higher chance of missing a step or forgetting to do some required work, which will cause a lot of trouble for us.\nIn my own experience with TeamCity, it has shorten my release time for my “EasyNETFramework” project from about 30 minutes to only two! It will take the latest source from github, call MSBuild to publish the web project and change the connection string and other related configs plus it will run for me the Nunit unit testing with a single click.\nAlso, you will see how you can define triggers in TeamCity to automatically call in a build and see its result.

It is use to authenticate users for many different types of applications around the world. Jenkins, Kubernetes, Jira are all using LDAP for authentication.\nIf you have un-secure apps then this course is for you. When combined with the best of integrations and modern tooling, LDAP will enable you to setup automated authentication at higher velocity while maintaining cost effectiveness. We will learn about the four key components of LDAP -\n1) Authentication - Learn how to setup a slapd server locally which will serve as the backend for LDAP. We will then learn how to authenticate users using LDIF statements from the command line. Design your very own directory information tree.\n2) Application Integration - Integrate LDAP with your python/java/nodejs apps. So your users have privacy and can be secure of what they do in your apps. This will also let you control access to different users.\n3) Cloud Integration - LDAP is even used in the cloud. Here we see how to integrate LDAP with JumpCloud and other cloud platforms to manage your users without needing a local server.\nAs you grow to become a force in the Security/Dev team, you will adopt, in addition to LDAP, supporting technologies that compliment LDAP , such as SlapD(for a local server ), JumpCloud (for cloud support) and KeyCloak (for a UI and integration with other authentication mechanisms ) All in this course! We will also make use of LDAP in Jenkins and docker for advanced authentication. All of these topics will be talked about, so you know what they are used for.\nEverything is well documented and separated, so you can find what you need.

It allows us to drop our code into panels that we place and connect in a canvas. In a normal IDE your code will run linearly from start to end, making it really hard to create sub-experiments/tests, and also to organise your project clearly. In Prython each panel accepts multiple IN and OUT connections, effectively transforming it into a 2D Jupiter notebook. It also has a wide array of tools that complement this canvas functionality: such as displaying dataframes next to the panels that modified them, allowing you to freeze your outputs, attaching consoles, navigation markers, etc.\nWe assume that the student is already familiar with R or Python, and some familiarity with matplotlib, scikit-learn,or keras would be beneficial as well.",

      "description": "There seems to be a notion among uninformed beginners in programming that the VIM editor was born out of some sort of a relic and is used only by nerds who are fond of Unix. It is true to some extent. But relics are also classics that have a charm of their own which cannot be replicated. It is a privilege to learn them.\nThis course attempts to handhold you during your initial journey through Vim by introducing just a small and simple set of commands that will make you not only comfortable but also fairly productive when you start using Vim.\nNoteworthy Reviews:\nSai Radhika Mangipudi: The 1st tutorial itself is sufficient to keep going on..for  a week of practice. great explanation.\nAndrew Magdy Kamal: Nicely Designed little course : Very well designed, the course is very detailed, and although the animations are a bit immature, the teaching styles isn't. Overall would recommend.\nLearn the basic and mandatory commands to start using Vim effectively\nCommand mode\nInsert mode\nCommands in the above modes\nCommands to navigate amongst files and to interact with the environment.\nGetting started with Vim\nVim commands are predominantly keyboard based. Those who are used to using a graphical interface for program development may find it a little strange to adapt to this editor initially. It might seem to consume too much of your productive time. Still, in certain work areas like those involving C programming, knowledge of using VIM editor comes in quite handy in many many occasions.\nThis course hopes to help you start using the Vim editor without having to spend too much time figuring out how to accomplish the basic editing tasks.\nContent and Overview\nThe course first introduces a small set of commands that are mandatory to edit and store a text file.\nThen, it introduces a bunch of commands alphabet-wise. This approach is taken because, Vim is predominantly keyboard based, as mentioned earlier; so, all the alphabets are associated with some functionality. Once you gain the knowledge of these key-function mappings, then, you almost have the editor on your finger-tips, literally and figuratively.\nLastly, you will also be introduced to a small set of commands that will help you navigate through multiple files.\nOnce you are get familiar with these commands, then, it would become easy for you to follow the treasure trove of other awesome commands, configuration settings and vimrc changes in future.\nThis tiny course hopes to make your initial VIM experience as smooth as possible and  annihilate or at least attenuate the frustration faced sometimes by the beginners of VIM.\nHappy Vimming! :-)",
      "target_audience": [
        "Anybody who is interested in learning the basics of the VIM editor, people who have a necessity to learn VIM for their work urgently and are time-constrained, Unix/Linux users and people who are likely to be switching between Windows and Linux often, anyone who does not want to feel lost amongst seasoned Vim users at workplace should take this course",
        "People who are already familiar with Vim and are expecting to sharpen their Vim skills may not find this course useful, as this deals with basics for beginners mainly with an intension to quell their initial fear and aversion towards Vim, with a gentle approach to Vim."
