      "description": "本講座では、めまぐるしく変化する時代におけるマーケティング成功の秘訣をまとめました。\n\n\nマーケティングとは、本来どこか特定の部門が行うものではなく、あらゆる部門のメンバーが「顧客」と向き合うべきものです。\nそして、マーケティング戦略の上に、すべての組織、事業セグメント、チャネル、アライアンスなどを連携させて、練り上げた施策を実行することが必要です。\nだからこそ私は、マーケティング活動とは経営の根幹であると考えています。\n\n\nそして、最初から 大きな変化を求めるのではなく、小さな変化を積み上げることが何よりも大切です。\n大きな変化には、必ず大きな抵抗があります。変化は少しずつでも構いません。\n大切なことは、変化のスピードです。\n少しずつの変化を素早く起こすことができれば、着実に変化していきます。\nそして、着実に前進し、結果として、目指すべきゴールに一番早くたどり着くことができます。\n\n\n本講座では、「小さくはじめて、素早く実行し、大きく育てよ」とのメッセージを送っています。\nそのため、その実行プロセスを世界最速の意思決定手法である「OODAループ」に沿って解説をしました。\n\n\nただし、 OODAループとは、皆さんが実行しているPDCAと対立するものではありません。むしろ、車の両輪です。このあたりについても本講座の中で詳しく解説しています。\n\n\nそれでは、どのように組織の中にOODAループを埋め込み、マーケティング活動を成功させていくのか？\nそれが本講座の核心になります。\nぜひ最後までご視聴いただければと思います。",

By using these tools for your event planning, you will be able to create a complete overview of what is needed in less time than ever before without forgetting anything.\nUse the tools to keep track of your progress. It will allow you to be on Top of your Game at all times.\nBy the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and the tools to become more efficient, organized and professional.\nAnd if you are new to the field, this course will allow you to learn things the right way from the top down without the need to upgrade your essential skill set repeatedly.\n\n\nPersonal Touch\nStudents will be able to start discussions and message me with private questions. I pride myself on answering most questions within 24 hours.\nFor those that want additional help with their event planning that is beyond the scope of this course, I provide One-On-One Virtual Consulting Sessions for festivals and events through my website.\nI love helping students that take my course and I have taken it to a whole new level. I am here to help!\n\n\nMore about the course:\n\n\nThere are a lot of good event planners and managers out there. Most specialize in a specific field and repeat the same process over and over. Not that there is anything wrong with that. The problems occur when event planners step out of their comfort zone to plan events that are larger than what they are used to. It is next to impossible to apply the same principles to a larger event.\nIf you are used to planning events for 300 people, you cannot apply the principles for those events to larger ones for 3,000 or 30,000 people. If, however, you know how to plan events for 30,000 people, you can downscale those principles to smaller events.\nThis course shows you how to plan the \"big events\". You can then use the skills you learn here and apply them to any size event.\nA big part of planning a large-scale event is knowing all of the requirements.\nMore people does not mean you just need more of the same. More people need more things, different things (requirements).\n\n\nA brief overview of what is covered:\nThe difference between festivals and events.\nWhat kind of time frames are involved in the planning stages?\nAttracting the right kind of sponsors for your event.\nHow to plan an effective and winning sponsorship strategy.\nThe elements of sponsorship proposals.\nHow to deal with sponsors to keep them year after year.\nWhy buying entertainment is different from buying a couch.\nWho are the people involved in the process?\nWhat you need to know about sending an \"offer\" to prevent you from having major issues.\nWhen it is appropriate to send an offer.\nWhy artist riders are so important to the overall process.\nHow to spot potential issues in artist riders.\nHow you can utilize the Event Master Plan to plan any kind of or any size event or festival.\nHow to use the Event Master Plan in your daily planning life and how it will make your life easier.\nHow to use the Event Master Plan to prime your budgets.\nHow to use financial information discovered and bring it all together in the Cost Sheet.\nHow to use the cost sheet to provide an industry standard and accepted financial overview of all costs, revenue and potential profit, including industry-standard splits.\nMy Tools. As part of this course, you will get lifelong access to the tools that I have custom designed and perfected over 30 years of planning and managing events of all kinds and sizes.\n\n\nThis course is ideal for people in the following categories:\nEvent planners/managers that have never had the chance to produce a large scale event and would like to expand their skill set to attract more business.\nEvent planners/managers that have tried unsuccessfully to produce a large-scale event and want to learn how to do it properly.\nWedding Planners that want to expand their business beyond weddings.\nCorporate Planners that want to grow the size of events they would like to tackle. The same principles are 100% transferable to corporate planning and I have successfully done so myself many times over.\nBoard Members of festivals and events (and corporate companies that put on large events).\nAs a board member, you are responsible for the event in many ways. Having a solid knowledge of everything in this course will help you reviewing budgets, marketing and all other plans. It also will help you find the right person to manage the event for you and provide you with the knowledge you need to see if your staff is doing a good job.

      "description": "Consumer behavior is the study of individuals, groups, or organizations and all the activities associated with the purchase, use and disposal of goods and services, and how the consumer's emotions, attitudes and preferences affect buying behavior. Any individual who purchase goods and services from the market for his / her end-use is called a consumer. In simpler words consumer is one who purchases goods and services available in the market. Example- Tom might purchase a tricycle for his son or Mike buy a shirt for himself. In the above example both Mike and Tom are consumers. Consumer behavior deals with the study of buying behavior of consumers. Consumer behavior help as to understand why and why not an individual purchases goods and services from the market.\nThere are several factors that affect consumer behavior such as cultural factors: cultural factors comprises of a set of values and ideologies of a particular community or a group of individuals. It is the culture of the individual which decide the way he / she behaves. In simpler words, culture is nothing but values of an individual. What an individual learns from his parents and relatives as a child becomes his culture.\nThe consumer goes through a lot of stages before he/she buy a product or service. Tim went to a nearby retail store to buy a laptop for himself. The store manager showed him all the latest models and after few rounds of negotiation, Tim immediately selected one for himself. The basic analysis is that Tim need a laptop and when he went to the store there was variety to choose from. Being mindful consumer really means being aware of youractions and how they impact the planet and your community.",

This will serve as a source of inspiration and show you how these strategies can work for you too.\n\n\nWe structured the masterclass in simple challenges that you must complete in order to move on to the next step.

Bu eğitimi hazırlarken, insanların nasıl ikna olduğu, nasıl kara verdiği ve bilinçaltı ekseninde nasıl düşündüğü gibi konuları göz önünde bulundurarak, ömür boyu ara ara dönüp, inceleyeceğiniz bir eğitim hayata geçirdik. Eğitimin 1. versiyonu yayında,  ara ara yenilikler ekleyecek, hatta videoları yenileyerek, bu eğitim setini güncel tutacağız.\n\n\nAsansör Sunumu (Elevator Pitch) Nedir?\nElevator pitch, yani Türkçesiyle Asansör sunumu; asansör kapılarının kapanmasından itibaren başlayan ve varılacak kata kadar devam eden, 15-45 saniye içerisinde yapılan bir sunumdur. Bu sunumda, kısa bir zaman içerisinde ilk defa karşılaşılan yatırımcının dikkatini çekmek için girişimciler kendilerini ve girişimlerini anlatır.\nAsansör Sunumu Yapmadan Önce Nelere Dikkat Edilmeli?\nGirişiminizi tanıtmak için yaratılan süreyi iyi değerlendirmek yatırımcıların ilgisini çekmede önemli bir unsurdur. Peki, bu kısa süre içerisinde sunumunuzu nasıl etkili kılabilirsiniz?\nAsansör sunumu, diğer sunum çeşitlerine kıyasla çok daha zordur. Süre kısıtlaması, uzun süreli ve sağlam bağlantılar edinme hedefi nedeniyle, diğer sunum çeşitlerinde de profesyonel olmayı gerektirir. Sunum öncesinde arkadaşlarınıza ya da kendi kendinize yapacağınız provalar ile heyecanınızı yatıştırabilirsiniz. Prova yapmak, sunum için size pratiklik kazandırır ve konuşmanızı daha etkili hale getirir. Bu denemeler sayesinde bahsetmeniz gereken kilit noktaları belirleyebilirsiniz. Bu önemli konuları kapsayan minik bir konuşma metni hazırlayarak sunumunuza hazır olabilirsiniz. Sunum provaları sayesinde eksik ya da zayıf kaldığınız noktaları tespit ederek kendinizi geliştirebilir ve sunumunuzu zenginleştirebilirsiniz.",

The approach is to think through your business holistically, starting with identifying the high level milestones your leads and prospects experience, and then examining the gaps between those milestones to spot and prioritize opportunities for improvement. You can think of it as a progressive diagnostic - when you engage in this conversation, it prompts thoughtful reflection on your current business reality, and the gap between that and the ideal business future.\nI believe the lessons in this course are irrefutable, invaluable, and universally relevant (bold claim, I know).\nWe took the patterns that were revealed from these conversations and translated them into a curriculum that can help any small business reveal opportunities, and prioritize the path forward.\nIn six modules we'll work through establishing the milestones of your customer's journey, paving the path between them, and analyzing that journey to reveal your top opportunity so that you can pursue it with confidence. There is a peace of mind that comes along with knowing the thing you're working on is indeed the best use of your time - and this diagnostic helps produce that level of clarity.",

Ou perde a força completamente porque está desfocada.\nBuyer Personas são a representação de seu cliente ideal com base em pesquisas de mercado e dados reais sobre seus clientes existentes. Esta é a pessoa para a qual você está criando seu conteúdo, produtos ou serviços.\nEm vez de focar em um segmento amplo ou algo abstrato, você humaniza seu marketing e o torna real. A criação de Buyer Personas resulta em um Marketing mais forte, mais eficaz e eficiente, além de mais econômico.\nPermite que você transmita uma mensagem mais personalizada, minimize gastos em publicidade e descubra as objeções dos clientes.\nQuem são seus clientes e qual o problema que você está resolvendo para eles?\nComo seu produto ou serviço terá sucesso no mercado onde outros podem ter falhado?\nCom a definição de Buyer Personas você terá uma ideia muito melhor de quem, como e onde você deve investir para impulsionar o sucesso do seu negócio através de estratégias de marketing mais direcionadas e eficazes.",

Do you want them to grow profitably by attracting increasing numbers of ideal customers who are both loyal and who then recommend them to others? Then this Masterclass in  Actionable Insight Development is for you.\nEvery brand needs an insight as its foundation, but most organizations don’t know how to develop one. Especially one that they can immediately action to grow the brand faster and more profitably than ever before.\nDo you work in marketing, market research or brand management, or are you a business owner or even an entrepreneur just starting out? In that case, you need to know how to develop actionable insights as the basis for each of your brands and businesses.\n\n\nBefore getting into the details of this Masterclass, here are a few facts for you:\nFACT: Brands built on customer insights have a more solid foundation to grow and consistently engage their customers - as if by magic!\nFACT: Customer-centric companies grow seven times faster than those that aren’t and are 60% more profitable!\nFACT: Thinking customer first in everything you do builds more powerful brands and greater brand loyalty.\nThis course includes eleven captivating videos explaining how to develop actionable insights using my proprietary 7-step process. It has been inspired by the exact same steps used by some of the most successful CPG / FMCG companies in the world. And it has been taught to many more of them, too, as a way of upgrading their own, often outdated, practices.\nFrom how to choose your category and target audience to how to convert your business objective into a customer-centric aim, you will learn how to walk in your customers’ shoes, analyze and complete your data and information about them, and then develop actionable insights that lead to profitable growth for your brands.\n\n\nACTIONABLE INSIGHTS DEVELOPMENT MASTERCLASS GOAL\nThe facts I mentioned at the start of this description should be your wake-up call if your brands don’t have an insight as their foundation! I built this comprehensive Insights Development Masterclass to help everyone who has heard about insights and knows they should be using them but isn’t sure they know what they really are or what the best way to develop and action them is.\nCATSIGHT is our proven methodology for maximizing the ROI of your information investments. It was developed more than ten years ago and is mentioned in the globally acclaimed book “Winning Customer Centricity: Putting Customers at the Heart of Your Business – One Day at a Time.”\nOver the years, CATSIGHT has been used by multinationals, agencies and PMEs across the world to improve the value of their intelligence investments.\nThe method focuses on analyzing available information before any data gathering is carried out, and which is then commissioned only to fill identified knowledge gaps. This avoids unnecessary expenditure, increases actionability and ensures maximum value is obtained from all surveys and reports purchased.\nA food and beverage multinational regularly conducted market research surveys to answer their marketing and sales questions. By implementing CATSIGHT, they were able to eliminate numerous expenditures while also gaining more actionable insights that impacted their growth.\nWith an average cost of $20-50,000 or more per project, that can quickly add up in terms of budget savings!\nA well-known Japanese proverb says\n“Insight without action is a daydream. Action without insight is a nightmare”.\nSo which are you living, a daydream or a nightmare? Neither is good, and this course will help you to avoid both!\n\n\nACTIONABLE INSIGHTS DEVELOPMENT MASTERCLASS CONTENT\nYou can keep scrolling below to view the comprehensive course content and also to watch some of the free video sessions available, but here is a quick outline of what we will cover together:\nWhat is an Insight? Do you know precisely what an insight is and why it’s essential that it should be actionable? I show you and provide an easy way to remember the crucial elements of an insight.\nHow to Develop an Insight: I share my proprietary 7-step process for developing an insight. Even client organizations with their own insight processes are often surprised to learn that they are missing several of these essential steps when I show the full process to them.\nIdentifying the exact category in which you’re competing: Most companies know their industry role, but they don’t always correctly identify the category in which they are competing - from their customers’ perspective. I explain how to recognize whether your current target group is too narrow or too wide and even provide tools so you can select the most profitable segment to go after.\nTurning your business objectives into customer aims: It is essential to understand how you will succeed in meeting your business objective by impacting your customers’ attitudes and/or behaviours. Thinking customer first will make your objectives far more actionable in the marketplace, as you will be taking your customers’ perspective.\nChoosing your ideal target audience: Trying to attract anyone who buys a segment is almost certainly destined to fail. You need to select a group that will be the most profitable and then get to know them as deeply as possible. From segmentation to persona/avatar creation, I provide the detailed knowledge and all the tools you need to support you in making an ideal choice.\nInsights need cross-departmental knowledge: Even if professionals in market research and marketing are the natural leaders of insight development, implementing the actions coming out of them requires the support of every department. I show you how to get that assistance from every level and from right across your whole organization.\nWalking in your customers’ shoes: To understand them deeply, you must see the market from their perspective. I know I've already said this several times, but it really is that important! I’ll share many ways for you to do this, some that don’t even require you to leave your desk or office!\nInformation gathering and market research: I’ll show you where and how to get all the data and information you need to fill your knowledge gaps. Then, I’ll explain how to analyze and summarise it all to develop actionable insights. Too often, people turn to market research when they need information. However, most organizations already have far more information internally than anyone realizes. Have you never heard this phrase?\n“If only we knew what we know!\"\n\n\nUnderstanding human behaviour: The best insights contain an emotional element since emotions are the source of change in attitudes and behaviours. You’ll learn how to choose the most relevant need state for your brand and then identify all the different emotions you want to stimulate. This will ensure that the insight you develop will resonate with your target audience and engage them so they take the desired action.\nInsights in Action: I share many inspiring case studies of how insights have been played out in advertising and brand communications across the globe so you can learn by example.\nNext Steps: Once you have completed this masterclass, I’ll suggest some ideas to take your learning to the next level with additional courses and books you may want to consider.\n\n\nLEARNING BY DOING\nI believe that the best way to learn is by doing. That’s why this course includes many real-life examples, and each class ends with exercises for you to complete. You will benefit most from each session if you finish these activities before continuing with the next video session.\n\n\nWHAT OTHER STUDENTS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE MASTERCLASS\n“Great way to gain an understanding of insights in brief segments. Learning I can put into action immediately.” Terry V.\n“RI enjoyed this course, and it gave me great insights into an area I’m familiar with - even though I’ve been in CX for almost 40 years. I love Denyse’s energy and humour, and her practical examples made this all come alive.” Aki K.\n“As CMO of a tiny Internet company, my challenge is centred around how to get the C-Suite (who are more artists than businessmen) to gain a concrete realization of the psychological factors in marketing. Your course was a good fit for me in that I have a better vocabulary/systematic way to use in trying to achieve my goal” William J.\nTaking this course is 100% risk-free. If you do not like the course for any reason, you can request a refund within the first 30 days. That is my promise to you. ENROLL NOW, and I’ll see you in the first video.\n\n\nMEET YOUR INSTRUCTOR DENYSE DRUMMOND-DUNN\nIf you have never met me before, my name is Denyse Drummond-Dunn. I am a Business Growth Catalyst, helping companies grow faster & more profitably through deeper customer understanding and engagement. My career of more than 30 years includes working in senior global executive roles in over 125 countries with Nestlé, Gillette & Philip Morris International. But for the past ten years, I have become a full-time coach, trainer, and speaker, sharing my expertise with those willing and ready to upgrade their knowledge and results.\nI’m a new-age marketer, combining creativity with technical expertise & cultural sensitivity. Living in the heart of Europe in Switzerland, I’ve always worked globally. This has provided me with a unique perspective to help organizations, large and small, understand the importance of customer centricity, no matter where in the world they might be. This is particularly powerful when looking to innovate or roll out successful brands in other markets.\nI hold a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science & diplomas in Organisational Leadership & Innovation from IMD in Switzerland and the LBS in the UK. Besides my multinational executive clients whom I adore, I’m passionate about animals (I have two cats, Maddie and Pearl), flying (I’m a twin-engine pilot), underwater diving (I’m a PADI Divemaster) and technology. (I’m a Geek too!)\n\n\nARE YOU READY TO START MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR BUSINESS?\nI invite you to join this masterclass and start helping your organization make better use of all the data and information it has gathered so that your brands are built on the solid foundation of actionable insights. Click the “Buy now” button to enroll in the course “Insight Development Masterclass for Marketers and Researchers.”\nAnd I’ll see you in the first session.\n\n\nFINAL NOTE\nUdemy has recently introduced a very early rating and review request. You can ignore it, but if you do decide to rate the course, could I ask that you also add an update to it when you have completed the course? The final rating is much more critical and will help other students understand the great value of the content. Thank you.\nCopyright 2023 Denyse Drummond-Dunn, C3Centricity",

      "description": "El término Marketing es, con frecuencia, mal utilizado. Algunos lo asocian con un conjunto de herramientas de venta, otros creen que es un sistema de Mercado concebido para crear necesidades en el público. También están quienes creen que Marketing es publicidad; pero nada más lejos de la verdad.\nLo que la mayoría de la gente no sabe es que los grandes emprendedores digitales tienen enormes éxitos porque dominan en profundidad los principios del Marketing Digital y delegan a otros todas las cuestiones técnicas, pudiendo de esta manera hacer muchísimo más y con la mejor calidad.\nEn este curso, nos enfocamos en los Principios detrás de todo el Mundo del Marketing.\n\n\nPrimera Parte: Marco Teórico y Conceptual de la Disciplina.\nRecorreremos los Fundamentos de Marketing, que son esenciales para tener una base sólida de conocimientos como guía de nuestras decisiones y posteriores acciones. Conoceremos las tendencias actuales de la disciplina y los nuevos escenarios que desafían nuestros proyectos.\nLos cambios económicos, tecnológicos, sociales y culturales de los últimos años han alterado el carácter y el alcance de los Mercados, por lo cual, estudiaremos en profundidad los Mercados, sus Segmentos, Nichos y Micro-Nichos, junto con las principales herramientas de análisis y medición actuales.\nDe igual manera estudiaremos en profundidad a los consumidores y su Comportamiento de Compra, considerando que son ellos quienes deciden si compran o no nuestro producto y es por ello que merecen una especial atención, para identificar qué les gusta, qué les disgusta y qué les gustaría, para luego poder darles justamente eso.\nEs muy común en la Fijación de Precios que se recargue un porcentaje sobre el costo del producto, pero este rudimentario y obtuso método no funciona en el Mercado actual, es por eso que abordaremos el concepto de Pricing, la ciencia de la Fijación de Precios.\nAnalizaremos y estudiaremos en profundidad otro de los apartados más importantes del mundo del Marketing, el Desarrollo de Productos, creación de ofertas, creación y selección de Carteras de Productos, para partir del producto adecuado siempre.\nSin importar de qué clase de producto se trate, debemos ser capaces de contactar con los Compradores Potenciales y facilitar el acceso a nuestro producto. Por ello estudiaremos en detalle la creación y gestión estratégica de los Canales de Distribución.\nY por supuesto entraremos en lo que se conoce como Mix de Marketing o Mezcla de Marketing.\n\n\nSegunda Parte: Aplicación Práctica en la Era Digital.\nComenzaremos viendo cuáles son las diferencias principales entre el Marketing Tradicional y el Marketing Digital, considerando que ambas pueden y deben coexistir si queremos obtener grandes logros.\nVeremos los diferentes tipos de Productos Digitales, tales como: Cursos online, E-books, Programas de Afiliados, y con qué herramientas y plataformas digitales podemos desarrollarlos.\nTrabajaremos los diferentes métodos y herramientas para desarrollar los siguientes elementos de Marketing Digital:\nInfo-Productos.\nEmbudos de Ventas.\nPáginas de Captura.\nPáginas de Aterrizaje.\nCartas de Ventas.\nNewsletters\nAuto-Responders.\nWordPress y los principales PlugIns de Marketing.\nMarketing Orgánico (gratuito) en Redes Sociales.\nMarketing Pago en Redes Sociales.\nY mucho más.\nVeremos paso a paso cómo se crea una estrategia general de Marketing y luego abordaremos una estrategia de Marketing de Contenidos que encaje con estrategia general.\nAl Finalizar el curso sabrás exactamente qué hacer, cómo hacerlo y a quién delegar las tareas de tipo técnicas para lograr el máximo desarrollo posible de tu empresa.\nBienvenido al Curso de Marketing, bienvenido a la unión definitiva de los Principios de Marketing, con los Resultados en la Era Digital.",

And we believe the key to designing that business is a clear customer journey framework that produces consistent results, and creates calm, organized, predictable growth.\nThere are nine total stages in the Lifecycle Marketing framework, and they're broken out into three higher level sections.\nThe three stages in the Collect Leads section are: Target | Attract | Capture\nThe next stage, Convert Clients, also has three stages: Engage | Offer | Close\nAnd the final three stages fall under the third section, Create Fans: Deliver | Impress | Multiply\nThe first step is to use the framework to assess the current reality in your business - not to cast judgement one way or another, but just to take stock of what does or doesn't exist.\nOnce you've done that, the next thing you can do is spot any gaps the framework has revealed - and work on resolving them.\nAfter you've established you have a complete customer journey, then you can go to work optimizing it.\nAnd finally, once you've designed the ideal customer journey you want your customers to experience; you can comb over it with an automation lens and look for areas where automation could enhance it.\nYou can learn more about this concept we call Lifecycle Marketing in our flagship course.",

By exploring the essential principles, skills, and practices detailed in this course, you will gain the tools needed to turn strategy into action and drive sustained success.\nSection 2, Setting the Stage, lays the foundation by emphasizing the importance of aligning sales planning with a company’s broader strategic goals. In today’s competitive B2B environment, this integration is non-negotiable. Sales managers are instrumental in ensuring that sales strategies support corporate objectives, organizing teams effectively, and adapting to changing market conditions. This section underscores how such alignment boosts sales performance and fuels overall business growth.\nTo lead effectively, sales managers must possess a robust understanding of financial fundamentals, which is the focus of Section 3, Essential Finance Skills. From analysing financial statements to creating realistic sales budgets, this section equips managers with the financial acumen required for decision-making. By mastering these skills, sales managers become better positioned to plan strategically and manage resources efficiently.\nSales success hinges on a deep understanding of customers, which is explored in Section 4, Customer Skills. This section focuses on the ability to analyse markets, craft compelling value propositions, foster customer satisfaction, and manage relationships effectively. These skills are critical for improving sales performance and building long-term client loyalty—cornerstones of sustainable success.\nOperational excellence is at the heart of Section 5, Operational Skills. A sales manager’s ability to optimize resources, streamline the sales process, and leverage performance metrics determines the efficiency and effectiveness of the sales force. This section provides actionable strategies to refine these operational capabilities, enabling managers to maximize productivity and profitability.\nNo sales team can thrive without strong leadership, which is why Section 6, People Skills, emphasizes the human element of sales management. From recruiting and training the right talent to motivating and performance-managing a team, this section delves into the critical interpersonal skills that differentiate high-performing managers. The success of a sales manager often hinges on their ability to inspire and empower their team to excel in a competitive environment.\nThe journey concludes with Section 7, From Theory to Practice, where learners apply the knowledge gained throughout the course to real-world scenarios. Through a detailed, integrated case study, this section challenges learners to think critically, solve problems, and execute tasks as they would in the workplace. By bridging theory and practice, it ensures that sales managers are prepared to meet the demands of their role with confidence and competence.\nLet us embark on this journey together—equipping sales managers to lead with clarity, inspire with confidence, and deliver with excellence. The stakes have never been higher, and the opportunities never greater.\nWelcome to The Fundamentals of Sales Management.",

      "description": "Creating an online business of any type can be a daunting task but without sales and marketing skills you won't get far. Most likely you have your product or service, perhaps a new website, and now you wait for that money to pour in. The problem? It never does. There is much more to an online business than selling a product or service and then collecting money. One of the most important things you need to do is marketing. If you are not in a position to hire a marketing expert then doing it yourself is the next best way. It is needed no matter what type of business you do.\nThis sales and marketing course is designed to get you started in the right direction by making it super simple. It is a basic course designed for beginners and those who may be struggling to earn any sales or get traffic to their websites. This course will cover tips for making sales and various marketing techniques. For example did you know that a product with a personal story behind it outsells those that don't? I'll explain in the course. Did you know that video is a fantastic way to build your brand and bring in sales? I cover that as well. Other things we will discuss are tips for optimizing your website, blogging, traffic, video, paid advertising methods, email, offline marketing, customer service, branding, creating a call to action, social media, and so much more! By the time this course ends you will have everything you need to take your online business to the next level by utilizing marketing.\nWhile you take this course you can feel confident that you are learning from someone who has been where you are now. I have been running multiple online businesses for awhile now. I've had my failures and I've had my success. I learned what it takes to grow a successful business and now I am going to teach you using 100% video lectures and video tutorials. It will take a few weeks to complete this sales and marketing course as we will cover a lot but it will be well worth it. If you have advanced skills in marketing or are looking for advanced information on marketing this course is not for you.",

      "description": "Marketing is often seen as quite an ambiguous and vague concept that never really comes with a set game plan. Everyone seems to have a lot of marketing advice, and their own business marketing strategies, but how can you tell what’s useful and what’s not, especially when presented with such an overwhelming amount of information?\nThis course works from the ground up, guiding you to create a marketing plan of action that will help you make the most of the resources your company has readily available.\nThe course will start off with a basic definition of ‘marketing’, and what that means for your business. This will come in useful when you begin to understand what sort of customer you want to attract, and more importantly what type of customer you want to retain.\nAs proven by many ‘3-D businesses’, the best strategies operate on a ‘choose ‘em or lose ‘em’ principle. If you aren’t marketing to the right type of person, you aren’t going to generate a lot of sales. However, by marketing to the perfect customer type, you only need a fraction of your resources to generate the same amount of sales. This course will show you exactly how to make this divide between the right customer and the wrong one.\nThis course will also run you through the ‘Dramatic Difference’ model, and how you can apply it to take a significant step towards overtaking your competitors. After all, if you’re doing everything your competition brands are doing, why would your customers ultimately choose you?\nBy running through some easy mistakes that businesses make when designing their marketing plan, and how you can go that extra mile when attracting customers, this course is a fool-proof guide for any business owner or marketing leader looking to buck the trend and catapult their company towards profitable growth. Enrol now to take your business marketing strategies to the next level.",

      "description": "One of the secrets of successful businesses is that they understand how do their consumers/ customers behave. It is because once you know certain triggers that the consumers positively react to, you capitalise on those and provide the best experiences that your consumers are looking for. To find out these triggers that we being consumers are prone to, it is inevitable to study the behavior of consumers.\nUnderstanding consumer behavior helps us to treat the consumers the way they want to be treated, in result, it makes them happy consumers/ customers, which in return, make them come back to our company, business, and organisation again and again. This is a win-win situation for both parties. But how will we understand the behavior of consumers?\nWorry not. This course of consumer behaviour will teach you some very established models in the field of marketing. Understanding these models will help you know those factors that influence consumer decision making. Further, there are models in this course that will also teach you the process a consumer goes through in making a purchase decision. Businesses, companies, and organisations must know these models to improve their marketing strategies, and also to understand the psychology of ideal consumers/ customers.\nAfter attending this course, you will be able to at least understand the following:\nEstablished definitions of consumer behavior\nMain factors that influence consumer's decisions\nDifferent types of decisions that we make being a consumer\nWhat are the different stages that we go through before we buy a product/ service?\nWhat should companies, businesses, and organisations focus on during \"pre-purchase\", \"purchase\", and \"post-purchase\" stages?\nWhy do some people buy products as soon as they are launched, while others buy it at a later time?\nRemember, with a sound understanding of your consumers, the success of your business is guaranteed!",

      "description": "HTML, linking, rédactionnel, Google Panda, Adwords, affiliation, réseaux sociaux, outils d'analyses et de positionnement, etc. ; adaptées aux dernières conventions, cette formation a pour objectif de vous fournit une vue d'ensemble et les connaissances indispensables au référencement et marketing web pour vous permettre d'augmenter votre visibilité sur le web.\nLe développement d'Internet (et de la concurrence qu'il implique) est tel que le référecemment web est devenu un enjeu majeur pour tous sites ou toutes sociétés de e-commerce confrontés à une problématique de rendement : se positionner en tête des réponses proposées par les moteurs de recherche en général et Google en particulier, créer le maximum de trafic sur ses pages et ainsi augmenter de manière significative son activité et sa performance commerciale.\nLe SEM regroupe deux stratégies bien distinctes et toutefois complémentaires. Le SEO (Search engine optimisation), ou référencement naturel consiste à optimiser les pages de son site web, à la fois lors de sa conception (la mise en valeur et la hiérarchisation de l'information par l'utilisation des balises HTML ou encore l'arborescence du site sont, par exemple, primordiales) et au cours de son exploitation selon différents critères parmi lesquels : contenu, accessibilité, maillage externe (netlinking). Le SEA (Search Engine Advertising), quant à lui, renvoie principalement aux Adwords et à la publicité sur les moteurs de recherche ; cette dernière incluant également le reciblage publicitaire comportemental et personnalisé (retargeting), ou encore l'affiliation. Le principe du SEA repose sur un système d'enchère et de mesure de pertinence qui affiche des bannières publicitaires ciblées en fonction des mots-clés que saisi l'internaute.\nSi les réseaux sociaux (Facebook, Twitter, Google +1) s'inscrivent comme un des critères essentiels du référencement naturel au regard du nouvel algorithme de Google (et Google Panda), ils demandent pour les acteurs du web, au même titre que le SEM, de mettre en place des stratégies spécifiques et proposé un contenu adapté afin d'optimiser leur présence \"sociale\" : visibilité, e-réputation, fidélisation, développement commercial.  Celle-ci en rapport avec les codes et usages propre à la communication communautaire.\nAussi, cette formation référencement et marketing web se propose de faire le point sur l'ensemble de ces notions vous permettant d'acquérir les principes et les connaissances indispensables du référencement web adaptés aux dernières évolutions, comme à l'importance grandissante des réseaux sociaux. Qu'est ce que le référencement ? En quoi consiste t-il ? Quels en sont les différents domaines d'application et les stratégies à envisager ? Quelles sont les bonnes pratiques (et les mauvaises !) ? Qu'est ce que le Black SEO et quelles en sont ses limites ? Comment développer le netlinking et quels sont les moyens disponibles ? Comment mettre en place une campagne publicitaire et en tirer profil ? Quels sont les avantages et inconvénients de cette stratégie de référencement ?\nCette formation a pour objectif de vous fournit une vue d'ensemble et des pistes de réflexions sur ce domaine vaste et complexe qu'est le SEM afin que vous puissiez saisir les possibilités que celui-ci peut offrir dans le développement de votre activité. Elle permet ainsi d'identifier la large palette d'opérations d'optimisation de son site à mettre en parallèle avec les règles d'ergonomie et vous donne les clés pour augmenter votre visibilité sur les moteurs de recherche, comme de comprendre les différents leviers du référencement.

There has to be a more thoughtful and professional framework to evaluate your options and make your decision.\nUntil now, there hasn't been any type of decision making tool to help you with these challenging questions.\n\nThat's why we are thrilled to announce our new course designed for e-commerce sellers. A decision making framework that will help you solve the problem of \"where to sell\" and \"should I expand beyond Amazon\".\nAbout the co-instructors: Jason Miles is Udemy's most popular e-commerce instructor and his site (Pixie Faire) ranks in the top 1/10th of 1% of all Shopify sites (based on worldwide site traffic). He also sells on Etsy and got his business started on eBay originally. He's sold millions online. Kyle Hamar is a top 2% Amazon seller in the United States and also sells at high volume on Amazon in Canada and Europe. His brand (Leda Art Supply) is thriving and he brings that expertise to this course.\nCourse Description:\nA simple yet powerful 4-part process for creating your personalized sales channel strategy. At the end of this course you'll have a solid set of decisions made that help you clarify where you should be selling and why you should be selling there.\nYou'll learn about important micro-economic concepts and how to apply them to your business situation. Concepts like the The Stages Of Investment Return, the Production Possibilities Frontier, and evaluating Opportunity Costs.\nYou'll see examples of successful multi-channel selling.\nYou'll see the Production Possibilities Frontier concept applied to a \"real world\" online selling example... expanding from selling on Amazon (U.S.) to also selling on Amazon Europe based on a systematic analysis.\nYou'll also have a solid understand and decisions made related to where you should not be selling - and why.\nYou'll learn the pros and cons of expanding onto several of the top e-commerce marketplaces including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, Walmart, Jet, Mercado Libre, and more.\nAnd much much more!\nWe hope you'll join us and begin planning your sales channel strategy expansion with the precision and expertise you'll learn in this course.",

      "description": "Pricing is the process whereby a business sets the price at which it will sell its products and services, and may be part of the business's marketing plan. As can be noticed there are few important and fundamental aspects of pricing: price bring revenue, price is adjustable, price has an association with brand perception, utility consumer psychology and product differentiation as well, price has an association with quality and quality perception from the side of the consumer as well as the marketer, price influences demand, price is a tool to fight competition, price is associated with accounting markets like break even decided by the marketer, price is associated with financial mark-up like rate o return etc. Price is the exchange of value of goods or services in terms of money., price of a product or service is what the seller feels it is worth, in terms of money.\nManagers can set prices as an addition to what cost they have incurred in developing and marketing the product. In many instances price is the rupee equivalent of the value of the company's product. Pricing decision involves: decide the price objective, determine the demand, estimate the cost, analyse the competitors cost, prices and offers and select the final price.\nPricing is very important to any firm because it is the only one in the marketing mix that guarantee income, revenue and profit rather than creating cost. Failure to understand the dynamics of pricing will create a big problem for any business.\nTop management must have input in pricing, all factors in pricing need to be taken into consideration both internal and external factors, price discrimination and price sensitivity must be taken care off. It is important for companies to use pricing strategies carefully to have competitive edge. Always think about quality before pricing. The position your company have in the market also has a very big impact on your pricing and how you see the response from other competitors, market followers should never price higher than market leaders.",

The product, called copy or sales copy, is written content that aims to increase brand awareness and ultimately persuade a person or group to take a particular action.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCopywriting is a tailor-made career for 2021.\nBusinesses are hiring copywriters like crazy.\nGood copywriters can easily earn six figures.\nMost copywriters today work remotely.\nCopywriters don’t need formal training or education.\nIn this guide, I’m going to teach you, step by step, how to become a copywriter and earn six figures and beyond.\nI’ve been a freelance copywriter since 2013. I went full time in 2016 and earned around $80k. I netted around $130k the following year and $220k in 2018.\nI’m certainly not the best, the fastest, or the smartest. I know copywriters who hit six figures in their first year and were well past $300k by year three.\nBut unlike many people who succeed for one reason or another, I have a very good understanding of WHY I was able to hit my goals and grow my business.\nAs a result, in this guide, you aren’t just going to learn how I become a six figure copywriter. You are going to learn how you can become one as well.\nLet’s get started.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCopywriting is content writing with the direct goal of making a sale.\nCopywriting might be found on:\nWebsite pages\nBrochures\nPaid ads\nLanding pages\nProduct pages\n\n\nWhat exactly is copywriting?\nCopywriting is the art and science of writing copy (words used on web pages, ads, promotional materials, etc.) that sells your product or service and convinces prospective customers to take action. In many ways, it’s like hiring one salesman to reach all of your customers. A sales team contacts customers one at a time; a copywriter reaches all of them at once through billboards, magazine ads, sales letters, blog posts, and more.\n\n\nHow to Strategically Deliver Words that Get People to Take Action?\nCopywriting is one of the most essential elements of effective online marketing.\nCopywriting is the art and science of strategically delivering words (whether written or spoken) that get people to take some form of action.\nCopywriters are some of the highest-paid writers in the world. To become a proficient and profitable copy expert, you’ll need to invest time and energy in studying the craft.\nTo truly excel as a copywriter, consider investing in a copywriting course that will provide you the intensive training you’ll need to enjoy a lucrative career.\n\n\nBut how in the world do you actually become a good copywriter?\n\n\nShould you spend countless hours handwriting famous sales letters?\nShould you read hundreds of books on copywriting?\nShould you go to college and spend $100k on yet another advanced degree?\n\n\nTo become world-class (the top 5%) takes only about a month of focused, intentional work.\nBreaking through those extra four percentile points to become a true master copywriter (the top 1%) will take you years, if not decades, of practice and dedication.\nHowever, unless your entire career is dedicated to copywriting, all that effort is unnecessary. If you can break out of the realm of good copywriting and become great, the extra four percentage points are simply not needed to run a successful business.\nBecoming world-class is completely achievable and can be done faster than you think.\nLet’s begin.\n\n\nIt's TIME for BONUSES !!!\nThis program is the fastest, easiest way to become a highly paid and in-demand Million Dollar Copywriter™ – even if you have no experience, degree, or even if you speak broken English like me.\n\n\nFREE Gift #1: MillionDollarCopy - Business Proposal Template ($2,499 Value) - In Million Dollar Copy, we shared with you strategies and tactics through 7 modules on how to build a million dollar copywriting business.

I feel prepared and optimistic. “\n+\n“I got a project in my dream niche through cold emailing. I am motivated and equipped.”\n+\n“As part of the challenge, I used methods to land a contract with a local authority, worth £12,000. Amazed at my own abilities, but it's down to Tam bringing them out in a structured way!”\n+\n“I landed a client on a $520 monthly retainer for social media copywriting! Now, it's up to $850/month!I feel like freelance writing I'm able to support my family with.”\n\n\nI knew I had to turn this into a course for freelance copywriters!\n\n\nHERE'S HOW IT WORKS\nHere's how to: Find Your Copywriting Super-Niche in 5 Days\nThis short but punchy course is ALL about crisp, sweet implementation (not stale information, you'll forget instantly).\n‘Cos you’ve already bought the courses, taken the quizzes and devoured the entire internet. (I see you!)\nAll you need to do is show up and I’ll walk by your side and show you my exact framework for discovering and test-driving profitable copywriting niches.\nBecause I’m guessing you don’t want to wait five years to niche down like I did!\nHence why I’ve reverse-engineered my 8-year freelance copywriting journey and distilled it into a neatly-packaged, easy-to-repeat system you can absorb in less than one hour.\n\n\nOVER FIVE DAYS, YOU'LL LEARN:\nDiscern what makes you special + why this is crucial to your long-term success\nClarify your service sweet spot for more fun, ease and purpose in your business\nMatch your unique skills to flourishing marketplaces that NEED your copywriting skills\nVerify up to 3 new (or surprising) copywriting super-niches that get you bouncing-out-of-bed excited\nIdentify and take your next best steps towards a thriving copywriting business\nBasically everything I WISH I’d had when I started out as a new freelance copywriter. (Would’ve saved me 3 or 4 years of testing and experimenting).\nYou’ll also get a beautiful WORKBOOK to keep track of your research and progress.\n\n\nWHAT'S A SUPER-NICHE?\nIt’s the magical place where your unique combination of talents and interests meets a viable market.\n\n(Kind of like your personal superpower, but in niche form.)\n\nBecause when you combine your innate strengths and sweet spots with a market that needs your copywriting skills... your work gets easier, your revenue rockets and clients queue around the block to hire you.\n\n\nSOUND GOOD?\nI want you to end the course with a clearer idea of how to identify and try out niches . . . without all the seriousness and pressure I KNOW you're putting on yourself.\nSo if you show up each day and do the work, I’m confident you’ll walk away with more possibilities, more confidence, and more direction than ever before.\nIt's time to say goodbye to overthinking your copywriting niche . . . and walk away with a new mindset, refreshed optimism and, (hopefully) a handful of super-niches to explore.\nLet's do this!",

      "description": "Every business needs a marketing department to help it grow, but what exactly is marketing?\nThe first few things that normally come to mind are marketing = sales!\nMarketing is necessary for any commercial activity since it helps to understand and satisfy clients. Sales are increasing in the other direction!\nMarketing is more than simply personal selling or even advertising; most people define marketing in highly narrow terms!\nBoth marketing and sales attempt to increase income. They are so inextricably linked that many individuals are unaware of the distinction. Indeed, in small organizations, the same employees are usually in charge of both sales and marketing. Marketing differs from sales, and as the company expands, the roles and duties become more defined.\nWhen deciding between marketing and sales, every business owner must evaluate both components of the total sales and marketing cycle. Because marketing and sales must be tightly intertwined, they are often managed by the same department or even by the same people in many firms. For example, to be effective and optimize the odds of generating a sale, sales techniques must integrate the same messaging as marketing communications. Focusing on both the 'pull' and the 'push' successfully can position your firm for success.\nMarketing activities include public relations, sales promotion, advertising, and various additional services that benefit other business operations and increase the Sales of the Company.\nWho Should Attend This Class?\n\n-New small company owner who doesn't know anything about marketing!\n-Social Media Marketers who wish to understand classic marketing techniques!\n-Anyone who wants to study marketing from the ground up!\nWhat will we discover?\nThe first three films will serve as an introduction! What exactly is marketing? What is the distinction between Marketing and Sales? as well as some crucial principles?\nThen we'd know how to understand customers and which elements to prioritize.\nFollowing that, various groups of customers were divided to make the following work easier!\nFinally, create a marketing mix and 4Ps strategy.\nLet's grow our company and increase our revenues! Enroll right away!\nPS: More Business and Marketing classes are available on Skillshare. Happy Studying!",

I started as an engineer. But I always had a hard time understanding marketing and business, so my projects usually failed. To fix that, I took the time to learn different marketing strategies and after that, my projects began succeeding.\nSo I designed this course to give you access to a wide range of marketing strategies that WORK, so you can learn and use them immediately.\nIt’s very hard to find good marketers, and they are usually very expensive to hire, so why not become the best marketer in your team?\n\n\nLEARN DIGITAL MARKETING THROUGH REAL-WORLD APPLICATION\n\n\nNot every digital marketing tactic works instantly. By trying each one, you’ll discover what works best for the specific product or service you’re promoting. When you face unique challenges, you’ll gain hands-on problem-solving experience—reinforcing and deepening everything you learn in this course.\n\n\nI UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLE OF A NEW MARKETER\n\n\nJust like you, I didn't have a formal education in marketing. I had to learn it all on my own, but digital marketing is the great equalizer because there are no gatekeepers keeping you out.\nWhen I realized that, my mindset about digital marketing changed, and my shyness turned into passion because I saw how digital marketing could be the key to all my future success.\n\n\nWith digital marketing, all you need is your brain and your hands to succeed. It levels the playing field, giving you the opportunity to compete and win.\n\n\nAfter adopting the mindset that digital marketing is the great equalizer, and my ticket to success, I dove head-first into digital marketing and never looked back. I've been using it to promote everything I do for the last 15 years with tremendous success, and I never had to look outside myself for help or for answers.\nEverything you need to succeed in digital marketing is in this course and can be in your mind, so you can use it whenever you want!\n\n\nSTART YESTERDAY!\n\n\nMastering digital marketing does have a significant learning curve, and there are many things to learn. I recommend that you start as soon as possible because digital marketing is quite a journey. There is no person for whom every digital marketing strategy works from the first time.\nThere is usually significant trial and error, and much of it takes time to implement and observe results.\nDoes it work, though? Definitely.\nYou just need to start, learn, and work consistently.\nWith urgency and focus, you’ll gain the skills and experience to succeed.\n\n\nSTART WITH ZERO KNOWLEDGE AND MASTER DIGITAL MARKETING STEP BY STEP\n\n\nYou can start this course with zero knowledge, and you don’t need to be tech-savvy to succeed. Each section is under an hour, and packed with actionable strategies designed to deliver incredible results.\nIt’s all broken down step-by-step, so whether you’re a complete beginner or just want to refine your skills, you’ll feel confident applying what you learn.\nThese techniques work for every type of business: local shops, online stores, service-based businesses, personal brands, coaching or consulting, content creators, and even nonprofits. Don’t have a product or service yet? No problem! You’ll gain skills to promote for others or prepare for your own future business.\nStart now, because the sooner you do, the sooner you’ll start seeing results.\nEnroll now & let’s go!\n\n\nMONEY-BACK GUARANTEE\n\n\nThe course comes with an unconditional, Udemy-backed, 30-day money-back guarantee. This is not just a guarantee, it's my personal promise to you that I will go out of my way to help you succeed just like I've done for thousands of my other students.\n\n\nInvest in your future.

Anyone can learn how to post to social, write a blog post, or learn what SEO is, but quantity is not what works. What works are people who actually know WHY and WHEN certain marketing activities work.\nThat's the purpose of this course. By the end, you will have developed an actual marketing strategy, your own personal marketing playbook, that will guide you and your brand into the right marketing activity.\nThink about it - no more guessing or assuming. You will be able to inform others and act personally based on the correct information!\nThree reasons to TAKE THIS COURSE right now!\nYou get lifetime access to lectures, including new lectures every month (content is added/updated constantly).\nYou can ask me questions and see me respond to every single one of them thoughtfully!\nWhat you will learn in this course is original, tested, and very detailed! It comes from years of graduate-level education and 20+ of marketing leadership experience across dozens of industries.\n\n\nThere are plenty of people who can teach you shortcuts and fast tactics.\nThis is a course for people who are truly willing to understand instead. A course for people who would rather do it right than hustle and hassle people. Once you work your way through nearly 200 lessons, your strategy will become more clear, your empathy will deepen and you'll begin to see the market as it is, instead of merely wishing it to be what you want.\n★★★★★  \"This is the best marketing innovation I have seen in years.\" - Ignacio Agacevic\n\nThe Marketing Leadership Masterclass is split into 6 different online sessions, each focusing on a different aspect of marketing leadership.\nIn Session 1 we will focus on Building Your Model.\n\nAs you may know, more and more marketers are constantly under pressure to justify their marketing effectiveness, prove ROI, and create efficiency at scale. Since most marketing today is digital marketing, all the digital tools available make this task easier.\nTo do this well, every brand should have a model for how they track consumers from anonymous visitor all the way to loyal customer and promoter. The goal of building a model is to ensure that you have a way to track and measure every primary step a consumer takes during the buying journey. Without a model you will simply be guessing at which marketing tasks will be the most effective.\nThe benefit of having multiple models of historical numbers is that you are then able to build out future scenarios by which you can more accurately gauge ROI, create efficiency at scale, and identify opportunities for marketing activities on each channel.\nWhat are the requirements?\n\nNo experience or audience required.\nSuitable for all types of businesses (digital product, physical product, service, B2B, B2C).\nWhy take this Course?\n\nBecome a Leader - Learn how to think & act like a strategic marketing leader.\nModern Marketing - The world of marketing is in constant flux.

It's your ability to discover insights into what you are selling and who you are selling to. The best copywriters are the ones who ask the best questions.\nAbout me\nI'm your instructor, Alan Sharpe. I got started as a copywriter in 1989. In the years since then, I've worked as a freelancer and as an in-house copywriter at an ad agency. I have written in all of the channels—offline, online, outdoor, mobile and broadcast. I have written print ads, radio commercials, email sales letters, banner ads, brochures, slogans and plenty more. I got married, bought a house, and raised two kids on my copywriting salary alone. I have been teaching copywriting since 1995. On Udemy, I teach copywriting to over twelve thousand students from one hundred and thirty-eight countries. I am one of the top-rated instructors in the copywriting niche on Udemy.\nWhy take this course\nThis course answers the two biggest questions that beginning copywriters have. Number one, what is copywriting, exactly? And number two, how do I discover what I should write about?\nAt the end of this course, you will know what is expected of you as a copywriter. And you'll know the questions you need to ask before you start any copywriting assignment.\nCourse structure\nThis course is divided into two sections. Section one defines copywriting, describes the major types of copywriting, and discusses specialized types of copywriting. It then introduces you to the two main audiences who will read your copy, and describes the types of writing that some people mistake for copywriting. Section one ends with a handy glossary of common copywriting and marketing terms that you need to know before you offer your services as a copywriter.\nSection two goes into great detail about the seven questions you must ask before you can write great copy. We'll cover what you are selling, where you are selling, who you are selling to, why they should buy, who your competition is, the most important thing to say in your copy, and what you want prospects to do after reading your copy. Section two ends with a lesson on how to research a product or a service so that you can sell it with effective copy.\nThis course is filled with practical, step-by-step advice, tools, tips and tricks that I've learned over the years as a professional copywriter. I use dozens of examples from the real world of copywriting to help you understand what copywriting is, and how to get started on any copywriting assignment.\nIdeal student\nI designed this course for writers who want to write compelling advertising copy, but don't know where to start. If the thought of having to write one thousand words of promotional copy each day before lunch time fills you with dread, then this course is for you.\nEnroll now\nLearn more about the course by reviewing the course description and course outline below.

Conceptos de negocio y tecnología para analizar clientes. Veremos cómo el Data Quality es pieza clave para Big Data.\n2. Herramientas de negocio para diferenciarte de la competencia.\n3. Cómo la arquitectura de fidelización te ayuda a estructurar las recompensas (cupones, cheques y regalos)\n4. Para vincular a los clientes, necesitas un plan, aquí veremos el Plan de Desarrollo de Clientes con sus políticas y tácticas\n5. MEGAGUÍA del Plan para realizar acciones de Upselling y Crosselling y medirlas con dos métricas: venta incremental y ROI\n6. Cuadros de Mando de Clientes o Customer Dashboard (este contenido no lo encontrarás en libros, menos en Google) donde veremos el Blackboard, fichas de clientes, análisis de tiendas, alarmas, etc.\n7. Cuando desde el área de finanzas te pregunten cuándo cuesta fidelizar podrás responder con el caso práctico de valoración de escenarios de fidelización.\n8. Plantilla para saber cuánto cuesta un club de fidelización a 3 años con Payback, costes fijos, variables, ingresos por venta incremental, etc.\nEL CURSO CONTIENE:\n- Videos de más de 5 horas\n- Más de 12 ejercicios y 9 recursos descargables\n- Presentaciones con más de 200 diapositivas\n- Tres plantillas Excel\nNo analizaremos “datos” (entiéndeme), aquí analizaremos a los clientes, sus transacciones, sus visitas, su facturación y muchas cosas más con un solo objetivo … fidelizar y vincularlos.\nQUIEN DA EL CURSO\nHe trabajado en consultoría de estrategia de clientes más de 15 años, he escrito 3 libros y doy clases en universidades de España y Perú. Sé de lo que hablo porque me he “pegado” con muchos proyectos, sectores y alcances.\nEl curso lo doy yo, no un claustro de profesores, ni consultores de transformación digital, ni expertos en SEO, ni tampoco incluye una mochila, ni un grupo de facebook con no sabes quién (aunque no te lo creas, esto lo he sacado de ver otras opciones cuando buscas un curso de marketing relacional ... yo tampoco me lo creía)\nSi tienes dudas del contenido, me preguntas y te respondo\nPOR QUÉ DEBERÍAS COMPRAR ESTE CURSO\nEl mercado demanda perfiles mixtos, personas que sepan de tecnología y de negocio, que analicen, generen conclusiones y recomendaciones usando la información de clientes.\nLa demanda de estos perfiles ha crecido un 70%, sí, ni más, ni menos.\nNo soy un genio al afirmar que, con este curso, tu empleabilidad mejorará.\n¿Y AHORA QUÉ?\nPuedes seguir buscando posts, PDFs, White Papers y todo lo que quieras.\nQue tu tiempo es tuyo y tu dinero es tuyo.\nQue hay gente que busca toda la vida, pobres de ellos… pobres de decisión, pobres de conocimientos.\nESTE CURSO ESTÁ HECHO PARA PERSONAS QUE DESEAN REALMENTE APRENDER ANÁLISIS DE CLIENTES EN UN MUNDO DE CURSOS INÚTILES O PARA PERSONAS INÚTILES.",

You can create a rule, and based on certain criteria that you set, Salesforce can do a number of things, like send an email, create a task, or update a field.\nA sales process maps out the stages an opportunity follows through its sales cycle, affecting what’s available to view in a sales path. Within a specific sales process, you can easily add and remove stages.\nCloud Kicks uses two distinct Sales processes, one for retail sales and one for custom shoe projects. Retail sales follow a different sales cycle than custom projects, and that means they go through different sales stages.\nThe Cloud Kicks team outlined both processes step by step, because they want to track and report on these types of sales separately.\nDistinct sales processes mean distinct data.\nAutomated Workflows\nBy automating your sales process, your reps can skip the busywork and take the right actions at the right time. The really great thing? With Sales Cloud, you can manage workflows and process with point-and-click tools.\nService Cloud + Sales Cloud = Lots of Revenue\nWith the Salesforce Platform, you can stop worrying about losing customers, and start focusing on meeting their needs for the future. And yes, we help with that, too. Salesforce releases new features three times each year, and with the platform, that innovation seamlessly integrates into your CRM. It’s also completely customizable, so you can tailor it to your business processes. And when all that collaboration leads to explosive growth, Salesforce grows right along with you.",

When the road map is unclear, the companies falter. Pundits believe that it is the implementation stage where the companies lose the battle, which is true, but what is of utmost importance is to have a sound goal of where the company wants to reach. This course takes you through a culinary journey of devising a robust Marketing Strategy using a \"SAMOSA\" approach. It covers fundamentals that you would need to effectively segment, target and position your offering to achieve success. In order to capture the attention of the buyers in this noisy environment, an effective SAMOSA approach is a must to have. A clearly defined SAMOSA approach will help you understand and fulfill the needs of your target market, constantly engage and build long term relationships with them! For folks who do not know what a Samosa is - it is a cone shaped, Indian tea-time, street-side snack and is popular all across the country. Just like a deep-fried Samosa, the more you're immersed in the heat of your market needs, the more 'golden' you shall get! SAMOSA is the abbreviation of Strategically Analyze your Market with three different elements: \"Objective, Scope and Advantage\" (Objective, Scope, Advantage is a concept that was created by two authors Collins and Rukstad from Harvard Business School) - remixed in this course to give a creative touch.

Quickly and easily.\nOver 2,000 students have already learned what took me almost a decade to develop.\nHave you heard of my \"Branding, Public Relations and Social Media Secrets?\"\nI've been working with international brands for almost a decade. And this course highlights what REALLY works.\nIt has taken me years to find out what really works... and now these tactics are revealed here for the first time.\n\nI make over $7,000 a month with private clients teaching them these very tactics - but you can gain my secrets for a fraction of the price.\n\nWhen I first started my career in marketing, I was making a measly $30,000 a year. As a former Marketing Director, I made triple that -- and even more once I started freelancing. This is because I know what REALLY works when it comes to branding, public relations, and social media. And you can too.\nI know what works. My CV and current consulting practice proves it. Check out some of the free lectures below as a sample.\nEvery single tactic I reveal in this course is easy enough to implement in minutes - and you can see your brand change instantly.\nNothing is kept secret - I'm revealing everything I know... and as I work with my clients, I'll unveil even more up to date tactics. And you pay NOTHING EXTRA for this ongoing content.\nPlus, Udemy has a 30 day guarantee. And you have my personal guarantee that in 2 hours, you'll be amazed at how much you'll learn... and you'll be kicking yourself if you already have a brand but haven't mastered branding, public relations, and social media.\n\nWhat this is course IS NOT:\n\nI do not cover anything you can freely find anywhere else online. I present to you real tactics I've used for major, international brands that I've worked with for close to a decade.\n\nI will not \"look at your brand\" and \"tell you what's wrong\". Every brand is different - and it would be reckless to advise you through a course. But I will help you build a rock solid foundation that EVERY brand I've worked with needed when I began working with them. This is something you need.\n\nI won't teach you any underhanded tricks, black hat marketing techniques, or how to write clickbait - I value my skills and I want to value your brand by giving it REAL potential to be amazing.\n\nBut, if you want my real \"insider\" information - remember that I went from a lowly $30k a month salary to over triple that amount when I worked with agencies (I now make well over 5x that as a consultant) - so you need to get this course now... right this minute.\nEvery minute you delay, you're actually LOSING money...\n\nEnroll now!",

However, the harsh reality is that more than 95% of all new consumer products that are launched FAIL. In fact, most of these are discontinued by their brands before the end of 2 years from launch, after accumulating huge losses for their parent company\nNew products developed without doing the due diligence from both (1) consumer and (2) business perspectives are well on their way to the 'failed-launches graveyard', taking reputations of many marketers along with them\nIn this course you will learn the most contemporary new process development system used by successful brands. It gives a unique consumer and business understanding, that professional brand managers have developed with reference to new products\nThis course adds the practicality of business and market perspectives to the theoretical knowledge of marketing text books. It will help establish a bridge between what you can learn in textbooks and what is actually followed and expected at corporate.\nIt has been created by a professional brand manager, who has worked in multiple MNCs across the globe. It will help budding marketers,  entrepreneurs and students alike who wish to master successful New Product Development.",

You must learn that certain effects lead to certain reactions, and use that knowledge to increase results and avoid mistakes.\n\n\nThere are many psychologically-based observations about consumer behaviour that are commonly used in marketing. Some people know them by instinct, others learn them by experience.\n\n\nThis course will help you get a firm grasp of them and teach you how to use them to your advantage.\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to:\n• Identify patterns in consumer behaviour.\n• Understand how they affect purchase decisions.\n• And adjust your marketing strategy accordingly, to get the best results and avoid mistakes.\n\n\nThe psychological principle you will learn can be applied to your:\n• Content\n• Pricing\n• And sales strategy.\n\n\nHuman nature is perpetual. In most respects it is the same today as in the time of Caesar. So the principles of psychology are fixed and enduring. You will never need to unlearn what you learn about them. The more you understand consumer psychology the more creative and effective strategies they will be able to develop.\n\n\nIn this course we will learn the best methods to increase sales. These things are very important. An identical offer made in a different way may bring multiplied returns.\n\n\nMarketing psychology isn’t just a nice thing to know, it is essential, if you want to develop effective and highly profitable marketing strategies.\n\n\nEnrol now to get started!",

We love our events! They can encompass anything from festivals and conferences to food and craft fairs to parties and celebrations. Events are also a tried and tested method for businesses and organisations to market themselves and generate sales.\nHere's the tricky bit:\nEvents, like many things in life, seem in essence quite simple things but are in fact, a little more difficult to actually deliver. Creating memorable and crucially rewarding events when visitor expectations are so high - is no easy task. Designing, planning and producing events is a bit like directing a live stage show. Unlike a show though: there is usually no dress rehearsal or full run through and once started - no second chances.\nBut the truth is:\nMy experiences have shown me that you can all be great event managers, with a little of the right kind of help and a ‘can do’ attitude.\nSo on my on line event management course – 'How to organise successful events' I am going to teach you everything I know about the ‘how to’ of organising great events and so give you the skills and confidence to run events…in just a few hours.   Course Outcomes: you will learn how to:\ndesign events your customers or visitors actually want using objective setting to guide your events planning\ncreate and design an event that excites\neffectively project plan and budget your events\nselect, contract and work with great contractors and suppliers\nsearch, evaluate, select and site plan your perfect venue\n\n\ndesign a great event programme that delivers excitement and change\n\n\nincrease your event sign up rates by creating effective event promotional plans using on and off line media\n\n\nconstruct accurate operational plans to help you set up and run your events\n\n\ndeliver safe, well run and risk assessed events\n\n\nlead, motivate and brief your event day teams\nobtain feedback and evaluate the effect of your event\n\n\nHave an overview of the process of planning an online event\n\n\nAnd of cause know that YOU can design and deliver successful and rewarding events: packed full of great takeaway memories.\n\n\nThe course\nThe Event Expert ‘How to organise successful events’ is a high content course designed to give you a good understanding of how to run successful events.

NB: It’s the same one I use to run my own events. I have been      designing, planning and delivering events for the past 20+ years.\nI know events are no soft option. However with the right kind of help and a positive attitude, I believe we can all be great event managers. This course will certainly set you up nicely to enter the wonderful world of events planning!\nThe truth is: I  Knew nothing about events when I was asked to run my first event.  I learnt quickly and happily survived. I think you will too.\nWho is this 'How to organise successful events' course for?\nThis on line event management course is specifically for:\nNew event managers who have no or little actual events experience or formal training.\nAnyone who has been given an event to organise or been asked to help plan and deliver an event.\nAnyone who has already tried events before but found they have not quite delivered.\nAnyone who wants to know how to run a successful event\nAnyone who is seriously considering a career in events\nAnyone who is already involved in events but wants to take the next step up to become the event manager\nSo, if you are an employee or are doing this voluntarily for a charity, community group, club, association, school, college or interest group this course will give you a full understanding of the ‘how to’ of successful event planning.\n\nIt is suitable for all types of public and business events.\nPlease note: This course is for those serious about developing their event planning skills. It is a very comprehensive: concept to completion and every step in between 'how to' course based on my 20+ events of practical events management experience. It is for those who genuinely think events could be their thing: either professionally or as a volunteer event manager running events for your favourite course or charity.\n\nIt is not suitable for experienced professional event planners but, would be a very helpful reminder of the fundamentals of successful event planning or for those who have had no formal event management training.\n\n\nCourse duration\nI would recommend you set aside about 8-10 hours to review the presentations, watch the videos, read the accompanying blogs and reference manual and complete the quizzes and exercises.\nOr if time is precious: you could try and set aside an hour at a time and complete a module a day?

In that time he has been a local authority events manager and events director of a range of events and festivals, as well as helping a variety of organisations to deliver their events – as a freelance events manager and consultant.\nFor the past 20 years he has also been helping clients from the world of business, exhibitions, education, sport, the public and charity sector, training, tourism, creative agencies and festivals develop the ideas, skills and confidence to go it alone: run their own events.

His clients include some very well-known names. He’s an in demand event specialist.\nHe is a regular blogger on all things events, a speaker and author of three event planning books. Work with or listen to Chris and you will get clear, logical and easy to follow advice based on his 20+ years of practical events management experience. He does indeed practice what he preaches.\nHe is not somebody who once ran an event or never ran an event and thinks they can now write a authoritative course on planning an event.  He has successfully completed over 500 events and taught over 6000+ events managers: it’s safe to say that there is not much Chris doesn’t know about the ‘how to’ of successful events. His client list is testimony to that.\n\n\nHere are some recent testimonials for this on line course\nThis is exactly what I need!! It was full of details and practical steps. This course is broken down in an order that makes sense and is doable for any type of event.\nIt contains valuable information, clear explanations, helpful practice activities and delivered by an engaging and very knowledgeable instructor\nAmanda\n\n\nDetailed, lots of advice from the real world, tons of information. Can't wait to put it into practice. Thanks for your time and energy to put this together.\nAndre\n\n\nI am so glad I came across this course! Great explanations Chris made it very clear by the way he organised the lessons. Thank you, this helped a lot!\nAnna\n\n\nI have really enjoyed this course! Filled with useful information, detailed, and extremely helpful.\nAnnaline,\n\n\nI've been organising events for a few years now, but I haven't come across any course which was more applicable to my everyday work than this. I loved that it systematically goes through every stage of the event management process with a really practical approach. Whether you are an experienced event manager or just starting it's a perfect choice. I can definitely recommend it.\nMilan\nAn extremely helpful events course.\nI found the course extremely helpful. I have learnt things I never knew before. The workbook provided during the course is great for taking notes and the reference manual is full of so much useful information about everything you need to know. I have kept a copy of both for myself to refer back to when I need a bit of guidance. I really liked the fun test at the end of the course to the quiz after module 8. I fully enjoyed the blog posts, I especially liked reading about Chris's own personal experiences. I particularly liked the blog titled ' is finding the perfect venue really such a big deal'. I believe reading about his personal experiences as an event manager really helps understand all aspects in organising an event. I will recommend the course to anyone who is truly interested in the events industry.\nGemma Rolfe\nJam packed full of information that is really useful, relevant and reliable\n“WOW! What a comprehensive course, I found it jam packed full of information that was really useful, relevant and reliable. The course literally covers everything a new event manager could possibly need to know in a simple and easy-to-understand manner with the course elements covered in a logical and common sense order which helps it flow easily. I like the way the way you have used a combination of narrated presentations, PDF’s and fun aspects like the quiz / survey at the end, this makes it varied and interesting to read. With so much information to take in, the individual slides are simple, easy to digest and absorb. The ‘visual’ of where you are in the course in the left hand side column is helpful and useful to keep track with. If you are thinking of or new to events, this course is a must do!”\nLouisa Brown\n\n\nHere are words that have been used to describe me taken from recent in-house course evaluation and testimonials are:\nCreative, personable, expert, very keen attention to detail, enthusiast, inspiring, passionate, engaging, funny, relaxed, captivating, incredibly knowledgeable, meticulous, real can do approach, really really…knows events, practical, excellent communicator, approachable, has a wealth of event experience!\n\n\nCourse completion certificate?\nWhen you complete 100% of the course, you will be emailed a certificate of completion by Udemy so you can show it as proof of your expertise and that you have completed a certain number of hours of instruction in the course topic.\nYour 100% No-risk Money back guarantee\nThe course comes with a Udemy-backed, 30-day money-back guarantee. This is not just a guarantee, it's my personal promise to you that I will go out of my way to help you succeed. I really do believe that you will find the course incredibly helpful as you seek to learn the event planning ropes but should you not: You can have your money back. No questions asked.\n\n\nInterested? Want to learn to be a great be an events manager? Then don’t delay sign up now…it could be the start of something very special\n\n\nPS: Imagine having the confidence to run your own events? To lead or be part of an event planning team organising charity, arts and sports events: exhibitions, shows and fares, parties and celebrations and know you did yourself…with a little help from someone who started…just where you did – knowing nothing about events!\nGo on: give it a go: events really could be your thing!\n\n\nThank you!",

      "description": "HOW TO CREATE A POWERFUL CAPABILITY STATEMENT.. so you can win government contracts is a course teaching you how to create the ideal marketing collateral for the government market.\nAfter years of working as a consultant in the government industry, I was deeply disturbed by the challenges which small business have. I saw the disparities that limited small businesses from success. According to the SBA, small businesses represent 99.7% of American companies, yet they are only winning 20% of federal dollars. Women owned small businesses represent 41% of companies, yet are only winning 4.3% of contracts. Minorities represent 35% of the population, yet are only winning 5.6% of contracts.\nAs such, I left the consulting world and decided to start the Government Contractors Association. I wanted to do something to help impact the disparities and challenges which existed in the most lucrative industry. This course is one of the many training tools and resources which I have created to help change the disparities and the \"economic injustice\" which exists in the government market.\nIn this course, you'll learn that the government does not use brochures or flyers. They use capability statements. If you want to have the best chance of winning contracts, then you'll need to have a literature that speaks to your audience.\nThis course guides you step-by-step on how to create a capability statement. It explains why you need one, what are the components and how to use it.\nIn this course you'll also receive guidance on how to find an agency so you can market your capability statement to. You'll learn 7 important keys to unlock more contract opportunities. You'll also receive templates and samples so you don't have to start from scratch. Just use the templates and edit them so you can finalize your capability statement quickly.\nThis is your opportunity to grow your company in the $500 billion government market. Use this course to help you to create your marketing capability statement for the largest customer in the world.",

      "description": "Are you an independent coach or consultant?\nAre you currently selling your time by the hour?\nOr, in packages based on term, such as a 3-month package or a 6-month package?\nDid you know that's not the best way to sell your services?\nIn fact, did you know that actually makes it harder to sell, and it encourages prospective clients to negotiate based on what they think they need or can afford?\n__________________________________________________________________________\nI followed Debbie's 5 step process for a new proposal which was accepted promptly, without question or negotiation.\nFor the past 12 years, as a business and marketing mentor, setting the correct price for my clients for the services they offered has always been an issue, even setting my own pricing has been a problem. I was able to give my clients the formula for establishing their hourly rate but including the 'adding value' element was missing. Debbie's course 'How to Design a Signature Program' was exactly what I needed to solve this problem. Further, I tested this myself, after finishing the course. I followed Debbie's 5 step process for a new proposal which was accepted promptly, without question or negotiation. I highly recommend Debbie's easy step-by-step model for pricing, which in my opinion, can be applied to anyone offering a service and not only for coaches, consultants and mentors. ~ Fran Piggott CEO, Marketing Guru, South Africa\n__________________________________________________________________________\nLike you, when I started my own business as an independent marketing consultant back in 1998, I too sold my time by the hour, or by the month.\nThen I remembered that when I worked in the advertising agencies we sold by the project. We presented prospects with a specific scope of work and the results we would deliver, and we quoted them a project fee or a monthly retainer to cover that scope of work.\n\n\nThat's when I realized I needed to sell my services the same way.\nI didn't want my clients buying my time. After all, who's to say what your time is worth. It's rather arbitrary. And high hourly fees can actually turn prospects away if they don't think you're worth it.\n\n\nIt's much better to sell results.\nThat way clients are buying what they want. They're paying for you to solve their problems.\nYou decide how long it takes to get that outcome and you charge them based on what that outcome is worth.\nIt has nothing to do with what your time is worth.\n\n\nWhen you learn to package your services it changes your entire business.\n\n\nIt helps you attract more of the right clients—the clients who are searching for exactly the outcome you deliver.\nIt eliminates clients negotiating down the price or the term because you can easily tell them, this is what it takes to get the results you want.\nIt enables you to charge for the value you're delivering, which is usually more than what you or a client might determine your time is worth.\nIt enables you to sell more confidently because it eliminates any doubt that you're “worth it.\" It's not about you. It's about the outcome your clients want and will get when they work with you.\n\n\nSo, if you're an existing coach or consultant who is still selling your time, or you're a brand new coach or consultant who is trying to figure out how to package your services and what to charge, this course is for you.\n\n\nThis course is ideal for independent coaches or consultants who...\nAre currently selling their time by the hour, or term (e.g. 3 month package)\nAre new in business and aren't sure how to package their services\nWould like to make it easier to sell their services\nAre tired of prospective clients negotiating down price or term\nAren't comfortable selling because they don't know what their time is worth\nAren't getting enough of the right clients\nAre creating time-consuming spec proposals for every single prospect\nAre having to re-invent the wheel with each new client\nWould love to be able to promise specific outcomes to their clients\nWould like to create more efficiency in their business\nAre interested in creating leveraged programs (e.g. online courses, books) in the future\nWould like to know how many clients they need to make the money they desire\nWant to be sure they can reach their income goals without working more hours than they want\nWould like reliable, predictable cash flow (instead of being on a cash flow roller coaster!)\nWant to be sure their business is viable, profitable, and enjoyable\n\n\nDon't waste another day trying to sell your time.\nThis course will take you step-by-step through the exact same process I used successfully myself, and with my private consulting clients, for years.\n\n\nThis course includes:\nInstructional Video Lessons for each step of the process\nFill-in-the-blank Worksheets so you can create a profitable Signature Program\nExamples for all exercises for your review and reference\nStep-by-Step Instructions so you can easily apply what you're learning to your business\n\n\nDesign a Signature Program...\nYou can become known for\nThat will set you apart from the competition\nYou can sell confidently\nYou know will deliver the results your ideal clients want\nThat will make your business profitable, enjoyable, and successful\n\n\n****************************************************************************\nIf you're already enrolled in my course, How to Market Yourself as a Coach or Consultant...\n... and you're wondering if you should enroll in this course, here are a few things to think about:\n1) This course features separate video lessons for EACH of the 5 steps in both my Signature Program and Financial Viability processes. If you've struggled with these processes and you want more in-depth instruction and explanation, this course provides that.\n2) If you prefer focusing your learning on bite-sized topics, this course does just that. This is one of the most important topics I teach because it's what enables you to get out there and offer your services in the way your ideal clients are most likely to buy.\n3) If you haven't yet gotten to the Signature Program and Financial Viability sections, this course may help you get these important steps done so you can get out there and start selling your services, while you're still learning and applying the rest of the marketing steps.\n4) If you've completed my How to Market Yourself course and you're still struggling to package, market and sell your services, this course may just provide the additional know-how, inspiration, and motivation you need to get on track.",

I created frameworks for you to use that increase your competency during a coaching session. You learn about the first FEARLESS session called the discovery session and receive a priceless business assessment. By the time you finish these sections, you will understand at a deeper level exactly what people struggle with and how this specifically stops them from achieving Marketing Psychology success.

      "description": "Mastering KPI & Measurement: The Science of Business Success\nEvery successful business and marketing strategy is built on one fundamental truth: what gets measured, gets improved.\nYet, too many businesses and marketers operate on guesswork—hoping for results instead of strategically driving them. They launch campaigns, invest in advertising, expand operations, and chase revenue without a clear roadmap to track their success. But true professionals know that without data-driven decisions, business growth is just an illusion.\nAsk yourself:\nWithout clear objectives, how do you know where you're going?\nWithout specific KPIs, how do you track progress?\nWithout measurement, how do you ensure success?\nWithout tracking your business and marketing efforts, how do you adjust, optimize, and grow?\nWithout KPIs, you're flying blind—unable to see what's working, what’s failing, and what needs to be improved. The difference between struggling businesses and market leaders lies in their ability to define, measure, and refine their performance based on real numbers, not just assumptions.\nIs This Course for You?\nIn our first lesson, I’ll challenge you with critical questions about your business and marketing strategies. If you can answer them all confidently—knowing exactly how your business is performing, which campaigns are successful, and where you need to improve—then congratulations! You’re already a top-tier brand manager, marketing strategist, or business leader. In that case, this course may not be for you.\nBut if you hesitate, even for a moment, then this course will be transformational for you.\n\n\nYou will learn how to:\nSet clear, actionable KPIs that align with your business goals\nMeasure what truly drives success (instead of vanity metrics that don’t matter)\nUse data to optimize your strategies and maximize growth\nEliminate guesswork and start making informed, strategic decisions\nBuild a scalable business model based on measurable results\nNo more random experiments. No more wasted resources. No more hoping for success.\nThis course will give you the tools, insights, and frameworks to take control of your business growth. By the end, you’ll be able to think like a professional strategist, set KPIs that drive real performance, and unlock the full potential of your business.\nAre You Ready?\nIf you’re serious about growth and want to master KPI setting like a true professional, then this is your moment. Let’s take your business and marketing skills to the next level.\n\n\nLet’s begin!",

      "description": "--\n●【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ3】について\n\n\n【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ3】では、ECMJ式のEC管理リテラシーを学んでいきます。\n\n\nEC管理リテラシーは、EC事業を着実に成長させるための「土台」の力です。とくに既存事業と並行してEC事業を成長させる企業は、社内でのEC事業の優先順位が低くなりがちです。立ち上げたけれども運用されていない「ゾンビネットショップ」にならないためにも、よりEC管理リテラシーが重要になります。\n\n\nECサイトに改善施策を加えていくための根拠となる「内部・外部情報管理」。着実な施策を積み上げ、状況を可視化し、目標とのギャップを埋めるための「ECスケジュール管理」。そしてデータから具体的な実践策を議論し「いつまでに誰が何をやるか」を決める「ECマーケティング定例会議」。主にこの3つがポイントになります。\n\n\nイーコマース運営が「詰まる」本質的な課題に触れながらEC管理リテラシーを高めていきましょう！\n\n\n--\n◇主な講座の内容◇\n\n\n◆セクション2◆ECMJ式ECリテラシー講座とは\n\n\nEC事業を成長させるためになぜECリテラシーが必要になるのか、必要なECリテラシーの全体図と共に解説していきます。【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ】全般に収録されている内容ですので、場合によってはスキップして問題ありません！\n\n\n◆セクション2◆ECMJ式EC管理リテラシーとは\n\n\n講座のテーマである「EC管理リテラシー」について解説をします。EC管理リテラシーとはEC事業に取り組むにあたってベースになる力です。ECに限った内容ではなく、事業を適切に進めるための「仕事力」と言っても過言ではありません！\n講座で紹介するEC管理リテラシーは「内部・外部情報管理」「ECスケジュール管理」「ECマーケティング定例会議」の3つです。この3つのリテラシーがどのようにEC運営につながっているのかをご紹介します！\n\n\n◆セクション3◆内部・外部情報管理とは\n\n\nEC運営の過程では様々な情報を得ることができます。多くのECサイトでは、社内・社外から取得できる情報が右から左に流れてしまっており、活用しないまま情報が消えてしまっています。これは非常にもったいないことです！\nEC運営から得られる情報、社内の他部署に散らばっている情報、外部（市場・競合）のトレンド情報は次の改善施策を検討するための「お宝」です。内部・外部の情報を上手に活用して「お客様のニーズの在りか」を探しましょう！\n\n\n◆セクション4◆ECスケジュール管理とは\n\n\n多くの会社さんはEC事業を既存の事業と並行して展開しているのではないでしょうか。陥りやすいのが、既存事業にリソースが取られるために、ECへの取り組みが曖昧になってしまう問題です。解決策として、ECの運営スケジュールをきちんと立てることをおすすめします！\nこのセクションではECMJ独自のワークシートを活用して、EC事業の目標値と施策の成果から「EC運営のスケジュール」をつくる具体的な方法をお伝えします！\n\n\n◆セクション5◆ECマーケティング定例会議\n\n\n既存事業と並行してEC事業に取り組む会社さんにスケジュール管理とともにおすすめしたいのが、ECのマーケティング定例会議の設定です。ECの会議を定例化することによって、EC事業を「必ず進捗させる」習慣を組織につくることができます。定例会議をマイルストーンとして、EC事業を進めるルーチンをつくるのです！\nECマーケティング定例会議でおこなうことは、「データと改善施策の因果関係を探す」「内部・外部情報からお客様のニーズの仮説を立てる」「スケジュールに落とし込む」です。最重要のポイントになる「いつまでに誰が何をやるか」の管理の方法まで解説していきます！\n\n\n--\n●ECマーケティングリテラシー講座シリーズとは\n\n\nEコマース運営業務として「What（何を）」をおこなうか、はご存じの方が多いと思います。また、書籍やセミナーなどで具体的な成功事例の「How（どう）」を学ぶ機会も多いと思います。しかし成功事例の「How（どう）」は容易に真似できるものではありません。仮に真似できたとしても「次に何をおこなうか」の「How（どう）」は想像できないはずです。\n\n\nECマーケティングリテラシー講座は「How（どう）」の根拠となる「Why（なぜ）」を身につける講座です。「Why（なぜ）」を学ぶことによって「How（どう）」を無限に生み出す力をつけることができます！\n\n\n目指せECの内製化！「ECの内製化」とは「業務の内製化」ではなく「判断の内製化」なのです！\nこのコースはECを自社サイトで運営する人・チームもしくはショッピングモールで運営する人・チーム、販売する商材ジャンル・カテゴリに関わらない「原理原則」的な内容です。\n\n\n--",

I had no clients, I had no samples, and I had not written a single word of promotional copy, ever, for anyone. And yet within a few weeks of starting out, I was earning money as a freelance copywriter.\nThat was twenty-six years ago. Today, getting started is even easier. And even harder.\nI've worked as a freelance copywriter and as a staff copywriter at ad agencies. I have written in all of the channels: offline, online, outdoor, mobile and broadcast.\nI have written print ads, radio commercials, email newsletters, sales letters, banner ads, product packaging, brochures, factsheets, case studies, slogans and plenty more for Apple, IBM, Bell, Re/Max, Hilton Hotels and hundreds of other clients worldwide. I've written copy for some of the top agencies in the world, including Blitz, Cossette, J. Walter Thompson and Leo Burnett.\nI got married, bought a house, and raised two kids on my freelance copywriting salary alone.\nIn case you're wondering, I've been teaching copywriting since 1995. On Udemy, I teach copywriting to over thirteen thousand students from one hundred and forty countries. I am one of the top-rated instructors in the copywriting niche on Udemy.\nWhat you'll learn\nWelcome to Freelance Copywriter in a Week. This course teaches you how to start a freelance copywriting business in a week. I teach you the steps I took to get started. And I teach you the lessons I learned along the way as I freelanced for businesses, agencies and non-profit organizations in North America and around the world. At the end of this course, you’ll know how to launch your freelance copywriting business in seven days.\nLearn seven proven steps to get started as a freelance copywriter\nThis course is divided into seven sections, each one corresponding to a day of the week.\nOn day one, you create your portfolio. I tell you why you need a portfolio, what you need in your portfolio, and how to create an effective portfolio from scratch.\nOn day two, you brand yourself. I teach you how to brand yourself with a company name, a website, and branded email.\nOn day three, you pick your perfect client.

Finding a ￼solution seems impossible.\n￼Maybe, like us, you’ve:\n￼￼￼￼￼￼Tried multiple paid sources like FB ads which ended up in frustration, debt and nothing to show for your efforts￼\nTried dozens of free traffic sources ￼￼which only resulted in a massive waste of time and energy￼\nBought course after course on traffic ￼which led to ￼more wasted money and frustration\n￼It’sreally no wonder that most people who try to ￼drive traffic  to sell products, build a list and make affiliate commissions simply give up.\nBut the truth is…\nFinally Being Able To Send Floods Of Buying Traffic To Your Offers Is MUCH Closer Than You Think!\nWe’ve been down the same road and these days, things have gotten much better…\nWe’re finally able to drive high quality, converting traffic anywhere we choose at will, and we can also sell more products for profit. We’re even lucky enough to say we can now build our lists faster than ever, risk free.\nBut we’ve NEVER forgotten the frustration before seeing any improvement.\nHaving Tried It ALL, We Were Beaten Down and Ready To Throw In The Towel…\nRoadblocks were a constant reality.\nWhat stopped us DEAD IN OUR TRACKS was that we were afraid to keep WASTING TIME & MONEY trying traffic sources that just don’t work.\nWe just didn’t know, back then, that there are UNTAPPED traffic sources that give AMAZING results. We were afraid of not getting ANY returns from our traffic driving efforts.\nOf course, we’re sure you know EXACTLY what we mean.\n﻿You couldn’t blame us for wanting to give up when this sounds so familiar to you:\nYou’ve tried multiple paid sources which just resulted in frustration, debt and nothing to show for your efforts\nYou’ve tried dozens of free traffic sources which led to a massive waste of time and energy. You’ve bought course after course on traffic which all ended up in more wasted money and frustration…\nThey say the definition of insanity is expecting the same action to produce different results. Well, being fairly sane, we were fresh out of ideas. And nothing worked.\nBut before we pulled the plug entirely…\nSomething happened that changed everything!\n﻿We were steps away from giving up when we were networking with some TRAFFIC GIANTS and learned they were using completely UNDERUTILIZED and EVERGREEEN sources to drive traffic…\nAnd once WE tapped into these secret sources, we couldn’t believe our success. After making SO MANY MISTAKES, we couldn’t believe we’d stumbled upon the answer.\nHowever, knowing we weren’t the only ones suffering from this traffic problem, we had to share our formula for success.\nAfter all, we’re nothing special. We didn’t deserve this success anymore than anyone else. We just had a stroke of luck that came our way.\nWhich is WHY we’re so glad YOU’VE stumbled your own way to this course. We can’t wait to introduce you to Simple Website Traffic Generation Strategies...\nHere's a quick recap of everything you'll receive when you secure your training right now:\nA COMPLETE package of 13 different traffic sources, free & paid, that are largely untapped and bring fantastic results.\nStep by step over the shoulder video training.\n3 of our personal BEST traffic sources included.\nCreated by marketers that use these methods every day.\nProven results.\nDrive engaged visitors in any niche.\nUntapped and undervalued\ntraffic sources that deliver.\nNew website traffic generation sources being added each month as we uncover them.\nWhat Makes This Course Unique?\nWe’ve got your back. You’ll have a dedicated team of three instructors ready to answer any question you have, or describe something in more detail for you.\nAs with our other courses, this one will be updated over time with fresh content. All updates for life are included.\nThe extensive content is broken into easily digestible bits you can rapidly absorb. Engaging exercises along the way help you master the methods so you can see results fast.\nYou’ll come out with\nspecific strategies AND SKILLS\nto drive consistent, lucrative traffic to any of your websites and online properties.\nThank you!\n-The IM Rebels\nMark Tandan, Brian Gray and Shane Farrell",

Do you want to understand what really drives your customers, colleagues, and partners to say \"yes\"?\nWelcome to the next frontier of business strategy. Traditional approaches rely on what people say. Consumer Psychology and Neuromarketing give you access to what they truly think and feel.\n\n\nUnlock the Science of Decision-Making and Become a More Influential Professional.\nThis certificate program, developed by the MTF Institute, is a comprehensive and practical guide to the subconscious drivers of human choice. Grounded in real neuroscience and behavioral economics, this course moves beyond guesswork and provides you with a scientific toolkit to understand, predict, and ethically guide decisions in business and beyond.\nGo Beyond Guesses: Stop relying on opinions and surveys. Start using proven scientific frameworks that reveal the true motivations behind consumer behavior.\nBecome Radically More Persuasive: Master the core principles of influence that apply to marketing campaigns, sales negotiations, leadership, and even your personal brand.\nMake Smarter Strategic Decisions: Understand your own cognitive biases and those of your team to improve your critical thinking and strategic planning.\nEarn a Prestigious Certificate: Add a powerful, academically rigorous credential in Neuromarketing & Consumer Psychology from a global institute to your professional profile.\n\n\nWhy Do People Say One Thing, But Do Another?\nFamous case studies, like Cheetos' advertising, have proven that what consumers report in focus groups is often the opposite of what their brain activity reveals.

We will equip you to communicate directly with the \"decision-making brain.\"\n\n\nIn This Course, You Will Master:\nThe Foundations of Irrationality: Discover why the human brain uses mental shortcuts (heuristics) and how these shortcuts lead to predictable patterns of behavior.\nThe Core Cognitive Biases: Dive deep into the most powerful biases used by leading companies like Netflix and Amazon. You will master practical applications of Anchoring, Priming, the Completion Effect, and more.\nSensory and Emotional Triggers: Learn how subtle cues like colors, words, and even the warmth of a drink can dramatically influence trust, perception, and loyalty.\nThe Science of Persuasion: Go beyond basic sales tricks and learn how neuroscience explains trust-building through techniques like mimicry, social proof, and neural synchronization.\n\n\nThis program is taught by industry experts and backed by the academic rigor of the MTF Institute, an official partner of IBM and Microsoft. You will gain not just theory, but a complete toolkit to confidently apply these strategies in your career.\nThis certificate program is more than just a course on marketing - it is your new toolkit for understanding the human mind.\nEnroll now to start making smarter, more influential, and scientifically-backed decisions today!\n\n\nCourse provided by MTF Institute of Management, Technology and Finance\nMTF is the global educational and research institute with HQ at Lisbon, Portugal, focused on business & professional hybrid (on-campus and online) education at areas: Business & Administration, Science & Technology, Banking & Finance.\nMTF R&D center focused on research activities at areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, WEB3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets, Metaverses, Digital Transformation, Fintech, Electronic Commerce, Internet of Things.\nMTF is the official partner of: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, member of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nMTF is present in 217 countries and has been chosen by more than 900 000 students.",

Although product pricing is a difficult task, there are ways to identify the right pricing strategy that fits your business.\nAn ecommerce pricing strategy is a well thought-out plan that helps determine how you accurately price products to increase sales and profits while staying competitive. Different ecommerce pricing strategies are used depending on the type of products sold, product demand, and competition.\nToday we follow our favorite brands on Instagram, set eyes on a product and locate where it’s sold in seconds.\nAnd we have too many options. Options that sell identical products at different prices.\nPricing fails when it’s taken as a dull task within an e-commerce company. When taken seriously and handled in smart ways, it turns into a secret and very effective marketing tool.\nMany times, an ecommerce pricing strategy is based on the target audience, what your ideal customers are willing to pay, and where they currently shop for similar products. The right pricing model will come down to what shoppers are willing to pay for your product based on several factors, such as brand reputation, demand, and competition.",

      "description": "According to Philip Kotler, “Marketing management is the analysis, planning, implementation and control of programs designed to bring about desired exchanges with target markets for the purpose of achieving organizational objectives.\nIt relies heavily on designing the organizations offering in terms of the target market's needs and desires and using effective pricing, communication, and distribution to inform, motivate and service the market.” Marketing management is concerned with the chalking out of a definite program, after careful analysis and forecasting of the market situations and the ultimate execution of these plans to achieve the objectives of the organization.\nFurther, their sales plan to a greater extent rest upon the requirements and motives of the consumers in the market. To achieve this objective, the organization has to pay heed to the right pricing, effective advertising and sales promotion, distribution, and stimulating the consumers through the best services.\nTo sum up, marketing management may be defined as the process of management of marketing\nprogrammes for accomplishing organisational goals and objectives. It involves planning, implementation, and control of marketing programmes or campaigns.\nThe only way people become aware of a product, service, or idea is if it’s marketed well. A marketing manager builds that awareness by developing and executing marketing strategies to meet consumer needs — and maximize profits. Working in industries as varied as advertising, hospitality, healthcare, finance, technology, retail, and education, marketing managers are integral to a company’s success. They manage internal teams, craft (or oversee) promotional messaging and products, and work to publish or distribute them to the public via media, advertising, and social media. Depending on the size of the company, they may be one of many marketing managers, specializing in a group of products or services, or a specific area of execution.\nSearch engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic\nDigital marketing is the act of promoting and selling products and services by leveraging online marketing tactics such as social media marketing, search marketing, and email marketing. When you get down to it, digital marketing is simply marketing.\nIn this course, you will learn how businesses create value for customers. We will examine the process by which Marketing builds on a thorough understanding of buyer behaviour to create value. You will learn the major elements of the marketing mix - product policy, channels of distribution, communication, and pricing - and see how they fit within different analytical frameworks that are useful to managers. This will enhance your understanding of how marketing works in the business world.\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: • Define marketing and describe how marketing creates value • Describe the elements of the marketing mix • Explain how these elements interact to create value for consumers • Use different analytical frameworks to examine how managers solve business problems • Evaluate brand extensions • Develop a marketing Plan proposal",

      "description": "Owning a small business, you juggle many balls in the air - and with only 24 hours in a day, it can be difficult to focus on marketing your business.\nOne of the biggest challenges I see when I work with small business owners is that marketing your business can often be a little bit like throwing mud at the wall and seeing what sticks.\nAnd it's easy to get overwhelmed by all the marketing strategies and tactics we should engage in. I was recently speaking on marketing at a large sales conference and one audience member stood out to me. After listening to speaker after speaker talking about how to market and sell, he simply asked “how am I supposed to do all that and still run my business?\" That question really stuck with me because it summed up how many small business owners feel. And the answer to it is: you can't do it all – not at the same time anyways. So how do you do it? Follow a SMART marketing plan that incorporates basic marketing fundamentals - a solid system that will guide you. Marketing your business isn't a giant leap, but it's the discipline of putting one foot in front of the other one, day after day, rain or shine.\nSmall business owners often focus on marketing their business when business is down and do a good job giving it a strong push to increase sales. But once the business gets busier (and other areas of the business need attention – the team is growing, product or service lines are expanding), less attention is giving to marketing. After all the business is running well now… but it's not. Without constantly giving attention to your marketing to feed your sales funnel, you will create a rollercoaster business that's up when you market your business and goes down when you pay less attention to your marketing. Sounds familiar?\nIn this course I will share with you the blueprint to your marketing success.\nYou will learn about:\nYour Target Market: You will learn why identifying your target market is critical to your business success and how to define the target market for YOUR business.\nYour Market Positioning: What does your business stand for, what value do you provide and what makes you unique? You will learn why the answers to these questions are key to communicating your market positioning to your prospects and clients.\nWebsites: Your website is the centre of your digital marketing universe. Do you have a website, and if so, is it performing well? You will learn about the key components to building a successful website and how you can work on this right now.\nBlogging: Are you writing a blog? If the answer is “yes\", congratulations! I'll teach you how you can tweak your blog to be an even better marketing tool for your business. If the answer is “no\", I'll ask you to please revise this answer to “not yet\". A blog is a cost effective and easy to implement marketing tool (and yes, you can write!)\nSocial Media: Without doubt, social media is a “must\" in today's marketing, but it's also the most overwhelming part of marketing for small business owners. I will teach you how to develop a successful social media strategy that is sustainable for your business.\nEmail Marketing: Email marketing should be a component in any small business' marketing mix – and it's also one marketing tactic that can be highly automated and systematized. You will learn how email marketing can help you build lasting relationships with your prospects and clients.\nVideo Marketing: Are you doing any video marketing yet? It's easy to get started (and cost effective, not to say free!). Learn why video marketing is so powerful and how you can make it work for your business.\nOffline Marketing - Print: I have owned a digital printing company for over 18 years, and print is still close to my heart. It's a powerful marketing tool that will help you drive traffic to your online marketing channels. Learn how you can have big results on a shoestring budget.\nOffline Marketing - Direct Mail: I call direct mail a secret weapon when it comes to marketing. Learn why and how you can tap into this “secret weapon\" for your business.\nWhy should you buy this course?\nIt will help you grow your business! We cover strategies and tactics that are proven to increase sales and profits and each lecture is followed by an exercise that will encourage you to implement what you have learned right away (knowledge is power, but only when acted upon!).\nI have created this course for every small business owner out there who wants to grow their business. I am an entrepreneur and small business owner myself and I believe that most businesses started out as someone's dream…and I am here to ensure that the dream has a solid foundation beneath it.\nIf you are ready to take the next step...and go from “throwing mud at the wall\" and seeing what sticks to creating a sustainable, results-oriented marketing system for your business, click on \"take this course\" at the top of this page. It's that simple (and since every Udemy course comes with a 30-day money back guarantee... you have everything to gain and nothing to loose!)",

Damit überlässt du es nicht dem Zufall, welchen Weg der Kunde durch dein Angebot nimmt (und ob er überhaupt davon Gebrauch macht), sondern gibst ihm einen klaren, von dir definierten Weg vor.\nLandingpages eigenen sich hervorragend, um deine Liste ständig zu vergrößern und auch, um Verkäufe zu generieren.\nDieser Kurs ist speziell für EinzelunternehmerInnen gedacht, die ein stabiles und gewinnbringendes online Geschäftskonzept auf die Beine stellen möchten, ohne Tag und Nacht an ihrem Marketing zu feilen.\nSinnvoll ist es, wenn du schon ein paar Produkte, wie zB Webinare, Workshops oder Coachings und Therapien anzubieten hast. Es ist aber keine MUSS-Voraussetzung.\nDas kannst du nach dem Kurs:\ndu verstehst, warum der Einsatz von Landingpages wichtig für dein Business ist\ndu überlässt die Wahl deiner Produkte nicht dem Zufall, sondern planst einen sinnvollen Weg, den deine Kunden durch dein Angebot gehen\ndu strukturierst diesen Weg mit Angeboten auf Landingpages\ndu lernst, wie du mit wenigen Klicks selbst Landingpages mithilfe von OptimizePress 2 erstellen kannst\ndu lernst, wie du Anmeldeformulare und Autoresponder von KlickTipp integrieren kannst\nHinweis: Ich bin nicht mehr im Udemy-Marketing-System.

      "description": "What Do Students Say About This Course?\n\"BEST Marketing Course on Udemy\"\n\"This is the real deal :) No fluff, just genuine, valuable information through and through. This is very hard to come by as I feel a lot of marketers withhold information and knowledge just so they can make more money on their next ebook, course, etc. but you won't find any of that here. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in learning more about marketing fundamentals.\" -  Youngin\n\"The Best Marketing Course I've Ever Taken\"\n\"Beginner's marketing blueprint and action plan\"\n\"Clear, well presented, and engaging!\"\n\"Marketing made easy!\"\n\"I Highly Recommend This Course\"\n\"Outstanding Experience\"\n\"WHAT AM I GOING TO LEARN?\"\nYou will learn how to design a powerful name for your product(s).\nYou will learn how to create an imaginary customer. (a crucial concept)\nYou will learn how to price your product(s) and different pricing strategies.\nYou will learn how to craft your promotional message that sells.\nYou will learn different online marketing channels that you can use to put your message in front of your prospective customer's eyes - and much, much more.\nPlease watch the “preview\" lectures, as I share 28 minutes of high-quality content and you will have a better understanding of whether this marketing and business course is for you!\nMy name is Vladimir Raykov. I work as a Marketing Manager, I have a Bachelor's degree in Marketing, and I do online marketing business with my own digital products (eBook and eCourses). I became interested in online marketing several years ago and from then on, I have never stopped learning.\nThe reason I've created “Marketing Fundamentals - 5 Pillars - Learn-Apply-Earn!\" is because I'd like to provide you with a solid foundation (the missing ingredient) on which you can build your online business.\nIn this very moment, people are making millions online. All those people have something in common – KNOWLEDGE! They have invested time to educate themselves. They understand the importance of acquiring new skills and honing existing ones.\nThere are many courses right now, promising that you would make a huge number: 6 or 7 figure incomes. SECRET software and tactics or tricks… well, you will get nothing of that fluff here in my course.\nMind you, this course is NOT about getting rich quickly – if you are looking for this, you won't find it here and I advise you NOT to enroll in my course.\nIn this Marketing course, I'm sharing my experience and knowledge with you that I've been gathering for more than 6 years now. You will learn about the most important pillars of marketing, and namely: Product, Price, Place, Promotion, and Customer.\nThis course is not just plain theory! You are not going to be a passive student. Yes, I teach you the theory because you need it (after all this is a course about marketing fundamentals), but then I integrate the theory with practice, so you start gaining experience right from the beginning of your marketing career.\nNOT ONLY WILL YOU LEARN, but you will also be required to practice what you've learned – see all the “Take Action\" PDFs after each chapter. You will have to download these files and write directly on them.\nRemember, you have nothing to risk! The investment you make now will pay you back many times in the future. I've spent a lot of time working on this course. I provide you with high-quality audio and full HD videos. I believe in my course and I am sure you will love it. If, however, for some reason you are dissatisfied or the course is not what you've expected – no worries, you have 30 days money-back guarantee – NO QUESTIONS ASKED!\n\nSo, in short here is my proposal:\nMy course is going to teach you the fundamentals of marketing – product, price, place, promotion, and customer.\nOnce, you have these in place, you are ready to start building your online business. You will become a member of our marketing community – we share knowledge and experience.\nAll of the information you will be presented is high-quality HD videos with perfect sound. You have access to great bonuses that will become more and more with time.\nIf this sounds appealing to you, click the “Buy Now\" button right now.\n-Vladimir Raykov\nStay Purposeful",

      "description": "\"I know what my startup's goals are but I have no idea how to get there\"\nHi! My name is Eyal Toledano and for the past decade, I've obsessed over the science of engineering predictable growth for a variety of startups across SaaS, Ecommerce, mobile, gaming and more.\nIf you’re like me, you’ve run into many challenges trying to grow your startup, sell more of your product or garner traction for a project. All too often, we hear that ‘Build It And They Will Come’ is not a viable business strategy.\nIn the field, the truth is most startups die from being unable to materialize their goals into actual results. Too much strategy and too little action.\nThe fact is that goal seeking is an applied skill; it takes time, practice and mistakes to get really good at it and its nuances:\nWhether a product already exists or not, how do you determine the path to reaching your goals?\nHow do you set goals?\nWhat is the simplest way to gain a heuristic understanding of every moving piece contributing to your desired bottom line?\nAfter helping dozens of companies systemize their approach to growth through advisory engagements, accelerator mentorship and hands-on workshops, the Growth Models & Goalseeking masterclass was created to help transfer those skills on-demand.\nThe goal of this masterclass is to share my emotional, psychological and logical approach to designing growth systems with you so you can apply that approach to your use case.\nWhat you’ll learn\nOver 6.5+ hours of video growth instruction, learn to reverse-engineer your future state into weekly and monthly product iterations, complete with quantified KPI targets giving you a focused growth roadmap aimed at delivering the key monthly uplifts to reach your goals.\nTraverse the key sections of your company, defining and optimizing your Market, Product, Acquisition Channels and Business Model in a matter that enables your product to build demand for itself, rather than constantly having to figure out how to build demand for the product.\nLearn to identify North Star metrics which have the power to positively influence your every KPI across the board and how to optimize your product management in relation to these metrics\nAchieve working proficiency by building a growth model for your startup which will plainly show what needs to happen, where it needs to happen and by when to hit your desired goals.\nWho is this Masterclass for?\nThis is an entry-level growth marketing strategy class aimed at introducing marketers with a deeper sense of how to materialize their own strategy into a month to month execution plan that overdelivers their goals. Approximately 20% of the time is spent reviewing key growth concepts and 80% is follow along materials aimed at developing critical thinking around the most important parts of the growth equation.\nStartup founders\nMarketing managers\nGrowth marketers (SaaS, mobile, ecommerce)\nEcommerce marketers\nEvery model is different, especially based on the kind of business model used. A SaaS or mobile app model may focus on revenue and user retention whereas an ecommerce or transactional model might be more focused on profitably acquiring customers from the onset.\nThe goal of the course isn't to download and use the model that was built in the videos; but to give you enough tools and confidence to bootstrap a model of your own that clearly communicates your path and how to achieve it.\n\nGrowth Strategist Certification\nComplete a ten-part questionnaire to cement your understanding of the theory and practice of engineering and executing a demand and growth strategy. Walk away from the Masterclass as a certified growth strategist.\n\n\nAbout Your Instructor\n\"Eyal is one of the rare players in the startup space who can play each role really well. He has deep experience in startups at all stages of the lifecycle and across industries with specific superpowers in e-commerce, marketplaces and SaaS models. The wonderful aspect of working with Eyal is he raises everyone's game and keeps the momentum that is so vital to startups going up and to the right. I would work with Eyal and any company he is associated with, in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It's rare to find a Growth advisor of Eyal's caliber, let alone one who consistently drives results across the entire funnel. The hyper-growth we've experienced at ManyChat would overwhelm even the most seasoned Growth marketers. However, I can always rely on Eyal to bring compassion, perspective, and a few 'next steps' to the challenges at hand. Eyal is the trusted Growth advisor most SaaS founders know they need, but may never be lucky enough to have. I feel privileged to have Eyal's help growing ManyChat, and I'd relish the opportunity to work with him again on future projects.\"\n\"I have never learnt more in a short period of time than while working with Eyal. He's an extremely knowledgeable entrepreneur who always brings the best of the talent he works with.\"\n\"Eyal has been more than instrumental in helping me get my company growth on track. His experience helped him understand where I was coming from and provide a clear and actionable path to not just profitability, but to my own personal comfort and sanity. He's helped devise and implement a great, nimble marketing strategy fit for a small company, but scalable as we grow. He's also been a huge help in larger business operations. He made some strategic staffing suggestions which we're still relying on and benefitting from today. It's been such an honor to work with such a fine tuned mind. I can't wait to see where things go from here!\"\n\"Eyal is a true growth master. I've learned a ton through my time working with him. He's the man who makes the best plans. His strategic insight and advice helps companies reach product market fit. Highly recommend working with him if you get the opportunity.\"",

      "description": "「ニュートンは最後の魔術師だ」\n1940年ごろ、経済学者ケインズ（そう、あのケインズ）がオークションでニュートンの遺稿を落札しました。競売にかけられた329冊の手記の中、なんと三分の一は怪しげな錬金術についての文書でした。ケインズによれば、ニュートンは最初の近代科学者というよりは、最後の魔術師である、とのこと。冒頭の一文ですね。\nニュートンが金の亡者であったかどうかはわかりません。しかし金を合成する過程で、様々な発見がありました。硫酸、硝酸、塩酸など化学薬品の多くが試行のプロセスで発見され、様々な実験道具も発明されました。その成果は現在にも引き継がれ、歴史学者のフランシス・イェイツは「16世紀の錬金術が17世紀の自然科学を生み出した」と発言したほどです。\nもしニュートンが現代に蘇り、10年ばかりの寿命が与えられたら、彼は何を研究するのでしょうか。やはりこれも想像の域を出ません。個人的にはマーケティング工学をやるのではないかと思うのです。\nなぜなら世界の最も賢い人たちは、今、データサイエンティストという肩書きを携え、必死にマーケティングの研究をしているからです。その当時の世界で最も賢い人たちが研究するテーマは、時代とともに変遷しました。\n人工知能、宇宙工学、金融工学。\n人間と意思疎通のできるロボットの制作を夢見た科学者。月面着陸を夢見た科学者はNASAを目指しました。デリバティブやオプション取引を生んだシティやウォールストリートの天才たちは、やはり金融工学の分野で博士号を取っています。\nそして今日、ビッグデータをもとに人間の行動を解析するデータサイエンティストという職業が、世界で最もクールで、しかもセクシー（Sexy）だと言われています。\n僕はこの潮流と言うか時勢を見ていると、マーケティングは「現代版のアルケミー」なんじゃないかと思ったわけです。もちろんマーケティングを学んだからといって、無限に貴金属を生み出せるわけではありません。しかし中小企業や個人事業主でも使えるマーケティング工学は、安定的なビジネスを運営する手助けになるはずです。\n少なくとも、僕が勉強して、実際にビジネスに応用したマーケティング工学は、かなりビジネスをソリッドなものしてくれました。まぁ、たかだか個人が作った小さな会社です。勝手に言わせておいてあげてください。（僕は、本当にソリッドだと思ったんですから）\n例えば、クラウドファンディングを資金調達の方法だと考える人もいますが、あれはニーズ調査のためのツールです。資金が調達できなければ、そもそもニーズが存在していない証拠なので、クリエイターはむしろお金をかけずに調査をできてラッキーだと思うべきです。\n逆に言うとファンドレイズが成功したプロジェクトの場合、ニーズがあることを確認し、前金が手に入り、見込み客と顧客までも同時に手に入れることができます。これまでの商慣習を考えると、商品を販売する前にニーズとお金と顧客の全てを手に入れるなんて、魔法としか思えないような出来事なんですね。\nこういったマーケティング最前線の現場を見ていると、フリーランスや中小企業の社長に必要なのは、お金ではなく工学的な知識であることがわかります。このコースを受講して、工学的なマーケティングの知識を手に入れ、現場で試してみてください。\nなぜニュートンが錬金術にハマったか。その理由の一片が理解できるかもしれません。",

Introduction to choice architecture\nMeet Sam Tatam, behavioral strategy director at Ogilvy Consulting. Awarded strategist, psychologist, and advertising practitioner. Sam explains what is choice architecture, why it’s important and gives jaw-dropping examples of its power.\n2. The Power of Friction\nYour customers like everything to go smoothly, but sometimes too smooth won't soothe, but rather make them scoot. You’ll find out why increasing friction for your customers can be a surprising goldmine.\n3. The Importance of Salience\nThe rules of Salience aren't new. It’s way more than just personalization, as there are interesting and specific ways we can unpack salience to influence decision making; you’ll befriend idiosyncratic fit and salient feedback.\nThere’s a way to make an already good deal even sweeter if you design it in a way that feels like it gives your target customer a relative advantage, compared to others. Sam and Uber could tell.\n4. Defaults\nDefaults are very powerful for nudging customers towards making a certain choice. They allow us to make a decision without the need to invest too much effort into thinking about it. But with great power comes great responsibility. Using defaults in the right way so that your customers don’t feel like you’re limiting their agency, or power to make their own decisions, can be an art form, which Sam will explain to you in this part.\n5. Case study: Creating Healthy Habits by Matej Sucha\nIt turns out that diabetes patients have a large portion of their health state in their own hands - by what they eat and how active they are. A simple piece of advice could then be “eat healthily and move a lot” but we all know that changing one’s behavior is far from easy.\nThat’s why in this project for a health insurance company we designed an elaborate behavior change strategy with new habit creation at its core.",

Queste ricerche sono essenziali per guardare avanti e acquisire un vantaggio rispetto ai concorrenti nel tuo settore.\nChe cosa invece NON E' questo corso?  Beh... molte cose. Non è un corso su instagram, facebook, linkedin, etc.\nNon è un corso sullo storytelling, o sulle RP, sulle affiliazioni, sul public speaking e nemmeno ( sigh ) su come vivere felici senza lavorare :)\nChi studia con me, sa bene che si può fare un percorso entusiasmante insieme , nel rispetto reciproco e senza necessità di atteggiarsi a fenomeni... anzi, diciamolo subito: comunicare è faticoso. Faticoso, davvero. Ma anche incredibilmente appagante dal punto di vista professionale, umano ed etico.\nSe vuoi approfondire questi temi, ti suggerisco anche di dare una occhiata al corso completo, che puoi trovare su Udemy con lo stesso titolo , prodotto da \"Accademia Il Mio Valore\". Troverai molte più lezioni, più casi pratici e argomenti trattati.\nSe poi vuoi ottenere davvero il massimo e scoprire ulteriori vantaggi, puoi trovare tutti i miei corsi in versione completa e costantemente aggiornata nella mia accademia ( basta digitare IL MIO VALORE su google )\nTi aspetto.",

      "description": "Every human being's subconscious mind is responsible for making decisions much before the conscious one interferes. ‘Consumer Behavior’ involves studying the processes a consumer uses to make purchase decisions, to dispose of purchased goods or services and study the factors that influence purchase decisions and the use of products. We will discuss in details about some important topics, like: Types of Consumers, Role of Consumer Behavior in Loyalty, Model of Consumer Behavior, Steps of Decision-Making Process, How to Reduce Cognitive Dissonance, Factors Influencing Consumer Behavior, Role of Consumer Behavior & Value Drivers.\nYou can analyze your consumers to understand consumer behavior to find out which customer value driver do they consider most important.\nBased on your consumer behavior studies, you can then modify your marketing strategies and product offerings to foster the following four key customer value drivers:\nValue for Time\nValue for Attention\nValue in my Life\nValue of Access\nAs the consumer continues to deal with a brand for a long time, the brand tends to explicate a better insight of customer’s needs and expectations. Through this, a great relationship can be developed between them. This will result in selling of more products and retain the business with the consumers which finally leads to profitable business.",

The desire to develop essential skillsets, implement effective systems, and achieve tangible results is often overshadowed by the overwhelming nature of the task, leading to paralysis and inaction.\nThis course breaks down the core skillsets that you need to succeed in Marketing and teaches you the technical skills, including why they’re important, what they drive, a case study and a workbook with full guide to build it yourself.\nBased on Notion - an excellent free tool - this course gives you a workbook that as you work through the course, learning the only fundamental key skills you need, your workbook grows with you to create all of your marketing functions and tools.\nWith this course I will take you through everything you need to build your entire marketing function, from concept all the way through to a/b testing and measuring your R.O.I.. All built into a tool for you to keep forever, this course is a complete learning of everything you need to learn and execute in order to market your product or your brand. So if you are looking for your first marketing moves, or you want to make sure you’re building the best foundations for Marketing success, then sign up.\nBorn out of frustration of how complicated people are making Marketing, this comprehensive course will deep dive into the core pillars of effective marketing, breaking it down into two fundamental modules: \"Know Who to Talk To\" and \"Know How to Talk to Them.\"\nModule One lays the groundwork for your brand, the unsexy parts of Marketing that are often forgotten but the absolute pillars of success. This module will give you the essential skills to understand and dissect your target markets, build out your audience and segmentation, create your personas, map out your customer journeys and much more to make sure that you know exactly who you need to go after in order to grow your business.\nModule two takes you into the core aspects of your brand and how you amplify it to others. In this module you’ll learn how to uncover your brands essence and translate it effectively to resonate with your audience. From building out your identity to crafting compelling brand stories, ideation, and brainstorming, I will show you how to ensure your messaging cuts through the noise. Then I will show you how to take everything you have learn and ACTUALLY implement it. How to build out your BAU and Campaign Marketing PLUS how to use the Course Workbook to run your entire marketing activities (because you will be an expert by this point).\nThis isn’t just a run of the mill Marketing course – it's a dynamic blend of theory and practical application, honed through my 15 years of real-world, building brands and start up experience. I’ve spent years taking brands from a core idea to over $1m revenue, and this course will show you how I did it.",

They search for goods and services and, sometimes, they'll leave reviews for restaurants; coffee shops; florists; heating and cooling repairmen; plumbers; lawyers; accountants and more.\nYour company - whether you're a local start-up; \"Mom and Pop\" shop or is starting to grow with a larger customer base and more employees - needs to protect and improve its online reputation.\nOne of the best ways is by earning positive reviews from customers and clients through online review websites such as Yelp, Manta, Google+ Local, Bing Local and many others.\nPositive online reviews offer social proof that your company provides excellent products and services to its customers. It tells other potential customer \"buy from this company\" or \"visit this restaurant!\"\nOn the other side, customers can also leave your company a negative review which can quickly cause your business' online reputation to go sour.\nIn this course, we'll focus on how you and your business can earn positive reviews from customers.\nWe'll explain how online review websites work and how businesses and customers rely on these websites; how your business can claim, confirm and optimize your online review profile for better rankings; which online review websites your company should target, and, most importantly, proven and inexpensive tips and techniques you can implement in order to earn more positive reviews for your business.",

      "description": "Account-Based Marketing (ABM) is a strategic approach to B2B marketing that focuses on targeting high-value accounts rather than broad audiences. Unlike traditional marketing methods that cast a wide net, ABM aligns marketing and sales efforts to engage specific accounts with personalized campaigns. By treating each target company as a unique market, ABM delivers higher conversion rates, better customer relationships, and increased revenue potential.\nIn today’s competitive business landscape, generic marketing tactics are no longer enough to capture the attention of key decision-makers.

We'll use my marketing strategy master document to cover how to define your company vision, important company milestones, setting KPI's, defining customer personas, customer journeys, as well as identifying your competitive landscape.\n\n\nWhy should I learn about marketing strategy?\nAnyone looking to grow their company or advance in their career has to be able to think and act strategically. Thinking strategically is a muscle you have to develop, but there are no real great frameworks for combining the most important aspects of a growth strategy into one unified vision. We'll teach you how to think about each part as part of the whole strategic solution so you can grow your business or get that promotion faster.\n\n\nDo I need any experience or related skills to complete this?\nAll you will need is access to a computer. We will provide all the necessary documents for you to organize and execute your growth strategy.\n\n\nWhat is included in the certification materials?\nWe will provide you access to all the documents and high definition video walkthroughs that cover the document topics.\n\n\nPart 2: Implementation\nAfter gaining a deeper strategic understanding of how to organize your business, we will teach you how to execute an initiative implementation system. You'll learn about the various growth channels, and how to organize and execute individual initiatives for maximum impact.\n\n\nWhy do I need to understand how to implement initiatives?\nStrategy will teach you about the overarching goals of the organization, and an implementation system is your strategy at work. You will learn how to execute your strategy and get feedback from successful and failed initiatives and how to apply that to future work.\n\n\nPart 3: Reporting\nThe last step in any process is understanding if what you are doing is successful or failing. We'll teach you how to monitor the success of your business by tracking quantitative and qualitative data.\n\n\nWhy is reporting important?\nReporting allows you to make realtime decisions about whether your strategy and implementation process is truly working as you need it to. By teaching you how to set strategic KPI goals and crafting a story about the success or failure of those goals with qualitative data, you can be a more effective strategic manager.",

      "description": "If you want to earn a decent living as a freelance copywriter, you must embrace one simple, proven, and indisputable fact.\nWEALTHY COPYWRITERS DON’T USE JOB BOARDS.\nCopywriters who earn $100,000 a year don’t use Upwork. They don’t offer copywriting gigs on Fiverr, for a fiver. They don’t have a profile on Freelance dot com.\nWhy don’t wealthy copywriters use job boards? Three reasons. First, because the level of competition on job boards is brutal. Every job post receives proposals from dozens or even hundreds of other copywriters. You can’t possibly stand out amidst all that noise.\nSecond, because there’s a race to the bottom in rates. Job boards attract businesses who want to pay the lowest possible price for your copywriting services. On job boards, you are in direct competition with overseas freelancers who charge a fraction of what you charge. They get the gigs. You go hungry. Or, you lower your rates, YOU get the gigs, and you STILL go hungry.\nThe third reason wealthy copywriters don’t use job boards is simple: they are a massive waste of your life. Spend any time on Upwork, for example, and you’ll discover that you can waste an entire day responding to job posts, crafting customized proposals and pitching your services, and have nothing by the end of the day to show for it except sore fingers. I know writers who have applied to hundreds of jobs on Upwork, let me say that again, hundreds of jobs on Upwork, and they have heard absolutely nothing in response.\nIf you want to earn a decent living as a freelance copywriter, you must shun all the job boards, and find your writing gigs another way. That other way is what I teach you in this course.\nHi, I’m Alan Sharpe, and welcome to my course on finding copywriting clients without job boards. I wrote my first piece of copy for pay back in 1989. Today, I make around 150 thousand dollars a year as a freelance copywriter. And I don’t use a single job board, ever.\nThe secret to earning decent money as a freelance copywriter is to shun job boards and reach out to potential clients directly. When you land clients directly, you have less competition, you earn more, and you take control of your future.\nIn this course, I teach you where to find copywriting clients, including professional associations, mailing list tools, supplier directories, trade publications, trade show directories, trade associations and other uncommon but effective sources. I teach you how to find clients in all the same places where I look for prospects. I have been at this for more than 30 years, and I know all the best places to look. By the end of this course, you will, too.\nOne thing to know about this course is that I don’t tell you to look for clients in any of the usual places that so-called “experts” tell you to look. I don’t tell you talk to your family and friends, or to join Facebook groups, or to follow people on Twitter, or to attend networking events. WRONG!\nIf you want to get the same results that mediocre copywriters get, keep looking for clients in all the wrong places, including job boards. But if you want to earn six figures or more, do what I teach you in this course. Find your clients yourself by looking in more than a dozen uncommon, but effective places. You’ll find better clients, you’ll earn more money, and you’ll take control of your future.\nSee you soon.",

Anyone can learn how to post to social, write a blog post, or learn what SEO is, but quantity is not what works. What works are people who actually know WHY and WHEN certain marketing activities work.\nThat's the purpose of this course. By the end, you will have developed an actual marketing strategy, your own personal marketing playbook, that will guide you and your brand into the right marketing activity.\nThink about it - no more guessing or assuming. You will be able to inform others and act personally based on the correct information!\nThree reasons to TAKE THIS COURSE right now!\nYou get lifetime access to lectures, including new lectures every month (content is added/updated constantly).\nYou can ask me questions and see me respond to every single one of them thoughtfully!\nWhat you will learn in this course is original, tested, and very detailed! It comes from years of graduate-level education and 20+ of marketing leadership experience across dozens of industries.\nThere are plenty of people who can teach you shortcuts and fast tactics.\nThis is a course for people who are truly willing to understand instead. A course for people who would rather do it right than hustle and hassle people. Once you work your way through nearly 200 lessons, your strategy will become more clear, your empathy will deepen and you'll begin to see the market as it is, instead of merely wishing it to be what you want.\n★★★★★  \"This is the best marketing innovation I have seen in years.\" - Ignacio Agacevic\nThe Marketing Leadership Masterclass is split into 6 different online sessions, each focusing on a different aspect of marketing leadership.\n\n\nIn Session 3 we will focus on Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)\nCRO has been considered by many the most important marketing activity because it makes every visitor exponentially more valuable. For example, if you double your conversion rate but keep the same traffic, you have essentially doubled your revenue. Digital marketing is analytics driven, smart marketing.\nIn this Session, you will learn how the best companies design and optimize sites that convert. The goal is to remove the fog of mystery around CRO by introducing you to a common-sense, data-informed, well-proven strategy for optimizing your conversion rate.\nAt the conclusion of this session you will have developed your own conversion rate optimization plan based upon each of your primary user touch points.\nWhat are the requirements?\nNo experience or audience required.\nSuitable for all types of businesses (digital product, physical product, service, B2B, B2C).\nWhy take this Course?\nBecome a Leader - Learn how to think & act like a strategic marketing leader.\nModern Marketing - The world of marketing is in constant flux.

      "description": "WHY THIS COURSE?\nThis course is specifically designed for introverts who are self-employed, have online businesses or want to develop their hobby into a profitable business.\nI know how tough it is to spread the word and talk about what you do. Most creative introverts I know just want to DO the work - rather than spend their time and energy marketing it.\nIn addition, most marketing advice out there is designed by and for extroverts - which doesn't take into account:\n1) Your unique, innate introvert strengths\n2) The problems and challenges introverts face\n3) The most effective way to use introversion to your advantage\n... And that's why this course exists.\nI've spent 5 years learning what to do (and not to do) in marketing online and offline, using the introvert traits that come naturally to me - and this course will show you how to do the same.\n\n\n***BONUS*** WORKBOOK AND MULTIPLE TEMPLATES + CHEAT SHEETS\nMy students love how actionable my courses are, and I go all out on creating useful workbooks, templates and other printables and tools to make life super easy for you, and save you time.\n\n\nINCREDIBLE STUDENT SUPPORT\nI offer my time to regularly hold office hours with students. During the office hours you can ask me any business question you want, and I'll do my best to help you.\nStudents can start discussions and message me with private questions. I answer your questions within 24 hours. I love helping students who take my courses and I look forward to helping you!\nI also promise to regularly update this course to reflect the current marketing landscape, and what I'm learning.\n\n\nOVER 23 VIDEO LECTURES\nThis course is comprehensive. It will make you a great marketer in a short amount of time, no 'extroverting' required. You will learn top social media marketing strategies, effective copywriting skills, how to get publicity for your business, introvert-friendly networking strategies, and lots more.\nAfter you complete the course, you will have a well-rounded understanding of various marketing strategies, and most importantly you will be able to choose and implement the ones that suit YOUR personality type and preferences in order to grow your business.\n\n\nMONEY-BACK GUARANTEE\nThe course comes with an unconditional, Udemy-backed, 30-day money-back guarantee. This is not just a guarantee, it's my personal promise to you that I will go out of my way to help you succeed just like I've done for thousands of my other students.",

      "description": "By not actively positioning your business you are leaving everything up to chance, and worse, letting potential clients do this on your behalf which is unlikely to be for the benefit of you or your business.\nCombined with a generic or uninspiring value proposition, poor positioning can be the reason behind some of the challenges and frustrations your business is experiencing.\nIf you're not attracting any new clients, it could be that your value proposition is too broad and doesn't highlight what is special about your business and why potential clients will want to work with you.\n\nIf you're not attracting clients you enjoy working with or are the right fit for your business, it could be that your value proposition doesn't clearly outline who your ideal client is.\n\nThis course covers how to identify your differentiators and what makes your business special. By connecting the dots between each element of the positioning process, you'll be able to confidently define your business' value proposition and use it as the basis for building your other strategic marketing elements such as your messaging platform and advertising campaigns.\nIt is a powerful course that provides the foundational principles you need to create a business you love working in. The knowledge gained will be applicable across other areas of your business, not just your positioning and value proposition.\n\n\nThis course is for you if:\nYou own, or are starting, an interior design business\nYou want to know where to focus your efforts for maximum impact before you launch your business\nYou are ready to thrive, not just survive\nYou aren't attracting enough new clients or you aren't attracting the types of clients you enjoy working with\nYou're frustrated or confused by what steps you need to take to grow or improve your business\nYou've kept your value proposition broad, trying to appeal to everyone.

      "description": "Neuromarketin is a commercial marketing communication field that applies neuropsychology to market research, studying consumer sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective responses to marketing stimuli. The potential benefits to marketers include more efficient and effective marketing campaigns and strategies, fewer product and campaign failures, and ultimately the manipulation of the real needs and wants of people to suit the needs and wants of marketing interest. Understanding consumer behaviors in marketing is very important to knowing what your consumers are capable of doing and what products and services they need and how best you can use communication to let them know your brand and choose your brand instead of competitors brands. Let not all of us forget that the only thing that can change the mind of the customer is quality of a brand and the satisfaction that, the brand can bring to solve the customer problems, so in practicing neuromarketing we must make sure that our products and service can meet the test of time.\nThe aim of every marketer is that they want to ensure that they use neuromarketing to increase their sales but that does not come easily companies must ensure that they simplify complex products and vice versa, we must know that simple decisions work best when made with more thought while complex decisions work better when made intuitively. Product or service modification is very important in any sales context because consumers want to see changes to long existing brand, since consumers taste and preferences changes quickly companies must be creative in dealing with both loyal and potential customers\nWhen we are using the neuromarketing techniques then marketers must use the right tool and the right technology to get the best outcome by using techniques such as eye tracking, pupilometry and facial coding etc , can all help to achieved the best results. Just lie your muscles, your brain needs exercise to eep it in good working order. Neuromarketing is a powerful and effective tool that can help you understand your customers better. B tapping into their brain you can gain valuable insight into how they think, behave and make decisions.",

Since the initial audience had very little (almost no) knowledge of marketing, I tried to simplify the concepts as much as I could.\nWhy should we always have \"value\" in mind when we approach marketing? What are the processes of marketing?\nWhat is Marketing Management, and which Marketing Concepts do we have? Which concept suits you and your company better? Are some outdated? Are some better than others?\nUnderstanding Strategic Planning. Even if we are a \"one-man-show\" or a very small business, we should have some strategic planning. This would guide us to further create and tweak our marketing strategy.\nHow do we segment a market? What is the correct audience for us? How can we position ourselves and differentiate our product or service in comparison with the competition? What tools can we use here?\nWhat is Marketing Mix? What are the good old four P's that everyone mentioned? Why should we look at that also from a consumer perspective?\nWhat is an Integrated Marketing Strategy?\nAnd much more!

The course is focused on practical applications of marketing strategy including contemporary market research tools, modern day marketing frameworks and concepts. As the course instructor I run a digital marketing agency and practice these techniques daily, there is a strong focus on practicality and application as well as theory.\nThe course is divided into 4 sections:\nIn the first section we start by gaining a thorough understanding of what marketing and market strategy actually is. We cover a number of key marketing tenets such as the 4P’s and persuasive techniques used in marketing.\nIn the second section we discuss market research in depth and how to generate marketing personas. We explore the components of marketing personas and we dive into modern tools that can be used to conduct market research\nIn the third section of the course we take a deep dive into marketing frameworks. These are models that can be used to apply marketing principles and market research to our modern day consumer landscape. We discuss 6 marketing frameworks and look at their evolution and usage.\nIn the fourth section we take a look at modern day marketing personalities and consider their ideas and how to incorporate them into our marketing practice. We also provide a nice and easy summary of the course and the models we have discussed.\n\n\nWhat Students Are saying:\nEloin wrote:\n\"Very well presented and explained, I really enjoyed this course because it broadened my outlook on marketing. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a little more depth in their marketing efforts.\"",

Here's an overview of pricing policy and strategies for marketing:\nPricing Policy:\nA pricing policy outlines the guidelines and principles a company follows when setting prices for its products or services. It involves strategic decisions on pricing objectives, methods, and approaches that align with overall business goals. Key elements of a pricing policy include:\n1. Pricing Objectives:\nDetermine the primary goals of pricing, such as maximizing profit margins, gaining market share, achieving specific revenue targets, or enhancing brand positioning.\n2. Market Analysis:\nConduct thorough market research and competitor analysis to understand customer preferences, pricing trends, and industry benchmarks.\n3. Cost Analysis:\nEvaluate all costs associated with producing, distributing, and marketing the product to ensure pricing covers expenses and generates desired profit margins.\n4. Value Proposition:\nDefine the unique value proposition of the product or service to justify its pricing relative to customer benefits and competitive offerings.\n5. Pricing Methods:\nChoose appropriate pricing methods such as cost-based pricing, value-based pricing, competitor-based pricing, or dynamic pricing based on market dynamics and product positioning.\n6. Price Segmentation:\nImplement pricing strategies that cater to different customer segments based on their willingness to pay, preferences, and purchasing behavior.\n7. Promotional Pricing Guidelines:\nSet guidelines for promotional pricing, discounts, and sales strategies to drive short-term revenue without undermining long-term profitability.\nPricing Strategies:\nEffective pricing strategies are tactical approaches used to implement the pricing policy and achieve specific marketing objectives. Here are some common pricing strategies:\n1. Penetration Pricing:\nSet a low initial price to quickly gain market share and attract price-sensitive customers. The price may be raised later once a customer base is established.\n2. Skimming Pricing:\nLaunch the product at a high price to capture early adopters and customers willing to pay a premium for new features or innovations.\n3. Value-Based Pricing:\nDetermine prices based on the perceived value of the product or service to the customer, considering factors like benefits, quality, and competitive alternatives.\n4. Competitive Pricing:\nSet prices based on competitors' pricing strategies, aiming to match, undercut, or differentiate based on value.\n5. Bundle Pricing:\nOffer multiple products or services together at a discounted price compared to purchasing them separately, encouraging upselling and increasing overall customer value.\n6. Dynamic Pricing:\nAdjust prices in real-time based on demand, seasonality, or market conditions using algorithms and data analytics.\n7. Psychological Pricing:\nSet prices slightly below round numbers (e.g., $9.99 instead of $10) to create a perception of lower cost and increase purchase likelihood.\n8.\n· Cross-Functional Collaboration:\nEnsure alignment between marketing, sales, finance, and product teams to implement pricing strategies effectively.\n· Continuous Monitoring and Optimization:\nRegularly analyze pricing performance, customer feedback, and market dynamics to adjust pricing strategies accordingly and stay competitive.\n· Customer Communication:\nClearly communicate value propositions and pricing strategies to customers through marketing campaigns, product messaging, and customer service interactions.\n· Adaptation to Market Changes:\nRemain flexible and adaptive to changing market conditions, competitor actions, and customer preferences to maintain pricing relevance and effectiveness.\nBy developing a well-defined pricing policy and employing strategic pricing strategies, businesses can optimize profitability, enhance customer value perception, and achieve sustainable growth in competitive markets. Regular evaluation and refinement of pricing approaches are essential to staying responsive to evolving market dynamics and customer needs.",

There’s a lot of mysticism around growth hacking, growth marketing, and digital marketing. But the fact is, growing any organization — whether it’s the next tech unicorn or a small business — is like building a well-oiled machine. And the blueprint for this machine is the growth marketing funnel.\nThis blueprint allows you to break down your growth machine into distinct parts that you can prioritize, optimize, and improve. Stop wondering where to focus, stop simply hoping initiatives will work, and start driving results systematically.\nYou will master the growth marketing funnel by the end of this course. And along the way, you'll learn the fundamentals of customer acquisition, retention, and monetization.\nIncluded in this course:\n23 high-quality video lectures\n25 written lectures, complete with examples from well-known companies, wisdom from growth experts, and insights from my own experience\n14 practical exercises that you can apply to your own business (or impress a future employer with) right away\n4 ready-to-copy Google spreadsheet templates you can use for modelling growth, virality, and more\nA curated collection of external resources where you can go even deeper on these concepts\nThe ability to ask me questions if you get stuck (I'll respond as soon as I can!)\nThis course is not highly tactical and does not contain growth hacks. Instead, it gives you a growth marketing foundation that you can use as a filter in a world where the best tactics are changing every day.\nAs well, the underlying concepts in this course are not new — what I offer is a synthesis of some of the greatest minds in growth marketing, combined with my own experience working at high growth startups.\nI want to train you to think like a growth marketer. The funnel is how we’ll get there.\n\nReady to get started? Enroll now and learn skills that will unlock new growth in your business and your career.\n---\n\"...for anyone looking for an awesome digital marketing coach, this is your guy!\"\n— Rory R., former student of Lloyd's (and now, full-time digital marketer!)",

Eric had just left Spain and I had been living here for about six months.\nI was really impressed by Eric's copywriting knowledge and he was blown away by the lifestyle I had created as a freelance copywriter.\nI had used my copywriting business to live around the world including Costa Rica, New York, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\n.\nWe combined our knowledge to make the most EPIC copywriting course on Udemy\nSince we were both already Udemy instructors, we decided to combine our knowledge and make the most thorough copywriting course Udemy, and perhaps the world, has ever seen!\n.\nWhat are you waiting for?\nCheck out the free preview videos and see if this course is a good fit for you. After you've watched a few lectures, you'll be hooked and well on your way to becoming a copywriting master and living your life on your own terms!\n.\nYou can start learning in less than 30 seconds!\nEnroll right now by clicking 'Buy now' button in the top right-hand corner.\nCheers,\nDan & Eric\nP.S One last note. This course is very comprehensive and covers everything a complete beginner would need to know to become a paid copywriter, including the business side as well as all of the copywriting knowledge you need.\nIf you don't want to work as a copywriter, but want to learn how to write effectively and persuasively, you should still take this course. There are hours of valuable content on this.\nAnd if you're already a great persuasive writer, but you haven't figured out how to get your first clients yet, or how to charge for writing, then you should also take this course. You'll have a chance to fine-tune your copywriting skills and then learn how to translate those skills into real paying clients.",

      "description": "NOTE: I have decided to make this course free. I hope you take this information with the spirit is intended. I want photographers to be as successful as they can be. Good luck to all of you taking this course.\nI think the information is vital for photographers who are being marketed to in a constant barrage of \"Secrets\" and \"Easy Methods\" and the snake oil of hype and glitz. There are no secrets, nothing this important is easy, and people who try to tell you there is a single way to success are simply full of it... and your money if you buy into the nonsense. Don't be sucked in by the perkiness and the hype, becoming a successful photographer may be one of the most difficult career moves out there. But it can be done, IS being done every day be people who are prepared and willing to work.\nThe Real World, NO BS, Marketing Strategies for Photographers.\nThe title of this course says it all... this is a real world, no nonsense approach to marketing for the commercial photographer. While this course is fully implementable by photographers of all genres, the approach is for the emerging commercial photographer. Much of the information can be used by wedding and portrait photographers, however the main thrust of it is toward the editorial, corporate and commercial photographer in markets that are difficult to get a foothold in.\n\nThe class consists of video and worksheets designed to help you forge your own, personal approach to marketing and finding clients.\nThis course is not designed to be done quickly, and I suggest that you take a couple of months to complete it - based on how much outside work you are doing. The worksheets take time to complete and are instrumental in the design of your marketing strategy. Use them to educate yourself, and bring them to the Webinars for some individual discussion if you would like. There will be opportunities for further discussion on these points.\n\nVideo is used for a more narrative approach, and there are the worksheets that have been mentioned. The class is designed to go from beginning to end the first time through, then to be used as a resource for continuing in the specific areas the student is struggling with.\nIf you are wanting to create a business out of commercial photography, build a reputation, find and retain clients and have a complete working knowledge of how marketing a small, creative business is done, this course is for you. Whether you want to go full time or make a good part time income, creating and understanding your marketing strategy will save you time, money and heartache.\nAs a photographer, designer and marketer for small and medium businesses for forty years, I bring all of my experience and knowledge of this field into easy to understand videos. The work is hard, but the skills needed are presented in a way that make them accessible - and that benefits the busy student in many ways.\nOur Comprehensive Table of Contents:\nThe Real World, No BS, 'Take Your Secrets and Shove 'em” Approach to Marketing for Photographers\nIntroduction\nMarketing is a Journey Not a Destination\nMarketing Builds Awareness.\nThere Are No “Secrets”\nYour Story\nCrafting Your Story\nMarketing is Not a Tactic or a Trick\nMarketing is Not Sales\nWhy Cookie Cutter Strategies Won't Work\nPreparing to Build Your Strategy\nGoal Setting Worksheet\nKeep It Simple\nCreating a Strategy That is Right For You\nCreate Your Own Strategy\nThe Building Blocks\nWatch Out for Roadblocks – Especially The Ones You Create\nBuild a Support Group\nBecome Responsible, and Love Being Responsible\nBudget Your Assets for Maximum Reach and Minimal Expense\nUnderstand Your Market\nBuilding a Good Foundation\nFirst – BE a photographer.\nWhat do You Do?\nWhy do You Do It?\nA Long Dissertation on Shooting What YOU Love to Shoot.\nPlan the Work and Work the Plan\nShooting Every Day -- The Goal\n“Shoot Every Gig for a Year” - (“Wizwow’s Approach to Making Headway”\nShoot at 110% For Every Job You Get\nThe Essence of the Self Assignment\nCreating an “Editorial Schedule” To Keep The Work Fowing\nThe Time Tested, Good Ol' Hardcopy Portfolio.\nCreate a strong experience based book.\nWhat is in it.\nWhy you have it.\nWhere You Show it.\nWho You Show it to.\nWhen to Create it.\nWhy You Still Need It\nWhy iIt Makes a Difference.\nWhich Portfolio Style is Best for You\nPortfolio building ideas.\nFolders for Possibilities\nBasic Portfolio Challenges.\nBasic Portfolio Layout.\nHow To Decide On Presentation\nPage Size\nWhat about the Web?\nHow the Web Portfolio is Different Than the Hardcopy\nWeb Categories\nHow Many Categories / How Many Images Per?\nWhy Less is More\nWhy having a 'Webmaster” is a Losing Proposition\nPresentation of the Image\nHow Large Should the Images Be?\nHow to Create a Faster Loading Image in Photoshop\nProtecting The Image.\nUsing a Watermark (that usually looks terrible, unprofessional and silly) VS Not Using A Watermark\nHard Copy Tools\nPrint Materials\nIdentity Materials\nEven Business Forms Need ID\nWhy Spending a Ton of Money on ID when starting Makes No Sense\nCommon Sense Design Trends\nDrop Off Materials Leave Behinds\nDirect Mail Approaches\nThe Internet\nThe Most Important Two Internet Tools..\n-Your Website\n-Your Blog\nCreate a Blog for the 'Right' audience.\nBlog For Clients, Not Other Photographers\nWhat Kinds of 'Stuff' Should You Blog?\nSocial Tools\nSocial Sites (Satellite Outliers and the Main Site approach.\nWhy Facebook, G+ and Twitter Will NOT make you rich).\nWhy Ignoring Facebook and Twitter (and G+) Is A Problem – Or Not – Depending.\nUse the Outliers to Build Awareness\nEmail Marketing\nFind and Build a List\nPurchase a List\nMonitoring the Effort\nUnderstand Metrics\nUse Google Analytics\nCreating Additional Content Marketing\nOnLine Magazines\nContent Placement\nPutting it all together:\nShooting for Free vs Shooting for Access.\nShould You Do Work For “Free”?\nWhat Is The Value of your work?\nDo Beginners Have to Start at “Cheaper” Prices?\nShooting for Growth.\nLive the 'Life'\nThe Wrap Up...

Understanding intimately who your ideal customers are and how THEY move throughout the buying journey is definitely the right starting point to unlock all sorts of answers.

As you follow me along, you will begin to understand how powerful customer journey mapping is and how it can help you make important decisions on your sales and marketing spend and activities.\nIn this course, I draw from my extensive practical experience to squeeze as much value as possible so that you can get inspired in your own business and consider to delve deeper.",

I took notes diligently\" - Theatreche Douardtoulouse\n\"I really enjoy this and it is very useful.\" - Dr. Rosselli\n\n\nThe sales presentation is the crucial part of the sale and you know it. No room for mistakes. No room for improvising and hoping. You need a solid system, don't you?\nYou do not need a good pitch, you need an outstanding pitch. In other words, your high school presentation skills won't get you anywhere near the level of buy-in you need from the prospect.\nIn this sales skills course, you are going to learn how to give a killer sales presentation using the power of stories, subconscious communication and cognitive biases for your 10x pitch.\nStorytelling is talked about a lot but few have mastered how to apply storytelling to deliver a great pitch. Taking this course, you will be one of the few who master this skill.\n\"The tools offered are very practical, something that you can actually apply when selling\" - Larissa R.\nTelling stories like a master, after having taken this course, you will not even have to \"sell\" to them, because they will want to buy. People hate to be sold to be sold to, but they love to buy. A great story thus makes a selling-situation into a buy-situation.\nStorytelling is a powerful technique underutilized by sales professionals today. However, with the right framing and understanding of psychology, a powerful story will make their limiting beliefs crack down and you will be able to persuade them of your idea, product or service. When you give a great sales presentation, you won't have to do much selling any more, because they want to buy.\nIn this sales skills course, you learn how to build your perfect pitch in 5 steps. Inspired by venture capitalists like Geoff Moore and Oren Klaff, blended by some of the best technique of the (in)famous Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort as well as other experts in the field such as Russell Brunson and Grant Cardone, the instructor has years of experiences in applying a combination of those techniques with maximum results. For the first time, he decided to teach this blend of powerful strategies to a larger group than his own sales people.\n\n\n\"Great course, very motivational and Stefan explains very interesting tips to try for be successful and take a step forward in sales.\" - J- Davidnoos\n\n\nDiving deep into the human mind, this course will also teach you\nHow to frame in an idea to create intrigue, scarcity and urgency\nHow not to be needy in the eyes of your prospects and instead flip the script and let them chase you\nHow to anticipate and overcome objections way ahead of time\nHow to pitch to their emotional side while at the same time giving them loads of numbers and making logically sense of your deal\nHow to create hot cognitions in your prospects brain, the ultimate sense-overflow in the prospect's mind that gets them to chase you\nThis sales skills course on focuses on the most important part of sales: the pitch, meaning the sales presentation - how to pitch to get your ideas fully across. It allows you to clearly frame your idea, product or service to get maximum venture capital. It focuses on the delivery of the pitch, what to say and how to say as well as how to structure your pitch, while giving loads of background what happens in the prospect's mind when you do so.\nStorytelling is the most under-used sales technique. This is why it is so powerful. Be one of the few who learns it now and become a great presenter and storyteller.\nFinally this offer even includes a 30-day full money back guarantee, so there is no risk at all but a huge upside...\n\n\n\"I would have made many common mistakes that this course has pointed out. Stefan has an excellent at teaching on how to be a better salesperson and really explains everything at a good speed using practical, understandable examples that make sense.\" Rodney. Doussot",

      "description": "★補足動画追加のお知らせ\n（2025年6月～）\n各セクションでの説明内容について、「講座シリーズ1」を収録した2021年時点と市場環境が若干異なるため、セクション2と3の最後のレクチャーに補足資料として追加の動画を入れてました。\nEC市場の現状をおさえてマーケティングを展開していきましょう！\n\n\n--\n●【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ1】について\n\n\n【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ1】は、ECの市場感、現場感、マーケティングの方向性など、ECにおける全体感をおさえることができる初級入門的な内容になっています。これからECに本格的に参入する事業者のみなさん、はじめてECの担当者になった人・チームのみなさんにぜひご確認いただきたい講座です！\n\n\n日本全体のビジネスにおいて、ECは成長産業という位置づけです。しかし、インターネットの特性上「トップの会社が総取り」するケースが多く、また参入障壁の低さから競争が激化しています。その中で大切になるのは、「なにでトップを取るのか」という考え方です。マスじゃなくていいんです。ニッチでトップを狙っても十分にビジネスになります！！\n\n\nまずはECの市場と「マーケティングの原理原則」を理解して、ECの海原に打って出ましょう！\n\n\n--\n◇主な講座の内容◇\n\n\n◆セクション2◆Eコマースの基礎知識\n\n\nみなさんECについてどれくらい知っていますか？EC事業を営んでいてもECの歴史については知らない方も多いかもしれません。私も知らなかったので、ECについていろいろと調べてみました！\nECというと「物販」のイメージが強いですが、昨今は物販以外のECもたくさん存在します。LINEスタンプなどはその最たるものですね。旅行の予約サイトも広義でいえばECです。とにかく、ECというビジネスを狭く考えない方がいいです。もしかしたら、「物販」ではないECでも成功するかもしれませんよ！\n\n\n◆セクション3◆Eコマースの市場環境の変化\n\n\nマクロでみればECは成長産業です。ただ、ミクロ（現場感）でみるとすべてのECサイトが同じように成長しているわけではありません。ECの需要と供給のバランスは2010年前後を境に大きく変化をしています。供給の伸びが、凄まじいんですよね！\nまた、インターネットは「トップが総取り」するビジネスモデルになりやすい傾向があります。この市場環境が今後逆転することはありえません。その中でいかにして市場に存在感を示していくか。ポイントは2つです！\n\n\n◆セクション4◆Eコマースの仕事（運営業務）\n\n\nECの仕事‥といっても、単に業務のことではなく「販売戦略」と「運営業務」のふたつの視点からECの仕事について説明をしていきます。運営業務を知る前に、「なぜその運営業務をやるのか？」のもとになっている販売戦略を知っておくことが重要です！このふたつは密接な関係があります。\n今回、販売戦略と運営業務について、「具体的になにを考えるか」「具体的になにを実践するか」を一覧化したワークシートをダウンロードで配布しています。自社でやっていること、やっていないことをチェックして、今後のEC運営の参考にしてください！\n\n\n◆セクション5◆Eコマース成功のポイント「差別性」\n\n\n実店舗とECのビジネスはその特性が180度異なります。実店舗は存在しているだけでお客様の目につき、来店をしてもらうことができます。しかし、ECサイトはたとえ存在していてもそのサイトがどこにあるのか、お客様からは見えません。存在しているだけでは、お客様にアクセスしてもらうことは不可能なのです！\n「ネットショップをつくればお客様がやってくる」この勘違いは実店舗をやっている事業者のみなさんが陥りがちな勘違いです。ECサイトは「お客様に探される」からこそ存在します。ポイントになるのは、「どうやって探されるか」です！これが「差別性」につながってきます。\n\n\n◆セクション6◆Eコマース成功のポイント「データ活用」\n\n\nECの面白さは「データ活用」にあります。日々のECの運営業務はすべて何かしらのカタチでデータにその結果が現れます。このデータから「次の改善施策」を判断することがポイントです。最初に決めたコンセプトでも、お客様の反応（＝データ）が悪ければ、後から変更してもいいのです。何度も挽回のチャンスがあるのがEコマースなのです！\nデータは結果です。そして結果があれば、その結果を生み出した要因があります。ECのマーケティングで着目すべきなのは、この「要因」です。データの変化から要因をキャッチし、今度はその要因を起こせないかを考えること、これこそがECのマーケティングの「絶対ルール」なのです！！！\n--\n\n\n●ECマーケティングリテラシー講座シリーズとは\n\n\nEコマース運営業務として「What（何を）」をおこなうか、はご存じの方が多いと思います。また、書籍やセミナーなどで具体的な成功事例の「How（どう）」を学ぶ機会も多いと思います。しかし成功事例の「How（どう）」は容易に真似できるものではありません。仮に真似できたとしても「次に何をおこなうか」の「How（どう）」は想像できないはずです。\n\n\nECマーケティングリテラシー講座は「How（どう）」の根拠となる「Why（なぜ）」を身につける講座です。「Why（なぜ）」を学ぶことによって「How（どう）」を無限に生み出す力をつけることができます！\n\n\n目指せECの内製化！「ECの内製化」とは「業務の内製化」ではなく「判断の内製化」なのです！\nこのコースはECを自社サイトで運営する人・チームもしくはショッピングモールで運営する人・チーム、販売する商材ジャンル・カテゴリに関わらない「原理原則」的な内容です。",

      "description": "Junte-se a mais de 100 mil alunos inscritos nos cursos de marketing da M2up aqui na Udemy.\nNesse curso você vai aprender a utilizar o neuromarketing para conectar-se com a essência do seu consumidor e criar ações e campanhas de marketing muito mais assertivas!\n\n\nCada vez mais as empresas estão investindo em Neuromarketing...\nComo é o processo de decisão de compra? Como funciona a mente humana nesse processo e como as marcas podem influenciar positivamente isso? Quais fatores impactam emocionalmente os consumidores fazendo com que eles escolham uma determinada marca ao invés de outra?\nSabemos hoje que 95% das tomadas de decisão diárias de um indivíduo são tomadas inconscientemente. O neuromarketing surge da necessidade de entender as verdadeiras motivações do consumidor - não basta apenas um gatilho para levar uma pessoa a uma decisão de compra. O cérebro funciona como um todo e várias coisas têm que estar em concordância para haver uma ação.\nEsse curso de neuromarketing pretende ajudar você a entender melhor como seu consumidor toma as decisões, assim, você aprenderá técnicas para posicionar sua marca de forma mais eficaz na cabeça dos consumidores.\n\n\nEntenda conceitos e técnicas de neuromarketing para diferenciar a sua marca dos seus concorrentes!\nO que é neuromarketing?\nComo funciona a mente humana na tomada de decisão;\nVieses cognitivos como truques da mente;\nTécnicas de neuromarketing (disposição de produtos, storytelling, design, psicologia das cores);\nMarketing sensorial;\nGatilhos mentais;\nCases que aplicam na prática;\nE MUITO MAIS!\n\n\nDê uma olhada em algumas avaliações que recebemos\n★★★★★ Bem esclarecedor e completo. Traz abordagens teóricas juntamente de práticas no dia a dia de marcas e empresas, categorizando e explicando com clareza cada etapa, termos e ações que podemos exercer em propagandas voltadas às campanhas e vendas de serviços ou produtos. Aborda também o uso de cores e suas relações dentro da publicidade; como os gatilhos influenciam na compra e venda; evidencia o trabalho na interação entre vendedores/empresários com seus consumidores e potenciais clientes. Adorei o curso! – Viviane Pires de Araujo\n★★★★★ SIMMM, ESTOU ADORANDO A DIDÁTICA E TAMBÉM MAIS SOBRE ESSA AREA MARAVILHOSA! - João Paulo de Oliveira Mendes\n★★★★★ Fácil e tranquilo até o momento Agradável, Fácil assimilação, ótima didática e excelente dicção Excelente, gostei muito do seu curso. Valeu muito as informações adquiridas. - Jorge Luiz Marques de Nobrega\n★★★★★ Sensacional, ótima didática e dinâmica, me interessei mais ainda pela área de Neuromarketing! - Jefferson Araujo\n★★★★★ Laura é top. O curso foi muito bom com uma didática super legal, envolvente e contagiante. Parabéns. - Alexandre Magno de Oliveira\n★★★★★ O conteúdo é maravilhoso e a professora é excelente! Estou adorando cada aula! - Daiana Costa Constantino\n\n\nCurso legendado por humanos\nNada de legendas automáticas! Esse curso foi totalmente legendado pela nossa equipe, em Português (Brasil), para facilitar a acessibilidade do conteúdo.\n\n\nOverview/resumo do curso\nO primeiro capítulo é mais teórico, vamos entender conceitos básicos de neuromarketing, para compreender bem esse campo de estudo que se origina da neurociência com o marketing e também vamos ver como funciona o cérebro humano.\nNo segundo capítulo vamos nos aprofundar mais na mente humana e compreender o processo de compra do consumidor, vendo como funciona o nosso cérebro na tomada de decisão - algo que é fundamental das marcas entenderem para serem assertivas e se conectarem emocionalmente com seu público. Para isso, vamos ir à fundo no conceito de dopamina (a famosa substância do prazer), vamos saber o que são neurônios-espelho e como aplicar no marketing e também entender a diferença entre o inconsciente e consciente para tomar uma decisão.\nEm seguida, vamos estudar o Efeito Priming e Halo - que são estímulos capazes de influenciar nosso comportamento com base em experiências vivenciadas. Você também vai aprender sobre vieses cognitivos e heurísticas e os truques que eles causam na mente (sendo alguns deles: viés da ancoragem, viés da aversão à perda, viés da confirmação, entre outros, e a aplicabilidade deles no marketing e dinâmica de compras).\nPara entrarmos nas técnicas de neuromarketing, vamos entender a base desse estudo: emoção, atenção e memória. A partir disso, vamos abordar o poder do storytelling, merchandising comercial e publicidade subliminar - entendendo esse conceito, aplicabilidade e alguns exemplos.\nDepois vamos entrar em um capítulo sobre Branding Sensorial, entendendo como as marcas podem explorar os 5 sentidos humanos para criarem ações, campanhas e ambientes que aumentam suas conexões e resultados com o público. Ainda aqui vamos conhecer alguns cases de empresas que souberam como utilizar o marketing sensorial para se destacar e as 10 principais regras do branding sensorial, que as marcas devem entender como aplicar nos seus negócios.\nApós isso vamos nos aprofundar na psicologia das cores, onde você vai ver que cada cor produz um efeito distinto nos seres humanos. De acordo com um estudo realizado por Satyendra Singh, com a Universidade de Winnepeg, 85% das decisões instantâneas relacionadas às compras são tomadas por influência das cores. Por isso, é essencial compreender como elas podem ser utilizadas. Para isso, vamos trazer os significado de diversas cores e exemplos da aplicação delas em marcas de segmentos variados.\nPara encerrar o curso, vamos falar sobre gatilhos mentais - que são muito poderosos quando falamos em marketing. Existem inúmeros gatilhos que estimulam as as decisões que nossos cérebro toma no piloto automático. Nesse capítulo, você vai conhecer alguns desses gatilhos, entender como funcionam e ver como aplicar na prática!\n\n\nAlém de todo o conhecimento incrível que você vai adquirir, você ainda ganha:\nAcesso vitalício ao curso e todas as suas atualizações\nSlides e todos os recursos adicionais usados no curso\nCertificado de conclusão online do curso\nMeu suporte personalizado e respostas as suas dúvidas\nGarantia de reembolso de até 30 dias\n\nBom, agora eu só posso dizer mal posso esperar para trocar experiências com você.\nAfinal, os consumidores já não compram produtos para satisfazer apenas as suas necessidades básicas, eles querem experiências e \"algo mais\" dos negócios. Assim, as marcas precisam se posicionar cada vez mais dentro do mundo emocionado e experiencial de seus consumidores.\nPor que esperar? Comece ainda hoje a sua trajetória de Neuromarketing, é só clicar no botão! :)",

      "description": "Wenn du ein erfolgreiches Business aufbauen möchtest, solltest du unbedingt die Macht der Werbepsychologie verstehen und nutzen, denn sie hilft dir dabei, die Bedürfnisse und Wünsche deiner Kunden besser zu verstehen und effektiv anzusprechen.\nDurch dieses Verständnis können gezieltere und personalisierte Marketingstrategien entwickelt werden, die die Kundenbindung erhöhen und die Akquisition neuer Kunden erleichtern. Klingt spannend?\nIn den nächsten 2,5 Stunden wirst du kompakt! und durch wissenschaftliche Studien gestützt, dein Wissen im Bereich Verkaufspsychologie, Werbepsychologie und Marketing erweitern und mit Hilfe von über 60 Effekten und psychologischen Prozessen, den Kunden besser verstehen. Egal ob junge Marke, etabliertes Unternehmen, aus einem privaten oder beruflichen Interesse – in diesem Kurs wirst du lernen mit nur kleinen Veränderungen große Wirkungen zu erzielen.\nDa der Kurs sehr kompakt aufgebaut ist, empfehle ich dir die für dich bedeutsamsten Effekte herauszuschreiben.\nDu wirst Begriffe wie Exposure, Reizwörter, Persuasives Design, Framing, Priming, Kognitive Dissonanz, den Praise Effekt, Decoy-Effekt und vieles mehr verstehen. Wieso handelt der Kunde so wie er handelt? Warum haben wir die Überzeugung, dass unsere Meinung richtig ist? Wie können wir die Psychologie im Marketing nutzen?\nIch werde dir aufzeigen worauf der Mensch reagiert und wieso das essentiell für eine erfolgreiche Marketing-Strategie ist. Wenn wir länger auf einen Reiz, in diesem Fall eine Werbung, schauen, desto besser verstehen wir sie und sind eher zu einem Kauf geneigt. Denn bevor Unternehmen überhaupt Produkte verkaufen können, müssen Sie erstmal die Aufmerksamkeit der Kunden bekommen und das ist gar nicht so einfach, wenn man bedenkt, dass 90% der Werbung, der du jeden Tag begegnest, gar nicht von dir wahrgenommen wird.\nUnser Gehirn ist sehr geübt darin, unwichtige Informationen zu ignorieren. Ich zeige dir, wie wir das Gehirn durch psychologische Tricks und Effekte dazu bringen, auf deine Werbung zu schauen und diese aktiv zu verarbeiten und auch sympathischer zu finden. Denn gute Werbung bringt Spaß, steigert die Verkaufszahlen und bleibt im Gedächtnis.",

He'll help you see that a presentation is a unique and powerful opportunity, a chance to be heard, a moment where you have the leverage to make something happen.\nIn this forty-minute course, you'll learn how to engage, how to seek enrollment and how to discover and integrate the worldview of your audience. This course will forever change how you give and consume presentations and might just save your organization from another ten thousand hours wasted watching useless bullet points fly by.\nThis short course is a radical rethinking of Powerpoint (or Keynote) and how you use a deck and a presentation to be heard.\nInstead of focusing on prettier slides, you'll learn how to use the leverage and attention you get as the presenter to understand the audience, enroll them in your journey and share your point of view.\nNOTE! I'm not going to try to teach you to operate the software. Instead, the course teaches you to avoid falling into the passive voice trap that's built deep into the design (and our expectations) of how people use Powerpoint.\nWe've all spent too much time watching (and giving) presentations that are boring, ineffective and irrelevant. It's time to change that.",

With the advent of technology and the widespread adoption of digital channels, modern marketing leverages various digital tools, platforms, and data-driven insights to create personalized and impactful customer experiences. It focuses on building relationships, fostering brand loyalty, and driving business growth in a highly competitive and digitally connected world.\n\n\nKey Characteristics and Components of Modern Marketing:\n\n\nDigital Transformation: Modern marketing is deeply rooted in digital transformation. It involves embracing digital technologies and platforms to connect with customers across multiple touchpoints such as websites, social media, mobile apps, email, and search engines. This shift allows businesses to reach a wider audience, collect valuable data, and deliver targeted and relevant content to enhance customer engagement.\n\n\nData-driven Decision Making: Modern marketing relies heavily on data-driven insights to make informed decisions. Through various analytics tools, businesses can collect and analyze customer data, including demographics, preferences, behaviors, and interactions. These insights help marketers understand their audience better, segment them into specific groups, and personalize marketing messages and offers for more effective and relevant communication.\n\n\nContent Marketing: Content is at the heart of modern marketing. Creating valuable, informative, and engaging content is essential for attracting, engaging, and retaining customers. Content marketing involves developing a content strategy that aligns with customer needs and interests, and delivering it through various channels such as blogs, videos, infographics, and social media. Modern marketing emphasizes the importance of creating content that educates, entertains, and adds value to the customer experience.\n\n\nCustomer-Centric Approach: Modern marketing revolves around understanding and prioritizing the needs and preferences of the customer. It focuses on building meaningful and long-lasting relationships with customers by delivering personalized experiences at every touchpoint. This involves implementing customer segmentation, targeted messaging, personalized offers, and proactive customer support. By putting the customer at the center of marketing efforts, businesses can create loyalty, advocacy, and sustainable growth.\n\n\nOmnichannel Marketing: Modern marketing recognizes the importance of delivering a seamless and consistent brand experience across multiple channels and devices. It integrates various marketing channels, both online and offline, to provide customers with a unified and cohesive journey. This includes integrating social media, email marketing, mobile apps, websites, and physical stores to create a holistic customer experience that transcends individual touchpoints.\n\n\nMarketing Automation: Automation plays a vital role in modern marketing. Marketing automation platforms and tools enable businesses to automate repetitive tasks, such as email campaigns, lead nurturing, social media scheduling, and data management. This automation allows marketers to focus on strategic activities, optimize processes, and deliver timely and relevant content to customers, resulting in improved efficiency and higher engagement.\n\n\nAgile and Iterative Approach: Modern marketing embraces an agile mindset, where marketers continuously test, learn, and iterate their strategies based on data and customer feedback. It involves setting clear objectives, measuring key performance indicators (KPIs), and adapting marketing tactics based on insights gained. This iterative approach allows businesses to optimize their marketing efforts, respond to market changes, and stay ahead of competitors.\n\n\nIn summary, modern marketing embraces digital transformation, data-driven decision making, customer-centricity, and agile strategies. It leverages technology, analytics, and personalized experiences to effectively engage customers and drive business growth. By understanding customer preferences, delivering valuable content, and utilizing automation, modern marketing enables businesses to build strong brand connections, foster customer loyalty, and thrive in the digital landscape.",

Tuttavia, nonostante l'inizio delle lezioni sia sempre molto semplice, si arriva anche a contenuti decisamente complessi ed avanzati, per cui si consiglia:\n- ai principianti di non correre nello studio\n- a chi possiede già competenze di saltare le parti introduttive e di concentrarsi sugli argomenti meno conosciuti\nSi parlerà di:\n- come realizzare un sito web performante\n- come ottimizzare la propria presenza su facebook, instagram, twitter, youtube\n- come realizzare campagne promozionali efficaci online\n- come gestire la presenza e le recensioni su tripadvisor\n- come definire un piano editoriale solido per creare dialogo con i propri clienti\n- come fare pubbliche relazioni e come gestire giornalisti, opinion leader e influencer\n- come gestire altri canali di marketing ( convenzioni aziendali, organizzazione eventi, groupon, educational, etc. )\n\n\nA differenza di un corso specifico su un singolo strumento, qui l'obiettivo è dare la conoscenza necessaria a scegliere per la PROPRIA attività i mezzi più efficaci, senza farsi trarre in inganno dalle sirene della moda del momento o dell'ultima tecnologia.\nIMPORTANTE: non si tratta di un corso generale riadatatto per il settore alberghiero ma di un corso concepito già in partenza per questo mondo, con una focalizzazione sulle strutture indipendenti. Questo nel rispetto del tempo che dedicherai all'apprendimento, per minimizzare i tempi, che visto il tuo lavoro sono ridotti al minimo.",

      "description": "--\n●【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ5】について\n\n\n【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ5】では、EC事業成長の本丸である「新規顧客獲得」についてお伝えしします！Eコマース事業者の悩みといえば「新規集客」ですが、はたしてセッション数が増えれば問題解決なのでしょうか？違いますよね。注文が入ってこそ悩みが解決します。\n\n\nつまり、本当の課題は「新規顧客獲得」なのです。問題は、「自社のネットショップを利用してくれる可能性がより高い」お客様へのアプローチができていないことなのです。そして、「新規顧客獲得」の課題は「新規集客」だけでは解決することができません。\n\n\n「新規顧客獲得」を実現するためには、自社の資産を活かさなければいけません。またECサイトで販売する商品の見直しも必要になります！講座ではEC事業を成長させるための「商品ページ別販売実績管理表」のつくり方をお伝えし、日々の実務から「新規顧客獲得」につながる「ヒット商品の芽」の探し方、育て方を学んでいきます！\n\n\n「新規顧客獲得」の考え方を学んで、効果的な「新規集客」と販促広告費の削減を目指しましょう！\n\n\n--\n◇主な講座の内容◇\n\n\n◆セクション2◆ECMJ式ECリテラシー講座とは\n\n\nEC事業を成長させるためになぜECリテラシーが必要になるのか、必要なECリテラシーを全体図と共に解説していきます。【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ】全般に収録されている内容ですので、場合によってはスキップして問題ありません！\n\n\n◆セクション3◆新規顧客獲得はECの永遠のテーマ\n\n\n「新規顧客獲得」を実現するには多角的なマーケティングの視点が必要になります。「新規顧客獲得」は「新規集客」ではありません！インターネット広告の活用やSNSの活用だけに留まりません。\n「新規顧客獲得」のためには「新規集客」だけではなく「顧客設定」や「商品企画」「データ活用」などの視点が必要になります。「新規顧客獲得」とは、つまり「EC戦略」のアプローチでもあるのです！\n\n\n◆セクション4◆資産と商品の可能性を知ろう\n\n\n「新規顧客獲得」のためには、まず自社の資産を最大限に活かすことが重要です。実店舗があれば実店舗からの送客、ブランドがあればブランド力を活かしてECサイトの「新規顧客」を増やしていきましょう。簡単にはお客様に伝わりません。しつこく徹底することが重要です！！\n次に商品です。残念ながらEC事業を展開しているほとんどの企業は商品に問題があります。「マーケティングが展開しやすい商品」ではないのです。でも大丈夫。商品を変えていけばいいんです。どのような視点から商品を見直すかをお伝えします！\n\n\n◆セクション5◆\"ヒット商品の芽\"を探し、育てよう\n\n\nEC事業を成長させるためには「ヒット商品」をつくることが大切です！ヒット商品が売上をつくり、ヒット商品が新しいお客様の呼び水になります。どのブランドも「ヒット商品」をつくることで、ブランド認知を高めてきました。「新規顧客獲得」のカギは「ヒット商品」が握っているわけです。\nでは、自社のネットショップの中に「ヒット商品」の可能性を秘めた「ヒット商品の芽」があるか。ここを探し出す具体的な方法をお伝えします！「ヒット商品の芽」は「ヒット商品」になるまで育てなければいけません。合わせて「育てる方法」もお伝えします。\n\n\n◆セクション6◆情報を活かして\"逆算のマーケティング\"を展開しよう\n\n\n「新規顧客獲得」のマーケティングは資産の活用、商品の見直し、「ヒット商品の芽」の育成という「積み重ね」の方法だけではありません。ECのマーケティングでは「逆算のマーケティング」を展開できるのが特徴です！つまり、「すでに出ている結果」から逆算して、マーケティングを展開するのです。\nその基になるのがデータ活用と情報管理です。このふたつを利用して、すでに発生しているニーズを顕在化させ、「新規顧客獲得」のマーケティングに活かしていきます。ネット広告やSNSなど、いわゆる「新規集客」アプローチも「逆算のマーケティング」を展開することで、その効率性が何倍も上がるはずです！！！\n\n\n--\n●ECマーケティングリテラシー講座シリーズとは\n\n\nEコマース運営業務として「What（何を）」をおこなうか、はご存じの方が多いと思います。また、書籍やセミナーなどで具体的な成功事例の「How（どう）」を学ぶ機会も多いと思います。しかし成功事例の「How（どう）」は容易に真似できるものではありません。仮に真似できたとしても「次に何をおこなうか」の「How（どう）」は想像できないはずです。\n\n\nECマーケティングリテラシー講座は「How（どう）」の根拠となる「Why（なぜ）」を身につける講座です。「Why（なぜ）」を学ぶことによって「How（どう）」を無限に生み出す力をつけることができます！\n\n\n目指せECの内製化！「ECの内製化」とは「業務の内製化」ではなく「判断の内製化」なのです！\nこのコースはECを自社サイトで運営する人・チームもしくはショッピングモールで運営する人・チーム、販売する商材ジャンル・カテゴリに関わらない「原理原則」的な内容です。\n\n--",

      "description": "Lead the reader on an imaginative journey to your “Order Now” button.\nOnce you’ve mastered copywriting fundamentals, such as creating a tempting offer, sprinkling in proof elements and always ending with a call to action, learn to cast a spell with words. Through unexpected metaphors, sensory detail, strategic teasing and 22 other often overlooked techniques, ignite readers’ curiosity, earn their trust and get them thinking, “Hmm, I want that.” (I used at least three advanced creative wording techniques in this paragraph. Can you name them?)\nThe Advanced Copywriting online course teaches you how to captivate with language so you confidently create distinctive, memorable promotions. Whether in headlines, on a home page, in tweets, in client newsletters or throughout long sales pages, your words can sparkle with originality, charm readers and tickle their desires.\nJust as importantly, the course describes where creative energy goes awry, so you avoid misdirecting, baffling or overtaxing your readers. You learn both principles and pitfalls with a whopping 239 examples from actual marketing copy. Through comments on these snippets from high-tech, small-business and consumer brands, you come to understand key do’s and don’ts. You experience the never-ending delight of choosing and arranging words.\n\n\nHow This Course is Different\nMy name is Marcia Yudkin, and using my decades of experience as a copywriter, author and marketing coach, I serve as your guide to the pizzazz of creative language. Compared with blogs and books on this topic, the Advanced Copywriting course has four points of distinction.\n\n\nPlain English explanations. Although many of the techniques discussed have roots in the rhetoric of ancient Greece, you won’t need to struggle with terms like “anaphora,” “catachresis” or “isocolon.”\n\n\nThorough coverage. You don’t learn only three or four methods to jazz up marketing writing. No less than 25 techniques take the stage in turns, each carefully explained and related to one another where appropriate. In addition, near the end of the course you have the opportunity to test your new understanding by rating 20 examples on your own and then comparing your assessments with my comments.\n\n\nExamples from marketing copy, not novels or poems. I spent two years collecting both excellent and awful examples for the course from marketers all over the Internet. In contrast, other teachers rely on quotes from the likes of John Steinbeck and Jane Austen, who don’t serve as realistic models for promoting phone apps, vacation rentals or sweaters. One widely admired expert told me she couldn’t possibly take the time to find marketing-related instances of the rhetorical tactics she often wrote about. But I did.\n\n\nHundreds of examples. Just a few examples aren’t enough for you to get the hang of applying the principles described. Instead, well over 200 short passages illustrate vividly what to do and not to do.\nTo my knowledge, no other copywriting expert offers such a broad range of advanced wordsmithing savvy in one course, book or website. No one!\n\n\nWhat You Learn\nExpect a discussion of well-known techniques like metaphors, comparisons, parallel structure, and rhymes. Yet Advanced Copywriting delves into much, much more, including:\n\n\nWhen exaggeration pleases and where it becomes hype that exploits and cheats the reader\nA technique from classic comedy you can use to delight readers and keep their attention\nHow to use the musical characteristics of language to imply softness or harshness, movement or indolence\nDo questions engage readers? Some do and some don’t – and how to know the difference\nInstances where rich, evocative description does wonders for sales, and less well-known ways to stimulate readers’ imaginations\nExactly how to determine whether a metaphor is mixed up or helpful\nWhy knowing your audience matters as much as vivid expression\nPutting the power of curiosity to work for you – not just in bullet points, as here, but also in headlines, product names and blog posts\nThe “dimensionalizing difference” that brings complex ideas into clearer focus\nA surprisingly underused ingredient that boosts credibility and makes your overall pitch stronger\nHow predictable old phrases can be resurrected with loads of new life\nWhy twos are perfect for some techniques while others call for threes\nAnd did you notice the prevalence of contrast in these bullet points? How you can harness the power of that element\nCriteria to use when tweaking and improving your next-to-final draft\nNot to mention examples, examples and more examples of it all\nClick on the preview videos to experience whether or not the material revs up your mental engines. After signing up, you go through the course whenever learning is convenient for you, and the course can serve as a reference indefinitely after that.\nWhy not dig in right now?",

      "description": "Completely Updated and Re-Recorded in 2022!\nThe entire course has been completely updated and re-recorded to ensure it's current and covers everything I believe is important to successfully market an independent coaching or consulting business.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAre you an independent Coach or Consultant who is just starting out in business?\nOr perhaps you've been in business for awhile but you're not attracting enough clients or making enough money?\nThere's a lot that goes into building a successful Coaching or Consulting business.\nIn this course, I'll teach you exactly what you need to KNOW and DO to successfully market yourself as an independent coach or consultant.\n\n\nHi, I'm Debbie LaChusa, and I've been in business on my own as an independent coach, consultant, and online teacher since 1998 - that's 24 years!\n\n\nWhen I started out I was probably a lot like you... I didn't have any experience running or marketing my own business. The one advantage I did have was that I had studied marketing in college and I'd spent 13 years working in the marketing industry. It was very different marketing my own business, but over time I figured out how to translate my corporate marketing experience into a process that worked for marketing my own business.\nIt worked so well I started coaching other coaches and consultants, and ultimately began teaching online.\n\n\nSince 1998, I've built and run a 6-figure consulting business, a 6-figure coaching business, and a 6-figure online course business.\n\n\nThis course is based on the same 4-step process I used to market my own businesses, and that I used for years with my one-on-one coaching clients.\nIt's a process that's been proven in the real world... has stood the test of time... and just plain works!\n\n\nIf you'd like to learn how to...\n\n\nPackage Your Services... so you can stop selling your time or creating spec proposals\nBrand Yourself and Your Business... so you stand out from everyone else who does what you do\nMarket Your Services... so you attract more of your ideal clients, more easily\nSell Your Services... in a way that doesn't feel like selling and works better than free coaching sessions\n\n\nThen this course is for you!\n\n\nIn this course I walk you through each of these 4 steps with...\n\n\nExtensive Virtual Coaching (including real world examples, stories, and instruction based on years of experience)\nWorksheets & Handouts (the same worksheets and handouts I used with my private clients)\nDemo Videos (to demonstrate how to do the technical work I teach in this course)\nSuggested Resources (to help you quickly implement what you're learning in this course)\n\n\nAll to help you apply my 4-step process to your coaching or consulting business.\nI've been teaching this content online for 9 years and more than 12,000 coaches and consultants have learned how to Package, Brand, Market, and Sell their services using my proven, proprietary process.\n\n\nCourse Content Updated and Completely Re-Recorded in 2022 - Here's What's Changed\nThis re-recording of the original course I created in 2013 includes changes based on my additional 9 years of online business experience. I've streamlined my 4-Step Package-Brand-Market-Sell Process, updated my recommendations on Branding, and added all new sections on Website Development and Adding Services/Diversifying.\n\n\nHere's what a few students in the original version of this course had to say...\n\"I took this course after her signature program course and it is already yielding gems. She is BRILLIANT, knows her stuff, actually understands the PSYCHOLOGY of her client and how important it is to create a business you like. As a serial entrepreneur, I can truly see her personal experience coming through in understanding that knowing her client is the way to craft a business they will be successful at because they love what they are doing...this is very different from many people selling marketing courses. Really happy I found her.\"\n\n\n\"After decades in the travel industry, the pandemic forced me to pivot and this course has been invaluable in realistically redefining my scope, branding, and marketing. If you are in the same boat or at the start of a new business, this course is a must! Simply follow the steps, complete them as you go along and you'll have an actionable business plan by the end of it. Good luck!\"\n\n\nBe sure to watch the Free Preview videos to get a better idea of my teaching style and what this course covers.\nI look forward to seeing you in class and helping you market your coaching or consulting business!",

I'm excited to see what the rest of the content will offer!\" Moriah\n★★★★★ \"Tamsin has done it again! As an aspiring copywriter, I was completely clueless about how to start my (new) career until I watched Tamsin's videos. She goes into the nitty-gritties of what is required to jumpstart a copywriting career. Her exercises forced me to tap into the unused parts of my brain to do some actual \"copywriting\" work, which I'm so grateful for, as it gave me a feel of the elbow grease I'd have to go through to build my career. Tamsin's encouragement is so valuable. It's almost like having a personal coach telling me what to do and not to give up. The rest is up to me - practice, thick skin, grit, research, hard work. Thank you, Tamsin, for the invaluable advice and tips you've shared with me.\" Brenda Chung\n★★★★★ \"I loved the writing prompts to begin creating my portfolio. This helped immensely and I was able to get 5 or 6 documents added! It really helped to motivate me to continue writing on a vast array of subjects. Thank you!\" Kristine Walker\n★★★★★ \"This course is truly amazing! I have recently moved into full-time copywriting and web development and needed a portfolio of work. Following Tam's lectures and writing has enabled me to do just that. When Tam says the copy templates the course provides are proven to work, she is not wrong! I used the one to approach my contacts and had a reply requesting my services from a large company CEO, within hours!!\"\n\n★★★★★ \"If you haven't taken Tam's other copywriting course, and are serious about copywriting, then you are missing out, I really recommend that course as well!\" David Kalcher\n★★★★★ \"For months now, I've been telling myself that I need to build a portfolio so I can start freelancing more seriously, but it just never got done. It felt like too big of a task to tackle, so instead, I distracted myself with more skill-building courses, and planning and re-planning my freelance business.\"\n\n★★★★★ \"The best thing about this course so far is that it cuts through all of the busywork and potential roadblocks, and really encourages students to do what matters. I love this. Building a copywriting portfolio has never felt so doable before.\" Tara Nelson\n★★★★★ It's got me writing! That has to be a good thing.

Definitely puts one's mind at ease about going on this new copywriting venture!\" Che\n★★★★★ \"I initially finished the Complete Copywriting Course, and this course is the perfect addition to take what Tamsin teaches there and put it into practice. By the end of the course (if you actually do the exercises) you'll come away with a body of work all ready to go.\" Dominic Frencken\n★★★★★ \"Tamrin was Awesome, she brought us along and had us put together 5 pieces for or portfolio- I think more feedback and assignments to have to turn in either with links or cut and paste to her would be helpful so she can review and help us further BUT as I start her full course I think I'll get just that! Also I would love to see a group with shared copy of students.....so please invite me if this is up or when you have it up! I so want to take my copywriting and make a business out of it and have it really help my blog flourish!\" Pamela Schmidlin\n★★★★★ \"I found this course to be exactly what I was looking for and exactly as described. As far as improvement goes, I would recommend just having some more example copy as part of building our own copy. Something that is similar to the examples we should be building, but not to similar.

My name’s Tamsin and I’ve taught over 5000 students on Udemy with my best-selling copywriting course.\nI’ve been writing marketing copy under various guises for 16 years.\nFor six of those, I've been running a successful copywriting business.

I no longer hated selling and I started closing more sales.\n\n\nIf you're currently selling your services using free coaching sessions, or you're giving away valuable advice in spec proposals, I'd like to invite you to learn a more effective way to sell your services, that does not feel like selling AND does not require you to give away your valuable time and expertise for free.\n\n\nThis course is for you if you're an independent coach or consultant and...\nYou hate sales, or you've never been taught how to sell\nYou're currently selling your services using free coaching sessions, or you're giving away valuable advice in spec proposals\nYou're tired of giving away your valuable time and expertise for free\nYou're struggling to convert prospects into paying clients\nYou're having a hard time finding potential clients to even make offers to\nYou dread the idea of cold-calling\nYou're tired of hearing prospects tell you, \"let me think about it and get back to you\" and then never hearing from them again\n\n\nWhat You'll Learn in this Course\nIn this course you will learn a simple, conversational, comfortable, 10-step sales process you can use in 30- to 60-minute Free Consultations with your prospects, to turn more of them into paying clients.\n\n\nSell More, More Comfortably, and at Higher Prices\nAs an independent marketing consultant and coach since 1998, I've been selling my own services for more than 20 years. I tried a lot of different things when I first started out. And I admit, at the beginning I was just kind of winging it.\nHowever, when I learned the how to sell the way I'm going to share with you in this course, selling not only became more comfortable, I sold a lot more coaching and consulting packages. And, I sold them at higher prices.\n\n\nWhen I dialed in my process to include the specific 10 steps I'm going to teach you, and I went out and tested the this 10-step process for the very first time, I sold $12K worth of private coaching in a little over a week.\nEven better, I knew exactly what I needed to do each month to keep generating that same income.\nWhile I can't promise you'll have the same result, what I can promise is that if you are currently giving away free advice in free coaching sessions or spec proposals as a way to sell your services, or you too are just kind of \"winging it\" when it comes to selling your services, this 10-step sales process will truly transform the way you sell, and your results.\n\n\nSo, if you find yourself wishing clients would just show up, so you don't have to pound the pavement or do cold-calling to find them… (Neither is required with this process!)\nOr, you're struggling to get clients to say yes…\nOr, you're tired of giving away free advice and sample coaching sessions and still not getting clients…\nI encourage you to enroll in this course.\n\n\nNot only will you learn how to sell your services, you'll receive:\nA step-by-step agenda and checklist you can use in every consultation you do, so you know exactly what to say and do to close more clients\n25 different ways you can get prospective clients to contact YOU and request a consultation (that means no cold-calling or pounding the pavement looking for clients!)\nA formula to help you determine exactly how many free consultations you need to do to generate the clients and income you want so you can get off the cash-flow roller-coaster and start earning reliable income month after month\nFill-in-the-blank worksheets to help you fine-tune your sales process, so the more consultations you do, the more you improve your closing ratio (that means you get to spend less time selling and more time working with clients)\n\n\nBe sure to watch the Course Introduction Video to learn more about what you'll learn in this course (it's free!)\nThen enroll in the course and start learning an easier, more comfortable, more effective way to sell your services so you can attract and begin working with all those people you got into business to help.\nSee you inside!\nDebbie LaChusa",

Thus the sales take place through self use as well as through the distributor who have been enrolled by the individual. In this case the distributor focuses on increasing the network of and recruiting other distributors rather than selling the product alone. Thus with extension of distributor network and the subsequent purchases as well as recruitment done by the chain the sponsor distributors earn rebates and commissions from the company.\nThe income generation happens when the distributors as well as in providing sales training and sales kit to the distributors who are the salesmen. The companies spend a lot of effort in training the sales distributors and teaching them the art of communication, of building and managing relationships as well as in providing them the product training and sales training. In this effort the companies use audio visual media, books as well as marcom materials extensively. Team meetings, conferences, seminars and membership to various achievers club are the main stream activities that help build the spirit and participation of the individual distributors.\nWhat attracts people to multi level marketing is the dream of earning millions as income without having to invest anything but one's effort and time and without having to sacrifice one's career or other priorities of life.",

Whichever metaphor you want to use, marketing has become about tactics, tools, and tricks... when it should be about creating a beautifully crafted, strategically thought-through journey. Both for you, and your customers.\nOne where \"less is more\". One where you have a sense of calm and have constructed pathways, stepping stones and marketing assets to help make it all happen.\nThis introductory course takes you on a journey... to teach you 'the journey'. How good is that?\nWe have created the idea of a \"Golden House of Enchantment\". This house is located beautifully on a wonderful small island. The island sits in a calm lake, surrounded by glistening water. And all around, stretching into the distance are hills.. and further away, great moutains.\nWe use the idea of water. The flow of your communication across the land to invite people to your golden house. And the flow of the customer down the mountains to visit your golden house. And then keeping those customers in your house as treasured guests.\nWe had a lot of fun putting this together for you.\nAnd we hope you enjoy this free course. It's incredibly powerful.\nBe sure to see our other courses on Udemy by checking out our instructor profile.\n\n\nAnd be sure to message us if you have any questions.\n\n\nBest of luck on your journey to marketing mastery.",

      "description": "--\n●【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ2】について\n\n\n【ECマーケリテラシー講座シリーズ2】では、「EC戦略づくり」「EC組織づくり」「EC運用づくり」のポイントを解説していきます！Eコマースのマーケティングおける先入観を正し、ある程度リソースが限られる中でいかにECを成長させるか、そのポイントを学んでいきます。\n\n\nこの講座の特徴は、ECにおける戦略・組織・運用づくりについて「現実的な課題」をベースにした解説をしていることです！例えば、組織の課題として「ECチームの評価」や「ECの担当者選び」があります。これは講師がEC事業のコンサルティングを経験する中で、実際に直面し課題解決をしてきたことです。\n\n\nECの「戦略づくり、組織づくり、運用づくり」における要点を学んで、着実にEC事業を成長させていきましょう！\n\n\n--\n◇主な講座の内容◇\n\n\n◆STEP1◆Eコマースのよくある勘違い\n\n\n「ECサイトを立ち上げたら勝手にお客様がやってくる」。「完璧なECサイトをつくってEC事業をスタートしなければいけない」。こんな先入観をもっていたりしませんか？\nEC事業をスタートする前に「イメージしがち」な先入観をまずは見直してみましょう。EC事業は「小さくスタートして、大きく育てる」。これがポイントです！\n\n\n◆STEP2◆Eコマースの戦略を立てる\n\n\nECは「後からでも変えられる」ことが強みですが、それでも「ポジショニング」を理解していれば、最初の一歩目を有利に展開することができます。ネットショップの「商品」と「差別性」、この2つの観点から学んでいきましょう！\nまたEC事業を成長させるためにはネットショップの「勝ち筋」をいかに見出すかが大きなポイントになります。1商品、ヒット商品が出れば状況のすべてが一瞬にして変わります。「事業の成長ライン」と「運用コスト」の関係を学びましょう！ECは「ゼロ→イチ」がもっとも難しく、「1→100」はそこまで難しくはありません。\n\n\n◆STEP3◆Eコマースの組織をつくる\n\n\n日本の90％以上の企業が「既存事業と並行してECに販路を広げる」会社です。既存事業がある中でEC事業を展開する場合、組織を形成するにあたって「落とし穴」になりえる課題がいくつかあります！\n「目標設定（ECの目標がない会社が多い）」「EC担当者（上長もわからないので放り投げ状態）」「評価（他部門と売上実績の取り合いになる）」、講座で取り上げているこれらの課題はすべて講師が実際のコンサルティングの現場で経験をしてきたことです。「組織のリアルな課題」を押さえておきましょう！\n\n\n◆STEP4◆Eコマースの販売チャネルを検討する\n\n\n「売上の新しい柱」としてECに販路を広げる際、ひとつの課題になるのが「自社サイトとショッピングモール」のどちらを選択するか、です。現実的には「自社サイトもショッピングモールも多店舗展開で」というブランドも多く「どちらかでなければいけない」ことはありません！\nただ、EC事業の序盤は運用リソースが少なく資源を集中させる必要があります。自社サイトとショッピングモールのメリットとデメリットを理解した上で販売チャネルの選択をおこないましょう！\n\n\n◆STEP5◆Eコマースの運用業務をつくる\n\n\nECについて理解した（勘違いを見直した）、EC戦略を立てた、ECチームを組織した、販売チャネルを検討しネットショップを立ち上げた‥、EC事業の成功のカギをにぎるのはこの後です。つまり運用です。運用無くしてEC事業の成長はありません！しかし、ECの運用業務に詰まって「本当は売れるのにもったいない」状態になっている会社が多数。。\nまさに講師が日々直面し解決している課題こそ、この運用です。運用業務がうまく回らないのはけっして「ノウハウがないから」ではありません。ノウハウはネット・書籍・セミナーなど様々なところに転がっています。本質的な課題は「取り組み方」なのです。この講座における「運用づくり」は、「取り組み方づくり」です。本質的な課題を徹底的に叩きましょう！！！\n\n\n--\n●ECマーケティングリテラシー講座シリーズとは\n\n\nEコマース運営業務として「What（何を）」をおこなうか、はご存じの方が多いと思います。また、書籍やセミナーなどで具体的な成功事例の「How（どう）」を学ぶ機会も多いと思います。しかし成功事例の「How（どう）」は容易に真似できるものではありません。仮に真似できたとしても「次に何をおこなうか」の「How（どう）」は想像できないはずです。\n\n\nECマーケティングリテラシー講座は「How（どう）」の根拠となる「Why（なぜ）」を身につける講座です。「Why（なぜ）」を学ぶことによって「How（どう）」を無限に生み出す力をつけることができます！\n\n\n目指せECの内製化！「ECの内製化」とは「業務の内製化」ではなく「判断の内製化」なのです！\nこのコースはECを自社サイトで運営する人・チームもしくはショッピングモールで運営する人・チーム、販売する商材ジャンル・カテゴリに関わらない「原理原則」的な内容です。\n\n\n--",
