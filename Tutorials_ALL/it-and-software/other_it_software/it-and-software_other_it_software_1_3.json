Homer software will then perform optimization on our model to minimize the net present cost of the system.\nIn this course, I tried to explain all you need for designing your system and technically and economically assessment of it using Homer software for the first time on the Udemy website.\nWhat you will learn in this course:\nThe basic technical and economic concepts of integration of renewable energy systems\nHomer Software interface\nHow to calculate required parameters\nImport data to and export the results from Homer\nSeveral real projects (Hands-on Homer)\nFinal evaluation of the results\nThis course is not theory and will give you this opportunity to learn to design energy systems as fast as possible by hands-on projects.\nI am so excited to start this course with you and ready to answer all your questions in the comments.\nSee you!\nN-Sh",

You can use Phone System to replace your current PBX system with a set of services that are directly provided by Microsoft 365.\nInternal calls within your company are handled only within the Phone System and never across the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), eliminating the need for long-distance charges.\nThe phone system offers add-on options for connecting to the PSTN in order to place external calls.\nYou can link a supported, customer-provided Session Border Controller (SBC) to a phone system using Direct Routing.\nUsing this feature, you can set up on-premises Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connectivity with the Microsoft Teams client.\nIn this course, students will learn to configure the Microsoft Phone system by following hands-on labs as demonstrated in the course. The course teaches all the advanced features offered by Microsoft Teams Enterprise Voice.\nAll lab exercises use the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform. Students will be able to configure the phone system direct routing step by step by installing MS Teams-certified SBC and trunking with Asterisk PBX for the demonstration.",

      "description": "This course builds upon the skills learned in the first course in this series DAX Power Pivot – 10 Easy Steps for Beginners.\nYou have already gotten your hands dirty with DAX & Power Pivot and seen how awesome it is. Now you are ready to take your skills to the next level by delving deeper and acquiring a more thorough understanding of how Power Pivot handles Time data.\nData Analysis Expressions (DAX) includes Time Intelligence functions to support the needs of Business Intelligence analysis by enabling you to manipulate data using time periods, including days, months, quarters, and years, and then build and compare calculations over those periods.\nHere's what others had to say about the course:\n\"So far it's been easy to follow. The instructor is doing a great job of explaining what she is doing. Looking forward to more advanced topics. UPDATE: I've completed the course. It's a great course and I'm glad I took this one, as well as DAX Power Pivot 10 Easy Steps for Beginners. I'll be referencing the material often, there's a lot on information that's new to me. I really want to dive more into custom calendars and DAX patterns. I've already been showing my managers at work how powerful DAX functions can be. Gilly Dow did a fantastic job with both of her courses I took on Udemy. She's very knowledgeable on Excel and Power Pivot topics and her enthusiasm and encouragement always shows in her lectures. She is very responsive to queries from her students; my questions were answered very quickly. I've taken other online courses where you never heard back if you were having problems; that's definitely not an issue here.\"\n- John Pertell\n\"Outstanding. It’s explained clear concise wonderful examples that are broken down and clearly explained fantastic course great teacher and teaching style. Highly recommend\"\n- Stephen Davanzo\n\"Highly recommended course! For every single function mentioned in the course there are an example and practice exercise. Great!\"\n- Elbina Rizakhanova\nWhat You'll Learn:\nThe first part of the course concentrates on DAX time-ready functions ideal for a standard calendar – the kind you hang on your wall. So, if that’s how you roll at work – this is perfect for you.\nThe second half raises the stakes and you will learn how to manipulate DAX to generate your own custom functions to work with 4-4-5 calendars used in many different industries including retail.\n\nIn order to do this, I’ll introduce you to some new DAX functions that will elevate your skills enabling you to build custom functions for those pesky non-standard calendars.\nEven if this doesn’t fit your remit – DO IT ANYWAY! Your level of understanding will increase leaps and bounds and your confidence will soarrrrr!!! Plus, it’s GREAT fun and you’ll learn heaps along the way!\nWhat you will learn in this course:\nPerforming Date Calculations in DAX with a Standard Calendar\nBuilding a standard Calendar table\nRunning Totals with: Month-to-Date (MTD), Quarter-to-Date (QTD) and Year-to-Date (YTD)\nComputing the moving annual total for Fiscal Year Ends\nAggregating and Comparing Growth %’s over time\nTime intelligence with CALCULATE()\nComputing periods from the Prior Year\nClosing Balance, First Date, Last Date, End of Month and Start of Year\nComputing values Between Dates\nPerforming Date Calculations in DAX with a 4-4-5 Calendar\nBuilding a custom Calendar table\nWorking with multiple Calendar tables\nManipulating DAX Patterns\nCustom Time intelligence with CALCULATE()\nCustom Time intelligence with CALCULATE(), FILTER() and ALL()\nAggregating and Comparing Growth %’s over time\nWill it be easy? Yes and no – the first half of the course – the DAX “time-ready” functions are intuitive and straightforward.\nThe custom Time Intelligence functions you create can be challenging but with my guidance and your growing understanding it will be really, really satisfying - trust me!\nThanks for taking the time to check out my course. I can't wait to help you take the next step in developing your DAX & Power Pivot skills. I have used Excel 2016 to demonstrate this fantastic tool but you can follow along in Excel 2010 & 2013 - I'll do my best to point out the differences. If you have any questions about the course, feel free to message me here or check out the FREE preview lectures to learn more.\nTake the first steps to a new and rewarding future by clicking on the TAKE THIS COURSE button, located on the top right corner of the page.\nI look forward to seeing you on the inside!",

This allows the programmers to allocate memory and manipulate it at runtime. That is why C++ is still a favorite language for high performance applications in various domains such as gaming, telecom, finance, aerospace, etc.\nHowever, it requires programmers to take great care while using dynamic memory, such as releasing acquired memory, taking care not to overstep memory boundary, etc. Otherwise, it could lead to problems such as dangling pointers, memory corruption, memory leaks, etc.\nThis course will help you overcome all these problem by leveraging the excellent features that Visual Studio provides. It has a rich set of functions provided by the C/C++ runtime heap library. These functions can help detect memory leaks, overflows, etc. You'll learn how to use these functions effectively and make your programs bug-free.\nIn this course, you'll start with the basics of heap memory management and understand C & C++ allocation functions/operators in depth. You'll also learn how to effectively use them to avoid memory problems. Afterwards, you'll learn about the Visual Studio heap library functions and understand how to use them in your code.\nBy the end of this course, you'll have a deep understanding of dynamic memory management. You'll be able to use CRT heap functions effectively to detect & isolate memory problems. You'll also implement the Visual Studio functions so that they can be used with any C++ compiler.\nNote:This course requires Visual Studio 2017 or a higher version.",

We will start customizing our shell (with aliases, functions, variables, etc.) and replace built-in tools with projects from the open source community that improve our shell experience. Each step we take will be tied back into the larger Dotfiles concept and recorded in our repository.\nThis subject is big and I have many more hours of content that I'd like to create. In addition to what's currently available, I'm hoping to make two more installments; Part 2 would be about ZSH and Part 3 would be where we put it all together by restoring our setup on a new OS.

In this course, you will understand and learn how to generate and sign a Json Web Token with a refresh token that users can use to securely access your RESTful application.\nThis course teaches how to use JWT (JSON Web Token) to embed users' roles and permissions to delegate user's authorization(what they can and can't do) in the application. This course also dives into defining and creating API, exposing API Endpoints over HTTP, and  handling HTTP Requests and File Upload through API Endpoints. It covers testing API Endpoints (using an HTTP client - Postman).\nThis course is short and focuses only on the generation of a JSON web token with a refresh token, and shows how you can use the refresh token to generate a new access token for a user. If you would like to learn more and build a full stack application and see how of this in practice, and way much more, please refer to my other course on Udemy, JSON Web Token (JWT) with Spring Security And Angular",

This is a practical workshop where you will learn how to replicate Oracle12c databases using Oracle GoldenGate12c by building your own replication environment. The course will give you the basics and the step by step practices to reproduce, in your virtual machines, a feel like production environment where you will replicate a database schema keeping it in sync with the source database.\nIn the course you will be guided step by step to set up and verify all steps in the Oracle GoldenGate12c installation and configuration, by using VirtualBox virtual machines with a pre-built Oracle12c multitenant database ready to use. You will start up in your laptop or PC two virtual machines with OraLinux servers and you will practice all the exercises in a total real environment.\nSo, even the workshop is based on OraLinux and Oracle12c multitenant, the replication theory would be valid for any supported environment you want to replicate: SQLServer through an Oracle server, or an Oracle Server to a DB2, etc. and including different versions like replicating data from an old Oracle11g to a Oracle12c with or without multitenant.\nThe course is divided into three main sections:\n1.- Laboratory installation, which will include detailed instructions to install and set up: Oracle VirtualBox, two virtual machines with OraLinux, each Oracle database server for GoldenGate, The installation and configuration of Oracle GoldenGate12c and a sample schema.\n2.- Basic replication, using the same database as source and target, for a single table.\n3.- Advanced replication, using the two servers to propagate all transactions from the source database to the target database at schema level (all tables and sequences). You woulc use this method to perform a database version upgrade to a new database release, having two environments in sync, and doing the upgrade by just stopping the source environment and starting the target database to the users. This is often called \"upgrade with almost zero downtime\", and it's one of the most valuable upgrading procedures when it comes to upgrade critical servers.\nIn other words, you will learn how to build a new replicated environment you may use as reporting database, or quality assurance test servers where you may test live your \"go to production\" procedures, or using it as a DR (disaster recovery) database copy ready to use in production in a severe lost of the main database, with all up to date transactions!.\nAnd so, you will find lots of chapters with important information about the Oracle GoldenGate funcionality and the particular considerations about Oracle database at administration level, such as setting up the supplemental login, how to manage multitenant Oracle12c database, important aspects about the logging files and transactional processing, or how to copy a schema consistent to a point in time to create an identical target based on a SCN.\nThe course also includes quizzes, checks, scripts, dictionary of terms and concepts, and basic troubleshooting guide it may be useful in your daily work. It's a complete guide and workshop with a practical laboratory you may use and keep for further tests and checks.",

      "description": "*UPDATE: Added section on Phoenix LiveView*\n\nTo become a professional level programmer, you need to learn different types of languages: Everyone knows Object Oriented Programming but few people realize they need to learn a Functional Programming language that scales well in distributed computing! Elixir is one such language. It’s a fairly young language but has gained immense popularity in the past couple of years — It’s the language of the future. Learning Elixir and its web framework Phoenix means you will be set for this high-demand job skill for the near future.\nIn this course, we will start from scratch with Elixir and then move on to Phoenix -- the next generation web framework that is set to replace a lot of deployments of Ruby, Django, PHP and even Node. The course assumes that you’ve had some basic programming experience before. If you know a bit of Python (just the basics: if, while, for, lists, dictionaries and tuples) or Java, you’d be all set.\nThis is a very applied course, so we will explain everything through the commands/code and not bore you with dull slides. In fact, there isn't a single slide in this course!\nIn this course, we aim to give you the feel of the rhythm behind Elixir and Phoenix so that you are in the position to understand the philosophy behind it and use it to your advantage. Through this approach, we can cover the whole spectrum in less than ?? hours. We will quickly cover the fundamentals of the Elixir language (but not go into those concepts which are never used). Similarly, we will cover different aspects of Phoenix (see detailed outlines below for specifics) in a way that is both quick and efficient instead of spending many hours explaining simple concepts.\nRemember: The reason you pay for this course is support. I reply within the day. See any of my course reviews for proof of that. So make sure you post any questions you have or any problems you face. I want all my students to finish this course. Let’s get through this together.",

In this course, you'll learn Python from the very basics to advanced concepts. This course is a part of Data Engineering, and you can also explore Linux and Spark/Databricks in upcoming courses.\nPython is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax is easy to learn and understand. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python has a comprehensive standard library and is often described as a \"batteries included\" language.\nGuido van Rossum created Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, and it was first released in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued in version 2.7.18 in 2020.\n\n\nThis Python course covers the following topics in detail:\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Fundamentals - Learn about variables, data types, operators, and expressions.\nOperators - Explore arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.\nInput and Output Statements - Learn how to take input from the user and display output on the screen.\nFlow Control - Learn about conditional statements and loops.\nPattern Applications for Logic Building - Learn how to build patterns using loops and conditional statements.\nStrings - Explore string operations such as slicing, concatenation, and formatting.\nString Programming Questions for Logic Building - Solve programming questions related to strings.\nList Data Structure - Learn about the list data structure and its methods.\nTuple Data Structure - Explore the tuple data structure and its methods.\nSet Data Structure - Learn about the set data structure and its methods.\nDictionary Data Structure - Explore the dictionary data structure and its methods.\nFunctions - Learn how to define and call functions.\nModules - Explore modules and how to import them into your Python program.\nPackages - Learn how to create and use packages in Python.\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOPs) - Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.\nException Handling - Learn how to handle errors and exceptions in your Python program.\nLogging Module - Learn how to use the logging module to log events in your Python program.\nAssertions - Learn how to use assertions to check conditions in your Python program.\nFile Handling - Learn how to read from and write to files in Python.\nObject Serialization by using PICKLE, JSON, and YAML - Learn how to serialize Python objects using these popular formats.\nDecorators - Explore decorators and how to use them to modify the behavior of functions.\nGenerators - Learn how to create and use generators to generate sequences of values.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Python course on Udemy is a comprehensive course that covers all the important topics related to Python. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of Python programming and be able to build your own Python programs. So, why wait? Enroll in the course today and start your journey toward becoming a Python programmer.",

      "description": "This Jira & Confluence Masterclass is the only course you need to get up to speed with Atlassians powerful project management tool Jira.\n\n\nPicture this: you're sitting across from your manager, confidently fielding every question with a single click. Why? Because you've built a powerful, insightful dashboard that provides crystal-clear transparency into your project, making you the go-to expert in the room.\n\n\nThis is the only course you will need to master Jira & Confluence for agile and non-agile projects and teams!\n\n\n\"A fool with a tool is still a fool!\"\nWe´ve all heard this phrase before and that´s why this course does not focus on teaching every single feature of Jira, but on teaching what really matters to get your team, project or product a head start and help you succeed in your work or career.\n\n\nWHAT JIRA CAN DO FOR YOU\nbeing proficient in Jira can help you in getting...\na new or better job\na raise or promotion\na new exciting task or project\nyour team or project successfully across the finish line\na big privat project organized (like a wedding)\nor simply make you an even more valuable asset of your team and company\n\n\nWHY TAKE EXACTLY THIS COURSE?\nI know. There are already a few great Jira courses out there and some of them have already thousands of students.\n\n\nThe reason is simple. I´m not an Atlassian Consultant. I´m a project manager. I´m a user.\nThat´s what i know. That´s what i teach. I teach what moves you forward, not everything the system is capable of.\nTherefore, this course is not for those who want to become a Jira-Admin.\n\n\nIn recent years, as a project and portfolio manager, I have repeatedly witnessed colleagues and friends being thrown into new projects or project management roles overnight.\nIn these moments, you’re expected to quickly learn new skills and rise to the challenge, but some of my colleagues  struggled to find their footing in the new role and didn´t know how to organize their new tasks. The complexity and challenges left them feeling overwhelmed, drained, and unable to enjoy their new roles.\nWe all want to succeed and take the next step in our career, but without a little help it can be a daunting task.\n\n\nI´m here to help. I created this course because I couldn’t find a comprehensive course that, from the perspective of a practitioner and project manager, covered the specific use cases my colleagues and I needed back then.\n\n\n\n\nONLY THIS COURSE PROVIDES...\n\n\ninsights on the latest version of Jira Software Cloud | Even including the brand new Jira sidebar!\nmore content than comparable courses, but remains focussed on the key issues\nfun and great food for thought: additional articles, comics, opinions and links to inspiring content that goes beyond Jira´s features\nbetter downloads and One-Pagers for you to use as quick-reference while setting up your own project or talking to colleagues\na carefully designed curriculum with introductions, wrap-up´s and quizzes to ensure that you remember what really matters\na naturally designed course structure that is easy to follow along with your own project\nreal-life examples from an experienced project manager and Jira user\nno BS or babbling around. Concise content that helps you succeed (i´m german, we get straight to the point ;-))\nabilitiy to learn according to your own schedule by providing short videos that tackle a single topic at a time\nvarious ways of testing what you´ve learned: Quizzes, Assignments with easy and more difficult options for you to choose and short and concise Wrap-Up´s of each chapter\nSupport - I´ll do my best to answer any question you might have\nOnly with this course you´ll get actionable advice on important functionalities and features combined with a free and powerful workbook, as well as links to inspiring additional content.\n\n\n\n\nMY MISSION:\nProject-based work is becoming more important every day, and I’ve seen how people like you can suddenly find themselves thrown into challenging project responsibilities overnight. My mission is to make project management knowledge accessible to everyone.\n\n\nFor this course my goal is not only to help you master Jira, but also to make you understand how you can apply Jira in your daily business\n\n\n\n\nAT THE END OF THE COURSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO:\n\n\nsetup a Jira project and a Confluence Workspace for your team or company\napply all important features of Jira & Confluence\ncreate customized workflows, issues and screens\nunderstand and create reports and dashboards\ncombine Jira & Confluence in an professional manner and to...\nknow several Apps that will enhance your Jira experience\nutilize powerful Confluence elements like page property reports\nunderstand methods and techniques like work-in-progress-limits, issue-hierarchies and more to use Jira to great effect in your job\n\n\n\n\nIN THIS COURSE YOU WILL LEARN...\n\n\nHOW to use Jira as a Project Manager or Team Lead\nWHAT you can achieve with specific features and how to apply them to real-life situations\nWHY it helps managing your project or team professionally\n\n\n\n\nYOU ARE IN CONTROL\nYou decide whether to complete easy or more difficult tasks in each chapter\nYou decide where to start the course after the initial introduction\nYou want the full experience of this course? Start at the very beginning!\nYou are already familiar with agile concepts & Jira and the Atlassian Marketplace? Skip ahed to chapter 4\nYou already know the basic concepts of Jira and want to learn more in-depth functionalities? Skip ahead to chapter 5\n\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURE OF THE COURSE\nJira & Confluence Masterclass for Users | Introduction and Downloads\nDownload the course workbook, set up your own Jira account and learn what i wish i knew before starting my first Jira project\nUnderstanding Jira Products | Jira and the Atlassian Marketplace\nLearn more about different Jira, Jira products and where to find addons and plugins that might help you later on.\nImportant Terms and Concepts | A Brief Recap on Scrum, Kanban and Jira Terms\nUnderstand the differences between Scrum and Kanban and learn some important Jira terms that we need for the rest of this course\nFirst Steps Working with Jira | Start Using Jira and Understand Basic Principles\nLearn how to invite team members, create your very own Epics, Stories, Tasks and Bugs and learn how Versions can help to organize your project or product development\nWork More Efficiently | Jira Boards and Timelines\nUnderstand the differences between Scrum and Kanban Boards in Jira, how to configure them for your needs\nStay in Control | Learn How to Apply Filters, Automations and Create Dashboards\nLearn how to keep an overview an all your issues by applying filters (incl. advanced Jira Query Language (JQL) filters), how to design automations for repetitive tasks and how to create dashboards and reports for more transparency and control\nBecome an Expert | Advanced Features for Customized Jira Processes and Workflows\nMake it your tailored project: Create custom workflows, issue types, screens and manage notifications in Jira\nConfluence\nIntegrate Confluence into your Jira project and learn how to use powerful elements to analyze and show Jira data on Confluence pages. Learn how to create Statusreports or similar project management related pages in Jira data in Confluence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWithin the last 13 years of my project management career i´ve learned that it´s never about the tool, but always about the project or product and the people who work with it. In my eyes it´s crucial to understand why you want to use a tool in the first place and than use the right features to get there.\nThat´s why i´m teaching from a project management perspective, focussing on what i believe really helps you to get your project or product across the finish line.\nI won´t focus on teaching each and every functionality of Jira, but on teaching what i believe is really useful to you.\nThat´s why i´ll do my best providing real-life examples and explanations, that will put Jira´s features into a real-life context.\n\n\nEnroll now! See you soon on the other side!\nNiels",

We often use arrays and structures in BigQuery and this course will teach you how to work with arrays, querying and unnesting arrays, using array functions as well as working with structures and arrays of structures.\nSQL functions are foundational building blocks for data analytics work and it is important to know the functions available in BigQuery to rapidly and effectively analyze data. In this course, we will learn about a range of SQL functions for:\n\nMath and statistics\nAggregate functions\nData type casting\nDates and times\nString manipulation\nRegular expressions\nApproximate functions for working with large datasets\nAnalytical and window functions\nData analysts need to be familiar with BigQuery operations so the course also covers BigQuery security, including access controls, column security, and row-level security, as well as performance and cost management.\nTest your understanding of BigQuery concepts with 8 assignments and 10 quizzes.\nIn this course, you will learn a wide range of topics that data analysts need to understand and you will know how to apply that knowledge effectively in BigQuery while working cost-effectively.\nAfter completing this course you will know a wide range of functions and techniques for analyzing and transforming data in BigQuery, understand how access to data is controlled using IAM, row-level, and column security, and how to control the cost of your BigQuery operations.",

      "description": "Learn Helm Charts with hands-on exercises\nThis course includes both Helm Unit Test exercises to teach Helm template programming and deployment exercises with a live Kubernetes cluster. Helm is often described as the package manager for Kubernetes, but it also includes its own custom template language. Not only will you learn how to manage Helm applications on Kubernetes, you will also learn how to use the template language step-by-step. By the end of the course, you'll have the confidence and skills you need to use Helm to manage your Kubernetes applications with ease. Whether you're a beginner just starting with Kubernetes or an experienced developer looking to level up your skills, this course will give you a solid foundation in using Helm to manage your applications.\n\n\nStart from the basics\nFor this course, you will learn how to use Helm starting with the basic concepts. We start with the parts of a Helm chart, and how the parts relate to each other. Helm charts have a lot of parts, but this course steps through each one so that you will have a strong foundation for the rest of the course. You will also learn why Helm is such a huge advantage for you when you manage Kubernetes applications.\n\n\nEssential Command Line\nIn this course, you will learn about the Helm application lifecycle and the essential CLI commands to install, configure, update, debug, and retire your application. Kubernetes has a command line tool, kubectl, that doesn't support Helm functionality. The Kubernetes command line provides a lot of tools to help you interact with a Kubernetes cluster. However, kubectl and manual resource definition management can be hard to work with as your applications grow larger and change over time. For that reason, Helm uses a completely different command line utility to manage Helm Charts. In this course you can learn the commands you need to manage your application using the Helm method.\n\n\nRemote Repositories\nIn today's distributed computing environment, you will need to work with chart repositories hosted on a remote server. In Helm, you can serve charts over the network through something called a Chart Repository. In this course, you will learn about the user commands you need to interact with both public and private chart repositories. You will also learn the structure of the Helm Chart repository so you know how remote repositories work in the Helm ecosystem.\nLearn Helm Chart programming step by step\nAfter the CLI, the course goes through the different data types and functions you will need to program a Helm chart. Helm has a lot of the same types as other programming languages, but everything is done a little differently in Helm chart templates. This course will teach you how to interact with all of the Helm types the Helm way.\n\n\nLearn valuable Kubernetes skills\nKubernetes is growing quickly, and many Fortune 500 companies use Kubernetes and Helm. Kubernetes allows these huge companies to scale their business effectively and provide great 24/7 service for their users. Having Helm on your resume can help you when interviewing with these companies.\n\n\nLearn Helm Chart Writing with Unit Test Exercises\nHelm chart programming is programming, even though it doesn't look exactly like Python or JavaScript. Automated testing can help you guarantee that your charts continue to work after you make changes. You get the same types of benefits with unit testing in Helm charts as you do with other programming languages. This course provides hands-on unit test exercises so that you will be ready to write your own Helm charts and unit tests with confidence.\n\n\nAppendix Examples\nHelm has a lot of functions, which can be intimidating when you are trying to learn Helm templates. The appendix section is full of examples for the many helm functions available to you as a user. This section of the course shows running example Helm templates that you can adapt to fit your own use case. The example Helm templates are included in the Git repository for the course. This section covers important topics like encryption, certificates, and password generation. You will also get examples for common utilities such as base 64, checksums, URL parsing, semantic versions, and file path handling.\n\n\nCustom Resource Definitions\nCRDs, or custom resource definitions, allow you to extend to Kubernetes API and provide more functionality to software running on your cluster. Many third party tools such as service meshes and CI/CD tools use CRDs to empower developers to configure tools using standard Kubernetes manifests. Helm has special behavior related to CRDs that you need to know in order to work effectively with CRDs. In this course, you will learn about how CRDs work in helm, get an example chart related to CRDs, and also learn about some of the limitations of Helm related to CRDs.\n\n\nLearn the standard\nHelm is the de facto standard for Kubernetes package management. There is no alternative, so learning Helm is essential. Having Helm in your toolbox will be an asset in your career as a developer, DevOps engineer, or anyone working with Kubernetes. By taking this course, you'll gain valuable skills that will make you a valuable asset to any organization working with Kubernetes.",

      "description": "You have learned ROS2 basic concepts and you want to:\ndive into more advanced core concepts,\nso you can take advantage of all the ROS 2 features,\nand create better robotics applications ?\nAnd maybe you are already stuck and you feel lost in documentation?\nThis course is for you: read on to learn more.\n\n\n– Why this course?\n\n\nI still remember when I first learned ROS 2. Understanding the basic concepts was already super hard, but then when diving into the more intermediate/advanced stuff, I really understood what the word “frustration” means.\nIt was so hard to find valuable information and then to make sense of all of it. In the end, it took me a lot of trial and error.\nNow that I understand and use those concepts, I just created the course I wish I had at the beginning, so that you can save a lot of time, and learn without frustration.\nAnd the concepts you will see here will not only help you create better robotics applications, they will also be super helpful when you start to learn about ros2_control, nav2, or moveit2. (Note: I don’t teach those frameworks in this course, but they rely a lot on the advanced ROS2 concepts, so this course will help you learn the frameworks faster)\n\n\n– How do I teach?\n\n\nIf you’ve taken other ROS 2 courses from me you know that I’m not here to waste your time.\nMy teaching method is quite simple:\nStep by step\nGoing to the point\nLearn while doing\nAlso I strongly focus on the “why” behind what you learn. The goal is not just to make you blindly repeat some steps, but to understand why those steps matter.\nAnd don’t take my word for it - here are some reviews from fellow students/researchers/engineers/teachers who took my ROS2 courses on Udemy:\n“Best course on ROS2 I’ve taken! Other courses (different sites/platforms) made it confusing but this course makes it so clear and easy to understand while letting you try on your own. I am definitely learning a lot in a painless and simple way. I should have gotten this course from the beginning.” - Miguel Martinez G.\n“Overall very satisfied. I’ve a strong background in programming, but at a higher level (web mostly) and the elegant, fluent and clean approach of this course has leveraged my introduction to the ROS environment in a short amount of time, without the struggle of going through a lot of documentation” - Devis D.\n“I think I learned all that I need to develop a ROS2 project from scratch. I will recommend 100% this course to anyone who wants to learn the fundamentals of ROS2.” - Javier D.\n“This course is awesome. I finally get to understand the development of packages/nodes in a simple progressive way, which helps to understand how the framework works and therefore helps to get into it easily.” - Christophe K.\n“Edouard has excellent teaching philosophy. He explains concepts clearly and demonstrates them practically which could be understood and applied easily. Thank you Edouard Renard.” – Farhan A.\n\n\n– What will you do and learn in the course?\n\n\nThis course is divided into 4 main parts:\nActions\nLifecycle Nodes\nExecutors\nComponents\nEach part can be seen as a mini-course inside the course, which means that you can learn them independently from each other.\nFor each part, I teach you the concept step by step, with a clear structure, and you learn by doing and writing the code.\nIn addition to that, I also give you additional practice to make you think on your own, and learn how to combine several concepts in the same application.\n\n\nSo, if you want to take your ROS 2 skills to the next level, enroll in the course today!\n\n\nYou don’t take any risk here, because you also get a 30-day money back guarantee if you’re not fully satisfied - no questions asked.\nSee you in the course!\nNote - this course is not for you if:\nYou know nothing about ROS 2. In this case, I suggest you start with my “ROS 2 for Beginners” course (level 1).",

      "description": "Internet of Things (IoT) : Fundamental Course (101 level)\nThe Internet of Things (IoT): A Revolution in Connectivity\nWe have been interacting with technology and living in a new way because of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT transforms our homes, workplaces, and cities with an increasing number of internet-enabled devices. As we explore IoT applications, we will examine its potential impact on various aspects of our lives.\nWhat is IoT?\nIn its simplest terms, IoT refers to the interconnection of everyday objects with the internet. From smartphones to wearable fitness trackers, home appliances to industrial machinery and vehicles, these devices are often referred to as \"smart\". These devices can communicate with each other and exchange information through IoT, enhancing their functionality and efficiency.\nA major technological advancement, IoT has a wide variety of applications. Using IoT, healthcare providers can monitor patients remotely, use smart medical devices, and engage in telemedicine, improving patient care and reducing costs. Agriculture can benefit from IoT-based systems by optimizing irrigation, monitoring crop health, and increasing efficiency.\nSmart homes are among the most notable IoT applications. Lighting, temperature, security systems, and even kitchen appliances can all be controlled remotely with IoT. Energy savings and increased home security are also a result of this connectivity.\nIoT's impact on diverse sectors of society only grows as it evolves. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to enhance IoT capabilities, enabling more advanced automation and predictive analytics. IoT applications will also be enhanced by higher-speed and more reliable 5G networks.\nWe are only just beginning to realize the potential of the Internet of Things. IoT revolutionizes everything from smart homes to industrial processes. Cybersecurity and data privacy challenges and concerns must be addressed to fully harness its benefits. Moving forward, IoT must be embraced while being implemented responsibly and securely.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolutionary concept that connects everyday devices to the internet, enabling them to collect and exchange data. IoT programming involves designing applications and software to interact with these interconnected devices. One popular technology for long-range communication in IoT is LoRa (Long Range). It finds its application in various domains like home automation, where smart devices, often powered by ESP8266 or Raspberry Pi, can be controlled remotely for increased convenience and efficiency. In the world of Industrial IoT (IIoT), MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) serves as a lightweight protocol for transmitting data between machines and devices. For enthusiasts and hobbyists, platforms like Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and Arduino offer versatile development environments to build exciting embedded systems, from home automation projects to robotics. These platforms, along with tools like MicroPython and Node-RED, provide flexibility and ease of programming. IoT is driving digital transformation and reshaping business models, making it a crucial component of modern electronics and microcontroller-based solutions.\nIn this fundamental course, I would like to teach the 6 major topics:\n1. Introduction and importance of Internet of things (IoT) 5.0\n2. Internet of things IoT types, principles and scope\n3. How IoT devices connect to the internet, IoT in smart homes and smart cities\n4. IoT in HR, Healthcare, Agriculture, logistics and supply chain and education sectors\n5. IoT architect skills and How to become an iot architect\n6. IoT and Data Management\nEnroll now and learn today !",

Great job making this useful content!\" - Siddhant Singh\n\n\nThis course is for everyone who wants to get better in Wolfram Mathematica!\nNo prior knowledge is required. We will start from the basics and climb the ladder up to advanced projects!\n\nWolfram Mathematica is an enormously powerful tool. In this language you can often solve difficult problems with only a few lines of code. However, this makes learning the language and especially the transition from conventional programming languages like C or python unique, as it uses a different approach to tackle programming. It is not difficult but can be overwhelming if you are on your own.\n\nMathematica was originally created to solve maths problems but was soon used in the natural sciences, as well. Today, it contains clever functions that can be adapted to all sorts of problems: We will solve programming tasks and will create beautiful, interactive images in our projects about statistics, physics, geography, chemistry, biology, music, political speeches, quantum computing, neural networks, machine learning, image manipulation, the stock market and more.\n\nYou are kindly invited to join this carefully prepared course that will teach you all you need to know about Mathematica. It includes a crash course, quizzes, exercises, background lectures and, of course, hands-on programming sessions in which we will solve real-life examples!\n\n\nWhy me?\nMy name is Börge Göbel and I am a postdoc working as a scientist in theoretical physics.\nI have refined my advisor skills as a tutor of Bachelor, Master and PhD students in theoretical physics and have other successful courses here on Udemy.\nEspecially when I started my PhD I was impressed how easily you can solve demanding tasks with Mathematica. I have used the program for the results and images in many of my publications and have recommended Mathematica to all of my students.\n\nI hope you are excited and I kindly welcome you to our course!",

      "description": "SAP has introduced a modern approach to programming in SAP ABAP from ABAP 7.40 onwards. Often referred to as the 'New Syntax', the modern approach aims at creating an expression-oriented language. There are various new elements introduced and let's try to understand this with simple examples in this course.\nWhy learn New ABAP syntax?\nAnswer the below simple question if you think it is only a New ABAP syntax course you already know, and then check if you need this course.  The answer is given at the end.\nQue. Value in sy-tabix?\nitab =\ncol1 col2\n1       val1\n2      val2\n3      val3\nwa = itab[ col1 = 2 col2 = val2 ].\nIf sy-subrc EQ 0.\nWrite: sy-tabix.\nEnd if.\n\n\nThe new ABAP syntax introduces several new language elements, making it more expressive and powerful. For example, constructor expressions, table expressions, and inline declarations allow you to write more concise and expressive code.\nIt is important to stay up to date with the latest developments in ABAP syntax to utilize its capabilities fully. For example, New Open SQL syntax supports SAP HANA built-in functions. You can write select queries with CASE expression, arithmetic expressions and arithmetic functions.\nLearning the new ABAP syntax can help you write better, more efficient, and more maintainable code.\nWhat will you learn in this course?\nWe will discuss the topics below in 2 parts: Theory and Practice.\nInline Declaration\nTable Expressions\nValue Operator\nFOR expressions\nCORRESPONDING Operator\nREDUCE Operator\nCOND and SWITCH Operator\nSTRING Expressions\nEXACT Operator\nCONV Operator\nNEW Operator\nREF Operator\nCAST Operator\nFilter operator\nOpen SQL vs New Open SQL\nSELECT query with CASE expression, Arithmetic Expression and SAP HANA built-in functions.\nCommon Table Expression (CTE) in ABAP SQL\nReverse looping using STEP addition\nWhy Learn New ABAP Syntax with Us?\nA new ABAP syntax is designed to simplify the life of an ABAP developer, but without knowing the proper functionality, it can be disastrous. For example, let's consider we have an ITAB internal table with 5 records, and the code gets into a situation where it is reading a record at index 6.\nOld syntax: READ TABLE itab INTO wa INDEX indx\nNew syntax: wa = itab[ indx ].\nWith old syntax, if you didn't get the record for index 6, just sy-subrc will fail and nothing will go wrong but with the new syntax, the program leads to a short dump.  In detail explanations in the course will help you understand all such important things.\nNo extra talk, straight to the point in detailed explanations with theory and practice sessions.\nYou will learn by comparing old syntax with new syntax for better understanding.\nWe have kept examples simple to understand in one go.\nYou will get all the ABAP programs discussed in the course for your practice and quick reference.\nAll the videos are less than 10 mins to keep you focused.\nTest what you have learned through MCQs.\nA few facts related to the New ABAP syntax:\nThe new syntaxes have been added without removing the old syntax, i.e., it's with backward compatibility.\nNot necessary to have a HANA database.\nCan be practiced on ECC and S/4 HANA systems.\nTo make the best of this course\n1. Get access to an ABAP system and practice on it.\n2. Follow the order in which lectures are arranged.\n3. Based on the title, feel free to skip certain parts.\n\n\nUPDATES:\n06/30/2025: Added E-book for quick reference.\n09/24/2024: For folks who prefer reading over videos, we have added articles that cover theory in simple words, along with code and output screenshots.\n02/29/2024: Use AI ChatGPT to learn New Syntax.\nAnswer to the question asked:  table expression doesn't modify system variable sy-subrc or sy-tabix.\nsy-tabix = 0\n\n\nHappy Learning!",

However, getting stuck part way through the intermediate course, I decided to complete the beginner course. Boy am I glad I did - it has really consolidated things for me, and was well worth the money. If you haven't taken any of Gilly's courses before I can highly recommend them - she is super enthusiastic, keen, knowledgeable, and very responsive. If you only take one DAX course as a beginner, make it this one”.\nIan W.\nDAX Power Pivot Time Intelligence – 10 Easy Steps\n“Great Course from Gilly. Her courses are a masterpiece and this subject was a tough one but she does a good job in explaining it Step By Step. Going by her own words you need practice to master it but at least I am happy the foundation is being laid with strong understanding to move forward. Thanks so much Gilly”\nGuna R.\nDAX Power Pivot – 10 Easy Steps for Intermediates\n“It is obvious that Gilly has spent a lot of time with her study guide and organization of this class. This is one of the best illustrated courses I've found on Udemy. Explanations of the DAX formulas are very clear and flow logically throughout the course. The concepts discussed are easily at the Intermediate level as advertised. Truly an exceptional effort by Gilly Dow.”\nJimmy F.\nPower Pivot is the perfect tool for those working in finance, statistics, project, business and market analysis or any data reporting role who have a need to create and produce Business Intelligence style Dashboard and Insight reports.\nI have used Excel 2016 to demonstrate this fantastic tool but you can follow along in Excel 2010 & 2013 - I'll do my best to point out the differences.

      "description": "This course is a hands-on introduction to device to cloud communication using Amazon’s AWS serverless design flow.  This course is meant as a basic, non-production level,  introduction to both device to cloud communications, and how to the manipulate IoT data on AWS using the serverless model.\n\nIn the course we focuses on a serverless design flow utilizing simple IoT data generated data by either the ESP8266 12-E or ESP32 embedded development boards using WiFi.  The course will cover how to program the devices, send the IoT data wirelessly to AWS through the AWS IoT Core MQTT broker, and then demonstrate how to store and visualize the IoT data utilizing various serverless services and design flows on AWS.    We will be using the AWS website to navigate services, and not the \"Serverless\" framework.\n\nSome of the important AWS services covered in in the course for IoT Data are: Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB. In addition, the course will cover other important AWS services such as AWS IoT Analytics, QuickSight, SageMaker, Kinesis, Cognito, and AWS IoT Core. We will also be using JavaScript and Node.js for our static web host and Lambda respectively.\n\n\nWe will start off the course by learning how to program the ESP device to connect to the AWS IoT Core MQTT broker. From there we will cover AWS IoT Analytic s which is a managed services which  tacitly utilizes additional underlying AWS services.  We will then move on to storing sensor information from our device using Lambda to form a data lake in S3 which we will use a repository for our IoT data. We will then access our IoT data, generated from our ESP device, with a statically hosted website in S3 demonstrating various visualizations methods such as Google Charts, Chart.js, and Highcharts as JavaScript visualization libraries.  From this point we can now move on to slightly more complex examples using the AWS-JS-SDK in the browser to invoke AWS services directly on our S3 web host. At this point we can move on to a more advanced serverless flow by having our static web host request IoT data held in a data lake repository on S3, or stored in DynamoDB, by making a request to an endpoint generated by API Gateway connecting a Lambda function that's programmed to fetch our data from our IoT data repository.\n\n\nThe purchase of a $5 ESP8266 12-E, or $10 ESP32, is recommended for the course, but is not absolutely necessary as we can ‘fake’ incoming IoT JSON data from AWS IoT Core on the MQTT broker.\n\n\nRemember! 30 days money-back guarantee with no questions asked.

How long will it take you to roll back?\n\n\nThis is where Helm comes in.\n\n\nHelm allows us to “template” our Kubernetes files so we can use a values file to plug in any details we need.\n\n\nThis means each environment can have it’s own values files so each deployment can be tailored\n\n\nYou can add our Kuberentes YAML files and package them into what is called a “Chart”.\n\n\nEach of the separate applications can be put in their own chart and pulled in as dependencies from Chart Museum - our chart repository.\n\n\nHelm is often referred to as The “package manager for Kubernetes” as you can deploy charts and any dependencies they have in a single deployment.\n\n\nDeploying charts is a breeze: it’s one SINGLE command.\n\n\nAnd to clear an environment?\n\n\nYou guessed it, just ONE command!\n\n\nI Know! Unbelievable, right?\n\n\nThink of how many late nights you would have avoided!\n\n\nImagine all the time, effort and pain you’re going to save using Helm.\n\n\nNow you’re ready to use it, you need to master it.\n\n\nNow you know the best kept secret from some of the best DevOps teams in the world.\n\n\nYou’ve got the opportunity to master this tool.\n\n\nThe Helm 3 Masterclass will take you from Zero to Helm Hero.\n\n\nShowing you:\nHow to take advantage of the powerful templating language\nGet you up to speed using Helm\nAdvanced conditional logic to make your charts even more powerful\nSetup and use chart museum\nAdvanced Helm techniques for multiple charts\nExpert Secrets from Industry - master troubleshooting tricks that you won’t find anywhere else\n3 Unique Hands-on projects and much, much more\n\n\nYou want to use Helm NOW, not in a couple of months!\n\n\nWhich is what inspired us to make the ultimate course with 0 filler! We want more engineers like you to get on board with the tech fast!\n\n\nThis is the one-stop course to learn everything you need to know to start working with Helm right away.\n\n\nThe Helm 3 Master class will prep you as if you started using it YEARS ago along with the other pros!\n\n\nYou’ll be learning from TJ Addams, an ex-Deloitte and ex-Capgemini lead DevOps engineer. He has been working with Helm and teaching DevOps for the last 3 years.\n\n\nHis experience of working with Helm on massive multimillion dollar projects will give you unique insights you won’t find anywhere else.\n\n\nIf you’re going to learn helm, why not learn it from the best?",

      "description": "Regular expressions have a bad reputation for being difficult to understand. This course introduces tools and a systematic approach so you can unlock the power of regular expressions to write compact, elegant code.\n\n\nCourse Concepts\nIn this course, we will cover concepts from basic to advanced:\nQuantifiers\nCharacter collections, including negation\nCharacter ranges\nString boundaries\nCharacter Classes\nFlags\nGreedy vs. Lazy Quantifiers\nMulti-Character Quantifiers and Options\nCapturing Groups (numbered and named)\nSubstitution / Replace\nLookahead and Lookbehind\nDepending on your level of experience, you can start at the beginning, or start later with concepts you've always been interested in, but haven't had a chance to learn yet.\n\n\nCourse Examples\nExamples progress in a logical, narrative way. At the end of one example, we will think about how we might tweak it to do something similar but more powerful. In this way, the concepts flow naturally from one example to the next.\nThe course has 44 examples in the course of the lectures, each written out on different platforms (JavaScript / Python / Linux (grep)) in the course repository. Each regular expression is fully commented and has test cases to show how it's intended to be used, so these are a great starting point if you like to \"code by example\" -- start with an example you know works and tweak it for your purposes.\n\n\nCourse Exercises\nThere are also 46 exercises using Udemy's code challenge platform. You are given a description of a regular expression, and then you write it using your choice of JavaScript or Python syntax. After you're done, tests written especially for the exercises will let you know whether your regular expressions did the job they were supposed to. These exercises are a great way to cement the concepts in your brain, and make sure you really understand the material presented in the lectures.\n\n\nCourse Tools\nThe course uses regex101 (with permission of the author) to show how regular expressions match the test strings. There are also slides breaking down each regular expression example and explaining each piece.\n\n\nQuestions encouraged!\nPlease use the Q&A feature on Udemy to ask questions! I love to talk about why regular expressions don't seem to be working, discussing decisions I made about course content, and debating regular expression philosophy.",

      "description": "Welcome to the beginners & intermediate level accessible website design course where you will learn both the techniques of accessible website design and an entire ‘framework for thinking about the subject’. This course will equip you with the skills to understand, identify and fix issues any accessibility issues you come across.\nAfter you have completed the course you will have the skills you need to build and maintain accessible websites - websites that will pass the WCAG 2.1 & WCAG 2.2 guidelines up to AA level. WCAG 2.1 & WCAG 2.2 Level AA is the level most governments and organisations use as part of their legislation. You will gain a deep understanding of what accessible website design means.\nMy name is Jim Byrne - and I will be your guide throughout the course. I am an award-winning accessibility specialist & website designer - with over 25 years of experience. I set up one of the UK’s first website accessibility consultancies in 1996 - called, The Making Connections Unit (MCU). The impetus for setting up the unit was my experience of working with disabled people within a project called The Wellbeing Initiative. It was there that I saw firsthand the barriers and discrimination that disabled people have to put up with every day. After setting up the MCU - I then set up my own accessible website design business in 2003.\nI have worked with national & local government, the private sector, corporate clients, Further Education, and the not-for-profit sector. My experience includes publishing books, guides, training courses, and giving feedback on a draft of the WCAG 2 guidelines - which I did as Director of the Guild of Accessible Website Designers.\nYou will hear disabled people explaining and demonstrating how they browse websites.\nThere are lots of course bonuses to download, including my 111-page website accessibility e-book, the audio from the course (to listen to at a time of your choosing), all the slides, and much more.\nYou will learn about the medical and social models of disability and what they mean for your approach to designing accessible websites.\nYou will learn how people with different impairments access the web, i.e. deaf & hearing impairment, blind & visually impaired, physical impairments, and people with learning difficulties. You will learn the tools and techniques they use and what that means in terms of ensuring websites are accessible.\nYou will learn techniques for making non-text content accessible. i.e. images, videos, how to ensure your links are accessible, how to ensure your tables are accessible. how to ensure your forms are accessible.\nYou will get access to real examples of screen reader use, and an example of captions being added to a video.\nYou will learn how HTML documents are structured and how that structure is fundamental to ensuring websites are accessible.\nYou will learn about the history and development of the WCAG 2.1 guidelines. You will learn what the levels mean (A, AA, AAA compliance) and the concepts that the latest version of the guidelines are based on. I translate the concepts into easy to understand language.\nYou will learn the basics of ARIA is and how you can use it to make dynamic content accessible.\nThe course is aimed mainly at beginners to the subject of accessible website design - but all website developers - whatever their level of experience - will learn from this course.\nIf if you want to learn accessible website design I sincerely believe the course I have developed is the one for you. I’ve put a lot of work into making it the best I could make it.  Have a look at some of my free videos and register today to get started. I look forward to seeing you on the course. :-)",

      "description": "Welcome to the Automotive Ethernet Course!\nIn the dynamic world of automotive technology, seamless communication within vehicles is paramount. As the backbone of modern in-car networks, Automotive Ethernet is revolutionizing how data is transmitted, paving the way for innovations like autonomous driving, advanced infotainment systems, and sophisticated driver assistance features.\nIn this course, you'll embark on an in-depth journey through the realm of Automotive Ethernet, gaining essential knowledge and practical skills to harness this powerful technology. Whether you're an experienced engineer looking to expand your expertise or a newcomer eager to dive into the automotive industry, this course is designed to equip you with the tools and understanding needed to excel in the fast-evolving landscape of vehicle networking.\nWhy Automotive Ethernet?\nAs vehicles continue to evolve into more connected and autonomous systems, the complexity of communication within these vehicles has grown exponentially. Traditional in-vehicle communication protocols such as CAN (Controller Area Network) and LIN (Local Interconnect Network), which have been reliable for decades, are increasingly becoming insufficient. These legacy protocols were designed to handle low-bandwidth, low-speed applications like sensor data transmission and basic control signals. However, modern automotive systems generate massive amounts of data due to the integration of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), infotainment, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.\nWith features such as 360-degree camera views, LIDAR, radar, vehicle-to-cloud communication, and real-time diagnostics, the data flow within the vehicle has dramatically increased. Traditional communication networks like CAN and LIN struggle to meet the requirements of these high-performance applications due to their inherent limitations in bandwidth and latency. The need for a more robust, high-speed communication network has led to the widespread adoption of Ethernet in automotive applications.\nWhy Ethernet?\nHigh Bandwidth: Ethernet provides far greater bandwidth than CAN, LIN, or even FlexRay. This allows for the simultaneous transmission of large amounts of data, making it perfect for applications like ADAS, real-time video streaming from cameras, and high-resolution displays in infotainment systems.\nLow Latency: Automotive applications, especially safety-critical systems, require low-latency communication to ensure real-time responsiveness. Ethernet meets these demands by offering fast data transfer speeds and prioritization mechanisms, allowing data to flow with minimal delays.\nScalability: Ethernet is highly scalable, allowing for the addition of more nodes and devices without significant network redesign. This flexibility makes it ideal for future-proofing vehicles as new technologies and systems emerge.\nFlexibility: Ethernet supports a wide range of protocols and standards, making it versatile enough to handle everything from real-time critical systems to non-critical systems like entertainment. Its compatibility with existing IP protocols also enables easier integration with external networks such as the internet or cloud services.\nCost Efficiency: Ethernet’s mass adoption in industries beyond automotive has led to mature, cost-effective technology. It offers an efficient solution for OEMs looking to upgrade their vehicle communication networks without significantly increasing manufacturing costs.\nReliability and Robustness: The automotive Ethernet standard, particularly with the development of BroadR-Reach, enables Ethernet to be used even in harsh automotive environments. BroadR-Reach allows full-duplex data transmission over a single unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable, reducing weight and cost while ensuring robust performance.\nFuture-Oriented Technology: As the automotive industry moves toward full autonomy and vehicles become part of the larger Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, Ethernet is positioned as the go-to communication backbone. It enables vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) communication, which are vital for smart city integration and autonomous driving.\nWhy Understanding Automotive Ethernet is Crucial?\nFor engineers, developers, and automotive professionals, mastering Automotive Ethernet is essential for the following reasons:\nAutonomous Driving: Autonomous vehicles rely on a complex web of high-speed data transfers between sensors, cameras, radar, and LIDAR systems. Ethernet provides the backbone for this communication.\nIn-Vehicle Networking: With Ethernet, in-vehicle networking becomes faster and more reliable, supporting seamless communication between ECUs (Electronic Control Units), infotainment systems, and safety-critical components.\nOver-the-Air (OTA) Updates: Ethernet allows fast, secure, and reliable OTA updates for vehicle software, helping OEMs keep their vehicles up to date without needing a service visit.\nAdvanced Infotainment: Ethernet enables high-quality multimedia streaming, high-resolution displays, and rich infotainment experiences with minimal latency, making it a must for modern connected vehicles.\nIntegration with External Networks: Automotive Ethernet, based on IP standards, ensures compatibility with external systems, enabling V2X communications and integration with cloud platforms for diagnostics, data analytics, and more.\nIn conclusion, as vehicles become more connected, autonomous, and data-driven, Automotive Ethernet is not just a luxury but a necessity for handling the complex, high-bandwidth communication needs of next-generation vehicles. Understanding and implementing Automotive Ethernet is a vital skill for engineers, developers, and anyone involved in the design, manufacturing, and maintenance of modern vehicles. This knowledge will be essential in keeping up with the rapid advancements in the automotive industry and ensuring the efficient operation of future vehicles.",

      "description": "About Me\nI’m not just an Excel fan—I’ve used it to build analytics departments, automate reports, and lead strategy at the VP level. I hold a Harvard MBA, a degree in Computational Sciences, and spent over a decade managing teams in a global bank. I was also a McKinsey consultant, trained to solve complex problems under pressure. I’ve worked in AI, built chatbots, and automated full workflows—but I still believe Excel is the fastest path to real-world productivity. And nothing unlocks that faster than VBA.\n\n\n1. Why Learn Microsoft Excel VBA?\nExcel is already powerful—but with VBA, it becomes unstoppable. Over 500,000 companies in the U.S. rely on Excel. Most reporting and analysis work doesn’t require complex models—it just needs to be automated.\nThat’s where VBA comes in. You’ll be able to:\nAutomate repetitive tasks\nBuild one-click dashboards and tools\nCreate dynamic workflows without hiring a developer\nControl files, PDFs, emails, PowerPoint—and even simulate keyboard actions\nAnd you’ll be surprised how much of it is easier than you think.\n\n\n2. Work Smarter, Not Harder\nThe difference between someone who knows Excel… and someone who automates Excel is career-changing.\nWhile others stay late updating reports, you’ll be building tools that run in seconds. You’ll finally move from manual work to impactful work—and from “Excel user” to “Excel wizard.”\nThis course will help you free up time, reduce errors, and turn spreadsheets into fully functional apps—without needing to be a programmer.\n\n\n3. Why This Course?\nYou don’t need to memorize code. You need to understand it just enough to use it.\nThat’s what this course does. We break VBA down into practical, real-world steps, so you can:\nRead and adapt existing code\nCreate your own macros from scratch\nBuild tools and reports that actually help your team\nThis course is built for real-life workflows, not classroom theory. You’ll build solutions you can actually use at work—like:\nCopy/paste automation\nDynamic dashboards\nAuto-generated reports\nPDF-to-Excel tasks\nCustomized user forms and interfaces\nWhether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your skills with event-based triggers, error handling, or advanced userforms, this course will give you the confidence to stop asking for help… and start automating like a pro.\nAnd yes—you’re protected by Udemy’s 30-day refund policy, as long as you’re within their terms.\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Is this course beginner-friendly?\nYes. You’ll start from zero, and every concept is explained in simple, clear language.\nQ: Do I need coding experience?\nNo. You’ll learn step by step. And you’ll see how even small scripts can make a big difference.\nQ: What if I’ve already recorded macros before?\nPerfect. You’ll now learn how to actually understand, clean, and modify that code—and build on it.\nQ: Can I apply this in my job right away?\nYes. Every lesson is built around real-world use cases—not abstract examples.\nQ: Will this work with Excel 365 / 2021 / older versions?\nYes. VBA has been stable across versions for years, so the material applies no matter your Excel version.\nQ: What if I don’t like the course?\nYou’re covered by Udemy’s 30-day refund policy, provided your request meets their platform conditions.",

      "description": "Building reliable and highly performant software requires knowledge that goes beyond a certain programming language or framework. It requires a solid understanding of how data is organized in memory, how it can be manipulated, sorted or searched into. There’s a reason why all the big tech companies such as Google, Amazon or Netflix focus their technical interviews on those topics. Whether you do mobile apps, websites, games, machine learning or any other work that involves coding, you need a good grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms.\nMany self taught developers and aspiring engineers often feel they lack the knowledge when having to decide on the right data structure or the right approach for solving a problem. If you ever felt that way, this material is the right choice for you. This course packs months of Computer Science subject matter to get you on the same level of proficiency as someone with a Computer Science degree.\n\n\nWhat sets us apart ?\nEvery video begins with an in depth analysis of the topic at hand. At this stage we won’t write any code yet, but rather learn how to approach the problem, think of ways we could solve it and build a mental model of the solution.\nWe then go on to code the algorithm step by step. But we don’t stop there. We take one or more examples and walk through the code line by line. And we mean that literally. You will see how the code runs from top to bottom and how data flows and changes during execution. We find this method the absolute best way to really understand the inner workings of an algorithm.\nWe’ll also analyze the time performance and space utilization of every algorithm and method we write using the Big O Notation. We’ll talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and discuss their real world usage. Apart from all of that, you’ll also learn things like recursion, how computers work under the hood, problem solving techniques, common programming patterns and much more.\n\n\nWhat does this course cover ?\nHow computers work under the hood\nWhat a data structure is\nWhat an algorithm is\nProblem solving techniques\nBig O Notation - how to analyze the time performance and space utilization of algorithms. This is done for every single function/algorithm we write.\nGain a deeper understanding of how code works\nRecursion\n\n\nData Structures:\nArrays\nHash Tables\nSingly Linked Lists\nDoubly Linked Lists\nStacks\nQueues\nBinary Search Trees\nTree Traversal\nHeaps\nGraphs\n\n\nSorting Algorithms:\nInsertion Sort\nSelection Sort\nBubble Sort\nShell Sort\nHeap Sort\nMerge Sort\nQuick Sort\nRadix Sort\nThanks for considering, and I hope this course will help you in your journey.

If you offer more videos on the subject i will be one of the first to sign up!!\" - Rob R\n\"I've been a DBA for a few years now and have used sp_who is active for years (and love it!) and even I learned a few new tricks. Great class!\" Nancy\n\"Well the credit also goes back to the mentor of this online course... yes it is worth for small amount of price.\" HCDS Academy\n\"Very practical course\" - Guillermo\n\"I love the detail and the real world applications\" - Darryl\n\"Knowledge is always about applied information towards getting results in a particular context. This is pristine knowledge supported by the experience of Mike. Solid gold\" - Roman\n\"Awesome course, it showed me some useful tips and some neat things which I will be using from now on\" Thomas\n\"Does an excellent job of (a) explaining course intent, (b) concepts, and most importantly, (c) explains the tools, gives a detailed (and easy) description of how to install them, and how to use them, and for what purpose. Great course!\" Douglas T.\n\"This will give you a head start when it comes to trouble shooting your SQL server. Thanks Mike !\" Luke D\n\"Instructor was engaging and the course material was just the right about to get to the core of the issues.\" Texas Squirrel\n\"Difficult concepts expressed in simple terms.\" Dare David\nCOURSE DESCTIPTION\nWhat do I mean when I use the words “real world?\"\n\nThis course is about learning a very specific skill that's one of the most important ones to becoming a senior level SQL Server DBA and that is - Where do you begin troubleshooting production issues?\nI'm going to give you the starting point and we are going to work through several examples of real world scenarios where a SQL Server was down  and how I brought back online.  You'll learn the language of performance tuning.\nAll industries have their own vernacular and the SQL world is no exception.I'll be introducing some new terms and scripts that are very specific to performance tuning and optimization.\nThese scripts and how I apply them are worth the cost of the course.  Performance tuners are like mechanics. Our goal is to keep the SQL engine as tuned as it possibly can be.\nOne stored procedure to rule them all!\nIn the real world, the elite SQL Server DBAs don't use canned tools. Many of the greats have a library of scripts and they use ONE of these every single day.\nIf you don't have a script library started then I'll show you how to set one up and GIVE you your first few scripts.\nWhen I'm called into troubleshoot a struggling SQL Server I always use ONE script first.\nThis script was developed by one of the world's leading experts on SQL Server and used by many of the world's leading experts on SQL Server.\nThis is a hands on course.\nYou will simulate a OLTP application and learn what to look for when issues arise. All of the demos are written in transact.  Everything is included in the price of the course. Set up for the course is easy. Installing the tools will take several minutes.\nThe most important part of our course will be working through the real world examples. All my lessons will have very specific instructions. The set up for all of the lessons is simply to cut and paste the transact code into SQL Server Management Studio.\nThe vast majority of the course will be working through the demos and analyzing how to troubleshot production down issues and what steps can be taken to bring the server back online.\nThe course will also include lectures but the lectures will be short and pragmatic. SQL Server is one of the most complicated pieces of software in Microsoft's suite. This course will provide you with the single most important facet to analyzing real world outages. Where do you start?\nIf you want to be one of the most skilled SQL Server DBAs then you MUST learn how to use this script effectively!\nStart now! Enroll today.",

      "description": "Why Managing Secrets is so important ...\nEveryone who works in IT these days is concerned with security. It's hard to go a day without reading about some sort of data leak or DDOS attack in the news affecting thousands if not millions of users. Having a solid defense-in-depth and risk management plan is key to protecting your organization's digital assets. In the past this has been the responsibility of executive management and security professionals, however these days in our brave new cloud computing world, everyone who works in and with the cloud has a far greater direct impact on releasing services that we are all responsible for taking a security-first approach.\nManaging secrets is an integral part of protecting your organization and any digital assets, including on-premise and cloud native applications.\nSo what is Secrets Management?\nFirst let's ask what may seem like an obvious question: What is a secret? A secret is really anything that you consider sensitive enough to protect from prying eyes, bad actors, or even incompetent ones. A more technical definition of a secret might be any credential, password, tokens, keys, or certificates used to protect data or access services used by an application or even a human.\nSo secrets management, then, is responsible for the governance of these secrets. Governance is a process that defines how secrets are created, protected, rotated, distributed, revoked, and destroyed. The governance process may also cover who can access what secrets and when.\nWhile process is great on paper, at the end of the day you need tools to make the secrets management process real. Enter one fantastic tool: Hashicorp's Vault.\nThis course will teach you how to use Hashicorp Vault.\nI have put together this easy to follow course on how to get anyone up to speed on using Hashicorp Vault as quickly as possible. You don't need to be a security professional or understand all the details behind encryption algorithms to learn Vault.\nVault is not just another password vault by the way. In this course you will learn the following:\n1. Securely deploy Vault into Development and Production environments\n2. Manage static secrets such as passwords\n3. Generate and management dynamic secrets such as AWS access tokens or database credentials\n4. How to bootstrap infrastructure and services without a human\n... and many others ...",

      "description": "\"Thanks for your classes on Lovable! I took them and built my first app in 6 hours. It was an amazing experience and your classes convinced me to dive in.\" - John Wang, VP Product Management, Saviynt\n\n\nWelcome to the future of app development with Lovable 2.0! In this course, you’ll embark on a hands-on journey into “vibe-coding”, a revolutionary mindset where creativity, collaboration, and AI-driven development come together to help you build production ready apps faster than ever before.\nLovable 2.0 redefines what’s possible by blending a smarter, agentic AI with a bold new interface (over 1.0), robust multiplayer features, and built-in security tools. The “vibe-coding” mindset encourages you to focus on ideas and the user experience while Lovable’s AI handles the technical heavy lifting of writing code. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, Lovable 2.0 empowers you to create, iterate, and launch without the traditional barriers of manual coding.\nSo, what sets Lovable 2.0 apart from its predecessor? The new Chat Mode Agent is at the heart of this evolution. Unlike basic assistants, this agent is truly agentic in that it reasons across multiple steps, analyzes your project’s context, and helps plan, debug, and refine your work without making direct code edits unless you want it to. This means you can brainstorm, ask questions, and solve complex problems in natural language, while always staying in control of your project’s direction.\nCollaboration is now seamless with multiplayer workspaces. Teams of up to 20 can collaborate, share credits, and track changes in real time, making Lovable perfect for startups and enterprises. Security is built-in (via Supabase), with automated scans that catch vulnerabilities before you deploy, giving you peace of mind as you move from prototype to production.\nGetting started involves making a simple choice between a Free, Pro, or Teams plan. Each AI action, from generating code to making edits, uses a credit, and tracking usage is simple through your account dashboard.\nWe’ll also introduce you to essential integrations like Supabase for your backend and Stripe. Supabase handles all backend activities such as authentication and storage and Stripe handles payment processing for when you are building an app you intend to sell.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll master Lovable’s core features, from AI first development (via Chat) to secure deployments, collection payments and pixel-perfect design. Get ready to unlock your creativity and build apps the Lovable way where coding is powered by giving English instructions and letting AI write the code!",

We will use many examples to make the lectures very easy to understand and digest.\nYou don't really need to have prior knowledge of Data Structure or Algorithm, but a basic prior knowledge of any programming language will be helpful!\nAfter going through these 100 Leetcode questions, you will get your foot wet and start trying some \"Medium\" questions soon. The purpose of this course is to learn fast and give you the confidence to start working on Leetcode questions.\nMost of these LC questions are EASY level or MEDIUM level with a quick solution. You can get the most out of it by following along. Because Medium question is like few Easy questions combined together. A Hard question is a combination of a few Medium questions. In the future, I will try to make a Medium level of Leetcode for all of you!\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to comment it below. I will get back to you as soon as possible.\nIf you have any suggestions on me improving the videos and contents, please also let me know, so that I can make better videos in the future. I hope you have a wonderful learning experience here!",

      "description": "Are you a beginning Python programmer who wants to prevent spaghetti code by organizing code better? Do you often have to work with unstructured code that is hard to understand?\nOr are you a developer that brings experience from other programming languages and want to learn how to use OOP in Python?\nThen this course is for you!\nThe 'Object Oriented Programming with Python' course guides you through an exercise, starting with a small, naive approach that gradually is turned into a well structured Object Oriented Design. Each step of the journey introduces new challenges, communicates intended changes with UML and uses tools from the OOP toolkit to solve problems.\nTarget audience\n\nDevelopers who especially benefit from this course, are:\nBeginner Python developers who want to organise their code better by using OOP\nDevelopers that bring experience from another programming language who want to learn using OOP with Python\nDevelopers that inherit spaghetti code from others at work and need bring structure to it\nChallenges\n\nYou have heard that object oriented programming can help you to structure your code. But many tutorials overwhelm you with technical blah blah and seem to focus too much on how to implement OOP features. But if you do not understand why to do things, you will use OOP without without using its full potential.\nThis can lead to writing ineffective code or worse: give up on the idea of OOP.\n\nThis course is different! It starts with the absolute beginning and introduces common challenges that are solved by using Object Oriented Programming. This way, you will learn OOP from the ground up, step by step.\n\n\nWhat can you do after this course?\nYou will organize your code better so changes in the future do not cause nightmares anymore\nYou can visualize and communicate your code to your colleagues with UML, before writing a single line of code\nYour code will be organized in small, predictable and testable units\nTopics\nIntroduction OOP: Understanding the problems that are solved with OOP\nClasses and objects: Create classes, the class initializer, and instantiate objects\nUML: Visualize and communicate the class diagrams with the Unified Modeling Language\nInheritance: Prevent duplicate code by creating subclasses\nEncapsulation: Prevent access to class information\nDependency injection: Decouple your code by injecting dependencies\nPolymorphism: Allow your code to be extended with minimal changes to the system\nComposition: Prevent an explosion of subclasses by using composition\nUnit testing: Write Unit Tests to test the correctness of your code\nDuration\n\n2,5 hour video time. 5 Hours with exercises.\nThe teacher\n\nThis course is taught by Loek van den Ouweland, a senior software engineer with 25 years of professional experience. Loek is the creator of Wunderlist for windows, Microsoft To-do and Mahjong for Windows and loves to teach software engineering.\n\n\nStudents of this course tell me:\n* * * * * “An excellent, concise and clear explanation of the basics of OOP. Fantastic course! Thanks Loek.”\n* * * * * “This is the Python OOP course I've been searching for a long time. Many courses teach OOP syntax but few courses help you understand the \"why\", and then followed by the \"how\". This course does it and also with realistic scenarios that make it more relevant to the workplace. Highly recommended!”\n* * * * * “I thought OOP it was really difficult. But through this course, OOP is something that makes coding much readable and robust. I am sure this course will help people who have hard time coding plain and simple.”",

      "description": "WHY IS THIS COURSE IMPORTANT?\nMedical errors are now the third leading cause of death in America. A system that can provide \"Evidence Based\" decision support to clinical staff in the diagnosis and treatment of patients has the potential of reducing many of these errors. It also has the potential of streamlining processes and improving patient experience. Big Data can provide the solid foundation for these clinical decision support systems. But the volume is enormous and it is increasing each day. This is complicated by the speed at which real time devices stream healthcare data. How do we link all of this data? How do we make sure that it is accurate? How do we manage it? How do we make it easily accessible? This course will begin to lay the foundation for addressing many of these issues.\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN IN THIS COURSE?\nFundamentals of Big Data\nWhat is Big Data?\nThe 4Vs of Big Data\nStructured vs Unstructured Data\nThe Challenges of Big Data\nBig Data, The Asset\nData Accuracy, Stewards and Governance\nThe Power of Big Data\nThe Users of Big Data\nThe Dangers of Big Data\nInteroperability & Databases\nWhat is a Database?\nData Islands and Interoperability\nBig Data, The Foundation for Making Decisions\nFrom Big Data to Insights\nDecision Making Process\nCausation and Correlation\nMedical Error Example\nPharmacy Example\nRadiology Example\nThis course includes:\nVideo lectures walking you through the various aspects of Big Data & making clinical decisions\nQuiz to test your retention\nSignificant number of resources to do a deeper dive into his topic.\nWHO IS THE IDEAL STUDENT FOR THIS COURSE?\nYou will learn a lot from this course if you are\nThinking about choosing healthcare as a career\nLooking to advance your career in healthcare\nLooking to expand your knowledge of healthcare to better perform your current job and better understand how it fits into the ecosystem of patient care and better serve those in need\nCurious about everything and want to learn more about healthcare just for the sake of expanding your knowledge base.\nWHAT IS YOUR TEACHING STYLE?\nMy teaching style is a very pragmatic one. I assume you know nothing about this topic and start with the foundation and build from there. Some of these concepts could be challenging, so I sprinkle in as many examples as I can, both non healthcare and healthcare, to assure full understanding of the topic. This is why I have appended \"Plain and Simple\" to all my courses.\nWHY ARE YOU QUALIFIED TO TEACH THIS COURSE?\nI spent 35 years in the designing and launching of medical imaging products and services. My career evolved from leading engineering teams, to becoming VP Marketing and then to president of a Healthcare IT firm. It is also based on 15 years of university teaching.",

This course is designed to give you your first taste as to what it is like to program an embedded system in order to create your first very own CAN bus network.\nThis course uses the Arduino because by far it is the most popular system of it's kind out there. It's very inexpensive, widely available, easy to use and there is tons of support on the web for it. It's why I chose it for this course.\nAt the end of this course, I hope that you will purchase your own components and build, run and test just as is shown in the lectures.

      "description": "Informatica Analyst or IDQ Analyst is a web-based application client that analysts can use to analyze, cleanse, standardize, profile, and score data in an enterprise.\nBusiness analysts and developers use Informatica Analyst for data-driven collaboration. You can perform column and rule profiling, scorecarding, and bad record and duplicate record management. You can also manage reference data and provide the data to developers in a data quality solution.\nOrganizations use Informatica Analyst to accomplish the following tasks:\nProfile data. Create and run a profile to analyze the structure and content of enterprise data and identify strengths and weaknesses. After you run a profile, you can selectively drill down to see the underlying rows from the profile results. You can also add columns to scorecards and add column values to reference tables.\n\n\nCreate rules in profiles. Create and apply rules within profiles. A rule is reusable business logic that defines conditions applied to data when you run a profile. Use rules to further validate the data in a profile and to measure data quality progress.\n\n\nScore data. Create scorecards to score the valid values for any column or the output of rules. Scorecards display the value frequency for columns in a profile as scores. Use scorecards to measure and visually represent data quality progress. You can also view trend charts to view the history of scores over time.\n\n\nManage reference data. Create and update reference tables for use by analysts and developers to use in data quality standardization and validation rules. Create, edit, and import data quality dictionary files as reference tables. Create reference tables to establish relationships between source data and valid and standard values. Developers use reference tables in standardization and lookup transformations in Informatica Developer.\n\n\nManage bad records and duplicate records. Fix bad records and consolidate duplicate records.",

It is strongly advised you do not attempt this course until you have completed all the prerequisites -see my other courses on Udemy if you need a refresher.\nAwarded Content Creator in the 2020 Qt Champion Awards:\n\"Bryan has a few courses available on Udmey, specifically his course on Qt 5 Design Patterns and also has a popular group on Facebook which helps others with their Qt questions as well. For his work alone in creating the Qt 5 training course online for everyone to benefit from it was easy to make him our year's Content Creator.\"\nIn software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design - a design pattern is not a finished application but rather a tool the developer can use across any software framework. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.\nThe goal of this course is to teach the student how to use design patterns in Qt 5 with C++ along with an understanding of issues specific to Qt 5. We will use a wide range of Qt technologies from Widgets, QML, sockets, server, threading, io, streams, processes, and the State Machine Framework. This course will cover traditional design patterns along with looking at common problems and solutions specific for Qt 5.\nThese videos are filmed live and unedited, the student will see every single step, mistake and correction - the result is the same as if sitting in a classroom watching in real time.",

      "description": "Learn Svelte 5 from scratch through hands-on, real-world projects! Whether you're a JavaScript developer eager to explore a hot new framework or looking to add modern web development skills to your toolkit, this course is for you.\n\n\nWhy Learn Svelte & SvelteKit?\nSvelte is a revolutionary framework that compiles your code to pure JavaScript, making your web apps fast, lightweight, and highly efficient. Unlike other frameworks, Svelte doesn’t rely on a virtual DOM, meaning it ships less code and performs faster. Pair it with SvelteKit, and you’ve got a full-featured toolkit for building server-rendered, highly interactive, and accessible apps with ease.\nWith Svelte 5, the code you write is even leaner and more efficient, and this course covers all the new syntax and best practices, making it the perfect time to start learning Svelte.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn:\nMaster the brand-new Svelte 5 features\nBuild three fully-functional projects: from a product landing page with Stripe integration to authenticated web apps\nIntegrate Stripe for payments, Sanity CMS for content management, and Supabase for authentication\nAutomate emails with SendGrid and connect your app to OpenAI for image recognition\nApply project-based learning to solve real problems\nHow to use TypeScript within a Svelte & SvelteKit app (second & third project are using it)\n\n\nCourse Overview:\nThis course takes you deep into Svelte 5, the next major version of the Svelte framework. You’ll build three progressively complex projects, designed to help you level up with practical, hands-on learning. The second and third project are written in TypeScript, while the first one uses vanilla JavaScript.\neBook Landing Page with Stripe Integration\nCreate a sleek landing page to sell a product online, fully integrated with Stripe for payments. Learn how to handle webhooks with your SvelteKit API endpoints and send emails with the ebook automatically when receiving a request from Stripe.\nDeveloper Portfolio with Sanity CMS\nShowcase your skills with a developer portfolio powered by Sanity CMS. Capture contact requests using a dynamic form, and use SendGrid to send personalized emails. Ideal for freelance developers looking to land new clients.\nAuthenticated CRUD App with Supabase and OpenAI\nDive into user authentication, database management, and image recognition with this feature-rich app. Upload book covers and leverage OpenAI to recognize books from a bookshelf image. The ultimate full-stack project!\n\n\nWhy This Course?\nProject-Based Learning: Forget boring theory! Each project tackles real-world scenarios that you’ll use in your own work.\nSvelte 5 Syntax: Be one of the first to learn Svelte 5, including the latest syntax and features.\nProgressive Difficulty: As you progress, the projects get more advanced, helping you build confidence and a solid understanding of SvelteKit.\nCSS Simplified: Every project comes with a skeleton CSS templates to skip styling videos and focus on JavaScript and Svelte functionality. If you don't want to, you don't have to write a single line of CSS.\n\n\nWho is This Course For?\nEverybody who knows JavaScript. Svelte is super easy to pick up and everything you need to know is covered in the course.",

We'll discuss two of those pillars — logs & traces — and we'll talk about what problem each of these solves.\nTo help enable you to make this topic practical, we'll go through examples in Go instrumenting sample applications that you can reproduce on your own Linux (or WSL-based) system. We'll examine the output of this instrumentation in the terminal or open-source UIs that you can use to learn the concepts. Lastly, we'll reproduce some failure modes to understand what failure looks like in these tools and give you a wider range of capabilities to debug different production issues.\nThis course was made for you if you are a mid to senior-level developer with some experience deploying software to production. Still, you’re looking to build the skills and capabilities to run higher-scale services with more traffic and debug these systems when they get into trouble.\n\nLet's get started!",

Ever thought of from where these applications are being served off?\nEvery application would be running from a server installed in an Enterprise IT center or data center. This server would consist of the components like Multiple processors, Memory Chips (or RAM), Hard disks or SSD, Input Output Cards, Network Interface Cards, etc.\nThe course covers concepts like Redundant Array of Independent Disk (RAID) and Logical Unit Number (LUN) in detail. Various storage technologies like Direct Attached Storage (DAS), Fiber Channel Storage Area Network (FCSAN), IP Storage Area Network (IPSAN) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) are covered in the course.\nVirtualization has given a way to mitigate the wastage of resources and improve ROI. The advantages of virtualization are:\nResource consolidation\nAgility\nDevelopment Flexibility\nMigration and Cloning, and\nDesktop Virtualization\nThe course includes Network Virtualization, Storage Virtualization and Server Virtualization.\nOn the foundation of the above-mentioned concepts, the course now turns towards Cloud computing which is defined as a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications.\nMajor Service models of cloud computing are:\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS)\nPlatform as a service (PaaS)\nSoftware as a service (SaaS)\nThese service models are discussed in detail in the course. Other concepts related to Cloud like storage and deployment models are also covered extensively.\nApart from all this Cloud Monitoring is an important aspect which needs to be considered in this domain. Cloud monitoring system refers to a set of programs, software, and applications that offers capability to monitor smallest to biggest elements of Cloud with number of benchmarks, thresholds, and nature of alarms.\nCloud monitoring includes the following concepts:\nElasticity\nScalability\nMigration\nAccuracy\nAutonomy, and\nComprehensiveness\nSo, join us to learn all this and much more related to Cloud Computing.",

The AWS Kinesis suite of stream persistence and processing services have come to be recognized as first class choice for achieving the kinds of event driven architectures feeding into real-time analytics.\n\n\nIn this course students learn to harness the power of Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) and Kinesis Data Firehose (KDF) to construct high-throughput, low latency, pipelines of data across a variety of architectural components leading to scalable and loosely coupled systems. Additional focus is placed on how these stream persistence technologies are used in conjunction with Kinesis Data Analytics to perform advanced, real-time, computations which drive informed business actions and insights.\n\n\nThe course goes beyond the theory of what these services are, making heavy use of demonstrations and code walkthroughs to give examples of how these technologies are used in practice. Most code examples are demonstrated in parallel using both the Python and Java programming languages in an effort to reach the largest audience of developers. However, some examples are presented only in one language in cases where either one language doesn’t support a particular functionality or is significantly less complex to demonstrate.",

      "description": "Infrastructure as a Code is one of the foundations of Devops Automation toolchain. Being the first to enter in 2005, Puppet is at the forefront of the IaaC revolutions and was the first tool amongst the four main configuration management tools including Chef, Ansible and Saltstack . Puppet is also the fastest configuration management system and provides a simple DSL (Domain Specific Language) to define the state of resources and does the heavy lifting of managing underlying platform specific operations by itself, providing users higher level of abstraction than scripts do.\nThe use of puppet is no more limited to servers, but has also expanded to managing all type of devices including routers, embedded systems, storage etc. With more and more organisations adopting to devops practices, knowledge on IaaC and tools such as Puppet is essential for today's generation of devops professionals. This skill would also help one to advance their careers, specially for the operations, systems, networks and devops engineers.\nThis course is one of the most comprehensive programs to master Puppet. It starts from most basic concepts related to Infrastructure as a Code, Convergent Infrastructures, Code and Data separation, Idempotence. It then helps you dive into the world of puppet by understanding the basics of the languages such as resources/providers, manifests, modules and then delves deeper into creating dynamic code with parameters, templates, defined types etc. Once equipped with the basics, it unlocks Puppet's full potential with advanced topics such as environments, hiera, r10k, puppet enterprise, rolls and design patterns etc. This course takes from from zero to puppet master in two weeks.",

      "description": "Overview\nPython is a programming language that can be used for a wide variety of purposes, from simple user scripts to web servers and complex APIs. It has a simple, highly readable syntax which makes it a suitable language for people who want to learn how to write programs.\n\n\nWhat you will learn\nWe will begin the course by installing the Python 3 interpreter. We will look at how to run the interpreter in the command line, as well as how to execute our Python source files.\nAfter that, we will learn about how to manipulate some basic data types. We will learn about how use Python to do simple arithmetic. Then, we will learn about working with words and characters, using a data type known as the \"string\". We will also cover the Boolean type, which is a representation of True and False inside of a programming language.\nThen we will move on to more complex types. First we will look at how we can organize data into a list. We will look at how to create lists, how to access elements inside them, and how to modify the contents of a list. Then, we will look at the dictionary type, which allows us to create mappings. For example, a dictionary could map account numbers to client names.\nWe will then move on to control flow. Control flow refers to the sequence in which a program's\nstatements are executed. We will look at the if statement, which allows the script to decide whether or not to execute a block of code based on some condition. We will also look at looping. Looping refers to repeatedly executing a block of code until some condition is met. Functions will also be covered, which will allow us to organize code into simple, reusable pieces. Then, we will learn about errors, and how to handle them properly so that they do not halt execution of the script.\nFinally, we will end the course with three practical coding exercises. These exercises will ask for user input, validate the user input, and display a result in the command line. In cases of invalid input,meaningful error messages will always be displayed to the user. The first exercise will involve asking the user for the length, width and height for a rectangular box. The program will then calculate and display the box's volume. The second exercise will calculate the sum of all multiples of a list of numbers up to 1000. The last exercise will ask the user for a length and a width, and display a multiplication table with the given dimensions.\nPrerequisites\nUsing the command line\n: In order to execute our coding examples, we will need to use the command line. In Windows, this is the Command Prompt and in MacOS this is the Terminal. For the purposes of this course, students only need to know how to change directories inside the command line. Everything else can be learned by watching the videos.\nPython 3\n: This courses uses Python 3, which has some significant differences from Python 2. The first video of the course will demonstrate how to install Python 3, and how to run it in the command line.\nNotepad++\n( Recommended ) : Notepad++ is a free, open-source text editor. Although JavaScript and HTML can be written using any text editor, Notepad++ is highly recommended because of features such as syntax highlighting and auto-complete.",

      "description": "A common problem that organizations face is how to gathering data from multiple sources, in multiple formats, and move it to one or more data stores. The destination may not be the same type of data store as the source, and often the format is different, or the data needs to be shaped or cleaned before loading it into its final destination.\nExtract, transform, and load (ETL) is a data pipeline used to collect data from various sources, transform the data according to business rules, and load it into a destination data store.\nSQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) is a useful  and powerful Business Intelligence Tool . It is best suited to work with SQL Server Database . It is added to SQL Server Database when you install SQL Server Data Tools  (SSDT)which adds the Business Intelligence Templates to Visual studio that is used to create Integration projects.\nSSIS can be used for:\nData Integration\nData Transformation\nProviding solutions to complex Business problems\nUpdating data warehouses\nCleaning data\nMining data\nManaging SQL Server objects and data\nExtracting data from a variety of sources\nLoading data into one or several destinations\nWeb scraping is  the  process of automatically downloading a web page's data and extracting specific information from it. The extracted information can be stored in a database or as various file types.\nWeb scraping software tools may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.\nScraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it.  Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when you view the page).  to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and phone numbers, or companies and their URLs, to a list (contact scraping).\n\n\nBig data can be characterised as data that has high volume, high variety and high velocity. Data includes numbers, text, images, audio, video, or any other kind of information you might store on your computer. Volume, velocity, and variety are sometimes called \"the 3 V's of big data.\"\nWhat kind of datasets are considered big data?\nExamples includes social media network analysing their members' data to learn more about them and connect them with content and advertising relevant to their interests, or search engines looking at the relationship between queries and results to give better answers to users' questions.\n\n\nSQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.\nSQL stands for Structured Query Language\nWhat Can SQL do?\nSQL can execute queries against a database\nSQL can retrieve data from a database\nSQL can insert records in a database\nSQL can update records in a database\nSQL can delete records from a database\nSQL can create new databases\nSQL can create new tables in a database\nSQL can create stored procedures in a database\nSQL can create views in a database\nSQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views\n\n\nPower BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization, or embed them in your app or website. Connect to hundreds of data sources and bring your data to life with live dashboards and reports.\nDiscover how to quickly glean insights from your data using Power BI. This formidable set of business analytics tools—which includes the Power BI service, Power BI Desktop, and Power BI Mobile—can help you more effectively create and share impactful visualizations with others in your organization.\nIn this beginners course you will learn how to  get started with this powerful toolset.  We will  cover topics like  connecting to and transforming web based data sources.  You will learn how to publish and share your reports and visuals on the Power BI service.",

Everything you need to know to start with Premiere Pro and to start editing is here.\nFEATURED REVIEW:\n\"This is the course I was waiting for: I am used to other videoediting systems (like Avid for example) and I have been trying to learn Adobe Premiere for years (last January I made another trial) but no course could nail the information in my head, until now! Mariano's course is excellent: it's easy to follow and covers all the necessary aspects of the videoediting, including the initial settings and the organisation of the workflow. It's fab that the material for the exercises is included too! Mariano is a very nice and likeable instructor with a good sense of humour, the lessons are well paced and easy to follow. I would recommend this course to any beginner as well as to professionals like me who find difficult to make the leap to Adobe Premiere.\" by Cristina Pavesi\nWHAT YOU'LL LEARN:\nYou’ll learn the whole professional video editing process, including how to create and organise projects, how to edit, apply effects and transitions, how to mix your audio, to colour correct and colour grade the video, how to add captions and how to export your final product for the online platforms in different aspect ratios. And of course, we’ll cover the most useful keyboard shortcuts.\nIT WILL BE FUN!\nWe’ll work together on a different project for each section, with different types of footage (all provided) including mini docs, interviews, travel vlogs and sports videos. This will give you the ability to learn different editing styles and to be flexible in your workflow.\nAt the end of each chapter you will also find a quiz and an exercise to complete on your own. But do not worry, you will also find an exercise review where I complete the same exercise so that you’ll be able to double check your work.\nWe'll wrap up the course with a final exercise that will revise all the skills learned.\nMY PROMISE TO YOU\nOnce you'll have completed the course, you'll be able to create a video project on your own, from start to end, with professional standards! Enrol now and let's start learning and practicing.\n\n\nPS: This course was built on Adobe Premiere Pro 2020 of Creative Cloud, Version 14.0.0 and 14.3.0 on a Mac Computer and it is suitable for Windows users too (some commands will be different, please NOTE).\nCourse UPDATED on 1ST JUNE 2021 with V.15.\nFor Windows users\nIf, when importing the material into Premiere Pro, you see some warning board about \"._.DS.Store\", just keep pressing \"OK\" and ignore all the files named \"._.DS.Store\", \".DS.Store\" and also the video files starting with \"._\"\nThese are only files of reference not needed to follow the course normally.",

(I want to stick to YAML. I don't want to learn a new language just to manage my configurations).\n\nWhy you should take this course:\nConfiguration management in Kubernetes becomes complicated the more you use it and the more complex your infrastructure gets, especially when you need to manage multiple environments.\nNew Kubernetes developers end up duplicating their Kubernetes configurations across multiple environment directories, resulting in even more complication.\nUpdating deployment manifests becomes really difficult when you need to make a simple manifest change, since this will need to be made in several places due to the duplication.\nMost other Kubernetes configuration management tools add more complexity to simple workflows, e.g. helm charts.\nThe name “Kustomize” is just cool and now integrated into kubectl :)\n\n\nExtra things that come with this course:\nAccess to the course Slack team, for getting help/advice from me and other students.",

      "description": "Server-side web GIS applications allow you to access GIS data stored in a multi-user database. This means that your data will always be current and any changes that other users make to the data will be immediately available in your application. You will be able to build complex GIS applications where some users will only be able to view certain data that you allow them and other users will be able to add, edit, and delete data from a web-interface. This means that your users will be able to interact with your GIS database from any device that has a compatible browser and an internet connection. They may be working in the field from a mobile device or from home on a mac OS computer, or on the other side of the world on a Linux computer.\n\nThis course uses PHP for the server-side language because of its popularity and its wide availability on web servers. We will use PostGIS as a spatial database, again because of its popularity and common usage in GIS applications. I teach standard web development methods that have stood the test of time and will still be available in many years after the latest, greatest, technology has been replaced with something even better. My goal as an instructor is to provide an introduction to the basic concepts. I don't think you will find any limitations with the software that I teach but if you ultimately decide to use a different server-side language, database, or a newer framework the methods you learn here will provide a solid foundation.\n\nBest of all, this course uses all open source software so there are no costs involved. I have had projects involving more than 50 people, including clients, accessing the same database through web interfaces and desktop GIS for several years with no problem and with no cost other than web-hosting which cost us about $10/month total.",

We will understand the makefile by using a real time example( \"Creation Of Egg Omelet\" ).\nWe are going to do 2 projects during the learning process of makefile.\nPROJECT#1: Without knowing/remembering too many things you will be able to write a makefile for generating binary, shared object(.so), static object(.a), and also get a trick to link from anywhere. After completion of this project Idea of makefile will be cleared. We are creating a makefile template after completing this project and which can be easily used in any project.\nPROJECT#2: During implementing this project, we'll improve our makefile and makefile template created in Project#1 by applying patterns, functions.\nEvery step we will face some problem and then apply the solution.\n\n\nWe will begin with the PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE creation(THIS CAN BE USED IN REAL TIME PROJECTS) after understanding all the possible output of a C/C++ program. Then we will come across more technical issues in programming and try to solve them one by one during this journey. Our project structure is in such a way that deployment process will become much easier.\n\n\nWe'll start writing simple makefiles and keep on improving as we really need it! We are doing lots of exercises and facing lots of issues and also fixing all on the fly!\nWe are going to write a makefile for all possible outputs. In this course you will always learn WHY??? and HOW???\nI will show you the real requirement of a particular concept and then we will learn and apply that.\n\n\nHighlights:\n1. Write makefile by knowing minimal things.\n2. One Makefile to call all makefiles\n3. Makefile with Cross Compilation feature\n4. Makefile considering DEBUG & RELEASE version of binary.\n5. Passing MACRO from makefile to other makefile\n6. Detect environment variables of terminal and one make pass the same to other make.\n7. We will discuss high level design(HLD) of the projects and from that you will feel how easy it is to write a makefile.\n8. You will be more comfortable with command line compilation\n9. Understand shared object linking issues and how to fix it temporarily as well as permanently.\n10. Project will be done in MAC and copied to Linux. We will directly do a single make which will call all the modules makefile and build the executables, shared object, static objects seamlessly. IMPORTANT thing is WITHOUT ANY SINGLE LINE OF CODE CHANGE FOR LINUX!",

Learning SQL means you know how to access them. This skill enables you to stay competitive.\nThe course teaches you Oracle SQL. But, SQL is a standard that is used for other relational databases also. So, you can re-use the SQL learning (not 100% though) for other DBs as well with some tweaks specific to those DBs.\nThe course tries to impart knowledge using two methods.\n1. Video lectures. The lectures introduce you to the basics of Oracle SQL and also the important nuances. For e.g. apart from learning what a NULL value means, you will also learn the situations the NULL values can be problematic.\n2. Exercises - PDFs -> The exercises deal with the concepts introduced in the videos and their nuances.\n- The answer for a question and the explanation will be provided in the next page. Occasionally, some questions can also ask you to do some self-exploration (recommended) on a topic related to the lecture. If you do not have time to do that, you can look at the answer with the explanation in the next page.\n- The exercises vary in complexity. Some of them can seem quite complex for a beginner. Some questions have been made intentionally confusing. A confusion/complexity now is better than the one at an examination hall or work. Isn't it?.\n- Several questions deal with real-life situations and their handling. Please attempt them using logical and practical reasoning, and if needed, take the help of the answer and the explanation in the next page. You can always contact me for any doubts.\nI believe, the course will help in preparing you for the complexity and ambiguity in the real-life database world.\nGood luck. Enjoy the course.\nPS: Exercises are attached as PDF resources in the videos. And not all videos will have a PDF. Questions across lectures could be clubbed together and uploaded against a single video lecture.",

      "description": "Welcome to the official PySimpleGUI course! I'm Mike, the developer of the python module, and I will be teaching you the ins and outs of creating Python GUIs with PySimpleGUI.\nPySimpleGUI places you, the developer at the center of attention. The goal of the module is to make developing GUIs fun & simple.  No, really, it's a serious goal for the project.\nThis course teaches you the fundamental aspects of the module, like simple window creation, how events are handled and how it differs from other GUI frameworks.\nWe go through every element in the module, so you’ll know how to maneuver yourself around building your own programs.  Every parameter is explained. Each element has multiple examples shown.\nAdvanced topics are also covered in the course. Different event dispatching methods can be used other than a bunch of if statements, and we go over building more complex GUIs with list comprehension and reusing layouts. Compiling programs into executable are also covered so you can distribute your amazing programs.\nWhen you buy this course, it ultimately helps the development of the PySimpleGUI itself. The revenue obtained from this course is a part of what will keep PySimpleGUI alive, so thank you!\nTake this course if you want to learn how to make simple GUIs! Simple doesn’t mean you’re limiting yourself to basic programs, it just means you’ll have an easier time doing it!\nIf you've dreamed of making a GUI and have not been able to, then come give it another shot. This time you'll get one made.  And have fun in the process.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Structural Engineering Abaqus Tutorial, the only course you need to learn how to deal with real-life structural engineering examples. This course is specially designed for mechanical, civil engineering students who want to expand their finite element knowledge. This course will teach you the theory behind input parameters as well as modelling and analyse the results.\n\n\nWhat you will get in this course:\n\n\n**This Course is divided into 12 sections and in order to get the most advantage of it, we highly recommend you to follow the course in order as the basic terms have been only explained in the initial sections.\n\n\nSection 1:\nAn overview of this tutorial.\nSection 2:\nThis section aims to teach you how to analyse various concrete beams under the 3-point bending condition. First, we start modelling the concrete beam only using CDP material property for concrete class B50, then in each video in this section, we try to reinforce the concrete beam with different methods such as steel bars and strips, CFRP and metal foam. There are two assignment videos in this section that will help you to test your newly learned skills.\nIn addition, this section provides you with some background information about the concrete damaged plasticity (CDP), Hashin damage criterial for composite material and metal foam input parameters. It is highly recommended to watch all these videos and make sure that you understand the theory behind input parameters.\nSection 3:\nThis section aims to teach you how to analyse various concrete columns under compressive loading. In this section, similar to the previous section, we start modelling concrete only then we reinforce the column using the combination of the CFRP laminate and Steel bars and strips.\nSection 4:\nThis section consisted of two simulations, in the first simulations, we apply load to the concrete column without any reinforcement to have some damage (around 0.05%) on our column then the load will be removed, and CFRP layers will be used in the damaged area to increase the strength of the column and then the load will be applied again.\nSection 5:\nThis section aims to teach you how to model the combination of the concrete beam and column under cyclic loading.\nSection 6:\nIn this section, you will learn how to apply tensile loading to various engineering applications. This section consists of four examples: Concrete specimen, Aluminium specimen and single lap bolted joints under tensile loading and adaptive mesh. In addition, you will become familiar with ductile and shear damage theory in this section\nSection 7:\nIn this section, you will learn how to apply impact loading on the concrete plate using the rigid and non-rigid projectile. In addition, you will learn how to import damage criteria for concrete using the .inp and keyword section by importing 32 required parameters. This section consists of three examples as follow:  Concrete block under impact loading using rigid projectile (Example-1), Concrete block with two metal sheet reinforcement under impact loading using steel projectile (Example-2), Crushable foam under impact loading using rigid projectile (Example-3)\nSection 8:\nIn this section, you will learn how to consider the thermal behaviour of the material under impact loading and how these properties could affect the results.\nSection 9:\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform a low-velocity impact simulation with a fun example by simulating the phone drop from the height of 5 meters.\nSection 10:\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform repetitive impact loading on the metal beam using the Johnson-cook damage model.\nSection 11:\nIn this section, you will learn how to use the XFEM method to study the crack growth in a concrete beam under 3-point and 4 point bending conditions using 2D and 3D examples.\nSection 12:\nThis section has some background information about all the damage models used in this course.\n\n\nI hope you all enjoy these tutorials. Please send me a message if you think anything can improve the quality of this course as I am updating the course regularly.\nMany thanks\nArmin\n\n\n**This course is only intended for Serious Students. A lot of efforts have been done to provide a practical understanding of the Software, theory and analysis which is not available anywhere on the internet.\n** Abaqus version 6.14.1 is used for this course, therefore in order to open files in the recourses section, you should have this version or any later version. However, you can still use the older version to do this tutorial.\n** These course examples are not intended to apply to any particular situation.

Very handy it things go pear shaped. I have my first web-site to up-grade and make responsive. My client want's to leave his old web-site up until the new one is ready. This means copying the site to my laptop (local-host), modifying it, testing it then uploading it. Anytime i've being stuck! Support from Andy and the other students has always solved any problems i've had. Would highly recommend all his courses they are straight to the point no waffle. \"\n\"This class is extremely easy to follow. Andy's instructional pace was easy to follow. Wasn't as tough as I thought it might be based on my lack of experience. Success with the class motivates me to continue working on educating myself on web page design. Thanks!\"\n\"My firsdt Udemy Course and my first Wordpress tutorial. It gave me a wonderful start. I did my first install of wordpress locally without any issues following this tutorial step by step. I can now do everything on wordpress without worrying about any monthly charges. Thanks Andy. \"\n\"Andrew is a great instructor and I love his flexibility in providing solutions to his students problems. I was having problems applying some of the concepts to my MacBook but once I reached out to Andrew, he when back to the drawing board and provided clear instructions for us mac users. I have the pleasure of taking some of his others courses which has the same high level of content and support.\"\n\"The usual high quality from Andy. If you want to test your website building skills, before committing to hosting and exposing to the world, then this is the way to do it. Clearly laid out and easy to follow. A great teacher.\"\n\"Loved this course. Andy's lectures were thorough but I was never bored. In each lecture I was saying \"I didn't know I could do that without blowing up my computer\" (lol) or \"Oh, so that's how you do that!\" I took my time and enjoyed every minute of it.

      "description": "Prompt engineering is one of the most in-demand and future-proof skills of the AI era — and this course will teach you how to master it.\nThis hands-on, tool-agnostic course is designed for professionals, educators, developers, analysts, and creatives who want to harness the full potential of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others. Instead of treating AI like a black box, you’ll learn how to collaborate with it by crafting structured, context-aware prompts that generate accurate, useful, and safe outputs.\nThe course starts with foundational concepts — what prompt engineering is, why it matters, and how different types of prompts (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, etc.) impact outcomes. You’ll gain a working understanding of how LLMs generate language, what “tokens” are, and why they sometimes hallucinate or fail to follow instructions.\nFrom there, we dive into real-world strategies for designing effective prompts. You’ll learn how to give the model the right amount of context, test and tune your prompts, and even use meta prompting — prompting the model to help you design better prompts. Each concept is reinforced with practical examples and guided exercises across domains like education, healthcare, legal, marketing, software development, and data science.\nYou’ll also explore advanced concepts like prompt tuning, hybrid prompting, and ethical AI use — including how to minimize bias, avoid harmful content, and ensure privacy. The course finishes with a capstone module on hallucination reduction, where you’ll learn how to prompt the model in ways that reduce false or fabricated outputs.\nNo programming background is required, though technically-inclined learners will find optional advanced modules on model architecture (e.g., Transformers) and prompt optimization techniques.\nWhat You’ll Learn:\nCore principles of prompt engineering\nHow LLMs work and why prompt structure matters\nTypes of prompting strategies and when to use them\nHow to iterate, test, and refine your prompts for better performance\nUsing meta prompting to build better prompt templates\nReducing hallucination and guiding the model toward factual accuracy\nEthical use of AI in real-world applications\nPrompting for different modalities (text, code, image)\nWho This Course Is For:\nProfessionals who want to automate tasks, improve workflows, or build AI-integrated tools\nEducators designing personalized learning materials or AI-assisted content\nWriters, marketers, and designers looking to collaborate with AI creatively\nDevelopers and data analysts seeking reliable, repeatable prompts for technical work\nAnyone who wants to use AI more safely, effectively, and intentionally",

Its creators engineered this cloud platform for high flexibility and security in the cloud computing environment. The core infrastructure meets the rigorous security requirements for global banks, the military, and other organizations needing maximum protection. The cloud security tools integrate 230 security compliance features to ensure data protection. Data encryption is available within all the AWS services. AWS offers a vast array of databases that are purpose-built, so users maximize efficiency and cost-effectiveness with the right tool to get the job done. Users benefit from innovative features like storage, databases, computing, machine learning, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and advanced connectivity with the Internet of Things.\n\n\nWho uses AWS?\nAmazon Web Services has millions of active global customers from a wide variety of industries who are using this cloud platform to build, implement, and host applications. Some of those industries include banking, non-profit, media, manufacturing, and government. These customers range from individual entrepreneurs and startups to businesses of every size and all types of public sector organizations. However, the majority of their base customers are smaller to mid-size businesses. AWS offers the AWS Partner Network (APN) to technology systems integrators to utilize this cloud platform to create optimized cloud technology solutions for their customers. Independent software vendors (ISVs) have modified their technology solutions for compatibility on AWS. Amazon created AWS in 2006 and have continued to develop and expand their innovative cloud platform to meet the ever-expanding needs of their growing list of customers.\n\n\nWhat are benefits of using AWS?\nSome cloud security benefits customers can enjoy under the AWS include:\nControl where their data is stored and who can access their data. AWS made this possible by combining access controls with continuous monitoring. This ensures that the right resources have the right access at all times.\nReduce human configuration errors by automating security tasks. This gives customers more time to focus on critical tasks, like scaling and innovating the business.\nExtend AWS security benefits of AWS through technology and services offered by AWS-selected solution providers.\nAWS receives third-party evaluation to ensure that it meets global compliance requirements and continuously monitors regulatory requirements to help customers meet security and compliance standards across industries such as healthcare, finance, and others.\n\n\nDoes AWS require programming skills?\nCoding skills are not required to work with Amazon Web Services. Users can easily perform most basic tasks without having any coding background. Most new users utilize the AWS UI to create their infrastructure rather than using coding tools. The UI approach is the most streamlined way to use AWS. However, for more professional uses, it is important to learn manual code configuration. If you want to excel in AWS, knowledge of Linux Scripting and Programming languages will improve the learning process. If you want to be an AWS developer, you need programming knowledge in varying languages. You must have experience in cloud computing, networking, and AWS Lambda, their serverless computing space. Cultivating specific technical skills will help you succeed as an AWS developer. You need to know about application lifecycle management, AWS services, AWS best practices, and understanding the process for creating, implementing, and debugging cloud-based applications.\n\n\nWhat are the certifications I can get with AWS?\nYou can gain six months of foundational AWS Cloud and industry knowledge when you get a certification as an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. Three associate certifications can give you one year of experience in resolving issues and integrating solutions using the AWS Cloud. These are AWS Certified Solutions Architect, AWS Certified Developer, and AWS Certified SysOps Administrator. There are two professional certifications that provide two years of experience in creating, running, and troubleshooting solutions with the AWS Cloud. Those certifications are AWS Certified Solutions Architect and AWS Certified DevOps Engineer. Six specialty certifications are available to help you gain technical AWS Cloud experience in specialty domains. Those are AWS Certified Advanced Networking, AWS Certified Data Analytics, AWS Certified Security, AWS Certified Machine Learning, AWS Certified Alexa Skill Builder, and AWS Certified Database.\n\n\nWhat are the AWS core services?\nAWS core services are AWS Compute, AWS Storage, AWS Database, AWS Networking, AWS Management, AWS Security, and AWS Application Integration. The EC2 service enables streamlined scalability for virtual machines. Simple Storage Services (S3) are object-based for cloud storage. On-demand scalability and blazing performance are available with the DynamoDB NoSQL database option. In-memory caches are created with ElastiCache. The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is provided for routing tables, gateways, subsets, and security mechanisms. Key services can be monitored through CloudWatch, and cloud databases can be hosted with the Relational Database Service (RDS). API calls to AWS are tracked by CloudTrail. Users, groups, and roles can be created with Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. Email or SMS notifications can be received through Simple Notification Service (SNS). AWS Application Integration enables queuing messages and decoupling components through the Simple Queue Service (SQS).\n\n\nWhat is serverless architecture?\nServerless architecture has a software design blueprint with third-party hosting for applications. This is known as serverless computing of function as a service (FaaS). This innovative serverless architecture removes the need for server software and developer management of hardware. Three key benefits of serverless architecture are decreased costs since you only pay for what you use, increased developer productivity, and improved scalability. With FaaS, applications are broken down into smaller sections to enhance the observation process. AWS is continually experimenting and innovating its services. As a pioneer in the cloud computing industry, AWS launched AWS Lambda, the serverless computing space, in 2014. This innovative technology enabled code operation without having to provision or manage servers. AWS innovation created the machine learning service Amazon SageMaker. Developers without previous experience can easily utilize this machine learning technology.\n\n\nAWS vs. Microsoft Azure vs. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?\nAmazon Web Services holds the lead position of these platforms, with Microsoft Azure ranked second and Google Cloud Platform ranked third. AWS offers a vast array of tools and continues to grow exponentially through innovation. However, they offer a complex price structure and are focused more on a public cloud platform than private cloud or hybrid cloud options. Microsoft Azure has more substantial Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) capabilities compared to AWS and Google Cloud. Google has been an innovator in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics for some time. This continual innovation has enabled them to effectively integrate AI into their cloud platform. They have also provided customers with more discount incentives than the other two platforms. They are in third place right now because they were the last of these three to create a cloud platform and have been more focused on technology than business operations.\n\n\nWhat is cloud computing?\nCloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the Internet. These resources include data storage, processing power, applications, physical servers, virtual servers, development tools, networking capabilities, and more. Cloud computing platforms help businesses build their complete infrastructure in a distributed fashion on the Internet instead of in their in-house data center. This offloads the costs of maintaining a company's own infrastructure to a cloud provider who will bill for only what they use. Cloud platforms offer elasticity to a business so that they can scale services based on workload. Virtualization in a cloud environment enables cloud platforms to provide more value by dividing physical hardware into virtual devices. The distributed nature of the cloud gives every user a low-latency connection, whether at the office or on the road.\n\n\nWhat are the different types of cloud computing?\nCloud platforms provide a variety of computing services to their customers.\nCloud platforms provide a variety of computing services to their customers. They also offer storage for companies to store all data types in the cloud, including PDFs and public images, and private company files. Their granular security allows companies to set access rights down to a specific endpoint, data file, or user. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a common cloud service a company can use to manage operating systems, runtimes, data, and applications in the cloud. When a cloud provider offers a platform as a service (PaaS), they provide businesses with hardware that comes with pre-installed software, which helps developers to get started quickly. With software as a service (SaaS), the cloud provider manages software or a software suite for a business, and they just use it. Cloud platforms also offer serverless computing where a company doesn't\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

It's concise, valuable and prolific. I highly recommended for DBA's. - Amir\nGreat. -Njabulo\nA solid overview. Covers the basics in a clear and concise manner. - Stephen Ward\nWe need more videos like this regarding the DBA SQL. - Mohammad\nIt was an amazing course. - Kabeer\nCourse Summary\nAll videos filmed in 1080 and audio is crystal clear.\nWhat do SQL Server DBAs do all day?\nThe answer really is… it depends on the day.\nMost DBAs start their day with some kind of caffeine.. usually coffee… then start checking job failures and other alerts.\nDid any jobs fail last night? If so… was it a critical job? Can we kick it off right now during core hours? Why did it fail? Backup failures will need to be kicked off immediately.\nWe simply can’t have production databases without backups. The good thing about backups is there highly optimized and can often be run during core hours.\nThe DBA will have to troubleshoot the failures and answer the questions above.\nYou’ll set up dev, test and other non-production environments. You’ll create users, import and export data and plan high availability and disaster recovery options.\nIn this course I’m going to cover some fundamental tasks the SQL Server DBA may be asked to perform on a day in day out basis.\nThanks for your interest in “The Day to Day Real World SQL Server DBA.”\n\nThe first 10 minutes are free on every Udemy course. Please take a moment to watch all ten minutes to ensure this course is right for you.\nSee you in the course!!!",

It allows IT Pros to not only perform most vSphere administrative tasks but also automate them.\nTake a chunky vSphere cluster made up of 50 nodes for instance, in which you need to make a change to detach one or more LUNs on all of them. You could either spend a few hours making the change on each host manually in the vSphere Client, or you can use PowerCLI to execute the change on all the nodes in a matter of minutes. Granted such change must be performed carefully if you know what you are doing.\nPushing changes to hosts or VMs isn’t the only benefit VMware PowerCLI brings to the table. You can also use it to collect data that is relevant to a specific use case in a single place. There are ready to use scripts available such as Alan Renouf’s vCheck that acts as a framework to email HTML reports based on what you want to keep an eye on. This script is backed by VMware themselves.\nAutomation always was a crucial part in IT operations and was introduced into its own category since the exponential gain in traction by solutions like Terraform. VMware PowerCLI and PowerShell becoming more advanced with each release, we are able to automate more and more. PowerCLI also provides integration with applications like vRealize Operations, NSX, VSAN, Horizon, VMware Cloud platforms",

All components of Snowflake’s service (other than optional command line clients, drivers, and connectors), run in public cloud infrastructures.\nOur goal was to get you up-to-speed with Snowflake and prepare you for the Snowflake Certification exam with a 250 set of practice questions and scenarios. When you finish this course you will have a solid understanding of the Snowflake environment, be ready to administer your own Snowflake environment and be prepared for the Snowflake Certification exam. I recently passed the Snowflake Core Certification exam with a score of 90% and the questions included in this course were invaluable as a study guide.\nIn addition to the above, we cover more specific areas such as:\n- Separation of compute and storage (the power behind Snowflake)\n- Virtual warehouses (compute instances)\n- Scaling up and scaling out\n- Zero-copy cloning (a feature unmatched by most any other competing platform)\n- Data sharing\n- Snowflake credits and billing\n- Performance tips\n- Clustering keys\n- Data loading and unloading\n- Structured and semi-structured data\n- and much more...",

I'm here to help**\n**UPDATED 11-2021: Added a section on Practical Transfer Learning**\nTensorFlow is by far, the most popular library for deep learning. Backed by Google, it is a solid investment of your time and efforts if you want to succeed in the area of machine learning and AI. The issue most people face is that getting started with Tensorflow guides usually delve too deeply into unnecessary mathematics.\nThat is where this course comes in. While some theory is important, a lot of it is just not needed when you're just getting started!\nThis course is for you if you are new to Machine Learning but want to learn it without all the complicated math. This course is also for you if you have had a machine learning course but could never figure out how to use it to solve your own problems.\nIn this course, we will start from very scratch. This is a very applied course, so we will immediately start coding even without installation! You will see a brief bit of absolutely essential theory and then we will get into the environment setup and explain almost all concepts through code. You will be using Keras and Tensorflow 2.x -- one of the easiest and most powerful machine learning tools out there.\nYou will start with a basic model of how machines learn and then move on to higher models such as:\nConvolutional Neural Networks\nResidual Connections\nInception Module\nFunctional API of Keras / Tensorflow 2.x\nTransfer Learning\nIn this course, we explain concepts using not only toy datasets but also a real-world dataset from the bioinformatics domain. While you may not be interested in this particular domain, you would still learn a lot of important concepts that are involved in taking data from the real world and feeding it to ML models. This is the aspect of ML that is missing from almost all courses available on the internet today! Doing this would mean that you would be able to solve problems of your own industry after finishing this course.\nAll with only a few lines of code. All the examples used in the course come with a starter code that will get you started and remove the grunt effort. The course also includes finished codes for the examples run in the videos so that you can see the end product should you ever get stuck.  Do checkout the preview lectures on this page to get a better feel of the teaching style used in this course and how it can help you learn quickly.\nI provide unmatched support.

With odata concept, client and server component can be developed independently . It is based on the REST architecture.\nPrior to odata developer were using different SAP connectors like java connector , .net, php based connectors to established and communication channel between SAP and other software's. Because of the flexibility of odata service as we can consume it from any application which works on web Odata becomes a preferred way of communication over other methods like, IDOC, REST API, RFC/BAPI etc.\n\n\nAdvantages of OData :\n•Odata light in weight\n•It is very easy and relatively fast to access data\n•We can get output in xml and json\n•We can perform all web based methods like, GET, PUT, POST, DELETE and Query.\n•Odata known for its stateless functionality, it means for every request from frontend system it gives the response , and server does not save any data. It treats every OData call as a new call.\n•We can develop and test OData in sap OData gateway frame work, before giving it to front end developer.\n•Due to advantage of complete framework in SAP for odata , compare to normal rest api development with which we do using resource handler class, the coding part is less in Odata\n\n\nRest API - Create Sales order with Rest API\nConsume Salesforce API in SAP",

      "description": "What is web scraping ?\nLet's say your boss at work gave you a task where he wants you to extract about 1000 product from a website, structure the data and save it to a database, would you copy paste manually all the product details from the product name, url and price ? I can imagine you would work days and nights and you wont finish the task, so this is where web scraping shines. So web scraping, or web harvesting or web data extraction is like writing a script that will automate data extraction from websites in a matter of minutes !.\nWhy learn Web Scraping ?\nWhether you're a data analyst, a web developer or even someone who wants to work as a freelancer you should learn web scraping.\nFor a data analyst building a dataset is extremely important, so without web scraping you simply can't generate it in addition to that adding web scraping in your resume is a plus for you.\nWeb scraping can be used in a variety of fields, so let me give you some examples on what you can do with it:\nGenerate leads,\nDrop shipping where basically you gonna constantly scrape products from different online stores and show case them on your website to make money,\nMonitor products prices to get the best deals,\nautomation,\nMachine learning,\nWeb scraping freelancer\nOf course there are tons and tons and variety of fields where web scraping can be extremely beneficial.\nIs this course the right one for you ?\nI've carefully planned and designed this course to be beginner friendly, from my experience I know those who do web scraping are mostly data analyst with no background knowledge on how the web works, how requests are made, how to locate and parse the data from the web and much much more, in addition to that this the most updated course regarding the material included and the tools used, so in this course\nI'll introduce to you the most used web scraping tools/frameworks\nWe will setup the development environment from scratch\nYou will learn and understand LXML core fundamentals\nHow to use XPath & CSS selectors to select the data from a web page\nHow the web works (Request/Response)\nHow to scrape simple HTML web pages\nHow to scrape multiple web pages\nExtract data from APIs\nYou will learn Splash(crash course) so you can use it to scrape JavaScript websites\nAuthentication/Login\nStore the extracted data whether to JSON/CSV files or MongoDb/SQLite3\nExclusive tips and tricks regarding web scraping\nFinally this course is project based, each section starting from the 2nd one we will experiment with a different website, each project has a certain degree of difficulty  and each one is completely independent from other projects.\nIs there is any assignments/exercises included in this course ?\nYes, each section has an assignment included to it, this will help to get your hands dirty and by the end of each section after doing the assignment included you will feel more confident and comfortable with web scraping.\nWhy LXML and not BeautifulSoup ?\nLXML is a lightweight HTML parser even the most popular web scraping framework (Scrapy) is built on the top of LXML, BeautifulSoup is a little bit overloaded with the number of functions exposed to us, it has more functions to use, yes that's right ! however in Web Scraping most of the time we use XPath and CSS Selectors to navigate and select what to scrape from the HTML web page (tree) so there is no need to learn about new functions and wasting all that time to familiarize yourself with the BeautifulSoup API and the internal architecture, in addition to all of that LXML in terms of performance is way better than BeautifulSoup.\nWho is your instructor ?\nHi! I'm Ahmed nice to meet you, my students prefer to call me web scraping Ninja and currently I have taught more than 2000 students around the world how to do web scraping. I personally do web scraping on daily basis whether for fun, for personal projects or as a freelancer and guess what ? I even have a master degree in computer science.\nShould I enroll to this course ?\nHonestly, by enrolling to this course you have nothing to lose, because if this course didn't meet your requirements, you can always ask for a refund in less than 30 days from the day you enrolled to the course guaranteed by Udemy with NO QUESTION TO ASK !\nSO IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WEB SCRAPING & YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START  ENROLL NOW ! :)",

      "description": "ArcGIS Pro is Esri’s flagship desktop GIS product, and it was first released in 2015.\nThis course is being released at ArcGIS Pro 2.5. It is designed for those who are new to ArcGIS Pro, and also for those who just want to learn more about how to use ArcGIS Pro for exploring spatial data.\nThe scope of this particular course may touch upon, but excludes in depth examination of large topics like editing spatial data, making maps and map series using layouts, and geoprocessing using tools, models, tasks and the ArcPy module for Python. There is already a full length companion course already available for ArcPy (ArcPy for Python Developers using ArcGIS Pro) and a short companion course available for map series (Map Series made easy using ArcGIS Pro), while companion courses for the other topics are in development.\nMost sections of this course can be taken in any order. You just need to download the data, and check that you have ArcGIS Pro working first.\nThe course requires only a Basic level license of ArcGIS Desktop (which includes ArcGIS Pro), and no extension products need to be licensed, in order to complete all exercises.\nIf you do not have an ArcGIS Desktop license then, for about $100-150 per annum, it is possible to use an Advanced level license and many of the extension products for non-commercial purposes (like taking this course!), via Esri’s ArcGIS for Personal Use program.\nIt is also possible to undertake a 21-day free trial of ArcGIS Pro.\nThe course takes an in-depth tour of the most commonly used ArcGIS Pro features for exploring spatial information. The scenarios chosen to illustrate how each feature is used are derived from the presenter’s experience working with ArcGIS Pro for 5 years, and with Esri software for more than 30 years.\nIn this 8.5 hour course of 52 lectures, which is suitable for English-speaking students from anywhere in the world, things that you will use and learn include:\nDownloading Natural Earth Data\nStarting ArcGIS Pro to check its version\nCreating Projects\nUsing Start, Help and Project Pages\nUser Interface for working with projects\nExploring 2D Maps using Zoom, Pan, etc tools\nUsing Pop-ups to identify features\nUsing Bookmarks\nChanging scale and setting scale dependent visibility and symbology\nFiltering features using Definition Queries\nWorking with Selections using attributes and locations\nMeasuring and Snapping\nUsing Contents pane\nWorking with Layer Groups\nSymbolizing Layers using Single Symbols, Unique Values, Graduated Colors and Symbols, Charts, Heat Maps, etc\nSymbolizing Layers using Attribute-driven Color\nUsing Transparency, Swipe and Flicker Effects\nLayer Properties like Metadata, Source, Selection, Joins and Relates, Time and Range\nConfiguring MapTips\nMap Properties like Extent, Clip Layers, Coordinate Systems, and Metadata\nWorking with 3D Scenes (Local and Global)\nUsing Camera Properties and Navigator Controls\nConverting and Linking Map and Scene Views\nPlus much more.",

Life is full of change, and calculus is the language that humans developed (invented or discovered -- that's an ongoing debate!) to understand how physical, biological, and abstract systems change. Calculus is more than just some equations you have to memorize; it's a way of looking at the world and trying to understand how the tiniest infinitesimal changes can lead to gigantic complexity bigger than the imagination.\nOK, but aside from all that fluff, calculus is also really important for basically every piece of engineering and digital technology that has touched humanity. Indeed, the history of calculus is the history of civilization.\nYou want to learn data science? => You need calculus.\nYou want to learn machine-learning? => You need calculus.\nYou want to learn deep learning? => You need calculus.\nYou want to learn computational science? => You need calculus.\nYou want to learn... I think you see the pattern here ;)\n\n\nWhy learn calculus?\nThere are three reasons to learn calculus.\nIt has applications for understanding data science and machine-learning algorithms, but it's also a beautiful topic in its own right.\nLearning math will train your critical thinking and reasoning skills. Any branch of mathematics will train your brain, but calculus especially so, because doing calculus is a lot of like running scientific experiments -- generate hypotheses, test them in experiments by holding variables constant, and measuring the output.\nIt's a better hobby than sitting around watching netflix. Seriously. Learning math will help protect you from age-related cognitive decline. Challenge your mind to keep it sharp!\n\n\nLearn calculus the traditional way or the modern way?\nSo, how do you learn calculus? You can learn it the way most people do -- by watching someone else scratch on a chalkboard while you furiously take notes and try to decipher their sloppy handwriting, all the while having a little voice in your head telling you that you don't get it because you're not smart enough.\nOr you can try a different approach.\nI follow the maxim \"you can learn a lot of math with a bit of coding.\" In this course, you will use Python (mostly the numpy and sympy libraries) as a novel tool to help you learn concepts, proofs, visualizations, and algorithms in calculus.\nThere are three reasons to use Python to learn calculus:\nPractical applications: Calculus is essential for understanding data science, machine learning, deep learning, computational science, and many other fields.\nMental exercise: Learning calculus, particularly in combination with Python, will train your critical thinking and reasoning skills.\nLifelong benefits: Engaging your mind with calculus can help protect against age-related cognitive decline and offer a fulfilling alternative to passive leisure activities.\n\n\nSo this is just about coding math?\nNo, this course is not about coding math. And it's not about using Python to cheat on your math homework. Python's symbolic math and plotting engines are incredibly powerful -- and yet underutilized -- tools to help you learn math. By translating formulas into code, implementing algorithms, and solving challenging coding exercises, you will gain a deep knowledge of concepts in calculus.\nAnd the graphics engine in Python will let you see equations and functions in a way that helps you develop intuition for why functions behave the way they do.\nYou will also learn the limits of computers for learning calculus, and why you still need to use your brain and freshly developed calculus skills.\n\n\nNew to Python?\nPython is a versatile and user-friendly programming language that complements calculus, especially when using libraries like NumPy and SymPy. By incorporating Python into your calculus studies, you can gain a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts, proofs, visualizations, and algorithms.\nIf you are new to Python, then don't worry! This course comes with a 7+ hour Python coding tutorial (potentially up to 12 hours if you complete all the exercises) that is designed for beginners and will teach you the coding skills you'll need for this course.\n\n\nAre there exercises?\nEveryone knows that you need to solve math problems to learn math. This course has exercises for you to solve in nearly every video -- and I explain the answers to every single exercise (not only the odd-numbered ones, lol).\nBut wait, there's more! I don't just give you problems to work on; I will teach you how to create your own exercises (and solutions) so you can custom-tailor your own homework assignments to practice exactly the skills you most need to work on. Because you know, \"give someone a fish\" versus \"teach someone to fish.\"\n\n\nIs this the right course for you?\nOne thing I've learned from 20+ years of teaching is that no two learners are the same, which means that no course will be right for everyone. I hope you find this course a valuable learning resource -- and fun to work through! -- but the reality is that this course won't be ideal for everyone. Please watch the preview videos and check out the reviews before enrolling.\nAnd if you enroll but then decide that this course isn't a good match for you, then that's fine!

Then we will be using AWS' built in SageMaker Studio Notebooks where I am going to show you guys how you can use any custom dataset you want. We will perfrom Exploratory data analysis on our dataset with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas and Numpy. After getting insightful information about dataset we will set up our Hyperparameter Tuning Job in AWS where I will show you guys how to use GPU instances to speed up training and I will even show you guys how to use multi GPU instance training. We will then evaluate our training jobs, and look at some metrics such as Precision, Recall and F1 Score. Upon evaluation we will deploy our deep learning model on AWS with the help of AWS API Gateway and Lambda functions. We will then test our API with Postman, and see if we get inference results. After that is completed we will secure our endpoints and set up autoscaling to prevent latency issues. Finally we will build our web application which will have access to the AWS API. After that we will deploy our web application to DigitalOcean.",

      "description": "Are you a Deep Learning enthusiast who is now looking for their next challenge?\nAre you interested in the field of Computer Vision and the ability of machines to extract insightful information from visuals and images?\nDo you want to learn a valuable skill to put yourself ahead of the competition in this AI-driven world?\nIf you answered with “yes” to any of these questions, you have come to the right place and at the right time!\nHere are 5 reasons this is the right course for you:\nWe have 1,170,000 students on Udemy and we know how to teach a complex topic in an easy to understand way\nIt contains numerous practical exercises\nA real-life case study with 16,000 images\nSave time – our course will get you there faster than the average courses on the topic\nNotebook files, course notes, quiz questions, practice materials – all materials are inside the course\nThis course is a fantastic training opportunity to help you gain insights into the rapidly expanding field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks.\nConvolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs in short, are a subtype of deep neural networks that are extensively used in the field of Computer Vision. These networks specialize in inferring information from spatial-structure data to help computers gain high-level understanding from digital images and videos. That can be as simple a task as classifying an image to be a dog or a cat, but it can also explode in complexity as is the case with self-driving cars, for example.\nThis is where most of the active Machine Learning research is concentrated right now, and CNNs are a crucial part of it. So, it is high time to up your game and master this piece of the Deep Learning puzzle.\nTo do just that, we have devised this wonderful and engaging course for you. Although a general understanding of TensorFlow and the main deep learning concepts is required, we will start from the CNNs basics and build our way to proficiency. Moreover, we are firm believers that practice makes perfect, that’s why this course offers a comprehensive practical example of a real-world project. What’s more, it contains plenty of exercises, homework, downloadable files and notebooks, as well as quiz questions and course notes.\nWe’ll start this course by taking a look at Kernels in the context of image processing. Kernels are an essential tool for working with and understanding Convolutional Neural Networks. We’ll explore how to achieve different image transformations and help you understand the role of the mathematical operation of convolution in this process. This will be the basis for our next topic - convolutional layers.\nArmed with all that knowledge, we will introduce the main subject of the course: Convolutional Neural Networks. Here, we’ll discuss intriguing concepts such as feature maps and pooling. In addition, we’ll inspect how such a network transforms the dimensions of the tensors.\nThen, what follows is a short and optional neural networks revision. CNNs are simply a subtype of deep neural networks, so a general knowledge of NNs is required. That’s why we’ll revise the basics: activation functions, early stopping, and optimizers.\nOnce we’ve covered all that, you will have the minimum required knowledge to start putting all this theory to practice – by building your first Convolutional Neural Network.\nWorking on the MNIST dataset, we’ll help you grasp the general workflow of creating a CNN architecture and build one from scratch. You are going to train it to recognize handwritten digits – a very useful tool in the real world. At this point, you will get the hands-on opportunity to tinker and change the network and see the results for yourself.\nAnd we won’t stop at creating the CNNs. We will also spend a good amount of time exploring them through TensorBoard – the go-to visualization and logging tool when working with TensorFlow. This will make your journey and experimentation in the field more straightforward and definitely more memorable. Neural networks are notorious for their difficult interpretation, so we will examine the Confusion Matrix as a tool to help you understand and interpret the results of your networks. Finally, we’ll show you how to easily tune the hyperparameters of your networks.\nBut there’s more.\nWe will show you how to master 3 common techniques to improve the performance of your models. In fact, you will have the opportunity to apply those techniques to the networks we create for the next practical section.\nYou heard that right! The idea of this course is to give you the real CNN experience. We will have an enormous practical exercise so you can work on a real-world project.\nTo do that, we’ve created our very own custom data set that comes from the fashion industry. It consists of more than 16,000 images of trousers, jeans, shoes, glasses, and sunglasses. And we will be using these for numerous practical examples and problems. We’ve devised a task to classify the different items with a corresponding label. Not only that, but we will also determine other characteristics, such as the items’ subtype and gender. Given the nature of these, we will be able to try out different techniques to achieve our goal and compare how these approaches fare against each other. You’ll get a taste of the real-world challenges of solving such a task, and gain experience with a real project that you can later add to your portfolio.\nFinally, to cap it all off, we end this course with a review of the timeline of Convolutional Neural Networks professional research. We will dive into the workings of some popular CNN architectures, and all-stars like AlexNet, GoogLeNet, as well as ResNet will all make an appearance.\nBy the end of this course, you will be completely equipped with all the tools you need to confidently work on CNN projects!\nWe, at the 365 Data Science Team are committed to providing only the highest quality content to you – our students. That’s why we have teamed up with a true industry expert – Iskren Vankov. Iskren is a very capable Software developer and Computer Scientist with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Physics from The University of Edinburgh, and a Master’s degree in Computer Science from The University of Oxford. Iskren has also been engaged in Deep Learning programming for more than 5 years with a focus on Recurrent Neural Networks.\nAs with all of our courses, you have a 30-day money-back guarantee, if at some point you decide that the training isn’t the best fit for you.\nWhat’s more, the course comes with plenty of exercises, homework, downloadable files, quiz questions, and course notes. Everything you need for a perfect learning experience.\nSo, what are you waiting for?\nClick the ‘Buy now’ button and let’s explore CNNs together!",

      "description": "Have you ever wondered how the first couple of years of a general Computer Science university course looks like? Maybe you’d like to know if this is the discipline for you and if you are good at it? Wonder no longer, for we will show you how to get there, how to get good as you go along on your journey, and how life as a computer scientist is like! Money is precious, time even more so, so our priority is to push you ahead, and give you a head-start into university life. Our goal with this course to help you decide if you want to do computer science & engineering at a university level, and what you can expect should you enroll into a course!\nIn this non-traditional, meta-versey course, you get to speedrun through the fundamentals of computer science & engineering in less than 7 hours!\nYou will see all that is promised here and more:\nComputing Basics\nInternet Basics\nWeb Development Basics\nProgramming Basics\n4 LeetCode problems from Tech Interviews\n1 TryHackMe Cybersecurity Challenge\n3 Introductory Python Projects: Use fundamentals to build Blackjack, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Hangman\n1 Practical Web developer Project using HTML/CSS/JavaScript\n2 Real-World Python Projects: Use popular libraries to build a Machine Learning-based Chatbot, and a Cryptography challenge Encryption/Decryption and Brute Forcing\n2 Assessment Modules: 9-question direct quiz and 28 critical thinking prompts\n5 Tech Shorts: History and Trivia delivered in Byte-Sized Pieces\nNarrative Story Elements, Visualized Algorithms, and Animated Characters to keep your learning fun\nMetaverse with a Virtual Academy: We host a complementary session every week for all students for the course in an online, avatar based platform (Gathertown)\nOur philosophy towards teaching is simply this: an individual should be able to take away the essentials of a lesson, no matter how hard it may be. Higher education material is already hard and is often made harder by hardened people at institutions. Code is only as important as a mind who likes to make things work. Focus on the semantics, and not the syntax (you’ll find out what this is and more in the course :))\nIn this way, the course is structured following the principles of explain-understand-assess, while incorporating illustrations, and animations, to form a comprehensive edutainment package! Our lessons are a holistic, audio-visual, multi-sensory experience, to encapsulate the complete odyssey of the definitive university experience for computer science & engineering. The more senses we engage, the more we remember the concepts, the stronger the core memory, and deeper the understanding. We believe relevant applications and ample examples should be part of the learning process, with considerable enjoyment.\nLearning by doing, and doing through learning with the Odysy twist is what you will come to know, and love.\nThis course is actively being maintained, live support is available, and any required updates will be performed periodically.\nDISCLAIMER: This is an avant-garde, experiential learning approach to make you love technology as we do. In just 7 hours, you will develop a rudimentary knowledge of everything that a student in computer science & engineering experiences across the span of two years at a standard university. This is not a substitute for university, but rather an approach to give you a test-drive. If you are already familiar with the basics, this course may not be for you, but please feel free to browse, maybe there’s something for you as well!\n\n\nUPDATE: Starting with NY'2023, we have now added English, Spanish/Castillan, French, Arabic and Chinese (Mandarin) subtitles to roughly 85% of all videos, thanks to OpenAI's Whisper. Their accuracies are affected by our accents and some background noise in some videos slightly, therefore, the quality can vary between high resource languages (English), and low resource languages (Arabic).

      "description": "\"Data is the new oil\".\n\n\nYou might have heard the quote before. Data in digital era is as valuable as oil in industrial era. However, just like oil, raw data itself is not usable. Rather, the value is created when it is gathered completely and accurately, connected to other relevant data, and done so in a timely manner.\nData engineers design and build pipelines that transform and transport data into a usable format. A different role, like data scientist or machine learning engineer then able to use the data into valuable business insight. Just like raw oil transformed into petrol to be used through complex process.\nTo be a data engineer requires a lot of data literacy and practice. This course is the first step for you who want to know about data engineering. In this course, we will see theories and hands-on to introduce you to data engineering. As data field is very wide, this course will show you the basic, entry level knowledge about data engineering process and tools.\n\n\nThis course is very suitable to build foundation for you to go to data field. In this course, we will learn about:\nIntroduction to data engineering\nRelational & non relational database\nRelational & non relational data model\nTable normalization\nFact & dimension tables\nTable denormalization for data warehouse\nETL (Extract Transform Load) & data staging using pyhton pandas\nElasticsearch basic\nData warehouse\nNumbers every engineers should know & how it is related to big data\nHadoop\nSpark cluster on google cloud dataproc\nData lake\n\n\nImportant Notes\nData field is HUGE!  This course will be continuously updated, but for time being, this contains introduction to concept, and sample hands-on for data engineering.\nFor now, this course is intended for beginner on data engineering.\nIf you have some experience on programming and wonder about data engineering, this course is for you.\nIf you have experience in data engineering field, this course might be too basic for you (although I'm very happy if you still purchase the course)\nIf you never write python or SQL before, this course is not for you. To understand the course, you must have basic knowledge on SQL and pyhton.",

Perhaps you've head of assembly in Ethereum smart contracts and heard it can be efficient but dangerous. After you finish this course, you will have a ground-up understanding of what exactly happens when a smart contract receives a function call, how it encodes that data, where exactly it stores it, and how it updates the blockchain state. Even if you don't write contracts in assembly, you will have a much better understanding of solidity's design choices and previously cryptic error messages will make perfect sense.\n\n\nWe will learn how solidity represents various data types, and how we can come up with more efficient representations ourselves depending on the application. We will learn the assumptions solidity makes about memory layout and how to avoid violating those assumptions when we use low level instructions. We will learn what happens behind the scenes when smart contracts make function calls to each other, and how to implement that protocol by hand. And of course, we will build smart contracts from scratch in assembly.\n\n\nNobody can claim to be an expert in solidity without mastering assembly (also known as Yul). So if mastery is your goal, take this class!\n\n\nNote: This class is not for beginners. You should be very comfortable with solidity before taking this course.",

The great thing about serverless is that you don't need to manage any servers!\nIn this course, you will dive right in and learn how to deploy AWS Lambda functions and declare and configure those functions using the AWS SAM Framework (Serverless Application Model).\nIn a nutshell, you will:\nNo longer need to create serverless infrastructures using the AWS Management Console manually\nNow have all your configurations and deployments in one single YAML file\nYou no longer need to package your functions into a zip file and manually upload them to the AWS cloud\nWith the AWS SAM CLI and SAM Framework, you do all that using the Command Line Interface quicker!\nThis is the best time to get well-versed in AWS SAM Framework and AWS Lambda Functions to configure, develop and deploy serverless applications quickly.\n\n\nAWS Lambda functions abstract out all the burden of dealing with servers - you write a function and let AWS take it from there! In addition, you save in cost since you only pay per usage - if your Lambda functions are not running, you don't get billed.\nWith AWS Lambda functions, you can scale out or in quickly without having to reconfigure servers!\n\n\nFor this course, we'll deploy several real-world functions to AWS Lambda:\nAn automated thumbnail generation service on S3 (Python)\nA REST API using AWS API Gateway & Lambda (nodeJS)\nA REST API using AWS API Gateway & Lambda (Python 3)\nAn Email Service Using Lambda, SES, API Gateway, and NextJS for the front-end (NodeJS)\nAn Email Subscriber Service using SNS, API Gateway, S3, EventBridge (Schedule), DynamoDB, Lambda, SendGrid API (NodeJS)\nA Face Recognition Service that recognizes faces and their features\nAmazon Comprehend service paired with EventBridge that emails users on schedule with selected news headlines\nAfter finishing the course, you can write any function you want.\nIn this course, you will be learning, by doing, everything you need to know to be proficient at using AWS Lambda and integrating with many different AWS services through the AWS SAM Framework!\n\nTry this course, and you have 30 days to be refunded if you don't like it. You have nothing to lose!\n\n\n---------------------------------\nThis course also comes with:\nLifetime access to all future updates\nA responsive instructor in the Q&A Section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nA 30-Day \"No Questions Asked\" Money Back Guarantee!\nJoin me in this course if you want to learn about AWS Lambda and the AWS SAM Framework and master the AWS platform!",

This course will start by introducing the complexity of Schedule C to the tax return, identifying the primary areas that will change using practical examples.\nLearners will understand how self-employment tax is calculated when there is schedule C income and how part of the self-employment tax may be included as an adjustment to income.\nThe course will cover the accounting periods and methods that may be appropriate depending on the business needs.\nWe will discuss how to report business income and calculate the cost of goods sold and gross profit if applicable.\nLearners will understand what a business expense is, how to report business expenses, and the most common categories of business expenses. We will show many examples to solidify the concepts.\nWe will learn how to report expenses related to the business use of your home, which can be a significant deduction for many businesses.",

      "description": "Overview\nJavaScript is a programming language that can be run by all modern web browsers. It is downloaded alongside the HTML code of a webpage. Unlike HTML, which can only be used to display content, JavaScript allows web designers to add functionality and interactivity to their websites.\nJQuery is a popular JavaScript library that is used extensively in modern websites. This library facilitates common JavaScript tasks such as animations, event handling, manipulating HTML content, and communication with external servers. In addition to its easy-to-use features, JQuery also takes care of many cross-browser compatibility issues automatically.\nWhat you will learn\nJavascrtipt Modules...\nWe will begin the course by learning where to write JavaScript. We will look at writing JavaScript directly inside an HTML tag, then inside of a <script> tag, and then finally in a file separate from the HTML document. We will discuss some of the reasons for using each method.\nAfter that, we will learn about how to manipulate some basic data types. We will learn about how to do simple arithmetic, and also look at some of JavaScript's built-in mathematical capabilities. Then, we will learn about working with words and characters, using a data type known as the \"string\". We will also cover the Boolean type, which is a representation of True and False inside of a programming language.\nThen we will move on to more complex types. We will learn about the array, which is essentially a list. We will look at how to create arrays, how to access elements inside them, and how to modify the contents of an array. Functions will also be covered, which will allow us to organize code into simple, reusable pieces. We will also learn about objects, which are a way of grouping together data and behaviors.\nWe will then move on to control flow. We will look at the \"if\" statement, which allows the script to decide whether or not to execute a block of code based on some condition. We will also look at looping. Looping refers to repeatedly executing a block of code until some condition is met. Then, we will learn about errors, and how to handle them properly so that they do not halt execution of the script.\nNext, we will look at the Document Object Model ( DOM ). This is what allows JavaScript to interact with the HTML code of a webpage. We will look at several ways of finding any particular HTML element on the page. Then we will see what information we can extract from that element (tag name, attributes,etc.). We will learn about adding and removing elements from a page. Finally, we will learn about events, which allows JavaScript to react to things like mouse clicks, mouse movement, key presses, and many others.\nWe will end the course with a practical exercise, in which we will build a simple JavaScript-based webpage. We will put to use most of the concepts covered in the course. We will look at how to validate user input, how to display results, and how to display meaningful error message to the user.\njQuery Modules...\nWe will begin the course by learning about selectors. Selectors are strings that are used to target specific HTML elements on the page. The selector syntax is highly intuitive and easy to read and understand.\nWe will then move on to events. The student will learn how to write code that reacts to things like mouse clicks, key presses, when the page is done loading, and a few others. These events allow programmers to create interactive user interfaces.\nAfter that, we will move on to effects and animations. Effects are used to hide and show elements. An example would be a menu that slides open when the mouse hovers over it. JQuery has a few built-in effects that can be implemented with minimal coding. For further customization, we will look at animations, which allow programmers to animate most of the visual properties of HTML elements.\nThen we will learn about changing the HTML content of a webpage. This includes adding and removing entire HTML elements, as well as modifying text and other HTML attributes programmatically. We will also learn about how to navigate the tree-like structure of an HTML document using the concept of parent-, sibling-, and child-elements.\nFinally, we will end the course by looking at AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX allows programmers to interact with external servers. To serve as our example, we will read airport data from a public web service. We will learn how to request data, how to handle the response, and how to handle errors.\nPrerequisites\nHTML: The student must know how to use HTML tags and attributes. Only a very basic understanding of HTML is assumed.\nGoogle Chrome (Recommended): Google Chrome is a free web browser and it will be\nused to execute all the examples in this course. Although all browsers can run JavaScript, Chrome has extensive built-in developer tools. In the course, we will be using Chrome's JavaScript console, which will allow us to run quick little examples without the need to create and edit files.\nNotepad++ (Recommended): Notepad++ is a free, open-source text editor. Although JavaScript and HTML can be written using any text editor, Notepad++ is highly recommended because of features such as syntax highlighting and auto-complete.",

      "description": "Note. Our course material is continually evolving. This course will be updated throughout 2023 and is the one stop shop for everything you need to begin designing accessible websites with the new 2.2 criteria.\nThis course will teach you all you need to know about the 9 new WCAG 2.2 success criteria. WCAG 2.2 is here, there’s 9 additional criteria to understand, and let’s be honest … accessibility can be hard to understand with lots of conflicting information and advice. I’ve done the hard work reading, understanding, and decoding the information into this course.\nMaster the new WCAG 2.2 success criteria is the culmination of my research into the 2.2 criteria. I've poured over each criterion, unpicked what it means, tested it, read background information including both the official guidance from the W3C and from the accessibility community to give you the best outcome.\nI don’t just want you to understand the new criteria, I want you to MASTER it!\nI want you to become the guru and to use the new criteria in your work, and confidently apply the techniques and design to the new requirements. I want you to make you the expert on WCAG 2.2!\nI’ve worked hard creating units that are effective at teaching you the 2.2 criteria. Each unit explains one accessibility concept only and after every unit there is a recap to complete. The questions are challenging as research shows when the questions are tough that’s when learning begins, I want you to excel.\nMost units are approximately 5 minutes long with no unit over 7 minutes in length.\nYou will learn:\nAn overview of the 9 new web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) 2.2\nKnow which guidelines are for designers or developers\nRelate the new requirements to real users through the use of personas\nUnderstand design patterns which pass WCAG 2.2\nAvoid design patterns which fail WCAG 2.2\nThis course gives you practical reusable patterns which pass the WCAG 2.2 success criteria.\nAt a glance:\nDesign alternative interactions with criterion 2.5.7 dragging movements\nCreate larger target sizes with 2.5.6 target size (minimum)\nLearn how to create consistency for global help with criterion 3.2.6 consistent help\nPlus, many more!\nWhat’s different about this course:\nThis course uses personas which ground the accessibility requirements to a real person needs. You’ll understand designing better focus appearances means a person like Madhu (featured in the course) who has Glaucoma can more easily use the interface. These personas centre the requirement on the user.\nIt’s practical with lots to take away. I SHOW you what to do to pass a criterion AND what not to do. You won’t be in doubt when thinking how best to pass the new WCAG 2.2 criteria.\nThe design advice has been heavily researched for accuracy. I’ve cross referenced all the information with blogs from leading voices in the accessibility community and web accessibility companies.\nI have over 14 years of experience in the web accessibility industry and run a successful web accessibility company. I’ve worked with large organisations globally. I blog, present, continually research web accessibility and helped make the web more accessible.\nI created the highest rated Udemy course on web accessibility ‘Introduction to Web Accessibility WCAG 2.1’.\nI’ve researched effective learning techniques to create content that encourages deep understanding. Completing this course will allow you to go beyond the superficial and really understand what you need to do to pass WCAG 2.2.\nWho this course is for:\nThis course is for people who are responsible for the design of digital interfaces, who want to use the new 2.2 criteria to make their designs more accessible and user-friendly.",

      "description": "Learn Advanced Microsoft Azure Services from a certified, experienced Azure Architect.\n(See what students of my Azure course are saying about it later on this page)\nMicrosoft Azure is one of the most popular public clouds in the industry, and it gets bigger and bigger by the day. Thousands of organizations, from all sizes and shapes, are moving to the cloud, and being able to work with it is one of the most important skills for every developer, architect, or IT admin.\nGetting familiar with Azure is really important, but that's often not enough.\nEven if you master the basics (VMs, networking, app services, databases etc.) - well, these are just a fraction of the services Azure has to offer.\nThere are hundreds of services in Azure, and you should be familiar with as many as possible on order to really take advantage of the cloud.\nAnd this course does just that - it covers four of the advanced Azure services, which can make your life as an architect and developer much easier.\nThese services are:\n- IOT Hub\n- API Management\n- Notification Hub\n- Cognitive Services\nThese services are extremely useful, and quite easy to use, and I'm sure you'll use them in your cloud apps after you'll learn about them in this course.\nNow, I really wanted to make sure that this course is the best Azure Services course out there, and so I decided to make it a little bit different.\nInstead of going through the various features of the Azure services and just talking about each one of them - this course takes a different approach.\nThis course is the most practical course about Azure services out there.\nYes, we're going to discuss the services, but then we'll actually work with them.\nWe'll create them, configure them, use them, integrate them in a working app, code them, and so much more.\nAfter completing the course, you'll be a real expert in these services!\nAnd note:\nThere is no other course like this!\nThis is the only Azure course that takes you step-by-step through these advanced services in such a thorough and practical way. After completing it - you can definitely call yourself an expert in these services.\n\n\nBut that's not all...\nAt the end of this course, we're going to go through a full blown case study. This case study, of a fictional app named MySceneries, will use all the services we've learned about in this course, and then some, to design a modern, sophisticated and efficient cloud architecture.\nBy the end of the case study, you can download the complete architecture diagram and cost estimation, and use them as a template for your future projects.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do my students have to say about my Azure courses?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"This is the best Azure course I have encountered on Udemy or anywhere. And I say this after buying 8 different Udemy Azure before\" - Arbaaz\n\"One of the best Azure classes in the world\" - Kkvi1357\n\"One of the best courses I've done at Udemy - top among maybe 50-100\" - Russ\n\"Memi is a true architect willing to get his hands dirty!\" - Kevon\n\"Excellent\" - Ashwani\n\"Highly recommended\" - Shashank\n\"I am loving it <3 the best part is the project based learning !\" - Juhi\n\"The best course I have taken on Udemy\" - Eslam\nAnd lots more...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is this course for?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: This is not a beginner course!\nYou're expected to have familiarity with Azure, especially with networking, app services, Function Apps, Cosmos DB and Storage accounts.\nYou don't have to be a full-blown expert, but note that this course builds on previous knowledge.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Me\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been working on Azure for more than 9 years, spanning dozens of customers from various fields - Fortune 100 enterprises, start-ups, govt. entities, defense, telco, banking, and lots more.\nIn addition, I am a certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert.\nI've been in the software industry for more than 20 years, and a Software Architect for more than 17 years, working with a variety of clients.\nI'm an avid speaker and trainer, having trained thousands of students in various courses.\nI love what I do, and my greatest passion (well, besides my family...) is designing modern, practical, and reliable cloud systems for my clients, using the best possible architecture patterns and services.",

This is a mature product with a rich feature-set that has over 80,000 internal users at Microsoft.\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of Azure DevOps?\nReliability\nAs a SaaS offering, Azure DevOps is reliable, scalable and globally available. It is also backed by an SLA of 99.9% uptime and by 24×7 support.\nAccess to the latest features\nAzure DevOps users get access to new features every 3 weeks. Microsoft is transparent, have published the product roadmap and are committed to rapidly iterating on the feature-set.\nEnd of the upgrade cycle\nFor organisations running on-premises CI/CD tooling, upgrades are a regular headache. By moving to a SaaS model, you no longer need to worry about patching and upgrading the toolchain.",

      "description": "Make your Azure environment as secure as possible.\nWorking in the cloud poses unique security challenges. The fact that the cloud is accessible through the internet, and that some services are open to the network by default, makes it an attractive target to attackers.\nAnd that means that you have to make sure your cloud environment is secure. Unsecure environment is an easy target for hackers, which can steal your data, crush your servers, and destroy your reputation.\nAnd this is exactly what this course is all about.\nIn this course we'll learn everything there's to learn about security in Azure. We'll begin from the very basics, the foundations of software security, and go all the way to the most advanced security topics in Azure.\nWe'll learn about the security services in Azure and see how, and when, to use them.\nWe'll also learn how to set a security baseline in Azure and make sure all the resources follow it.\nHere are some of the topics we'll discuss in this course:\n- Basic security principles\n- Security challenges in the cloud\n- Identity security with Azure AD\n- Network security (NSG, Private Endpoints and more)\n- KeyVault\n- Securing Virtual Machines\n- Securing App Services\n- Securing Databases\n- Firewalls\nAnd lots more.\n\n\nBut that's not all. I wanted to make this course as practical as possible, and therefore we're going to have a lot of hands-on work in Azure.\nWe're going to deploy virtual machines and configure them for security, we're going to create KeyVault and store our secrets securely in it, We're going to connect our database to an app service using Private Endpoint, and lots more.\n\n\nAnd to make this course even better - it has the following two additional elements:\n1. Case study, where we're going to begin with a basic, unsecure cloud architecture, and go through all the elements in it and make them secure. You'll be surprised to see the difference between our starting point and the final architecture.\n2. Azure Security Handbook, summarizing what we learn in this course. This downloadable handbook is a great go-to-guide for security in Azure, and it will greatly help you when designing your next cloud architecture (the same way it helps me...)\n\n\nThere is no other course like this! This is the most comprehensive, practical and easy-to-follow course about Azure security. And by the end of this course - you'll be a real Azure Security Expert!\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat do my students have to say about my Azure courses\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"This is the best Azure course I have encountered on Udemy or anywhere. And I say this after buying 8 different Udemy Azure before\" - Arbaaz\n\"One of the best Azure classes in the world\" - Kkvi1357\n\"One of the best courses I've done at Udemy - top among maybe 50-100\" - Russ\n\"Memi is a true architect willing to get his hands dirty!\" - Kevon\n\"Excellent\" - Ashwani\n\"Highly recommended\" - Shashank\n\"I am loving it <3 the best part is the project based learning !\" - Juhi\n\"The best course I have taken on Udemy\" - Eslam\nAnd lots more...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWho is this course for?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAny person who works with Azure will benefit from this course.\nWhether you are a cloud architect, developer or administrator - this course is for you.\nAnd in fact - anyone who's interested in cloud and security can take this course and benefit from it.\nIf you're not sure if this course is for you - drop me a note!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat are the prerequisites for this course?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSome knowledge of Azure and familiarity with the Azure portal is required for this course.\nNote: This is not a beginner course in Azure, and I assume you already know how to work with Azure, create resources in it and work with them.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Me\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been working with Azure for more than 11 years, spanning dozens of customers from various fields - Fortune 100 enterprises, start-ups, govt. entities, defense, telco, banking, and lots more.\nIn addition, I am a certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert and a certified Azure Security Engineer.\nI've been in the software industry for more than 20 years, and a Software Architect for more than 17 years, working with a variety of clients.\nI'm an avid speaker and trainer, having trained thousands of students in various courses.\nI love what I do, and my greatest passion (well, besides my family...) is designing modern, practical, and reliable systems for my clients, using the best possible architecture patterns and services.",

These include pre-rendering with Server-side Rendering or Static Generation, and updating or creating content at runtime with Incremental Static Regeneration. It can make your applications very fast!\nDuring the course, we'll cover the most important topics.\nThere're presented TDD or TLD approaches that I'll try to practice with you during the coding sessions. Probably you don't have enough experience with the tests, but it's ok, there's still an excellent way to learn it from the course. When you work with code and cover it with test cases, it provides you with guarantees that your code works as you expected. This is the purpose and benefit of the tests.\nTools for testing: Jest, React Testing Library\nStorybook is the most popular way to build the components library. From our side, it's the most basic part of the course. We'll install and configure Storybook, which will provide us with a full components spec. This approach is called Components Driven Development.\nCSS-IN-JS, EmotionJS, and Styled-Components are very powerful toolkits to build UI components. Even very complex component styles can be easily produced and supported by it.\nWe create Dark and Light modes for your application with EmotionJS and styled-components API and NextJS!\nGitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want. We create our deployment workflow!\nLast but not least it's Redux. Redux is a beautiful way to manage an application state. We'll use the Redux-Toolkit library - it simplifies the work with Redux.\nCheck out the full curriculum and free preview videos.

      "description": "AWS Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) is one of the key AWS Services used in building large-scale data processing leveraging Big Data Technologies such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Hive, etc. As part of this course, you will end up learning AWS Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) by building end-to-end data pipelines leveraging Apache Spark and AWS Step Functions.\nHere is the detailed outline of the course.\nFirst, you will learn how to Get Started with AWS Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) by understanding how to use AWS Web Console to create and manage EMR Clusters. You will also learn about all the key features of Web Console and also how to connect to the master node of the cluster and validate all the important CLI interfaces such as spark-shell, pyspark, hive, etc as well as hdfs and aws CLI commands.\nOnce you understand how to get started with AWS EMR, you will go through the details related to Setting up Development Cluster using AWS EMR. There are quite a few advantages to using AWS EMR Clusters for development purposes and most enterprises do so.\nAfter setting up a development cluster using AWS EMR, you will go through the Development Life Cycle of Spark Applications using AWS EMR Development Cluster. You will be using Visual Studio Code Remote Development on top of the AWS EMR Development Cluster to go through the details.\nOnce the development is done, you will go through the details related to Deploying Spark Application on AWS EMR Cluster. You will build the zip file and understand how to run using CLI in both clients as well as cluster deployment modes. You will also understand how you can deploy the spark application as a step on AWS EMR Clusters. You will also understand the details related to troubleshooting the issues related to Spark Applications by going through relevant logs.\nTypically we run Spark Applications programmatically. After going through the details related to deploying spark applications on AWS EMR Clusters, you will be learning how to Manage AWS EMR Clusters using Python Boto3. You will not only learn how to create clusters programmatically but also how to deploy Spark Applications as Steps programmatically using Python Boto3.\nEnd to End Data Pipelines using AWS EMR is built using AWS Step Functions. Once you understand how to manage EMR Clusters using Python Boto3 and also deploy Spark Applications on EMR Clusters using the same, it is important to learn how to Build EMR-based Workflows or Pipelines using AWS Step Functions. You will be learning how to create the cluster, deploy Spark Application as Step on to the cluster, and then terminate the cluster as part of a basic pipeline or State Machine using AWS Step Functions.\nYou will also learn how to perform validations as part of State Machines by Enhancing AWS EMR-based State Machine or Pipeline. You will check if the files specified already exist as part of the validations.\nWe can also build Data Processing Applications or Pipelines using Spark SQL on AWS EMR. First, you will learn how to design and develop solutions using Spark SQL Script, how to validate by using appropriate commands by passing relevant runtime arguments, etc.\nOnce you understand the development process of implementing solutions using Spark SQL on AWS EMR, you will learn how to deploy Data Pipeline using AWS Step Function to deploy Spark SQL Script on EMR Cluster. You will also learn the concept of Boto3 Waiters to make sure the steps are executed in a linear fashion.",

It is an open protocol, meaning that it is freely available for anyone to use.\nThe OCPP protocol is designed to support a wide range of charging station hardware and software configurations, including single chargers and charging networks. It is also designed to support multiple EV charging technologies, such as AC charging and DC charging.\nIn our online course on the OCPP protocol, we provide a comprehensive overview of the key concepts, structure, and functionality of OCPP-compatible systems. We cover topics such as:\nThe basic structure and components of an OCPP-based charging system\nThe different types of messages and data exchanged between the charging station and a central management system\nThe different types of commands and responses used in OCPP communications, including start, stop and status commands\nThe different types of authorization and payment methods supported by OCPP, such as RFID card and mobile app\nThe different types of error handling mechanisms supported by OCPP, including fault codes and error messages\nThrough our lessons and quizzes, participants will learn how to effectively use OCPP-based communications to manage and operate EV charging systems. We also provide practical examples to help participants understand how OCPP is used.\nUpon completion of the course, participants will have the skills and knowledge to work effectively with EV charging systems that use OCPP. They will be able to troubleshoot and resolve common issues, and manage charging session information needed for billing. Our course is suitable for charging station operators, fleet managers, and EV enthusiasts who want to learn more about the OCPP protocol and how it is used in the EV charging industry.",

This course is for the IT professional (and final year students) who have some professional experience (or no professional experience at all) and wants a short , direct, solid, to the point and deep introduction of Spring framework based Microservice development. It specifically eliminates all unnecessary theory and tries to link the student's existing knowledge in making him / her realize that a significant portion of Microservice development is not any different from regular java REST service development. The direct approach tries to reduce learning curve and speed up the learning processes. It demystifies Microservice development at a fast pace. For example, it stresses that after all, Microservices are services themselves. If someone is already confident in designing legacy monolithic REST services, a lot of those skills transfers directly to Microservice development as well. At the same time, it highlights specific areas where Microservice development has solid differences from legacy service development. This course thus, will focus on two aspects of the students background\n1. What he / she already knows about service development and how that skill still is useful in Microservice development.\n2. What he / she needs to know new about  Microservice development.\nWe cover several topics including Spring Framework Dependency Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming, Spring Boot based Microservice development ,which will add confidence to the student and his/her ability to do Spring Boot, as well as some of the heavily used Spring Cloud Netflx stack of libraries including\n\n1. Spring Cloud Service Discovery.\n2. Spring Cloud Config Service using Github\n3. Spring Cloud Config Client\n4. Spring Cloud Deteriorative Client Feign\n5. Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker Hystrix\nLastly, we use a custom loan application domain as a field to explore Microservice development.",

      "description": "Latest Update\nWith more than 4 hours update of the latest and greatest tech updates, and a real-life project experience, you'll feel like you've been transported to a parallel universe where GraphQL rules all. You'll learn how to:\n\n\nDefine GraphQL models like a boss\nCraft database schemas with the precision of a samurai\nControl multiple GraphQL services with the flick of a wrist\nTame database migration with Flyway, like a wild stallion\nBuild queries and mutations that would make Linus Torvalds nod in approval\nTackle the N+1 problem like a superhero\nUse dynamic filtering, sorting, and pagination on GraphQL queries like a magician\nTrace and limit complexities with GraphQL instrumentation like a detective\nValidate inputs with custom validations for business rules like a judge\nUpload files like a pro\nUpdate existing data with mutations like a ninja\nCombine multiple GraphQL services like a superhero team\nLoad data from other GraphQL and non-GraphQL services like a wizard\nSolve the GraphQL N+1 problem with data loaders like a detective\nImplement Apollo federation for combining multiple GraphQL services like a king\nDon't miss out on the opportunity to level up your skills, impress your coworkers, and become the office GraphQL guru. Enroll now and get ready for the ride of a lifetime!\n\n\nWhat Is Graph?\nI am graph, I go to work on graph. It's everywhere, really. I have a sister. Both of us has same parents. Our mom has parents, which is our grandparents from mom's side. And so our dad, which means we have grandparents from dad's side. And together, this is he \"myself\" graph. Tweet something on twitter, and it's a graph. See: 8 people likes the tweet, and 3 people retweet my original tweet, so this is the graph.\n\n\nWhat Is QL?\nQL in GraphQL is shorthand for query language. If it seems familiar, you are right. SQL, or the structured query language, has the same shorthand. SQL used to read and manipulate data in database. During SQL read, we can select multiple columns as we need, from one table, or several connected tables, usually through foreign key. The same way with GraphQL. Like SQL, a single GraphQL query can return multiple columns from connected data. We can also use GraphQL to change or remove data.\n\n\nSo What is GraphQL?\nGraphQL is a query language which uses graph concept. GraphQL is also a runtime that needs to be implemented on the backend, so the frontend application can use it as the query language.\nTo implement graphql, we need runtime frameworks, which each programming language has their own implementation. GraphQL itself is a specification, means whatever the framework, it must comply to the graphql specification, so the user can use GraphQL without even need to know what the GraphQL backend language is.\nGraphQL is a service, where we need two items for creating Graphql backend. First, is the schema, which represents GraphQL structure. It is like database tables and relationships. Second is the resolver, which is logic for each field on schema to represents data. A resolver tells how and where to access certain field. For example, whether to get field's data from database, or text file.\nSome says GraphQL is \"REST API killer\", \"The next REST API\", et cetera.\nBut what is GraphQL and why facebook, netflix, github, and some large names shift their technology to GraphQL? Is it true that GraphQL is \"REST API killer\"? Or the contrary, it is \"REST API friend\"?\nIn this course, we will learn the GraphQL fundamentals, including data types, schemas, and graphql operations. We will learn using Java Spring Boot and Netflix DGS framework to easily build GraphQL Java application. In this course, we will not only learn theories, but do a hands-on coding using PostgreSQL as database.\nComplete source code is provided for the course, so you will always stay up-to-date and have reference in case you are having difficulty (believe me, GraphQL will not that hard). If you are new to GraphQL, or if you've been trying to find out how to implement your own GraphQL server (especally using Java), but sometimes feel like you still don't quite understand, then this GraphQL course is absolutely suitable for you!\nIn this course, we will learn:\nWhat is GraphQL\nGraphQL schema, data types, and relationships\nCustom GraphQL data types\nCreating your own GraphQL backend using Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL database\nWe will learn using Netflix GraphQL framework (Netflix DGS)\nSecuring GraphQL endpoint\nand manymore\nIf you ever writing REST API before, this course will expand your knowledge and see how easy you can implement GraphQL fundamental. It's not very different with REST API implementation, but at some aspects, it's more powerful.\n\n\nTake the course and experience yourself!\n\n\nSpring Boot Version\nThis course uses Spring Boot version 3.x. Most of the code will still works with Spring Boot version 2.x, but for best learning experience, it is reccomended that you use latest Spring Boot version 3.x",

Isn’t there anything we can do to improve iterative development?\nIn this course, you will see how a complex object-oriented design can grow iteratively, in very small steps. In every step, we will be adding one complete feature to the program, while at the same time paying due attention to principles of good object-oriented design. The end result will be a complex application which is still flexible and extensible - exactly the way we always wanted our object-oriented code to be.\nIn four and a half hours of this course, you will learn how to control design of classes, design of complex algorithms, and how to recognize and implement data structures.\nAfter completing this course, you will know how to develop a large and complex domain model, which you will be able to maintain and extend further.

It involves activities like:\nMonitoring devices in the network\nProvisioning of services\nDiagnosing networking problems\nPlanning for optimum network performance\nDetecting security breaches\nAssessing the impact of planned network maintenance\nITU-T defined Telecom Management Network model (TMN) as a protocol for management of open-systems in any telecom network. TMN is a support network that interfaces the telecom networks, to provide means for transporting and processing operations, administration, maintenance, provisioning and management information. It basically provides a framework, for achieving interconnectivity and communication across heterogeneous operation systems, and telecommunications networks.\nThe course includes details on F CAPS which plays a key role in any telecommunication network. These management functions help in management of network, for deriving optimum performance. Shortly,\nF → Fault Management\nC → Configuration Management\nA → Accounting Management\nP → Performance Management\nS → Security Management\nThe course includes Southbound and Northbound interfaces.\nThe Southbound Interfaces, or SB eyes are those that help the Network Management Systems connect to the Network Elements, and manage them. Its main objective is to provide communication, and management between the network's SDN controller, and physical or virtual switches and routers.\nThe Northbound Interfaces, or NB eyes are those that help the Network Management Systems, connect to OSS systems. They are used to enable Alarm, Performance, Inventory, Provisioning, Configuration, and Security related information of the Network Elements, and forwards it to the high-level management systems, typically referred to as the OSS systems.\nSome of the concepts covered in the learning are TACACS, LDAP, SNMP, CORBA, XML, MTOSI, SOAP and important APIs in telecom.\nJoin us to explore all these and more on Telecom Management Network Model.",

You will learn about the new language features, how they make programming in C++ less painful and more productive, and how to use them idiomatically,\nIf you're used to traditional C++, Modern C++ will feel like a different language. It is safer, more expressive and more efficient. With Modern C++, you no longer need to work with explicit pointers to memory, which you have to allocate and release yourself. Complex loops can be greatly simplified, or even avoided altogether. Better abstractions remove the amount of \"boilerplate\" code you have to type in, leaving you free to concentrate on the problem you are trying to solve.\nModern C++ will reduce your development time and make your code easier to maintain and more likely to be correct and efficient. It avoids many situations which cause undefined program behaviour, resulting in less time spent on debugging and fewer defect reports.\nThe course begins with a review of C++ as of the 1998/2003 standards, including exceptions, templates and the Standard Template Library. If you have not used C++ for some time, this will allow you to revise and refresh your existing knowledge.\nWe then cover the changes in 2011 and 2014, starting with the core language and the standard library. Important new features such as lambda expressions, move semantics and multithreading have their own sections. Finally, there is some advice on how to use good practice when writing Modern C++ code.\nEach lecture contains a demonstration of the features being covered and has downloadable resources: the source code used in the video, exercises and solutions for the exercises. These are fairly simple and test your understanding of the topic you have just learnt.\nThere are also occasional assignments. These are more challenging than the lecture exercises.\nAfter successfully completing this course, you will have a good knowledge of the new features in Modern C++ and how to use them.",

Why should you trust me you ask? I have personally used Discord since its inception and have managed to establish, build, grow and develop 3 extremely Discord servers that currently have 51,000, 8,300 and 3,000 members. I have helped friends and other Discord server owners run and establish servers that currently have 100,000+ members or so. In short, I know what I'm talking about and have always loved the idea of being able to share my wealth of knowledge to even more people and companies out there!\n\n\nYou see, I believe Discord is a very powerful tool and when used right, can not only help build up your brand/community, but can also help you generate a bit of money for yourself or your company. YouTubers, Twitch streamers, million dollar companies and other business entities are slowly starting to use Discord as a means of growing their customer base. The best part about all of this is they're no better than you and I as I truly believe, anybody can grow an exceptionally successful Discord server if they're determined enough and are driven enough to do so. Sounds convincing enough? Well, lets get into what this course is going to provide then, shall we?\n\n\nThe main aim of this course is to help give you the confidence needed to not only start your very own Discord server, but to also help establish, build and organically grow your very own server, so that you too, can either choose to monetize it or simply choose to expand your community and/or brand to more people on the interwebs! Thus, in this course, you'll be exposed to some of the following important topics:\nWhat is Discord, why is it important and how is it similar to Facebook and Instagram in a sense\nHow to create a Discord account\nHow to navigate around the Discord Interface and User & Server setting sections\nHow to setup text channels, voice channels and channel permissions\nHow to setup roles and their permissions\nHow to make your server more appealing to one's eyes\nHow to use chat syntax and markdown to make your text look more engaging\nHow to create a Discord server outline and the important things to plan for when looking to establish a new server\nHow to use Canva to create server graphics\nWhat are Discord bots, why are they important and which bots do I recommend you to use and for what purposes\nHow to create an efficient support section on your server\nHow to grow your Discord server and how you can use different techniques (including paid and unpaid methods) to grow your server organically in the long-run\nHow to run adverts on your server\nHow to monetize your server\nHow I personally managed to grow my server to 51,000 members and what I have learnt through my own set of experiences this far\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Lets turn you into a Discord guru, it's time to change your life.\nPeace and love,\nSaif",

We'll also delve into the merging techniques essential for maintaining a clean and efficient pipeline workflow.\nWe then transition into the environment setup necessary for building CI/CD pipelines. This section covers the integration of Azure DevOps with the Azure Databricks workspace, setting up branch protection to safeguard your code, and implementing effective merging strategies. Each concept is accompanied by a hands-on demonstration to ensure you can apply these techniques in your own projects.\nNext, we dive into the Continuous Integration (CI) process. I’ll guide you through the setup of the CI pipeline, explaining the YAML configuration files in detail, and demonstrating how to automate the validation and integration of your code changes. You’ll learn how to build the CI/CD pipeline from scratch, using YAML files to streamline the entire process.\nAfter establishing the CI pipeline, we shift our focus to Continuous Deployment (CD). Here, you'll learn how to configure the deployment process to automatically push changes from the development environment to the production Databricks workspace, ensuring a smooth and error-free transition.\nFinally, we address the critical aspect of setting up permissions for the production environment. You’ll learn how to manage access controls to protect your production environment and ensure that only authorized changes are deployed. We’ll wrap up the course with a comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that all components work together seamlessly and that the deployment process is fully reliable.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a deep understanding of how to build, configure, and manage CI/CD pipelines for Azure Databricks, along with practical skills that you can apply directly to your projects.",

I tried my best to present CMDB and Discovery together because you cannot separate CMDB from Discovery.\n\n\nIt is crucial to understand:-\nWhy is discovery essential for organisations?\nWhat is CMDB? Why do we maintain any CMDB?\nHow CMDB & Discovery are related to each other?\nWhat is the reason behind updating CMDB?\nHow do Discovery and CMDB affect enterprise decision-making?\nIs it possible to manage without CMDB?\nWhat is the right way to set up, manage and discover devices?\nWhat is the actual mechanism of the ECC Queue, MID Server and many more?\nHow to do cloud discovery in a real-time environment?\nWhy is Service Mapping making the life of decision-makers so easy?\nHow are different types of ServiceNow discoveries different but still connected?\nHow can you practice real-time scenarios for CMDB and discovery in ServiceNow PDI for free?\nIn this course, we have done our best to provide industry-led examples and real-time scenarios. Whenever possible, we have simulated the real-time network setup to give learners enterprise exposure.\n\n\nThis course is based on the latest ServiceNow - Washington DC release version.",

We will start from 0, so no knowledge of any programming language is necessary. But at the same time, we will go quickly with the most fundamental sections that are typical and common for any programming language.\n\n\nFirst, we will see how to work with REXX in the Windows environment so that you can also use it for personal tasks and to facilitate your routines. We will work with a very intuitive and useful text editor for programming and test the REXX instructions in an interactive way.\nWe will see how to interact with the Windows operating system and how to handle files, we will also see how to execute MS-DOS commands.\n\n\nThen, we will see how to use REXX on z/OS. I will tell you how to get access to a Mainframe with z/OS so that you can access it from your computer and run your REXX programs IBM operating system. This environment is the original system where REXX was created. We will apply everything we have learned during the Windows phase and look at the specific options for working with REXX on z/OS (the latest operating system from IBM).\nWe will get the most out of REXX by creating interactive panels, handling datasets, and interacting with z/OS.\n\n\nDuring the course, we will find simple tests and practical assignments to be able to review and apply what we are learning. I will review those assignments personally.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy it and you find this course helpful. I'm attentive to my email, so you can contact me with any need.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nWish you the best!",

The true potential of WebRTC is limited primarily due to the lack of knowledge around the subject. WebRTC is a culmination of the development of Internet technology over the last 20 Years. It uses several protocols that have existed since the year 2000. This makes it a very complex technology to learn. The goal of this course is to smoothen this learning curve while not losing focus on the concepts that make it such a powerful technology.\nThis is a very practical oriented course. We will be making 2 Real World Applications. A Real-time chat application as well as a Video Chat Application. Not just that, this is a never-ending course!

      "description": "Design Patterns are a way to solve common object oriented design problems. But understanding and learning design patterns is hard and takes time. Looking at a pattern is like looking at a solution without a problem, unless you've encountered the problem in the past.\nThis course aims to help you understand & implement Creational Design Patterns. Each pattern is explained with multiple examples and through modern C++. This helps you understand how the pattern can be implemented efficiently using language features. The examples do not involve cars, pizzas, ducks, coffee, etc. These topics are rarely used while building real-world software. Instead I provide real-world  examples written in Modern C++. These examples will compile & execute on any platform that supports a C++ compiler.\nThis is how the course teaches creational patterns.\nThe intent, structure of the pattern is explained through UML class diagram.\nBasic implementation details of the pattern are explained.\nThe pattern is implemented in a simple example.\nYou get familiar with the overall implementation of the pattern.\nAnother example is introduced that has design issues the pattern aims to resolve.\nWe examine the issues and refactor the code by applying the design pattern step by step.\nAlternative scenarios & examples are explained along with differences between them. You also learn how to decide between different alternatives.\nI discuss the pattern in context of C++ and how to tweak it for performance, reusability & maximum flexibility.\nFinally, you'll learn when to use the pattern and its pros & cons.\nThis is an intensive discussion that spans multiple lectures. At the end of each section, you'll understand the pattern in depth and can apply it in your code or easily clear any design interview.",

This includes Google Earth, Sentinel Hub, various browser tools, and search engine use. It also touches on common analytical pitfalls, data handling, Google dorking, and ethics of investigations.\nWhile this course is beginner-friendly, it assumes an understanding of good journalistic or research practices to enable participants the best path to conducting ethical investigations. Participants only require an internet-connected computer and the free software options discussed in this course. While a good computer is not required, some of the tools can be a bit demanding on older processors, so patience may be needed. Not all tools will run on all operating systems, but the premise and techniques taught will.",

Our course covers all the aspects and features you need to know before starting your next project or moving your software to a docker based system.\nDocker is an open-source tool that allows developers to wrap their codes into small containers or packets, along with everything that would be required for the code to run. This code can then be shipped to any other system (regardless of its operating system and supporting hardware), and be deployed on that particular system. Along with the software, Docker containers also include code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and etc. in the container itself.\nSounds amazing, right? A portable software that runs on every environment without having to create virtual machines? We think so too! So, we designed this Docker course to help you learn Docker from scratch.\nDesigned for beginners, this course holds no presumptions. You do not need to know about Docker, containerization or even virtual machines. You only need to know simple Linux commands, that’s it!\nEverything else will be covered in this comprehensive course.\nYou will learn a basic introduction to DevOps, containerization, a background of Docker including what is Docker and its role in today’s tech driven world. You will learn how to download and install Docker, learn about its command line, understand the container environment, build a container from scratch, understand how a Docker container operates including storage, networking, mitigating risks, different types of containers, using memory, packing software within containers, automation, distribution, etc.\nAt the end of this course, you will have a clear understanding of what is Docker and how you can use Docker to simplify developing and testing software and even apps. So, what are you waiting for? This course is just what the ‘Docker’ ordered!",

There is always some type of customization to be done. Always some feature that the standard HMI software does not offer.\nAnd sometimes, using a very expensive HMI with all sorts of bells and whistles for a small project can just be overkill. There are times when you just need a very simple application that acquires a few data points from a Modbus network and displays them on a computer screen.\nThese are the reasons for this course!\nI teach you how to use FREE TOOLS with some basic programming to create your own Modbus Master application and Human Machine Interface.\n\nIf you apply yourself in this course and execute all that I ask you to do, then at the end, you would have a finished Windows Modbus Application that you can customize to your heart's content!\nThis is the start of your journey into a whole new area of Process Automation / SCADA and one that is increasingly in very high demand!\nLooking forward to seeing you on the inside!",

In this course, we teach an ordinary beginner to develop Python applications for very useful AI applications using Face Recognition. This course begins with a historical perspective of Face recognition and its importance in the AI-enabled world. We also give the algorithms used in research for some high-level understanding. We first write a Python program to read an image and identify all faces in the image. We explain the concept of face signature. The next chapter is about developing a program to compute the face signature. We then write Python programs to read faces and compare the signatures and recognize resemblances. We explain the process to create a face recognition application using the data. We write the complete program to recognize the faces of all known people. We also write a program to recognize faces from the CCTV footage. We coach the reader to understand the applications of face recognition and motivate them towards developing new applications. The tests are given at the end of each section help to summarize the understanding to build further in the right understanding.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand the field of face recognition as a branch of biometrics and algorithms and approaches.\nInstall Python Face Recognition and PIL (Python Image Library) with all required libraries.\nDevelop Python programs to locate human faces in a picture and make them in the image.\nDevelop Python programs to compare faces and recognize resemblance between faces and Identify a person when they appear in front of a camera.\nConduct project work to develop a full-face recognition-based employee attendance system.\nSyllabus\nUnit – I Introduction to Face Recognition\nIntroduction to Python Face Recognition Library –Installation of the library - Introduction to Face Recognition Concepts and Face Signature – Mathematical Techniques and algorithms for Face Recognition.\nUnit – 2 Python Image Library\nRepresentation of Images in Python – Python Image Library(PIL) – Loading a picture and identification of faces – Functions and methods of Python Image Library – Displaying Faces using Python methods\nUnit – 3 Face Detections and Face Locations\nPython methods for detecting faces in a group photo – counting the number of faces in a picture – Identifying all faces in a group photo and marking them as rectangular frames – Writing labels on marked faces\nUnit – 4 Face Encodings and Resemblance detection\nFace Encodings – Distance Function and finding the resemblance – Resemblance Detection – Resemblance examples for mothers and daughters – Compare faces and detecting the name from data files – Face Recognition – methods and examples\nUnit – 5 Face Recognition based Attendance management system\nCapture the face of a person using the laptop camera – Attendance Recording based on Face Recognition - Announcing the name – Writing the name and display in display – Create sample database – Implement a live system",

After this course, you will be able to do any real life project. After learning any software when we start any project we face many real world data problems. This course covers all the task that are required to handle any type of GIS data. Even non GIS data to GIS.\nThe theory behind tools, how it works. Hands-on tools.  Perfect Mosaic in Erdas, satellite data, Digital Elevation Model, Most of the things covered that required for Mast of GIS students, PhD students and Civil Engineers, Irrigation and Hydrology Engineers. If you have missed your practical classes of GIS, then this course is for you. It covers the whole practical syllabus of GIS, even more than it. It also covers Error resolving is software, issue with Satellite data. Compared same task output on different software. This will enable you to do any real life project. Content are decide based on real life problems which my Engineer student faced in field. Sometimes satellite image not provide sharp resolution data then we take Help of Google Earth, How use that Data in GIS. Even how we can use our Good Android Phone to Survey up to 3meter GPS accuracy by calibration its GPS. Later how we can use in GIS. Other than working with Data we need to represent in Best way. A best presentation of Data is considered to be Good work, so I have also covered how to make research ready GIS layouts. How we can improve satellite image improve resolution up to 15 meter and Processing of 10-meter satellite data. Getting Earthwork of Reservoir volume, converting to 3D. Mosaicking of Digital Elevation Model. Getting Drainage and watershed, stream order. Changing the projection of data. Advance labelling using scripts. Handling NetCDF data. Generation annual rainfall map and interpolation of Data. On Other side NDVI is covered. Cutting Study area for the project and deleting bad data from satellite image and vector files using smart tricks covered. How to reference data without latitude longitude and make it usable. Even how to get street level data from online sources and convert to GIS format. Cutting shapes with shapes. Handling attributes and calculation on that. Data conversion between raster and vector of multiple type. Small mini project also shown how to use a combination of tools to do one task. Even to find the right UTM Zone for your area. Also covers Excel data to GIS. Getting lat long,  Making Grid, If you missed your GIS practical classes, then it is for you.\nCovered 90% hands on and 10% theory on basics.\nIt does not matter which version of the software you have. Tool covered applicable to all version of ArcGIS 10.1 or 10.7 or above. Similarly Applicable to all versions of Erdas 2015 or 2018 and above.\nTry Not to jump between videos, many future video required concept covered in past videos.\nonline courses in gis and remote sensing\nbasic gis and mapping,\nbasic gis and mapping essential\ngis course for beginners\nthe basic concept of gis\ngeospatial analysis\nReal-life GIS Problems that solved by this course\nIn real life GIS project, we face many problems,\nLike We get data but not from toposheet\nOr we have the number of Excel sheets that need to convert to map,\nThe study area lies in Two or more satellite images that are totally different.\nSometime Station data not available for weather analysis.\nCounting vegetation in a fraction of second NDVI\nor, Still typing attribute open by one.\nStill making road maps by Digitizing, When QGIS helps a lot in combination with ArcGIS\nWant to represent multiple labels in Shapefile\nMouse control is not good, autocorrection\nAdvanced Editing of Shapefiles.\nThe Best one Presenting work in the Best way so that everyone thinks, you really did Much Hard work.\nThe best way of result presentation like high impact factor journals,\nThen This course is for you.",

      "description": "For a student of electrical engineering or for a practicing electrical technician, getting started with simulating electrical circuits can be challenging. Even more so in the case of power electronics where circuits are non-linear. This course introduces the process of simulation and also provides basic theory lectures to help you understand how simulations can be used to learn how power converters work.\nThis course uses only free and open source software. The course will have lectures to show you how to download and install each software. All software are compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac OS and you can follow this course whatever operating system you prefer to use. The course also has a basic tutorial on Python programming to help you with writing control code for electrical circuits. The course uses the free and open source circuit simulator Python Power Electronics. You can use other simulators if you are already using them. However, all examples in this course will use Python Power Electronics as I would like all students registered for the course to be able to access a circuit simulator and not all simulators are free to use.\nThis course is not a comprehensive course on power electronics. I will not be covering a vast number of power converters. Instead, this course focuses on depth. The lectures will have code along sessions where I will be building simulations from scratch and will be switching back and forth between theory presentations and simulation results to understand how circuits work. The course will not be heavily mathematical but on the contrary will use fundamental concepts of Physics to understand how power converter circuits.\nIn order to successfully complete this course, a student is required to have some basic electrical knowledge. This implies basic network laws - Kirchoff's Voltage Law, Kirchoff's Current Law, Ohm's Law. These would be taught in first year of electrical engineering. Other than that, you do not need to have prior knowledge of power electronics or analog electronics. A student will also be required to have some basic knowledge of programming. This course uses Python. However, if a student has used any other high level language such as C, C++, Java etc, that would do as well. Expert knowledge of programming is not necessary. This course however, should not be a student's very first time coding.",
