All topics in the exam are covered and few more topics which are required to be known by an architect are also provided.\n\n\nWe have been working on OCI since 2018 ( infact in Oracle Cloud - Classic for a few years before that). We have been through the entire evolution of OCI since its inception and have shared whatever knowledge we have about OCI.\n\n\nWe will be updating the content with videos as and when required. The course will be maintained for the 2025 certification also.\n\n\nPlease note, In the videos where the lab demonstrations are given we may have used the words/phrases - Labs or Demo or Hands-on or Practices - all these are synonymous in nature.\n\n\nThe UI for the Browser Console has changed recently, the features remain the same. From time to time Oracle does change the look and feel of the Browser console, we will not be creating new videos to reflect the same, but whenever there is a change in the functionality or feature, we will surely make new videos.\n\n\nDo inform us in comments about the benefit you got from the course. We look forward to hear from you any feedback that will make the course better.\n\n\nWe wish you all the best! Happy Learning!!!",

While I am personally a PSD, PSM1, PSPO1, and PAL certified (so enough experience and success to provide insight about this topic), this question pool is exactly what helped me to pass that very difficult exam with over 93% of success. I approve personally every single question available here and i assure you that they will appear in the exam or at least with some similarities!\n\nThese questions cover totally the PSD syllabus as provided by the scrum organisation, and are empirically proven to sustain and support the PSD exam. Some of them appear straight in the exam, some of them in some other form. What you should focus on the most is understanding the essence of every question, not learning by heart, so you can face the real questions of the exam which are derived from them, but dont look necessary like them.\n\nSo the success receipt for the PSD exam will be, according to my own experience:\n1) Work on this practice test until you get 100% easily in every mock exam in less than 15 min.\n2) Do the scrum developer open assessment available on the certification's website and do it multiple time until you get 100% consistently.\n3) Read some material in the internet about testing (ISTQB Syllabus), CI/CD (DevOps foundation) and Xtreme Programming (XP).\n4) I insist on this, and can repeat it undefinitly because it is the only wisdom and way to get the PSD: Understand the essence & meaning of every question, don't learn answers by heart! You are a god-damn smart human!\n\nAll feedbacks are welcome in the comment section, dont hesitate to write to me about anything good or bad related to this material so i can practice \"continuous improvement\"! #InspectionAndAdaptation\n\nPlus I give it to you with the cheapest price possible on Udemy, so dont hesitate to take on this scrum journey!

The CompTIA A+ certification tops Global Knowledge's list of top-paying certifications because it's a vendor-neutral certification that will help you land many well-paid, entry-level jobs.\n\n\nWhat is the CompTIA A+ certification?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification can be considered an entry-level certificate for IT professionals. Getting a CompTIA A+ certificate can lead to a successful IT career. CompTIA created this certificate for people seeking employment as a help desk, support, service center, or networking technician. The CompTIA A+ certification exam covers PC and laptop hardware, software installation, the configuration of computer and mobile operating systems, basic networking, troubleshooting, and security skills. Many enterprises require a CompTIA A+ certificate for their entry-level information technology jobs. Passing the CompTIA A+ certification exam can also serve as a springboard towards other technology certificates and career advancements.\nDo I need CompTIA A+ for Network+?\nGetting the CompTIA A+ certification is not a requirement to get a Network+ certification. Each certification covers a separate area of computer technology. The A+ certification will test your knowledge of PC hardware, mobile device hardware, operating systems, security, cloud computing, and troubleshooting hardware and network connectivity. It consists of two tests. You can acquire the Network+ plus certification by passing one test.

The second exam tests the knowledge of software troubleshooting, installing operating systems, configuring operating systems, and security. The passing score for the first exam, 220-1001, is 675 out of a scale of 100-900. For the second exam, 220-1002, a passing score is 700 out of a scale of 100-900. This means that to pass the first test, you need to answer at least 69 out of 90 questions correctly. Whereas for the second test, you need to have 70 correct out of 90.\nIs CompTIA A+ worth it?\nMany entry-level IT jobs require an A+ certification. It proves to the business you are applying to that you have basic IT knowledge. They want to know that you can do the work and don't need basic training. If you have no experience in the industry, having a CompTIA A+ certificate can get you an entry-level job. After that, you can specialize, add other certifications, and advance in your career. The CompTIA A+ certificate has been the first step in a successful career for many IT professionals.\nWhat are the objectives of the CompTIA A+ exam?\nThe test objectives are to ensure that an aspiring IT professional has the basic knowledge for an entry-level information technology job. CompTIA A+ applicants should be able to assemble components based on customer requirements.

CompTIA A+ applicants should have basic troubleshooting skills to diagnose, resolve, and document common hardware and software issues. They should know how to provide essential customer support. They should also understand the basics of scripting, virtualization, desktop imaging, and deployment.\nWhat jobs can I get with CompTIA A+?\nThe CompTIA A+ certification is the industry standard for a career in IT and is the preferred credential for technical support and IT operational roles. One job a person with an A+ certificate may choose is IT support specialist. An IT support specialist is responsible for installing and configuring computer hardware and software, monitoring and maintaining computer networks, and providing technical support across a company.

That's a mistake and definitely not the same as truly *understanding* the materials. If you're only taught how to add 1+1 and you're asked to add 2+2 on the test, you may not necessarily know how to. But if you're taught how to add any numbers together, the test will suddenly appear much easier!\nCheck the course's curriculum, and you'll see that all the crucial parts of the AWS Developer Associate certification were included in the course. Each chapter has its own practical cases, and there will never be a moment where you'll feel lost!\nIn any case, Matthew will be here for you and answer any questions you may have, and he'll constantly update and improve the course's content.

Data cleaning is always a big hassle, especially if we are short on time and want to deliver crucial data analysis insights to our audience.\nBut how can we be more efficient in the ETL/ Data Prep process? How can this process be more FUN?\nMeet KNIME!\nA great tool which comes to our rescue. KNIME allows us to do data preparation / data cleaning in a very appealing drag and drop interface. (No coding experience is required yet it still allows us if we want to use languages like R, Python or Java. So, we can code if we want but don’t have to!). The flexibility of KNIME makes that happen.\n\n\nHi guys and welcome back\n\n\nIn this course we build on our knowledge from the KNIME - a crash course for beginners class. So I assume you have worked with KNIME before as we do not cover all the basics. So if you are completely new to KNIME then please start with the crash course for beginners class!\n\n\nHere we want to extend our skills and dive into topics like\n-Workflow Controls (If conditions, switches…)\n-Workflow automation (Time triggers)\n-Workflow error handling\n-Introduction to databases in KNIME (database included!)\n-Other helpful nodes and sample workflows\n\n\nAll resources are included and can be downloaded from the resource section. KNIME (as you probably know) can be downloaded for free.\nThis is a hands-on course, so I expect you to “data prep” along with me!\nIf that does not sound like fun, then what?

It was only natural that after years of working random jobs I decided to go back to what I love, IT, and so I got my compTIA A+ certification (this right here, yes, and you will learn how to do that too as I will be teaching you everything I know about IT).\nAfter I got the certification I started working as technical support in IT and it is great.\nI am still studying myself when I have time but I thought I could find the time to create a course to help people that want to start a career in IT too :)\nThis internationally recognized core A+ course includes both the 220-1001 and the 220-1002 parts (it is a two-parts certification with two exams), our goal is to learn in a way so that you have a complete overview of what you need to know. Moreover, parts of the 1001 will cover the same topics of the 1002 so we get some repetition which is good to really store those concepts in your mind.\nIT professionals can make anything from $ 30'000 to $150'000 so it's really your responsibility to keep learning and getting new certifications to advance your career.\nSo here are the steps to successfully start a career in IT:\n-Study compTIA A+\n-Practice with mock tests online for the 1001 (a google search will give you plenty of free resources. There are paid platforms too like measureup )\n-Book your exam on the compTIA website\n-Pass the exam\n-Practice with mock tests for the 1002\n-Get certified\n-Apply for entry-level IT jobs\nIn the course I will also speak about real-life scenarios that you will face as an IT professional, so that you know what to expect from your first job (documentation, use of ticketing systems, logging tickets and receiving support calls) now all you need is patience and the right opportunity will come up :)\nBest of luck and thank you for reading this far, hope you will enjoy the course!\n\n\nHOW TO BOOK THE EXAM\n-Buy a voucher on the compTIA or pearson VUE website\n-Schedule the exam through the Pearson VUE website (can be also done remotely, at home)\n\n\nINFO\n90 questions, 90 minustes and a passing score of 675 (max is 900)",

This is done to ensure that you can spare time out of your busy schedule and learn at a steady pace.\nThe content is tailor-made to include practical scenarios that you can try at home and with ZERO extra investment.\nAll you need is this course, a computer/phone to watch on and a computer to setup a test-bed on. I have added some Linux demos for the open source geeks out there.\nThere is more !\nThis course will get constant updates every quarter and you have ME to top it all.\nAny questions related to the course are most welcome !\nIt's time to jump on the bandwagon with ME !\nLearning is Fun and Lets make it simple !\n#MakeNetworkingSimple",

      "description": "Important note: The complete course has been re-recorded, so that all audio problems have been removed, also in this second version of the course, new lessons have been added that will help you in your further learning.\nImportant note 2:  What you must know, before you buy this course, is that in my courses and lessons I use a lot of PowerPoint slides in which I explain in detail each service individually. The only reason is that after a detailed study of the theoretical part, it is easier for the student to follow the practical part. Many people do not like this type of teaching, but as an instructor, I want to do everything to teach and prepare the person who trusts me and buys my course as well as possible for an exam or some other business opportunity. If you don't have patience and only want the practical part, then don't buy my course, or if you only want to watch the practical part, then skip the theory. Basically, all my courses contain a large number of practical exercises.\nThis course is intended for beginners, Azure cloud administrators, Az-305 exam preparers, and all Azure or IT enthusiasts. In this course you will learn to create, deploy and work with Azure SQL service, all through many demos, exercises and examples. Also, in the other lessons, apart from the demo, you will have the opportunity to learn a lot. Before each demo, there are lessons in which all the concepts are explained or tried to be explained in detail, in order to make it easier to understand everything that is mentioned in the examples shown in the demos and videos. SQL Database enables you to easily define and scale performance within two different purchasing models: a vCore-based purchasing model and a DTU-based purchasing model. SQL Database is a fully managed service that has built-in high availability, backups, and other common maintenance operations. Microsoft handles all patching and updating of the SQL and operating system code. You don't have to manage the underlying infrastructure.  There are also additional lessons that will help you better learn and understand working with the Azure SQL database service and other Azure resources. This is of fundamental importance if you want to continue your journey towards Azure certifications, but the understanding itself is enough towards your complete mastery of this service.",

      "description": "ISO/IEC 20000 is a series of international standards for IT service management. ISO 20000-1:2018 standard is the only auditable standard that companies certify to. It is made on the quality philosophy of Plan, do check, and Act Cycle. Organizations have to check themselves whether their operations are done according to the planning phase or not. Similarly, if you are a service manager or working professional managing or implementing ISO 20000 either as a beginner, or expert you also have to check your expertise in Service Management systems (SMS). This \"lead knowledge validation exam\" helps you to check and validate your knowledge on ISO 20000 standard and its fundamental concepts like SLAs, service catalog, service components, etc. The objective of the ISO/IEC 20000 Lead Auditor exam tests is to help professionals and candidates who are seeking the accredited certification in the subject area, this is therefore a self-aid exam, not an official accredited certification. We expect by taking these tests candidates will suffice and improve their knowledge and skills regarding the auditing of a Service Management System (SMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValue Addition Alerts:\n1. Passing Certification Awarded By Instructor\n2. Road Map for Further Learning\nCertification: Udemy does not provide certification for exams, they only do in the case of Video Courses. But the great news here is, we have empowered our paid students to have a certificate, once they qualify by 80% in the exams. It is a manual process, in which learners are requested to submit evidence of qualification and apply for the certificate. The certificates are issued at the end of a month.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExam Composition\nYou will be assessed when you take this online exam in the following areas (Course Objectives):\n· The publication of the new ISO 20000-1 standard\n· The HLS (High-level Structure)\n· PDCA Approach\n· Context of organization keeping SMS in perspective\n· Leadership role in service management systems\n· Support Functions\n· Operation Controls\n· Internal Auditing\n· Improvement\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFood for Thought\nBe Familiar with ISO 20000-1:2018 knowledge which you hold...\nIf you think you are an expert in ISO 20000 after taking courses on the subject and working with ISO 20000-1...\nYou need to hold on!\nJoin this exam and self-assess yourself!\nMaybe you need to learn and learn...\nOr you can prove your knowledge and expertise by successfully completing this exam.\nBoth ways, you are in a win-win situation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlert >> New Audit Case Studies: This course comes with exclusive 3 audit case studies. You need to assess the situation and select the right option. If in case you select the wrong option, there is an explanation provided at the end of the assessment. Moreover, you can discuss the audit case studies as well in Q & A by stating the reference code provided with each study. There can be other correct alternatives for case studies, so you are free to share the alternative with reference to the specific case.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOfficial Lead Auditor Exam Versus Lead Auditor Practice Exam:\n1. Official LAC Exam is a written one, the Practice LAC exam is MCQ-based.\n2. Official LAC exams have four different sections, Practice LAC exam has three different sections.\n3. Official LAC exams have the last section for three written audit case studies, Practice LAC exam has a section for case studies containing 3 cases but answers are stated in MCQ-type. In order to provide students with a realistic simulated environment, students can post their answers in Q/A sections, by stating the reference code provided with each study; where the instructor can respond to their answers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: ISO 20000-1 standard is a copyrighted document of ISO. We will not be sharing the standard. Please purchase it from the ISO store.\nGood news: We will be adding more content for example case studies to practice tests in the future. If you feel that you lack the knowledge you can take ISO 20000 courses from Udemy or the instructor to guide you on gaining ISO 20000-1 knowledge.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExplanation of Answers: At the end of the assessment you will be provided with a result sheet that includes correct answers as well as the reason or explanation for the answer. So this exam is itself a learning process. You can improve your learning by assessing your answers against the explanation provided.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOne Month Money Back Guarantee: Don't forget One Month's 100% Money Back Guarantee without inquiry.

Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals and create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.\nVarious processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework. Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.",

Once we have all the prerequisite and applications on the Master VM then we will explore the creation and configuration of Machine catalogue and Delivery group.

It allows nonprofits to better manage some common nonprofit business processes. It is currently compatible with Salesforce Classic, and with some known issues with Lightning.\nThe Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) is an app that sits on top of Salesforce Enterprise Edition. NPSP is preconfigured for nonprofits as an-easy-to-use fundraising and constituent management application, designed to make the daily life of nonprofits a little easier. NPSP is a free, open-source product developed in partnership with the Salesforce ORG community, NPSP is built specifically with the needs of nonprofits in mind. Whether your organization is all-volunteer, moderately staffed, or well-established and resourced, the Nonprofit Starter Pack (NPSP) will help you advance your mission - as it's doing everyday for tens of thousands of nonprofits.\nNPSP can help your Nonprofit Organization:\nManage your contacts and households, donation payments, organization accounts and affiliations, and grant lifecycles.\nTrack relationships between contacts, donations and recurring donations.\nAs we go, we’ll recommend places where you can dig deeper into Salesforce when you want to, but be warned: Salesforce is a powerful and complex suite of products and there will always be new things to learn. So don’t expect to “master Salesforce” in a couple hours or even a couple days.\nBadabing Badabooooooom!\nLet's goooooo!",

      "description": "Whenever I taught  CCNP in the class-room, I found that Students were confused about some topics or commands that they have studied in the CCNA course (with someone else!), and I had to clarify or re-explain these topics or commands to them. This is because these topics or commands are confusing by their nature, or because the way that they are typically explained to the students. Therefore, the idea of this course came in my mind, which intend to clarify those confusing topics or commands.\nThis course contains five sections:\nWorking with Passwords: which contains thoughts on passwords, understand the meaning of the no service-encryption command, and how to break the type 7 encryption.\nWorking with Telnet:which contains how to work with telnet as source or destination, and how to telnet to a specific port. .\nMiscellaneous Topics: such as understanding the network command, the VTP client mode, the longest match rule, and the meaning of the OSPF process ID being locally significant .\nEverything about static Routing!: which explains almost everything about static routing and moving gradually from basic concepts and configurations to the advanced ones such as load balancing and floating static routes with IP SLA. Then we have to solve the challenge of making the configuration of the floating static routes working by getting help from HSRP! You will find this part of the course enjoyable and challenging.\nUnderstanding the OSPF LSA Types: Where I have explained the OSPF LSA types 1,2,3,4, and 5 , the metric and metric types used with OSPF redistribution, and the usage of the OSPF subnets keyword and the EIGRP no auto-summary command.\nConfiguring Frame-Relay: Where I have explained Basic Frame-Relay Configuration , how to configure Frame-Relay Multipoint sub-interfaces , and how to solve issues with routing protocols in a frame-relay network.\nNetwork Attacks Using Features of the IP Protocol: where different network attacks that uses features of the IP protocol are explained, including the IP Smufing attack.\nYou do not have to watch the videos in any particular order.  You can go directly and watch the videos related to topics or commands that you feel that they confusing or not clear. At the end of the course, there will be a practice test that you can use to find if these topics or commands are clear or still confuse you. You can attempt this practice test after watching the videos as a final check or even before to decide which topics or section you have to watch.\nI hope that that you will find this course useful, and that it will clarify confusing topics or commands for you, so that you can fully understand the CCNA curriculum, and be ready for your CCNP studies!.",

      "description": "This course is built for one clear purpose: to help you understand and prepare for the CCSK Cloud Security Certification in the most efficient and focused way possible. Instead of overwhelming you with hours of unnecessary content or repetitive theory, this course is structured to be compact, practical, and easy to follow. If you're someone who prefers clear explanations over complex deep-dives, this is the course for you.\nWhen designing this course, the goal was to avoid what's already been done too many times. There are many courses that go step by step through labs or provide in-depth technical demos. While that has value, it’s not always what you need when you're preparing for a certification like CCSK. This course takes a cleaner approach, concentrating on key concepts, certification-relevant content, and practical understanding, all presented through simple and informative visuals.\nYou’ll learn about the core building blocks of cloud computing, including how different service and deployment models work, and why they matter for cloud security. These foundational concepts set the stage for deeper discussions on governance, risk, and compliance—areas that are highly emphasized in the CCSK exam and critical for any cloud security professional.\nThe course also covers the security of cloud data across its entire lifecycle. You'll understand how data is protected, how encryption works in cloud environments, and how access to that data is controlled through identity and access management techniques like SSO and MFA. These topics are broken down into understandable terms, even if you're not from a technical background.\nYou'll also gain insight into infrastructure-level security, including cloud network protections, virtualization security, and how hypervisors are managed securely. In addition, modern security challenges like application security, DevSecOps, logging, and incident response are explored to give you a well-rounded view of what cloud security looks like in action.\nBusiness continuity, disaster recovery, and emerging trends like cloud-native security practices are included to ensure you’re up to speed on what’s relevant in today’s cloud-driven world. These are areas many candidates overlook but can make a big difference in your exam performance and professional confidence.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge you need to approach the CCSK exam with clarity and focus. More importantly, you’ll have a solid foundation in cloud security that you can carry into your career. If you're looking for a course that respects your time, simplifies complex topics, and helps you prepare effectively—this is it.",

With this course, you’ll learn how to solve any subnetting question in less than 30 seconds, giving you the confidence to ace your exam and get certified with ease!\nWhy Subnetting is Critical for CCNA Success\nSubnetting is a vital skill for anyone pursuing a Cisco certification. In this course, we’ll break it down step by step to ensure you fully grasp how subnetting works. You’ll master the “30-second method” and understand the mathematical principles behind this essential networking concept. Once you have the basics, we’ll introduce powerful shortcuts and tips to solve subnetting problems quickly and accurately in an exam environment.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\n\nThe Fundamentals of Subnetting:\nUnderstand how subnetting works, the mathematics behind it, and why it’s important for network design and configuration.\nThe 30-Second Subnetting Method:\nSolve subnetting challenges efficiently under exam conditions with proven techniques.\nExam-Ready Shortcuts:\nLearn powerful shortcuts and tips to tackle CCNA exam subnetting questions with speed and precision.\nIP Addressing Basics:\nExplore IPv4 and IPv6 addressing structures, including concepts like network prefixes, host identifiers, and the differences between dot-decimal and hexadecimal notation.\n\n\nWhy Subnetting Matters in Networking\nEvery device connected to a network, like the Internet, requires a unique address for identification and location. These addresses can be assigned automatically using DHCP, manually by administrators, or through stateless address autoconfiguration.\n\n\nHere’s a quick overview of key concepts:\n\n\nIPv4 Addresses:\nConsist of 32 bits, typically written as four decimal octets separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).\nIPv6 Addresses:\nMade up of 128 bits, written in hexadecimal notation with groupings of 16 bits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).\n\n\nBoth IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are divided into network prefixes and host identifiers, which are crucial for subnetting and understanding how devices communicate within a network.\n\n\nAce Subnetting in a Timed Exam Environment\nSubnetting questions often appear in the CCNA lab exam, where time is limited. That’s why this course focuses on efficient problem-solving techniques. You’ll practice subnetting against realistic exam scenarios using shortcuts that save precious seconds.\n\n\nKey Features of This Course\n\n\nHands-on Exercises: Apply what you learn to real-world subnetting scenarios.\nExam-Focused Tips: Learn techniques designed to handle the pressure of CCNA exams.\nSimplified Learning: Understand complex concepts like IP addressing and subnetting without unnecessary jargon.\nMastery in Minutes: With the 30-second method, you’ll be solving subnetting problems faster than ever.\n\n\nReady to Master Subnetting?\nWhether you’re new to networking or preparing for your CCNA certification, this course will equip you with the skills you need to succeed. Learn how to confidently approach subnetting questions, save time during your exam, and take your networking career to the next level.\n\n\nEnroll now and start mastering subnetting today",

Idea, is the step where l come to help to give you some clues of how it needs to be done and what are the mechanisms behind solving it efficiently. Code, the step where l write the code to solve it and l explain step by step how it works.\nNo previous experience is required as all the theory is covered for each chapter. If you never experienced programming before this is the chance to start it in a stimulating and exciting way.

Of those who actually take the exam, only half will actually pass. What goes wrong?\nThis is the question IT expert and the best selling author of 'Cisco CCNA in 60 Days' and 'Cisco CCNA Simplified' Paul Browning asked himself and spent years researching. He found after speaking to hundreds of IT students that most quit in frustration because they find the subjects both difficult and overwhelming and they felt under prepared for the task ahead.\nThe CCNA is not an exam for beginners. Even the CompTIA Network+ may not sufficiently prepare you for the new style CCNA exam. Cisco have made it tougher than ever with the introduction of advanced subjects such as Spanning Tree Protocol, IPv6, OSPFv3 and many more which previously were part of the advanced Cisco CCNP syllabus!\nWhat has been lacking is a foundational course you can take to cover all the subjects Cisco leave out from the CCNA but you simply must understand if you are to tackle the exam. Subjects such as TCP/IP, network cabling and basic router and switch configuration. If you are considering taking the Cisco CCNA exam and want to give yourself a huge head start then this is the course for you.\nYou will learn valuable information you can put to use when you study for the CCNA as well as learn tips and tricks you can put to use on a live network.\nIf you want to avoid months of frustrating study and wasted time then this course will help you accelerate your understanding and give you a valuable edge if you decide to progress to the Cisco CCNA next.",

      "description": "You want to prepare and give yourself the best chance of passing the Professional Scrum Product Owner 3 certification (PSPO III), look no further, this course is for you !\n\n\nWhat is Professional Scrum Master 3 certification ?\nThe Professional Scrum Product Owner III certification, commonly known as PSPO III, is Scrum . org most elite certification for Product Ownership.

Many of them ask you to reflect on or interpret the meaning of the Scrum Guide, the Scrum glossary, and essential resources published by scrum . org.\n2 practical exercise consisting of 30 questions requiring one or more answers for warm up\n3 practical exercises each consisting of 24 essay questions. These practical exercises do not allow you to write a long answer. You will therefore discover the questions allowing you to train in real conditions. The answers are available with each question and give you the main elements expected by the examiners.\n\n\nOctobre update :\nNew exercise including 24 essay questions similar to the real PSPO III exam\n\n\nNovember update :\nNew exercise including 12 essay questions similar to the real PSPO III exam\n\n\nChristmas update :\n12 new essay questions similar to the real PSPO III exam to complete the 5th exercise\n\n\nFebruay update :\nNew collection of warm up question\n\n\nAbout the Professional Scrum Product Owner 3 (PSPO III) Exam :\nDifficulty : Expert\nCost : $500 USD per attempt\nPassing score : Pass/Did Not Pass. Responses are scored by a team of Scrum experts using a common grading guide. Each response is evaluated to determine if it meets, exceeds, or does not meet the grading expectations. After all questions are scored, the entire test is reviewed to determine whether a passing score was earned.\nTime limit : 150 minutes\nNumber of Questions : 24\nFormat : Essay questions only.

The use of a Translate plugin is allowed\nIt is strongly advised to read the Standard of conduct published by scrum . org for more information.\n\n\nHow to prepare for PSPO III :\nDespite being a Level III exam, I personally found the exam much less challenging than, for example, PAL I. If you performed well on your PSPO II exam and take a while to prepare and contemplate about the role of the Product Owner, you should be able to pass the exam comfortably.\nIn order to prepare for the exam, you might want to consider the following :\nRevisit all the steps necessary to prepare for PSPO II\nEven if you passed your PSPO II exam, reiterating the material in a class and discussing aspects of the Product Owner position can be useful.\nYou can also read \"The Professional Product Owner Leveraging Scrum as a Competitive Advantage\" by Don McGREAL and Ralph JOCHAM. Reading is easy and is illustrated with many examples that will appeal to as many people as possible. It offers comprehensive guidance for the product owner. Ultimately, the Product Owner is a value maximizer, so read every chapter guided by the question “how does the content in this chapter allow me as a Product Owner to maximize the value of my product”. I personally found many answers to the problems which I faced in my activity.\nRead up on the technique of User Story Mapping.\nWhile it may be risky, a good way to test if you are ready is to simply take the PSPO III exam. Unlike the PSPO I and PSPO II exams, where you get an automated evaluation, the PSPO III evaluation provides you with very useful feedback. The PST grading your exam will give you pointers which concepts you might want to research more. In a sense, it can be seen as an empirical approach : the only way to know if something is ready is to test it under real-world conditions !\n\n\nDisclaimer :\nAll questions have been designed based on real life scenarios, experience and the latest version of the Scrum guide as well as the Scrum skills expected on the PSM III exam.

Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of each test, you will get an explanation for each question, explaining why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does.\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions per test (40 total).\nAsset Security – 13 questions per test (26 total).\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions per test (30 total).\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions per test (30 total).\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions per test (32 total).\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions per test (28 total).\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions per test (40 total).\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions per test (24 total).\n\n\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it, this is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right, and answering from an IT Security managers point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nMany students do 3,000 – 5,000 CISSP certification practice questions, when I did my CISSP certification I was around the 3,500 mark.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.  I would suggest 80%+ of right answers consistently on all CISSP domains using multiple practice tests before booking the exam.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nThis course includes ALL of these:\n2 full 125 easy/mid CISSP practice tests.\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days, no questions asked, money back guarantee.\nBonus materials: 10 bonus questions.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

It is targeted to people, who want to succeed in the LPIC-1 (Exam 101 v5).\n\n\nThe Course at a glance\nIn this course you will find:\n103 assignments properly categorized\n103 Solutions for every assignment\n1 compressed file for all of the above assignments\n100 Practice test questions\n10 lectures\n\n\n\n\nThe Course in detail\n\n\n103 assignments properly categorized\nIn this course you will practice on the following categories:\n1. System Architecture\n2. Linux Installation and Package Management\n3. GNU and Unix Commands\n4. Devices, Linux Filesystems, Filesystem Hierarchy Standard\n\n\n1 compressed file for all of the above assignments\nEach and every assignment comes with its distinct files, contained in 1 compressed file, downloaded during the first assignment\n\n\n103 Solutions for every assignment\nAll assignments are accompanied by solutions. We recommend you try to solve the assignments without viewing the solution. This way you will better understand your limitations and be able to focus on them. You can then see the solution after you have solved it, to know if you answered the question correctly.\n\n\nFast feedback from our instructors\nWe give feedback to all assignments, usually within one or two working days. Although in many cases we have been known to answer within a few hours.\n\n\nIn this course we have focused on the practical side. What does that mean? That almost all the content you will find in this lecture is in the form of assignments. You will gain practical, hands-on experience by solving these assignments and you will get feedback by uploading them in the Udemy platform.\nWe are involved in the IT Training field since 2003 and have successfully trained almost a million students. Our focus to the practical side of education has proven to be a lot more effective than just reading a book or watching a lecture.\nOur accumulated experience led us in developing an interactive training tool in order to promote self-learning and self-improvement when it comes to IT skills. This tool is called TEST4U and we firmly believe that it will help you achieve your goals; therefore, we created a couple of lectures dedicated to TEST4U. After all, close to a million students have trusted TEST4U for a good reason!",

      "description": "<<The course is updated as per the skills measured on  April 21, 2025>>\n\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU BUY MY DP-700 Fabric Data Engineer Associate MOCK TEST?\na. Deeply researched exam questions for DP 700. I create no more than one question/day to maintain high quality.\nb. No simple one-liner questions. Each question is based on your understanding of a scenario. The questions challenge you to understand, apply, and analyze your knowledge.\nc. This course comes with both clear and lucid video and text explanations. The text explanations come with product illustrations for easy understanding. You can also go through the video explanations for a more seamless demo.\nd. For each question I provide a Python Notebook/PowerQuery project file/scripts to simulate the environment used in the question.\ne. For each question I provide a summarized version of the answer (suitable for revisions) and a detailed answer (for in-depth learning).\nf. I simulate the actual DP700 Fabric Data Engineer exam experience for you in the form of drag-and-drop questions, dropdown questions, multiple yes/no questions with a radio button, repeated scenario questions, etc.\ng. No dumping of text in a ppt. PPTs are used only to demo architecture to enhance your understanding.\nh. Explanations run parallel to the product. Every detailed explanation has corroborating evidence with the Microsoft product (like Microsoft Fabric) shown in screenshots and clear callouts.\ni. Explanations are NOT directly copied from Microsoft documentation. I have rephrased all the reasoning in a simple and easy-to-understand language.\nj. No step-motherly treatment of incorrect answer choices. I took enough effort to explain the rationale for each answer choice (whether correct/wrong), including the reference links.\nk. Don't worry about inaccurate sentence framing/wrong grammar/incorrect punctuation. I use Grammarly to review every question.\nl. Almost non-existent repetition of questions only to increase the question count.\nm. I love to help you succeed. If you need to discuss, we have an Active Q&A dashboard and expect fast responses (save for my sleeping hours, which are generally less).\nn. As soon as there is an update from Microsoft, I try to update my course, keeping it always fresh.\no. The question bank is peer-reviewed every three months to ensure exam relevance.\np. Case Study: Contoware Analytics Modernization to help you better prepare for the exam.\n\n\nThe questions are collected from a variety of domains and sub-domains with extra care taken to equal attention to each exam area. Also, the questions are on different levels.\n\n\nFor example:\nRemember-level questions test whether you can recall memorized facts, & basic concepts.\nUnderstand-level questions validate whether you can explain the meanings of terms, & concepts.\nApplication-level questions test whether you can perform tasks using facts, concepts, & techniques, and,\nAnalysis-level questions validate whether you can diagnose situations & solve problems with concepts & techniques.\nA mixture of questions at different levels reinforces your knowledge and prepares you to ace the exam.\n\n\nThese are the exam domains covered in the DP-700 practice exam:\n\n\nImplement and manage an analytics solution (30–35%)\n\n\nConfigure Microsoft Fabric workspace settings\nConfigure Spark workspace settings\nConfigure domain workspace settings\nConfigure OneLake workspace settings\nConfigure data workflow workspace settings\n\n\nImplement lifecycle management in Fabric\nConfigure version control\nImplement database projects\nCreate and configure deployment pipelines\n\n\nConfigure security and governance\nImplement workspace-level access controls\nImplement item-level access controls\nImplement row-level, column-level, object-level, and folder/file-level access controls\nImplement dynamic data masking\nApply sensitivity labels to items\nEndorse items\nImplement and use workspace logging\n\n\nOrchestrate processes\nChoose between a pipeline and a notebook\nDesign and implement schedules and event-based triggers\nImplement orchestration patterns with notebooks and pipelines, including parameters and dynamic expressions\n\n\nIngest and transform data (30–35%)\nDesign and implement loading patterns\nDesign and implement full and incremental data loads\nPrepare data for loading into a dimensional model\nDesign and implement a loading pattern for streaming data\n\n\nIngest and transform batch data\nChoose an appropriate data store\nChoose between dataflows, notebooks, KQL, and T-SQL for data transformation\nCreate and manage shortcuts to data\nImplement mirroring\nIngest data by using pipelines\nTransform data by using PySpark, SQL, and KQL\nDenormalize data\nGroup and aggregate data\nHandle duplicate, missing, and late-arriving data\n\n\nIngest and transform streaming data\nChoose an appropriate streaming engine\nChoose between native storage, followed storage, or shortcuts in Real-Time Intelligence\nProcess data by using eventstreams\nProcess data by using Spark structured streaming\nProcess data by using KQL\nCreate windowing functions\n\n\nMonitor and optimize an analytics solution (30–35%)\nMonitor Fabric items\nMonitor data ingestion\nMonitor data transformation\nMonitor semantic model refresh\nConfigure alerts\n\n\nIdentify and resolve errors\nIdentify and resolve pipeline errors\nIdentify and resolve dataflow errors\nIdentify and resolve notebook errors\nIdentify and resolve eventhouse errors\nIdentify and resolve eventstream errors\nIdentify and resolve T-SQL errors\n\n\nOptimize performance\nOptimize a lakehouse table\nOptimize a pipeline\nOptimize a data warehouse\nOptimize eventstreams and eventhouses\nOptimize Spark performance\nOptimize query performance",

And for troubleshooting to be efficient, it has to be systematic and logical and not by random trial and error attempts.\nIn this course, I will demonstrate troubleshooting of Cisco Routers. You can use this course to learn how to troubleshoot Cisco Routers in real production and to help you to prepare for the CCNP TSHOOT exam and the Troubleshooting section of the CCIE lab exam. If you are already have CCNA level knowledge and/or experience, or you are in the middle of your CCNA studies, then you can use this course as a start for learning advanced troubleshooting.\n\nThis course uses multiple explaining ways in addition to videos. At the beginning of the course there is an article for summarized troubleshooting steps that is available for download as a PDF and which I recommend to be read before watching the videos. And for each lab, initial configuration will be available for download in order for students to practice the labs and challenge themselves if they can solve the tickets before watching the videos or even after. In addition, there will be a practice test for the student to check what he has learned. Some tickets have multiple possible solutions. Therefore, restrictions have been set so that there should be only one valid solution.\nLet us start the course together and begin the troubleshooting journey. Happy troubleshooting !",

But this is just an incomplete way of computerized system validation. So, we have made some sections in this guide that will discuss their requirements and also make the learner or participant aware of how to do complete validation.\nThis course contains a total of 6 sections and 7 lectures. If you have any question/s, you can put your question/s in the comments section. I will clarify your questions.\nThe first section includes information about Common errors related to computerized systems. This short recording will help you understand how many professionals make errors.\nThe second section includes information about the cGXP Assessment of the computerized systems. This is missing in most of the computerized systems validation approaches. First, the computerized systems should be evaluated whether it is having a cGXP impact or not. Based on that further validation study and depth of validation should be decided. The training session includes below points;\nImportance of topic\nKnow your Trainer\nRole of cGXP Assessment in Pharmaceuticals\nRegulatory Expectations\nFDA Citations\n11 Keys for cGXP Assessment\nCommon Errors\nTake Away from the session\nQ&A\nThe third section includes information about Vendor evaluation of cGXP computerized systems.

I am an Okta Certified Consultant and I have carefully designed this course for you to get to know the aspects of Okta in a simple and pleasant manner.\nCourse is intended for anyone out there working with Okta or simply interested in this field. More specifically, it is intended for those who are trying to get a helping hand into their journey of trying to get to be an Okta Certified Professional.\n\n\n*ATTENTION*\n1. Please understand this is not an official Okta course, everything you are going to see is designed by myself so my own point of view, but nonetheless a point of view based on the official Okta Professional Certification Exam Study Guide / public KB articles. In any case, it will NOT grant you the Okta Professional Certificate, the same as it will NOT provide you with the entire knowledge / answers needed for passing the actual Okta Certified Professional exam. You are the only one who knows if you are truly ready to take on such an official exam and when.\n2. Those questions you are going to see in the course, questions to which you have to find the correct answer(s), might have just one single correct answer or multiple correct answers, while Okta's official Certification exams have a DOMC (Discrete Option Multiple Choice) structure (not supported by Udemy at the moment).\n3. Each question in the course has at least 3 choices from which you can pick. There isn't a single question providing only two potential answers.\n4. This course is based not only on the direct links' content Okta provides in the Okta Professional Certification Exam Study Guide, but also on their nested links (with an infinite depth), as that's the only way in which someone can truly grasp the knowledge, by trying to check the extensions as well, which is where fine details reside at times.\n5. Pay attention that these questions might even be harder then the actual ones you'll find in the official Okta Professional Certification Exam, the same of some of them might feel much easier then what you'll meet in the official examination provided by Okta. This is simply a matter of perspective and level of knowledge. I added a timer of 120 mins and a threshold of 70% for passing this one, as mere guidance.\n\nYou'll get to see:\nA total of 120 questions with related answers (single / multiple choice as correct answer(s)), out of which:\n105 - are uniquely designed for this course\n10 - are shared between this course and the 'Okta Certified Administrator Knowledge Base Test' course on Udemy\n5 - are shared between this course and the 'Okta Certified Developer Knowledge Base Test' course on Udemy\n\n\n! Once again, the present course is designed to greatly help you towards achieving the goal of passing the Okta Professional Certification Exam, but cannot guarantee that, as this course is NOT provided by Okta officials, hence it does not represent a standard in passing the Okta Professional Certification Exam or gathering the entirety of the knowledge needed for passing it with success.\n\nHaving said the above, wish you good luck!\n\n\n\n\nWith respect,\nSilviu Muraru",

While you work on a long term improvement, you need to quickly implement a process to enforce short-lived service account credentials in your company. You have the following requirements: • All service accounts that require a key should be created in a centralized project called bat-ops. • Service account keys should only be valid for one day. You need a Google-recommended solution that minimizes cost. What should you do?\nA. Implement a Cloud Run job to rotate all service account keys periodically in bat-ops. Enforce an org policy to deny service account key creation with an exception to bat-ops.\nB. Implement a Kubernetes CronJob to rotate all service account keys periodically. Disable attachment of service accounts to resources in all projects with an exception to bat-ops.\nC. Enforce an org policy constraint allowing the lifetime of service account keys to be 24 hours. Enforce an org policy constraint denying service account key creation with an exception on bat-ops.\nD. Enforce a DENY org policy constraint over the lifetime of service account keys for 24 hours. Disable attachment of service accounts to resources in all projects with an exception to bat-ops.\nWhat's your guess?

It mentions setting a 24-hour key lifetime and enforcing an org policy that denies key creation with an exception for bat-ops.\nOption D: Disabling the attachment of service accounts seems unnecessary and could disrupt legitimate use of service accounts.\nAnd reference links to help you learn further!\nInstructor\nPaper Trails is a dedicated team of experts passionate about helping students achieve certification success.

Other improvements include more efficient routing and stateless address auto-configuration. It not only solves the problem of address limitation, but also brings other improvements to the IP protocol, like autoconfiguration on routers and improved security, among others.\nIt is a short course which will provide good knowledge about IPv6. We all know that IPv6 is the future because existing IP version i.e. IPv4 is almost full. Most of the companies have already used IPv4 so they are switching towards IPv6. You will also learn IPv4 vs IPv6 difference.\nMany of us think that it is very difficult to learn IPv6. But, It is not that tough in reality. Though it is of 128 Bit but once you understand the basic fundamentals then it becomes very easy. Once you know How to use it, then you can start using it in your routing protocols.\nThe first step to understanding IPv6 is to appreciate the forces that have driven the need for a new internet protocol. Thus, the chapter begins by describing the market and networking needs that have motivated the design of IPv6.\n\nSome of the things you will learn in the course includes  IPv4 vs IPv6 difference, Understanding of IPv6 Address , IPv6 Address Format, ipv6 link local address, How to enable IPv6 & disable IPv6 and many more.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor.

      "description": "*** Part of the full Course: Cisco Troubleshooting Labs For CCNA, CCNP, and CCIE Students (The best seller course in the IT troubleshooting Category ) ***\nTroubleshooting is an essential and important skill for network engineers. As a network engineer, you have to know not just how to configure network devices, but also how to troubleshoot them. And for troubleshooting to be efficient, it has to be systematic and logical and not by random trial and error attempts.\nSwitches are the foundation of your network, connecting all other devices together. Therefore, knowing how to troubleshot them is the first and the key step in the overall troubleshooting process.\nIn this course, I will demonstrate troubleshooting of Cisco Switches. You can use this course to learn how to troubleshoot Cisco switches in real production and to help you to prepare for the CCNP TSHOOT exam and the Troubleshooting sections of the CCIE lab exams. If you are already have CCNA level knowledge and/or experience, or you are in the middle of your CCNA studies, then you can use this course as a start for learning advanced troubleshooting.\n\nThis course uses multiple explaining ways in addition to videos. At the beginning of the course there is an article for summarized troubleshooting steps that is available for download as a PDF and which I recommend to be read before watching the videos. And for each lab, initial configuration will be available for download in order for students to practice the labs and challenge themselves if they can solve the tickets before watching the videos or even after. In addition, there will be a practice test for the student to check what he has learned. Some tickets have multiple possible solutions. Therefore, restrictions have been set so that there should be only one valid solution.\nLet us start the course together and begin the troubleshooting journey. Happy troubleshooting !",

In this vPC (Virtual Port-Channel), also known as multichassis EtherChannel (MEC) is a feature on the Cisco Nexus switches that provides the ability to configure a Port-Channel across multiple switches (i.e. vPC peers).vPC is similar to Virtual Switch System (VSS) on the Catalyst 6500s. However, the key difference between vPC and VSS is that VSS creates a single logical switch. This results in a single control plane for both management and configuration purposes. Whereas with vPC each switch is managed and configured independently. It is important to remember that with vPC both switches are managed independently. This means you will need to create and permit your VLANs on both Nexus switches. vPC Domain - Includes the vPC Peers, KeepAlive Links and the Port-Channels that use the vPC technology. vPC Peer Switch - The other switch within the vPC domain. Each switch is connected via the vPC peer link. It's also worth noting that one device is selected as primary and the other secondary. vPC Member Port - Ports included within the vPCs. vPC Peer-Keepalive Link - Connects both vPC peer switches and carries monitoring traffic to/from each peer switch. Monitoring is performed to ensure the switches are both operational and running vPC.  vPC Peer Link - Connects both vPC peer switches and carries BPDUs, HSRPs, and MAC addresses to its vPC peer.",

I will show you data privacy regulations, threats and protection mechanisms.\n\nRisk Management is what fundamentally drives information security programs.  Learn how to measure, manage and validate information security risks.  Physical security measures may not be the most glamorous part of information security but they are an important component of the bigger picture.   Because if intruders have access to your HW it’s only a matter of time before they get access to the data that’s on it.\nA subcomponent of physical security involves the management of environmental controls.   In this section we will go over some of the best practices associated with some of these types of controls and how implementing them can enhance security by preserving CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability).\nData classification is the process of organizing data into categories for its most effective and efficient use.   Learn how to effectively classify data and identify classification driven best practices controls.\n\nOnce we have a Risk Management program in place we need to implement operational security to manage the day to day aspects of security.  You will  learn about Operational Security Controls, what they consist of and how they help us to incrementally manage risk on a daily basis.You will learn how to formulate and execute an incident response plan which defines policies, in specific terms, which identify an incident and provide  step-by-step processes that should be followed when an incident occurs.\nAll IT environments require changes to be made on a fairly constant basis for the purpose of upkeep and enhancements.   After completing this lesson you will understand best practices for minimizing risk via configuration and change management.\n\nWhile at first glance DR might not seem like a natural fit with cybersecurity after further analysis we realize that disasters are threats that can inflict much more damage than any hacker.   Upon completing this lesson you will understand how to perform disaster recovery planning and design strategies for dealing with disasters.\n\nYou will also learn how to conduct forensics investigations using digital forensics technologies and techniques in this lesson.",

Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp, is a cornerstone of modern DevOps practices. It enables teams to define and provision infrastructure resources declaratively using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). While basic Terraform concepts cover resource provisioning and state management, advanced Terraform techniques empower developers to handle complex infrastructure setups with greater efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.\nAdvanced Terraform promotes modularity, which allows teams to reuse code and organize infrastructure configurations efficiently. Modules encapsulate related resources, making configurations more readable, manageable, and reusable across multiple projects or environments. This modular design ensures consistency and reduces duplication of effort. Terraform workspaces enable managing multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) within the same configuration. By isolating state files for each environment, workspaces simplify the management of environment-specific infrastructure without duplicating code.\nAdvanced Terraform techniques enable organizations to scale and manage complex infrastructure efficiently. By adopting modular design, dynamic configuration, and robust state management, teams can ensure infrastructure is reliable, repeatable, and aligned with organizational goals. Adopting best practices is crucial for leveraging advanced Terraform capabilities. These include version-controlling infrastructure code, implementing robust error handling, using variable files and environment-specific overrides, and enforcing security through role-based access control (RBAC) and secrets management. Additionally, automated testing with tools like Terratest ensures that infrastructure configurations are reliable and secure.",

The only reason is that after a detailed study of the theoretical part, it is easier for the student to follow the practical part. Many people do not like this type of teaching, but as an instructor, I want to do everything to teach and prepare the person who trusts me and buys my course as well as possible for an exam or some other business opportunity. If you don't have patience and only want the practical part, then don't buy my course, or if you only want to watch the practical part, then skip the theory. Basically, all my courses contain a large number of practical exercises.\nThis course is for beginners, azure cloud administrators and anybody who is interested in Azure or IT. In this course you will learn how to create, deploy and manage Azure Cosmos DB service, also you will see a lot of demos how to do things in this great service. Also, in other lessons, besides demos, you will learn a lot. Everything is explained before every demo, so it will help you to understand it with easy. Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service offered by Microsoft. It is designed to provide high availability, scalability, and low-latency access to data for modern applications. Unlike traditional relational databases, Cosmos DB is a NoSQL (meaning \"Not only SQL\", rather than \"zero SQL\") and vector database, which means it can handle unstructured, semi-structured, structured, and vector data types.\nWhen you finish this course, you will be able to work comfortably in the Azure Cosmos DB service, but what is most important is that you will learn the fundamental concept of the service itself and how you can further deepen your knowledge. And not only that, during the course you will get to know other Azure services, as well as programs that can help you work with databases and data.",

You should regularly check SAP System Landscape and monitor all the changes that are made in configuration and access profiles. This enhances the use of secure authentication to protect the Availability, Integrity, and Privacy of a User System.\nThis course is a pre-recorded session of \"SAP Security & Authorizations\" training. This training lesson will give you detailed insights apart from the core concepts and will help you understand the subject much deeper as the trainer and student interact about real-world challenges while implementing SAP Security.\nWe hope that this course will be useful and helpful for candidates who are looking for quality information from a highly experienced trainer having experience of over 15 years in this technology.\nWe have made attempts to edit the videos to the best quality possible and would apologize in advance for any inconvenience as mentioned above that this is a live session recording.   We hope you would find this useful and we wish you all the very best in your future endeavors.\n\nPlease Note: WE ARE NOT SAP AUTHORIZED TRAINING INSTITUTE NEITHER WE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SAP IN ANY FORM.

      "description": "You are interested in learning AWS and getting into the wide realm of programming and intense Tech Entrepreneurship. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of learning AWS (which to be frank, gives you the key to ruling the technology industry)\nSince technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to catch up is \"to work on it\".\nYet, nobody teaches in this manner and I suffer from the same pain when learning something new every time. Most courses are not designed to help you learn by example (immersion is the most potent way of learning in humans). Rather they bathe you with inapplicable information that you have to learn over and over again anyways.\nThis course is designed to cover all the basic concepts of Amazon Web Services and the syntax necessary for learning the advanced topics in AWS. Even though learning EC2 can open the door to working with Storage, Computation, and Databases and basically everything else with the word “AWS” attached to it, it has some new functionality and nuances that you have to cover and learn.\nMy job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced AWS (whether it be just programming logic…setting up servers…designing application backends (fun stuff) or doing boring stuff like writing bash script).\nIn this course, I will walk you though EC2 Configuration, and you will learn about the associated structures of EC2 instance creation (we hear a lot about servers and computation and memory, but how do we put these three together?),\nHowever, only a few videos per section are focused on information. I develop the rest of the details of the data structures and syntax through exercises that I walk you through in the course. There are 2-3 lectures on solving tough exercises on each subject so that you can understand not only the syntax and how to practically work on AWS.\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of Amazon AWS I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the IT world with the one of the most popular Infrastrcture Services: AWS",
