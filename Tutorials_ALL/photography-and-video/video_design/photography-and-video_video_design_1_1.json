      "description": "How To Be A Movie Script Writer : Film & Movie Script Writing : How To Write A Script For A Movie : How To Write A Movie Script\nFor beginners, the idea of screenwriting seems to be way beyond anything that we're capable of, but like many things in life that we know very little about, the opposite is true - scriptwriting is for anyone!\nThere's a saying in Hollywood that goes something like this: \"Nobody knows anything and anybody can do anything\" , which just about opens it up for everyone! To succeed at movie scriptwriting you need these basic essentials:\nHow to develop a great idea and produce a scriptwriting gem\nHow to Write a Movie Script from a great idea\nUnderstand what movie producers are looking for in Movie Script Writing\nHow to structure your screenwriting so that it hooks the reader\nBeginners should know how to present the results of their screenwriting in industry format\nHow to write the pitch for your screenwriting\nWhere to pitch your movie script\nThis course shows you the basics of screenwriting in detail and covers all the points above. Script writing is a craft - great news for us, beginners and all, because it means that anyone can learn it! All you need is this course ' How To Write A Movie Script : Scriptwriting Basics ' and you're half-way there. Information is the key to your success.\nGood grounding for a beginner. Explanations are basic and structured, but he doesn't talk down to you. Jeremy Gaines\nThese are great basic explanations of what makes a movie tick and how to put a script together. Tells you what keeps an audience on the edge of their seats. The script analysis alone is worth the price. Ben Kramer\nHow Do You Write A script For A Movie For Success?\nIn another course 'How To Write Novels' I describe the structure behind 99% of modern novels. This same structure also applies to the movies, with some subtle differences. One of the essential tools for any budding scriptwriting genius is script analysis, and we pull apart the movie Die Hard to see what makes it tick - exactly what makes a movie like this so successful?\nThis is how it works - analyse something that's successful and then apply the principles to your own work. It's true that the best way to learn how to write a script for a movie is by doing it!\nFinally, I cover the best way to pitch your idea to producers or agents to get the best results. The industry appetite for new material is surging upwards over the last couple of years and studios need new writers. Script writing isn't such a difficult thing - if you're organized and understand the industry requirements.\nYou can do it - I'll show you how to write a movie script! Sign Up Now!\nMovie script writing has come a long, long way since film-going became popular. Just like novel writing, the early writers didn't exactly fly by the seat of their pants, but they suffered from not having a solid structure as a basis for writing screenplays>\nBasically, a movie is a story. Sometimes it might not seem so simple. Let's face it - some movie plots can get very complex, which can be a bad thing. It dawned on screenwriters that all successful movies had certain things in common.\nThis correct proportion of hero (protagonist), villain (antagonist), quest, challenges and climax is what makes a movie tick. This is what we have to capture if we want to write a screenplay that sells.\n#howtowriteamoviescript #howtowriteascreenplay #moviescriptwriting #scriptwriting #howtowriteascriptforamoviepdf #scriptwritingbasics",

The first is based on a one-hour special documentary broadcast by Discovery Channel, and the second a half-hour serialised episode of a 26-part African adventure travel story.\nOnce released, critics used the words, \"gripping\", \"superb\", outstanding\" in their reviews of these films.\nThe course consists of a series of videos with details of what is being taught as written summaries.\nThe documentary is run, and as the story unfolds, the director/producer goes though all the thoughts, processes, equipment and creative processes used. This is a real-life event, valuable to those who both shoot and edit stories on video.\nAs every scene is covered, the shooting techniques, editing ideas and storytelling methods are revealed. This is an actual documentary, so what is taught is not just theory— it has become fact, and you can see the results for yourself.\nThe documentary was produced by an indie producer, yet still sold to major networks. How this was done is discussed.\nThe course lectures run to 247 minutes (±4,1 hours). With some, you may need to watch them more than once, because there is quite a lot of learning to do.\nIf you are interested in making serious documentary films, or telling thought-provoking videos for TV or social medial, then this course has a lot to offer.\nMuch of what is being taught here is not, and cannot be taught in a classroom. It goes beyond theory, as the course is based on actual, highly successful productions.",

Typically, they are taught with outdated methods which stem from the 90's, with boring talking heads and bad imagery. This class, instead, teaches you how to make modern, cinematic, and story-driven character docs that engage viewers both visually and emotionally.\nThis class will cover the whole documentary filmmaking lifecycle, covering how to plan, how to shoot, and how to edit. Part travelogue, part course, this course will show you how to craft a resonant documentary film with the hand of an artisan and eye of a storyteller. Showing behind-the-scenes footage, they bring you along Dandan's journey of making her beautiful short doc in Tokyo about a female boxer, also known as \"The Japanese Million Dollar Baby.\"\nAll of the lessons are designed to be applicable, get straight-to-the-point, and use minimal affordable equipment. They present Dandan's signature filmmaking approach, where you'll get to travel with a light footprint and gain access to your character's world in a natural, non-intrusive way.\nBy the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge, confidence, and a complete roadmap needed to make your first documentary short.\n\nCome join us in this creative adventure!",

      "description": "Behind the Blackmagic\nColor grading still enjoys an odd, almost mystical status among some filmmakers, but what if I told you that you can do it with software that you can get for free?  Well, there's no magic (Blackmagic doesn't count) here, just hard graft and know-how.  This course will take you from a standing start, right the way through to high-end and professional color grading using the excellent post-production solution; Da Vinci Resolve.  The training material I'm providing comes from real-world projects where I was paid to provide my labor.  I'm going to take you through how I approached each one of these projects to achieve professional results.\nOn this course, you will learn:\nThe full Da Vinci Resolve workflow, from receiving a project right through to final delivery\nPrimary grading tools which work on the entire image\nSecondary grading tools which allow you to make highly accurate corrections to your image\nKeying, tracking and rotoscoping in the color panel\nThe parallel and layer mixer nodes, and when to use them\nBest practices for large and complex projects\nTips and tricks to deal with challenging footage\nDa Vinci Resolve color management, including LUTs and camera RAW decoding\nDa Vinci Resolve's OpenFX plugins, including the Beauty and film grain plugins\nHow to make your footage sing and deliver a project professionally, every time\nAnd much, much more!\nI'm now a Blackmagic Design certified trainer in Da Vinci Resolve, and I've been color grading professionally for over nine years.  In that time I've produced work for brands such as Unilever, Greggs Bakery, TNT Logistics, Joules (a UK clothing line), the NHS, the BBC and Virgin Airlines.  It doesn't stop there, either.  I've delivered drama and factual work for broadcast and web, as well as feature films for international distribution.\nMissing a mentor?\nI'm bringing the benefit of my experience to this course because I know what it's like to have no-one to teach you.  When I started to grade on my film course back in university, there were no tutors who could teach me to grade at all.  I wound up spending long nights in the grading suite (some winter days I actually missed the sun completely) teaching myself to use Resolve from scratch.  It paid off as I wound up delivering grading work for the BBC wildlife unit, on the project that became Life Stories, whilst still studying at university!  But why was it like that?  I still believe I'd be a lot better now if I'd had the right training earlier, all the harder to iron out bad habits when there's no-one around to call you out!\nSo this course is my attempt to provide that support and that training to as many people as possible, all for the price of a pizza (a heavily discounted pizza if it's a large one).  If you want to learn how to finish your film projects to a higher standard, then come along as we cover Da Vinci Resolve in Depth in this course!",

Want to learn how to become a working Hollywood director in Television or Film?\nIn this online course you'll learn When to Move the Camera in your next film and video production. The key here is that camera movement must be invisible. It should serve the story without calling attention to itself. Next, learn How To Move the Camera most effectively by systematically fulfilling Five Tasks when designing each moving master shot. Finally, learn how a master of visual design like Zemeckis customizes his application of these Five Tasks to the unique demands of each scene.\nThey DON'T teach you this in Film School!\nTHIS COURSE IS AMAZING!!! I'm learning SO FREAKIN MUCH from it, and it's totally blowing my mind. Thanks so much to Gil and Alex for putting this course together. I'm a director working on my first horror film, which has a bit of action in it, and this course is totally giving me rocket boots.

Gil will show you how Kathryn Bigelow, John Woo and others ignite the screen by putting the camera in the right place and using the right lenses.

      "description": "Do you want to understand the creative techniques broadcast pros use when shooting for a TV show?\nWould you like to be taught by a genuine TV broadcast professional?\nDo you want to improve the quality of your videos, to the point where your audience can't get enough?\nAre you moving from still photography to video, and are not finding it easy?\nAre your videos just not getting noticed and shared on your YouTube channel?\nAs a professional video cameraperson, are you not getting noticed because your work is technically fine, but not creatively outstanding?\nThen you have come to the right place.\nMaking great video is not some great secret that no one is willing to share. The trouble is, most video courses on the net are presented by filmmakers making wedding videos and low budget music videos or their own YouTube channel. Very few are broadcast professionals. The proof is that most courses focus primarily on equipment, which requires limited creative insight.\nThis course is different\nI've been a broadcast professional for 37 years. And I've won international awards for my work. And I will now teach you the creative elements needed to make great videos. So, if you want to improve your videos to the point where they enrapture the audience and have them begging for more, know this: It is NOT about getting better equipment!\nBecause . . .\nFilmmakers:\nProfessionals worry about money,\nArtists worry about light and sound,\nAmateurs worry about equipment.\nIf you spend a lot of time worrying about equipment, is it not the time you stepped up to being an artist or a professional?\nEven if you understand codecs, and cameras and sensors sizes and lenses, it is not enough. Knowledge without skills can never create a masterpiece.\nAnd that is why this course is about honing your creative video skills. I do this in two parts. This course covers easy to understand shooting techniques that are used by broadcast professionals being paid upward of $1000 per day. The second course, is the creative editing: Video Editing -  Inspire your audience with creative flair. (That's a different course)\nCameras and gear\nWhen you enjoy a great meal, do you congratulate the chef by saying, \"You must have a great stove?\" Of course you don't. It's the same with filmmakers. A great film is not created by a great camera. It's created by talented, creative people. And those people use tools (cameras and lenses) to do it.\nSo this course is not about the tools. It is about  why a tool might be used in a particular way. So if you are in need of creative inspiration, then these courses are right for you.\nWe teach the creative part of video filmmaking.\nWe teach filmmaking skills at a level that can be understood by the lay-person or amateur cinematographer, from techniques used by broadcast professionals.\nDuring this course you will learn what is needed to tell a story on video, while informing and entertaining the viewer, no matter who they are. You will learn the important elements that go to make up a story, the affect of the visual elements and the importance and affect of the audio track. You will learn to prioritise when shooting, to enable the editing process to be easy and intensely creative. By using the techniques taught here, you can become a great video storyteller.\nThere are 42 lectures and 7 quizzes. Most  instruction is by video, with examples and samples.\nPart 1. Identify the kind of programs you want to make.\nPart 2. The five most important elements of video storytelling. The importance of audio.\nPart 3. From still photography to videography, we cover information versus emotion. The effect that audio has on an image.\nPart 4. Shooting techniques: The 4-second rule is the secret to delivering footage for the edit. I also teach editing-in-camera versus shooting for the edit, and more.\nPart 5. Shooting techniques: Perspective, zooms, lenses, light, composition, perspective, shooting interviews and much more.\nPart 6. Equipment ideas.\nPart 7. Conclusion and introduction to the editing course\nI hope you will enjoy and learn much from spending this time with me.\nJoin over 32 000 of my students from 154 countries!\n\n\nYour lecturer\nAndrew St Pierre White has 37-years as a broadcast professional, with international awards to his credit. He understands what it takes to capture great footage and audio to make compelling videos, even on a low indie producer budget. Whether it be a documentary series, a 30-second commercial, or a YouTube product review, he has done it all. His YouTube channel boasts over six million views a year and his commercials and TV shows have been broadcast all over the world..\nLatest testimonial on Udemy:\nThis is an excellent course for videographers who want to learn from a professional with over 30 years experience. BEST COURSE ON UDEMY. 10/10 Richard Butler, 1 hr 21 mins ago ·\n\nTestimonials from our seminar attendees:\n\"Even though I used to shoot still photos for a national news organization, I had no idea how different the video story-telling process is from still photography.  In just one class with Andrew, I learned more about making a great video than I had in all my other classes combined.  Andrew's practical focus comes from 30 plus years of being a doer, not just a teacher.  And make no mistake, Andrew is a GREAT, humble and respectful teacher.  Andrew's class opened my eyes (and ears!) to how to tell compelling stories through video, and made me a much better consumer of the art as well.  Thanks, Andrew!\"\nRobert Towry\nMonument, CO, United States\n\" I was fortunate to attend Andrews' class in Flagstaff, Arizona this year. A still photographer at heart, I wanted to make the leap into video making. With Andrews class I have learned so much and was so motivated that I want to become the next Spielberg! The course was informative and fun, from theory to fascinating clips that kept us all wanting more! There are many teachers who teach, but Andrew inspires and knows how to tell a story! \"\nConnie Blaeser\nSpruce Grove, Alberta, Canada",

Each button will be explained and used for practice.\nThen comes the fun part where we'll create effects, titles and custom animations.\nFinally we'll finish our video with color corrections and audio mixing to export the video with the best quality settings in a small file format.\nFAQ\nI have Premiere Pro CS6, can I follow this course? Sure you can! This course has been created to get you started with the fundamental features that came from older versions.\nWill I be able to create explosions and crazy visual effects after this course? I'm sorry to let you down, but no. Premiere Pro is a cut and slice program. But it's the core of the video editing process. Visual effects lay on top of your edit which is done in other applications and then brought to Premiere Pro.\nDo I need a fast computer? As you will learn the basics you don't need a fast computer. But it will make editing much more pleasant once you can playback your footage smoothly.\nMust I have video footage before I can take this course? Nope, I've made it easy for you. In the course attachment you can find the same video footage as used within the course. There's no copyright on it, so feel free to edit those clips and share it online!",

The strategies taught in this course are guaranteed to increase your video production earnings whether you are a veteran or are just getting started.\nRead what students are saying:\n\"This course is, by far, the best course I have taken here on UDEMY. The production is ultra-professional, the content is compelling and engaging and Logan hosts it with a perfect blend of professionalism and subtle humor.\" - Christian\n\"These have been VERY insightful Logan. It's so funny that I came across your learning program cause I JUST got a customer (who is a big company here in Nashville) but I mainly shoot stills. And as I left their office, I was pumped but I was like \"what the heck am I gonna make it about? And why is this so hard for me to get my head around why I feel so lost and anxious like I don't know what I'm doing\" haha. Even if I learned NOTHING else (which hasn't been the case) the money for this course is worth even the first two lessons ... Golden nuggets here Logan. Seriously, THANK YOU. I was about to make this video for this company in HOPES that they like it. HAD NO idea about any of this stuff. AND I went to college for film and audio, this is the first time of heard any of this. I could go on FOREVER but I can't tell you how grateful I am that you created this course and I can't stress enough that this showed up JUST in the nick of time. Excited to keep learning!\" -Dan\n\"Awesomest video course ever ever ever! I will give 6 stars!!!\" - Syed\n\"Make The Right Video will actually teach you something that you DON'T know!

      "description": "Do you want to be a filmmaker? Most video courses focus on teaching how to get better footage. And that's a good first step. But this course will do far more. It will teach you how to weave great footage into an even greater story, regardless of how mundane or ordinary the topic may be.\nI'm a TV producer, director and editor. My shows have been on major networks in many countries. I've been doing this for 38 years. And no matter where your videos will be displayed, you need to know the content of this course. Most of it you will not find in any other course, mainly because I think most video instructors don't appreciate just how important it is.\nSo, if you wish to entertain an audience, which means to have them enjoy your videos and look forward to more, good storytelling is the key. The best footage in the world is just not enough unless its crafted into a tight and engaging story. And capturing footage suitable for telling a story is what you will learn here. It begins before the shoot, continues during the shoot and on well into the editing room. Let's begin . . .\nYou'll learn these things:\nDifferent cameras and what makes them different.\nGood videography is less about fancy expensive equipment and more about telling a story.\nHow to determine what kind of videos you want to make, and what equipment is needed.\nCamera equipment is the great temptation. How to avoid spending on things that are promoted as needed, when all they do is briefly satisfy the ego.\nHow to shoot a scene to tell a story. Shooting is not just about 'getting great footage'. It's about capturing elements to tell a story during the shoot.\nLearn the mind space one should use to tell a story as its being shot. This is necessary because creating a story after the footage is shot, sets one up for failure in the edit.\nWhy should shooting and editing not be regarded as seperate processes.\nPans, zooms, top-shots, eye-lines, white-balance, B-roll and more. Not only how to get them right, but why they work in a story. Your footage will look like a pro's shot it. And when you begin your edit, you'll love me for it!\nFor example, I'll not only tell you what a pan is, how to shoot a smooth one, but more importantly, why would a pan work in a story.  Nobody ever teaches this stuff!\nB-roll footage? Techniques for extreme efficiency in footage gathering.\nAudio.  Techniques for extreme efficiency in audio content gathering.\nEditing software choices and links to free edit software that is, surprisingly, absolutely brilliant. It's also free, and I still use it. Wow!\nEditing techniques. I'll teach some simple rules that'll turn your audience's heads.\nEditing can be intimidating, because in many ways, its the most difficult part. But it's actually quite easy as long as the footage gathered is done with the story in mind. I'll teach you how this is done.\nHow to avoid the amateur traps; the shooting and editing techniques that might look cool, but actually shout 'beginner here!'.\nLook like a pro right from the start!\nMusic and how to find it, know its right, and use it properly.\nAnd a lot more.\nI hope you will enjoy and learn much from spending this time with me.\nJoin over 32 000 of my students from 154 countries!",

      "description": "This course is an advanced and in-depth guide to arguably the most important part of a Director of Photography's job: designing the lighting.\nRather than demonstrating techniques in isolation in a studio, this course takes place entirely on location. The intent is to show the realities of creating beautiful lighting while dealing with the usual challenges of real independent film production, like time, weather and equipment, as well as meeting the requirements of the script.\nThe course consists of four modules: Day Exterior, Day Interior, Night Interior and Night Exterior. Each module follows the blocking, lighting and shooting of a short scripted scene (inspired by the fantasy web series Ren: The Girl with the Mark) with two actors in full costume. Watch experienced Director of Photography Neil Oseman and his team set up all the fixtures, control the light with flags and rags, and make adjustments when the camera moves around for the coverage. Every step of the way, Neil explains what he's doing and why, as well as the alternatives you could consider for your own films. Each module concludes with the final edited scene so that you can see the end result.",

It's all here!\nI also give you access to free video footage and music to download and follow along step by step as we learn to edit each section, mastering each tool and feature; so you don't even need your own video to learn here, I have it all for you!

      "description": "Who Is This For?\nThis course was made for YouTubers, filmmakers, Vloggers, professional video editors, who want to edit for others like freelance. Content creators for YouTube and social media often want a simplified workflow, and Filmora certainly provides that kind of editing experience. But does that mean it’s something experienced editors should ignore? Not necessarily. Filmora9 does not have the features of professional software like Premiere, Final Cut, Media Composer, or Resolve. But if you are cutting a short film or documentary and have a limited budget it can get the job done.\nFeatures\nFilmora’s timeline can handle up to 100 layers, so this isn’t exactly iMovie. Any editing program is going to have basic editing and transform controls, but Filmora9 also has basic compositing and audio tools. The program also features full 4K support (both UHD and DCI 4K). I found this pleasantly surprising since free versions of professional applications often are restricted to HD projects. Here are a few other features worth mentioning:\nSupported Formats\nAs you might expect the supported recording formats are quite limited. You won’t be editing RED footage with Filmora, of course. If you’re using a DSLR or mirrorless camera then you shouldn’t have to worry about supported codecs. Filmora9 does not support ProRes as a recording format, but it is listed as a supported export format. Here’s a list of all the supported recording and export formats, as well as system requirements.",

      "description": "Fundamentals of VFX is a comprehensive training series that gives you in-depth knowledge and insight into the process of creating visual effects.\n\n\n***** Excellent foundational knowledge! I would absolutely consider it a must-watch before moving to more practical courses. *****\n- Alexandre Schead\n\n\n***** Great Intro to VFX, this information can be confusing for a beginner trying to find it spread around the internet but this course puts it all together in a structured and focused way that gives you an understanding of where you should focus your efforts after completing this.

Every  beginner should have this. *****\n- Joseph Stark\n\n\n***** Amazing course, I have learnt so much from this course.

I had already done a vfx course before but it was good to go back to basics and brush up on some much needed theory.

During this course we unlock key areas of visual effects production and explain complicated and technical concepts in an easy-to-understand way. The course spans the length of 14 lectures that make your learning experience exciting and engaging.\n\n\nLearn the techniques behind successful VFX shots\n\nHollywood blockbusters and the best video games of today rely on the use of 3D and Motion Graphics in an ever-increasing measure. This has increased our awareness and capacity to spot even the slightest imperfections in photo-realism.\nThis of course sets the bar very high for visual effects artists. It’s not enough merely to drop a 3D model into your composition, tweak the contrast and adjust the colors. And even if you have all the right tools, you need to know how to use them and in what order.\nCreating convincing and realistic visual effects takes a lot of thought, time and talent. Things such as lighting, optics,  camera angles and movements must be taken into consideration when compositing elements together. Intricate details and subtle effects are key factors for photo realistic results.\nIn this series we want to give you a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental requirements and techniques for combining 3D and Motion Graphics into live footage so that you can take your work to the next level.\n\n\n\n\nWe will guide you through the following lectures:\n01 - Course Introduction\n02 - History of VFX\n03 - Mattes\n04 - Chroma Keying I\n05 - Chroma Keying II\n06 - Matching I (Lighting)\n07 - Matching II (Optics)\n08 - Matching III (Tracking)\n09 - Rendering\n10 - Advanced Compositing\n11 - Colour Theory\n12 - Layer/Node-based Compositing and Software\n\n\nEven though we have packed the course with a ton of information, we have also made sure it does not take you ages to go through it. If you are time-conscious and yet want to gain a profound understanding of the most fascinating field in the filmmaking industry, then Fundamentals of VFX is for you!",

In 10 hours, this course provides you with the equivalent of Marcus' 5 years of experience—tips, tricks, and hacks to get you ahead of your peers.\n\nUnlike most other options out there, this course is completely up to date and viable for use in 2024 (and is updated whenever there are important new changes).\nAs if that wasn't enough, if you sign up for the course today, you'll receive a 1-year subscription to GYGC Support for free (Value: $299.88):\nYour GYGC Support Subscription allows you to personally contact Marcus and his team for help, support, and advice!\nAs you can see, this really is the ultimate one-stop shop for those wanting to start a successful gaming channel and reach thousands of people. But don't just take my word for it!\n\nHere’s what some of my previous students had to say:\n\n\"It’s an awesome course, I can’t recommend it highly enough. Really pleased. It’s been a lovely project to spend some time on with my family. We’re in the middle of the Coronavirus lockdown at the moment, so it’s been a wonderful project for me to spend some time on with my kids. It’s brought me closer together with them as well—great result.\" – Andy\n\n\"[The GYGC course is] kinda insane! Before the course, I had about 80 subscribers and something like 2,000 views on the channel. Now, about 5 months after I took it, I have over 1,500 subscribers and well over 200,000 views on my channel. I can’t believe it!\" – Elliot\n(Note: Just a few short months after writing this review, Elliot now has over 70,000 subscribers!)\n\n\"[The GYGC course] is suitable for beginners who’ve never used or seen a video editing program, for people like me who have a bit of experience but still need to learn a lot, and even the pros who can edit videos in their sleep! [The GYGC course] helps you get to know more about how YouTube works, what settings are best to use, copyright because that’s a big thing, and other stuff you may not have known.\" – Jakub\n\n\"I thought there’s no way I can create professional videos myself without a bunch of time and a professional editing team... Until I came across Marcus’ course. So I just got it. I dove right in, took immediate action, and I was able to start producing videos on my channel in no time. Professional-looking videos too, mind you.\" – Earl\nTo sum everything up, my students and I believe that the GYGC course is awesome. Because I stand behind my program 110%, I also offer a 100% risk-free guarantee. In other words, if you complete the GYGC course and do not get the value you were looking for, I will provide you with a full refund—no questions asked.",

      "description": "Video production. There are thousands of online video production courses, so why should you enroll in this one? This is the longest, most comprehensive, and most in depth video production course in the world on the specific niche of how to make human beings come across their best when they are speaking on video.\nThe missing ingredient in so many video productions is having a compelling, interesting, engaging human being speaking. So many courses on video production get lost in the details of lighting, editing software, and the latest technology with video cameras. Of course, all of those things are important, but if all you do is focus on the technology you can still end up with the boring, lifeless, and uninteresting video.\nIf you are only going to take one video production course, then this should not be your course. But if you’re serious about producing high-quality video then you should take this course in addition to others that cover all the basics of the technical aspects of video production. Frequently, great video production features compelling human beings speaking on camera. If all you do is obsess over lighting, graphics and animation you’re doomed to create a mediocre video.\nIf you are creating videos for online courses, YouTube channels, Facebook pages, email marketing, website content, etc. then you are likely featuring yourself or somebody else speaking on camera. You need to know how to make that person come across great. Because if you have great lighting, great editing and beautiful fonts, none of that matters if the person speaking on video seems flat, or bored, or boring, or uninteresting, or low energy, or bland.\nIf your video production is going to be high-quality then you need to know how to direct talent speaking on camera, even if you are your own talent. This course is longer and more in depth on the subject of directing talent and than any other video production course on this platform.\nMessage from the instructor: \"I’ve been producing videos with experts, politicians, CEOs, and business leaders around the world for more than 30 years. Most people are simply not great at speaking in a convincing way in front of a video camera. They must be directed, coached, and advised in a certain way to make them look and sound their best. In this course, I share with you all the secrets I’ve learned from coaching more than 10,000 executives before their media and on camera experiences.\" TJ Walker\nPlease note: this course is not designed for video producers who are exclusively focused on cartoons, animation, special effects, and pure image-based video productions.\nThis course is meant to supplement at least one other course of your choosing that covers all the technical aspects of video production.\nTechnicians, editors, and production assistants are increasingly seen as a commodity in today’s worldwide video production employment marketplace. If you want your video production skills to really stand out and for you to be seen as a first class producer then you need to know how to be a great director and to bring out the most compelling presentations from anyone speaking on camera in your video production. This course will teach you how.\nHere is what Udemy students say about this course:\n\"Full of great information, without the fluff. Great instructor, and great presentation.\" David Lee\n\"Direct, well-organized, motivated facilitator, great course!\" Brenda Newby\n\"Lessons are short but packed with information. This course covers much more topics than I expected. Lectures are interesting to watch, easy to understand and all of them could be used to improve any video with talking heads. Great course!\" Tihon Sergeenko\n\n\nIf you are ready to bring your video production skills up to a whole new advanced level, then enroll in this course right now.",

The creative side, far less so. And making great videos in not rocket science. I'm not a wedding videographer. I'm a professional filmmaker, having 30 years of TV commercials and documentaries and dramas under my belt. Having been through that, I now make my own films with a global audience of millions. (over 75 million views and 300K+ subs on YouTube).\nLesson-1. It's not the gear that makes videos good. It's the ability to tell stories.\nLesson-2. If your soundtrack isn't good, your video won't be good.\nHere you'll learn what is really important in making great videos, and how to get there fast.\nI've kept things easy to understand, with no unnecessary jargon, and in just 30 lessons I'll get you from knowing almost nothing, to making videos that people will really love to watch. And that you will love to make!\nWelcome to getting really good at making videos - fast.\nI hope you will enjoy and learn much from spending this time with me.\nJoin over 32 000 of my students from 154 countries!",

      "description": "This course explains the role of a Director of Photography (aka DP, DOP, Cinematographer) on set, from collaborating with the director in blocking the cast and choosing the camera angles, to lighting the scene with depth and mood.\nAcross the four modules of the course, watch experienced DP Neil Oseman set up and shoot scenes in common contemporary locations: domestic banter in a sunny kitchen, a monologue in a dark bedroom, an awkward first date in a restaurant, and a walk-and-talk in an outdoor bar. Watch him try out different blocking and camera angles to get the most depth and interest in the frame, create movement using a slider and a gimbal, and work out the coverage needed to complete the scene. Then learn the secrets of cinematic lighting as he sets up LED, tungsten and practical lights to create a look. Witness the camera rehearsals through to the final take, then sit back and watch the final edited scene. Every step of the way, Neil explains what he's doing and why, as well as the alternatives you could consider for your own films.\nThis is a follow-up to Neil's best-selling Udemy course \"Cinematic Lighting\", but it's accessible to anyone with a grasp of the basic concepts of cinematography.",

      "description": "The undeniable fact is that it’s great content that makes a great YouTube channel.\nYour lecturer is a highly successful YouTuber . . . And he says, \"While YouTube marketing, SEO and thumbnails are important, they must take second place to content. Viewers wanting more content results in subscriptions, fans, followers and income. Every successful YouTuber knows this.\"\nThis course focusses on how the great YouTubers became as successful as they are. Ask anyone of them, and they will surely answer, “We had the content people wanted. And that's not a difficult thing to accomplish.”\nYouTube is like real estate when they say, \"location, location, location.\" With YouTube, it's content, content, content. Why does it take most YouTubers years to reach just 1000 subscribers? Mostly, because their content is uninteresting, uninspiring or mediocre.\nWould you like to grab 1000 in just a month? The secret is great content.\nThis course is for people wanting to join the wonderful YouTube family of successful creators. Great content makes a great channel. Everything else is secondary. And, as important, creating great content leads to personal satisfaction, which means your channel will have a long and healthy life.\nThis course is here to help YouTubers, young and old, to create great content. It is creative in nature.\nGreat marketing is pointless without great content. This course is about content creation, because content is king!\nI began my career 38 years ago in advertising, editing TV commercials for big agencies. Much later I made TV documentaries for big networks. Now I have my own adventure travel TV show on YouTube.\nI can honestly say I’m having more fun now earning from my YouTube channel releases than I did chasing TV companies. Now they chase me!\nI launched my YouTube channel in 2008 as a means to market my work, but not gather viewers. That changed in 2014 when I finally understood the YouTube model and began to create content specifically designed to grow my channel.\nSince then, my subscribers have grown, currently topping 240 000.  Without any special marketing and SEO techniques, I went from 12 000 to 100 000 subscribers in less than four years. I attribute it to the quality of content. As a side benefit, because the quality is good enough, it has attracted sponsors.\nI’d like you to enjoy this level of success too.\nYou will learn:\nCameras. A practical overview on what makes great self-content gear.\nMicrophones. An overview on capturing great sound.\nKeeping out the shake. Legs, tripods, mounts and more\nDon’t dwell too much on the equipment. It’s not as important as you may think.\nTechniques for addressing the camera and audience.\nShooting from the hip ready for the edit.\nB-roll content. 4-second rule\nSelf-shooting and selfies.\nSkin tones out of doors.\nNatural lighting principals\nEditing:\nAudio. Neglect the audio quality at the expense of everything.\nEditing techniques for vlogs, stories and grabbing your audience in the first 5 seconds.\nEditing software choices.\nAvoiding the perils of poor music choice. The fastest way to lose a viewer.\nKeep it snappy but not disturbing.\n“Get on with it!”. How to step back and look at an edit sequence objectively.\nGetting your audience to feel something.\nInvitations to your viewers to watch more.\nTitles and thumbnails.\nLive broadcasts.\nScheduling.\nYoutube challenges and how to balance a YouTubers' life.\nIncome production alternatives.\nThe current catch phrase in the world of YouTube creators is, 'Content, content, content'. Come with me, and I'll help yours get better. I hope you will enjoy and learn much from spending this time with me.\nJoin over 32 000 of my students from 154 countries!\nsincerely,\nAndrew St Pierre White",

      "description": "If great footage + average editing = average result, and average footage + great editing = great result, what does great footage plus great editing equal?\nDo you want to understand the rules broadcast professionals use when editing a TV show?\nDo you want to improve the quality of your videos, to the point where your audience can't get enough?\nAre you moving from still photography to video, and is editing a major challenge?\nAre your videos just not getting noticed and shared on your YouTube channel?\nYou are a professional video editor, but are not getting noticed because your work is technically fine, but not creatively outstanding?\nThen you have come to the right place.\nOperators and editors.\nIn the pro broadcast world, there two types of editors: Operators and editors.\nAn operator is someone who should be an expert at the software, understands codecs, as well as the export parameters needed for broadcast. Very often, these people are not particularly creative, because creativity is not their main focus. Often, it's the technical side of video that excites them the most.\nBefore you do this course, I have a question:\nDo you mainly want to be taught all the technical stuff regarding video production? (called an operator-editor) Or. . .\nDo you want to become a creatively intuitive, clever video editor, that can create amazing content from your, or other people's footage? (called an editor) If yes, then this course is for you.\nIf you answered 1, then this is not a course for you. I don't teach the tech stuff at all. Because, honestly, I am no expert myself. I have worked in broadcast TV as an editor for 37 years, won awards in New York and Cannes, and yet I still only have a basic understanding of the tech stuff. Because, believe it or not, I don't need it. And neither do you!\nI am an editor. I am not an operator.\nEditing video (understanding the software) is a straightforward, if complex subject. It is taught all over the Internet. But find me a truly creative video editing course. I can't find a good one anywhere. So I created this one.\nEditing video is easy to do, but difficult to do well.\nThe trouble is, most video courses on the net are presented by filmmakers making wedding videos and low budget music videos. Very few are broadcast professionals. The proof is that most video editing courses focus primarily on software, which requires limited creative insight.\nThis course is not about software.\nYou will learn:\nHow to attract, grab and hold onto your audience,\nHow to entertain your audience, and have them wanting more,\nHow to make your edits seamless and integrated,\nHow to select music, and avoid the dangers of bad music choices,\nHow to avoid the traps amateurs often fall into,\nHow to use the power of visual elements,\nThe importance of the audio track. Oh, so important!\nMusic montage editing— easy to do, but difficult to do well,\nHow to edit dialogue,\nHow and when to use transitions,\nHow to maximise the power of sound effects,\nSome stuff about YouTube.\nEditing software and what's good, and what's less good.\nAll these skills will make your editing experience easy and intensely creative. You can become a great filmmaker.\nYou will need:\nA broadband Internet connection,\nA laptop or desktop computer.\nEditing software able to edit multi-layered audio tracks. Manipulating multi-layered audio is fundamental to good editing. Any edit software with multi-layer capability, able to handle your source footage, will do.\nA basic understanding of video editing. As this is not a software course, you will need an understanding of your software, how to ingest media from your camera card, and how to set up a time-line to begin editing.\nAn ongoing project would be an advantage so you can practice some of the techniques shown right away,\nA sprit of learning something new and intensely creative,\nBe prepared to have some fun.\n\n\nThe syllabus\n\nPart One: Preparation for the edit. Knowing where everything is frees you up to be creative.\nPart Two: How to capture your audience within the first 20 seconds and keep them riveted.\nPart Three: Music choice, music montage editing, back timing for effect and more.\nPart Five: Editing styles. Lots of examples of styles and their affect on the audience,\nPart Five: Transitions, pace and the story, and editing techniques,\nPart Six: Lots of actual broadcast examples. Why they work and the techniques used,\nPart Six: You-tube and presenting to camera. We talk software to assist you in making the right choice. Also, helpful tips on creating a You-tube channel and make money from it.\n\nSoftware and equipment\nLike our shooting course, we don't spend much time talking about equipment. We focus on teaching techniques to tell a great story—whether it's a full-length documentary, a wedding, or a 30-second commercial, it's all about story-telling.\nYou need to know the basics of your chosen editing software already. This is very important: Although what we teach is performed using computer software, this is NOT a software course. Instead of, how to use the software, this is, what to do with the software.\nIt does not matter what software you have chosen for your editing setup. As long as you know the basics, everything will be easy to follow and understand.\nYour lecturer\nAndrew St Pierre White has 37 years as a broadcast professional, with international awards to his credit. Included in these are Cannes Film Festival, Gold Award for Editing, New York TV, Silver Award Editing and Louries TV Awards South Africa, Grand Prix Editing.\nHe has edited numberless TV commercials, nine documentary series, many corporate videos and some TV dramas. His work has been broadcast on major channels and networks on six continents. As a director of TV, some of his work is on YouTube, where his channel boasts 76 million views and over 300K subscribers.",

I directed the HBO series TELEMARKETERS, which was nominated for an Emmy in 2024, and three documentaries that were the #1 documentary on the iTunes charts. I've had an incredible amount of success in my career, but I have also failed many, many times.

It's all in this 5 hour course.\nOther courses give general knowledge of how to make a film from people with minimal actual real-world experience. This course is taught directly from my experience making ten feature length documentary films, all of which have received worldwide distribution and been translated into many languages.\n*Watch some of the documentary short films made by my students at youtube. com/worldcinema:\nRickshaw Girl by Muzahidul Islam Zahin, a filmmaker and activist based in Dhaka, Bangladesh\nKwizera: A Story of Hope Born from Risiliance by Sahil Laul, a filmmaker based in the USA",
