      "description": "This is the perfect introductory course for those looking to understand the world of digital media. User experience design is much more than creating interfaces; it’s a multidisciplinary approach to shaping how individuals engage with digital social media. Human psychology plays a crucial role in these interactions, especially in fostering a sense of \"agency\" — the confidence that users can effectively achieve their goals within the network. Equally important is understanding how social media platforms are shaped by the evolving legal and regulatory landscape, including data privacy laws, ethical standards, concerns about misinformation, and the influence of algorithmic bias. These forces significantly affect how people behave online and how platforms design user experiences.\n\n\nIn this course, participants will explore the intersection of social media design, user experience, and human behavior, gaining comprehensive knowledge to manage content development and steer future technologies. Students will delve into how design choices impact user engagement, affect societal trends, and drive important discussions around platform accountability and user trust. They will also gain a deeper understanding of the balance between user autonomy and platform control.\n\n\nRather than focusing on any specific tools or software, the course offers a holistic perspective on how digital social media environments shape human behavior, providing participants with strategic insights and a framework to navigate the complexities of the digital world.",

Then the scheduler features and options are discussed step-by-step using carefully selected examples.\nBy the time the user is done with this course, he/she will be well equipped to power his/her site with the new scheduler functionality.\nPlease note that since the scheduler is currently in beta release, some of the functionality might change, but the core concepts will remain the same.",

However, this is dangerous, as it prevents us from being more calm - both in terms of relaxing our body, but also quieting the internal chatter in our minds.\nIn this course, you are going to learn more about the fundamentals of mindfulness and its components. You will learn how mindfulness is different from meditation. All of these contribute to being more present and aware in everyday life, which has multiple beneficial consequences:\n- Being less stressed and more relaxed;\n- Being in better health (breathing better and being less tense);\n- Being less negative and judgmental (both about events and yourself);\nThis course will be especially helpful to you if:\n- You frequently judge yourself or don't accept certain parts of yourself;\n- You still ruminate on past events and are not able to gain closure on them;\n- You are frequently stressed with situations;\n- You feel like you are not \"present\", living in a world full of distractions and escapes;\nThis short course will tell you both about the major concepts of mindfulness, as well as some practical tools to help cultivate it. By the time you're done, you will be able to cultivate a calmer, more aware, more relaxed presence.\nWho this course is for:\nYou're anyone seeking ways to calm down the internal chatter or take some of the pressure/stress off of yourself\nYou're anyone looking to better deal with stress and the preoccupations of everyday life\nYou're anyone who is curious about how to be more aware and mindful of your internal mental processes",

Mail, Hotmail, your ISP email...\nGaming: Xbox Live!, Playstation, Wii, Steam....\nStreaming: Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, Curiosity Stream...\nThe above list is only a small sample of sites you probably use on a regular basis.  In fact many people have over one hundred accounts and that list is growing all the time!\nHow do you keep track of all this information?\nUse the same few passwords among your accounts\nKeep a spreadsheet\nWrite them down on paper\nList them on a word processing document\nStick notes on your monitor\nUnfortunately none of those are good practices.  That's right - none of them.  For the best security you should have a different password for every account (site)!  These passwords should also be stored in an encrypted and safe manner.\nNow why should you use a different password? You have heard of massive data breaches haven't you? Where cyber criminals steal thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of account information?  It has happened to many sites including Adobe, eBay, Twitter, and many many others.\nIf your Twitter and bank passwords are the same and the cyber criminals steal your Twitter password, guess what? They could now potentially access your bank account! That would be a nightmare.\nSo every account on every site should have a unique password.  After all, the username is usually your email address so in most cases your account is only protected by your password.  However, there is more to this puzzle.\nYou should make your password as difficult for the cyber criminals to guess as possible.  That means quit using video123 and use something like R-'hJ@y|11_b@i&U%RfB-z`J7ZF0d\":blJg\"ksUg which is far more secure.\nNow you are probably wondering: how in the world do I have a unique long password for every site and easily keep track of all this information? Well, you are in the right place.  That is the whole point of this Udemy course.\nYour instructor, Jeremy O'Connell, will explain with videos how you secure your digital accounts and better protect yourself from cyber criminals.  So the next time when you hear on the news   of some site being hacked and millions of accounts being stolen you will know your accounts are safe and changing that site's password is no big deal.\nWhat are you waiting for?! This course is even free, so put away your wallet!",

      "description": "※貴重なお時間を無駄にされないよう、受講登録前に必ず、「要件」欄を全てご確認ください！ご受講いただいた時点で、全ての要件をご確認・ご了承いただいたものと見なします\n\n\n\n\n「業務効率化・DX・リスキリングに興味はあるけれど…」\n「文系の自分にはプログラミングなんてとても…」\n「結局挫折してしまいそうで…」\nそんな一歩踏み出すきっかけが欲しいあなたにオススメのコースです。\n\n\n\n\n企業・自治体・学校・etc...バックオフィスにお勤めの全ての方に！\nバックオフィス業務を効率化したいなら、コスト・汎用性・難易度・処理速度等の観点から総合的に見て、Excel VBA(マクロ)やRPAより断然Pythonをオススメします！\n\n\n\n\n\"必要十分なスキルを身につける\"。これが本コースの大きなコンセプトの１つです。\n世の中のプログラミング教材は、プログラミング初学者、特に「エンジニアを目指しているわけではないけれど、プログラミングに興味がある、自業務・実生活にプログラミングを活用してみたい」ぐらいで考えておられる方にとってはあまりにも過剰な知識を含んでおり、かつ基礎文法の解説ばかりで結局Pythonが自分にどのように役立つのかよく分からない、という場合が多いです。\n知識が網羅されており大ボリュームな教材は、必ずしも初学者にとって最適なものではなく、むしろ\"挫折の可能性を高めてしまうというデメリットの方が遥かに大きい\"と私は考えております。せっかく興味を持って学び始めたのに必須ではない知識の勉強が原因で挫折してしまう、というのは極めてもったいないですし、残念ながら実際よくあることです。\nなぜこのようなことが頻発してしまうかと申しますと、理由は大きく分けて２点あります。\n１点目は、\"ほとんどのプログラミング教材が現役エンジニアやエンジニア経験者によって作成されており、本当の初学者・独学者の気持ちやニーズが理解されていない\"からです。２点目に、学習者に非は無く不可避な話ではあるのですが、\"初学者であるが故に、どの知識が過剰なものなのか判別できない\"からなのです。\n\n\n本コースは、自身の独学経験も生かして、初学者の方が挫折せずにプログラミングの力と楽しさを実感していただけるような内容・ボリュームを意識して作成しました。言うならば、「こんな教材があったら良かったのに」「独学時代の自分に届けたい」と思える教材にしております。\nプログラミング教材でありがちな「とにかく教材を最後までこなすことが目的化してしまい、よく分からないまま写経してスキルアップした気になっただけで終わり」になってしまわないような工夫もしております。\nまた、他の多くのUdemyコースが質問回答や内容更新が無いまま放置されている中、私のコースでは、ルールに則ったうえで頂いたご質問には真摯に対応するとともに、皆様からのフィードバックを受け随時レクチャーの更新もしております。\n詳しいカリキュラムについては本ページ内の「コースの内容」欄をご確認ください。\n\n\n\n\nプログラミングは決して限られた人にしか扱えないものではありません。年齢も文系理系も関係ありません。\n誰にでも門戸は開かれており、あなたも必ずプログラムが書けるようになります。\nスマホのアプリを使うのと同じように、気楽に楽しみましょう。\n\n\n完璧である必要は全くなく、ハイレベルを目指す必要もありません。\n大谷翔平でなくても野球をして良いし、楽しむことができますよね。それと同じです。\nただあなたの日々の仕事や生活に、あなたのできる範囲でプログラミングを活用し、今より少しでも充実した日々になる。それで十分なのです。\n\n\nプログラミングを習得すれば、\nできる仕事の範囲が広がる・業務効率化により可処分時間が増える\n↓\n自分でコントロールできる仕事（裁量権）が増える・ストレスが減る\n↓\n会社生活・私生活がもっと充実する\nという好循環に入ることができます。\n\n\n\n\n「仕事が忙しくて勉強する時間が無い…」という方もたくさんいらっしゃると思います。私も以前は会社員でしたから、働きながら自己研鑽をする大変さは良く分かります。\nしかし、その忙しい現状を打破するためにこそ、忙しい合間を縫ってでも今、業務効率化スキルを学ぶべきなのです。少し厳しく聞こえるかもしれませんが、日々愚痴をこぼしながらも目の前のタスクを盲目的にこなし、勉強できない言い訳をしているだけでは、残念ながら状況は何も変わりません。\nまたよくありがちな落とし穴は、せっかく勉強にリソースを割いているのに\"概論的な勉強\"ばかりしてしまうことです。DX・BPR・EBPM…この界隈にはそれっぽいカッコイイ言葉が並びますが、（やらされ感を半分持ちながらも）そういった類の入門講座ばかりをむやみに受講し、言葉の定義を字面だけ暗記し、付け焼き刃の勉強で資格を取得し、なんとなく成長した気になったとしても…果たして実際に目の前の仕事は何か変えられていますか？\n楽は苦の種、苦は楽の種。是非「自分の力で自分の時間を作り出すんだ！」という気概を持って、毎日少しずつでもいいので\"目の前の仕事を効率化するための勉強\"に時間を割いてみていただければと思います。業務効率化は\"やったもん勝ち\"。習得が早ければ早いほど、恩恵は大きくなります。\n\n\n是非この機会に、私と一緒に楽しみながらリスキリングを始めましょう！\nそれでは、コースでお会いできることを楽しみにしております。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n★学習効率を最大化するための講師推奨ラーニングパス★\n①本コース\n（Python・プログラミングの基礎を学び、プログラムによってどんなことが実現できるのかを知る）\n↓\n②演習問題セット\n（基礎力を鍛え上げて自信をつけ、プログラミングの面白さを再確認し、学習のモチベーションをさらに上げる）\n↓\n③応用編・Excel自動化編・Windows編のうちニーズに合ったコース\n（様々なプログラミング活用方法を習得し、実務の効率化・自動化に繋げる）",

The world has taken our productivity onto digital platforms to a greater extent than ever seen before; Especially in the aftermath of the pandemic, but also with technologies advancing in general.\nWe look at key areas of virtual teamwork: from planning and scheduling to in-meeting facilitation, documentation & communication platforms, and how to building team spirit when you never see each other in real life. The aim is to give you a toolbox and to avoid the pitfalls of virtual teamwork for you and your team to enhance your efficiency, productivity, and overall experience of virtual work.\nMaybe you work in a small team or a big organization? Perhaps roles are clearly defined in your team, or you rather use an entirely horizontal structure? No matter the team, knowing how to facilitate your team’s performance and adaptability to the digital era are skills that any leader or team member can use to their own and their team’s advantage. Welcome to The VALE! Let the digital journey begin…\n(PS Especially as this is the first edition of this virtual module, we would appreciate all and any feedback.

I'm thrilled to guide you through this one-hour crash course, titled Quickstart Guide to Custom GPT Creation.\n\n\nWe live in an era where artificial intelligence is not just a buzzword; it's a reality shaping our daily interactions. At the forefront of this revolution is ChatGPT, a groundbreaking technology that has transformed how we interact with machines. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models. It's designed to understand and generate human-like text, leading to more natural and engaging conversations between humans and AI.\n\n\nThe significance of ChatGPT lies in its versatility. From customer service automation to creative writing, educational tutoring, and even coding assistance, ChatGPT has shown immense potential. It's like having a digital assistant that understands and responds with an almost human touch. This has not only improved efficiency in various sectors but also opened new avenues for innovation.\n\n\nBut what if I told you that the capabilities of ChatGPT could be tailored even more specifically to your needs? This is where the concept of Custom GPT comes into play. Custom GPTs are specialized versions of the original model, fine-tuned to excel in specific tasks or industries. Imagine having a ChatGPT model that understands medical terminology for healthcare applications, or one that can converse in the language of legal jargon for law firms. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\nIn this course, we will delve into the realm of Custom GPTs. You'll learn the basics of how these models work, what makes them so powerful, and most importantly, how you can create a Custom GPT model for your specific needs. Whether you're a business owner, a developer, an educator, or just an AI enthusiast, understanding how to create and use Custom GPT models can be a game-changer.\n\n\nThroughout this course, we will cover:\n\n\n1. The fundamentals of Custom GPT and how it works.\n2. The process of tailoring a Custom GPT model for specific tasks.\n3. Practical examples and use cases of Custom GPTs in various industries.\n4. Hands-on demonstrations to guide you in creating your very own Custom GPT model.\n\n\nRemember, this course is designed to be a concise yet comprehensive introduction. It's perfect for those who are short on time but eager to dive into the world of custom AI models.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will not only appreciate the power of ChatGPT but also possess the knowledge and skills to create a Custom GPT model that can revolutionize the way you, your business, or your industry operates.\n\n\nSo, let's embark on this exciting journey together and unlock the potential of customized AI with our \"Quickstart Guide to Custom GPT.\" Are you ready to transform the way you interact with the world of AI?

      "description": "If you feel like you’re always busy…\nIf you’re constantly stressed and overwhelmed, and frustrated that you can’t get a moment to yourself…\nThen this will be the most important message you read today.\nBecause today you’ll learn why you’re not getting the important things done... even when you try following all the productivity advice out there.\nAnd chances are, you’ve tried it all - planners, apps, courses, and more. It just never sticks.\nBut it’s not you -- it’s these methods that just don’t work.\nThe industry would have you believe that productivity is a matter of managing your time better. That it’s a matter of getting more done in less time.\nThat’s simply not true.\nSo if you’re tired of coming home after a stressful day, only to realize you didn’t get anything important done…\n… prepare to be shocked and see the real reason why you’re not getting the results you want with your current productivity tools and methods.\n\n\nThe Biggest Productivity Myth - Exposed!\nThe biggest myth about productivity that nobody questions is this:\nThat productivity equals getting more things done in less time.\nIt’s a big lie. And it’s why so many are still stressed and overwhelmed, despite using the latest calendar, planner, or productivity method.\nSo if productivity isn’t about time management or getting more things done, what is it?\nHere’s the answer from one of the greatest minds on productivity:\n“Time management is really a misnomer – the challenge is not to manage time, but to manage ourselves.” – Stephen R. Covey.\nIn other words, the key to being productive isn’t managing your time better. And it isn’t finding new and creative ways to “get more done” in a shorter period of time.\nInstead, it’s about managing you.\nThe key to being far more productive than you ever thought possible is to manage your energy and attention.\nBelieve it or not, I found this out when I was nine years old!\n\n\nIt's true. That's when I went to bed early on my own accord and woke up earlier than anyone else at home to spend time studying during weekdays. I had lots of fun in the weekends with friends. As a result, I ended up the top student year after year and earned scholarships that fully paid for my education from high school onwards. I continued to live and work this way throughout my career, spent lots of time with my kids when they were young, hardly worked weekends, and enjoyed work-life balance while being extremely productive at work and in volunteer activities.\n\n\nSo now, I’m on a mission to let you and anyone else know the true path to productivity!\nBecause it’s a shame that so many are banging their heads against the wall, wondering why they aren’t getting the results they want, despite using the planners, the to-do lists, and more.\n\n\nIn this course…\nYou’ll discover how to become the kind of person that gets the things that matter, done (all without tons of stress or overwhelm).\nYou’ll know exactly what it takes for you to be productive (and which habits you need to let go of that are robbing your time).\nAnd you’ll know exactly how to create your own, personalized productivity system that works for you and your personality.\n\n\nIn Productivity Master, you’ll also discover:\n● What productivity really is (hint: it's not about being busy or checking off every item on your to-do list!)\n● Why managing your time better is not the key to being productive (and what you need to manage instead)\n● The four \"practices\" of highly effective and productive people that will help you stay focused (and how to implement it in your own life)\n● How adopting one simple word and saying it more often will help you eliminate stress and get more of what matters done\n● The two kinds of tools you need to revolutionize your productivity (and no, you don't need yet another planner!)\n● How to structure your days for maximum productivity (and significantly boost your free time!)\n● The G.S.R.A. formula for getting the results you want with less time and effort\n● How to put your productivity on \"autopilot\" with a daily routine\n● How to properly \"schedule your work\" so you get it done easily - without willpower or struggle\n● How to adopt an \"inbox zero\" frame of mind so you can reduce stress and overwhelm\n● Simple ways to deal with resistance and get things done (even when you don't \"feel\" like doing them)\n● And much more...\n\n\nWhen you join How to Become a Productivity Master: Strategies and Secrets of the Most Successful People, you’ll learn the strategies and techniques you’ll need to adopt to achieve anything you want in your life with less time or effort.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Get\n\n\nHow to Become a Productivity Master: Strategies and Secrets of the Most Successful People includes a combination of in-depth and detailed instructions and hands-on activities. You’ll develop the productivity skills that will help you achieve the results you want in your life.\n\nIn this self-guided course, we’ll cover:\nLesson 1: What Do the Most Successful People Do?\nDiscover what the most successful people do, and learn what productivity is (and isn’t). This will give you a solid foundation for becoming a productivity master.\nLesson 2: What Does Productivity Really Look Like?\nLearn what being productive actually looks like and why being busy all the time and checking everything off your task list is NOT the same as being productive.\nLesson 3: Productivity Routines and Tools\nLearn how to establish your own personal productivity routines, so you stay productive without needing to use willpower.\nLesson 4: Creating Your Own Personal Productivity System\nLearn how to take everything you’ve learned so far and create your own personal productivity system.\nLesson 5: Maintaining Long-Term Productivity\nNow that you have your own system for being productive, you’ll learn how to use different tools to stay on track, troubleshoot any issues, and come up with solutions to address any challenges that come your way.\n\n\nEach power-packed lesson contains targeted activities to help you apply the concepts to your own life... so you can start getting more of what you want, with less time and effort.\nThe self-paced course contains everything you need to take your productivity to a whole new level.",

      "description": "O curso de Auxiliar Administrativo – Rotinas de Escritório visa preencher uma lacuna na qualificação profissional de jovens - que buscam uma formação para o seu primeiro emprego - e adultos - que procuram promoção no local onde atua, recolocação no mercado de trabalho ou novas ideais para implementar no controle e organização de seus pequenos negócios.\n\n\n\n\nConteúdos estudados\nO curso possui ao todo 23 episódios, composto por mais de 25 horas aulas em vídeo, incrementado com 23 roteiros de estudos disponibilizados para download no formato PDF e no formato de artigo, além de questões para revisão. Os assuntos estudados foram divididos em 6 arcos:\nArco I: Postura Profissional - Breve história da profissão e a evolução dela no Brasil; Características técnicas e comportamentais desejados para o profissional da área; A importância do trabalho em equipe; Diferença entre chefe e líder; Ética profissional.\nEsse primeiro arco é introdutório, com o objetivo de apresentar ao aluno os conceitos mais fundamentais para quem irá atuar. A importância desse arco se dá pela necessidade de ter uma boa postura no trabalho, ainda mais quando se almeja um reconhecimento.\n\n\nArco II: Início do Expediente - Conceito de Pessoa Física e de Pessoa Jurídica; Documentação da Pessoa Física (Certidão de Nascimento, CPF, Carteira de identidade; CTPS e outros); Documentação da Pessoa Jurídica (contrato social, CNPJ, Inscrição Estadual e Alvará); Serviços de cartórios (tabelionatos e registros civis).\nO segundo arco mira na importância do profissional da área em saber identificar e buscar os dados nos documentos das pessoas físicas e jurídicas quando da necessidade de preenchimento de cadastros e formulários.\n\n\nArco III: Organização - Programa de Qualidade 5 S's; Trabalho com agendas; Gerenciamento de tarefas; Reuniões (pauta de reunião e organização de reuniões); Noções de arquivamento.\nSabemos que organização é uma característica necessária do profissional e o terceiro arco trabalha nesse ponto, apresentando uma poderosa ferramenta que ajuda nesse quesito. Gerenciar o seu tempo e as suas tarefas é fundamental para um profissional que trabalha praticamente de forma \"autônoma\", mas com supervisão. Aquele que tem domínio sobre os seus compromissos é respeitado por seus pares!\n\n\nArco IV: Correspondência Empresarial - Processo de comunicação; Comunicação empresarial; Correspondência e envelopamento; E-mail; Elaboração de documentos diversos (ata, atestado, declaração, procuração, circular, memorando, carta comercial, ofício, requerimento, abaixo assinado, nota promissória e recibo).\nA necessidade da comunicação é de conhecimento de todos, então trabalhar esse ponto não é só importante como também crucial na vida de qualquer organização. Neste arco iremos ver dicas para montar um simples e-mail até documentos mais tradicionais, como a ata e a carta comercial.\n\n\nArco V: Atendimento - Importância do atendimento; Tipos de clientes; Atendimento ao telefone; Tabela de horários para ligações; Ligações telefônicas (local, DDD e DDI); Dicas para atendimento via chat.\nO atendimento faz parte de nossas relações sociais, pois se não estamos atendente um cliente externo, estamos atendendo um colega de trabalho ou até mesmo amigos, familiares e colegas de escola. Esse arco tem o objetivo de auxiliar nesse ponto!\n\n\nArco VI: Conhecimentos Básicos Bancários - Tipos de contas bancárias (conta corrente e conta poupança); Noções de aplicações em CDB e Tesouro Direto; Cartões de débito e de crédito; Transferências de valores (DOC, TED e PIX); Preenchimento de cheques; Formas de emissão de cheques; Impacto da inflação no dia-a-dia; Dólar; Financiamentos e empréstimos bancários.\nÉ comum os auxiliares administrativos desempenhares serviços bancários, como pagamento de contas. No entanto, por mais que tais serviços estejam presentes em nossa vida, é fundamental conhecer melhor para que possamos escolher qual destes [serviços] melhor nos atende.\n\n\nOs recursos do curso\nPara auxiliar nos estudos, eu elaborei um material de leitura complementar no formato PDF, que chamo de Roteiro de Estudo, sob medida para cada aula. A leitura desse material irá reforçar tudo o que é explicado em vídeo e, por este motivo, é um poderoso material de suporte na aprendizagem! Os slides que são utilizados em aula também ficam disponíveis para o seu acesso e estão no formato PDF! Assim, é muito material que vai te ajudar nos seus estudos! Utilize-os!\nAo final de cada arco eu preparei uns questionários - todos com gabaritos disponíveis para consulta ao final do curso - para que tu possas revisar os conteúdos, melhorando o aprendizado desses assuntos tão importantes para o ambiente administrativo.\nTambém há testes com questões de múltiplas escolhas ao final de cada unidade, chamadas de ATOL (Atividades on-line)! Elas são teóricas, desafiadoras e várias delas tentam simular situações do cotidiano do trabalho.\n\n\nPara quem é esse curso?\nSe você está saindo do Ensino Médio ou está buscando informações importantes para o seu primeiro emprego, esse curso é ideal para ti! Está em busca de uma mudança na carreira? Sinta-se convidado a estudar comigo! Ah, tu já trabalhas nessa área? Não tem problema, pois aqui será um ambiente para reforçar os seus conhecimentos e (por que não?) agregar mais informações!\n\n\nPuxem a cadeira, um café e um material de anotação: é hora de conhecer um pouco sobre o trabalho na área administrativa!\nBons estudos!",
