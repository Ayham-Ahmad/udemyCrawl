      "description": "Before I became involved in the world of cryptocurrency, I had my own mortgage brokerage where I helped individuals secure mortgages and loans. This experience has given me a solid understanding of our financial markets. Since 2009, I have been actively involved in the cryptocurrency industry and have witnessed significant transformations in the market throughout the years.\nFrom the early stages of initial coin offerings (ICO) to the current surge in security token offerings (STO), the crypto market has experienced remarkable growth. My journey with cryptocurrency began long before Bitcoin attracted any significant attention. In fact, it was essentially considered worthless at that time and its usage was vastly different from what it is today. Besides managing successful car and baby gear rental businesses in my personal life, I find great enjoyment in engaging in crypto trading and investment during my evenings.\nOver the years, I have gained valuable insights into identifying successful projects. Trust me when I say that finding a promising project is now more challenging than ever. In addition, I also operate my own Crypto Academy, where I privately teach individuals how to earn passive income through cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, I run a real estate firm that focuses on guiding and educating investors about the opportunities presented by real estate tokenization.",

Apart from that real estate, commodities, etc add hundreds of trillion dollars in market value.\n\n\nWhy am I saying all this?\n\n\nA new wave of growth for the web3 industry is likely to come by bringing traditional securities and assets on blockchain networks. How? With Tokenization.\n\n\nNot only traditional securities, but Tokenization also has the potential to unlock illiquid assets such as trade receivables, freight invoices and make them tradable like never before.\n\n\nWhile tokenization presents this huge opportunity, learning about tokenization can be challenging as it encompasses various disciplines apart from blockchain technology. This course is trying to fill the gap. This course not only covers the fundamentals of tokenization but also the capital market concepts and blockchain-related concepts to help you understand tokenization effectively.\n\n\nThis course also covers a comparison between issuance of Security Token Offerings i.e. STOs with IPOs and ICOs.

      "description": "Cryptocurrency has become a buzzword in recent years, and it has gained popularity in the financial market. Investors worldwide are looking for ways to profit from this growing market, and one of the most effective ways is through compounding. Compounding crypto is a simple yet effective method of investing in cryptocurrency that has been proven to yield significant returns over time. In this Udemy course, we will explore compounding crypto in detail and learn how to make the most of this investment strategy.\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we will introduce the concept of compounding crypto and explain why it is an effective investment strategy. We will also provide an overview of the course and the topics that will be covered.\nWhat is compounding crypto?\nCompounding crypto is a long-term investment strategy that involves reinvesting profits into the same asset to increase returns over time. It is similar to compound interest in traditional finance, where the interest earned on an investment is reinvested to generate more interest. In the case of cryptocurrency, the profits generated from an investment are reinvested into the same cryptocurrency, which increases the overall value of the investment over time.\nWhy is compounding crypto an effective investment strategy?\nCompounding crypto is an effective investment strategy for several reasons. Firstly, it allows investors to take advantage of the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate rapidly, and compounding allows investors to capitalize on these fluctuations by buying and selling at the right time. Secondly, compounding crypto allows investors to benefit from the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency has shown steady growth over the past few years, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. Finally, compounding crypto is a low-risk investment strategy as it involves investing in a single asset, which reduces the risk of losing money in multiple investments.\nCourse Overview\nIn this course, we will explore the concept of compounding crypto in detail. We will cover the following topics:\nIntroduction to Compounding Crypto\nUnderstanding Cryptocurrency Markets\nChoosing the Right Cryptocurrency for Compounding\nInvesting in Cryptocurrency Exchanges\nSetting Up a Compounding Strategy\nManaging Your Crypto Portfolio\nAnalyzing Your Crypto Investments\nMaximizing Your Returns\nUnderstanding Cryptocurrency Markets\nIn this section, we will delve into the cryptocurrency market and explain the factors that affect its volatility. We will also discuss how to read cryptocurrency charts and identify trends.\nUnderstanding Cryptocurrency Markets\nCryptocurrency markets are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by a single entity. Instead, they are influenced by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, news events, and overall market sentiment. Understanding these factors is crucial to making informed investment decisions.\nReading Cryptocurrency Charts\nCryptocurrency charts provide a visual representation of the price movements of a particular cryptocurrency. They show how the price of a cryptocurrency has changed over time and can be used to identify trends. In this section, we will discuss how to read cryptocurrency charts and identify trends that can be used to make profitable investment decisions.\nChoosing the Right Cryptocurrency for Compounding\nChoosing the right cryptocurrency for compounding is essential to the success of this investment strategy. In this section, we will explore the factors to consider when selecting a cryptocurrency to invest in.\nFactors to Consider When Choosing a Cryptocurrency\nWhen choosing a cryptocurrency for compounding, there are several factors to consider. These include the overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency, its liquidity, its historical performance, and the technology behind it. In this section, we will discuss each of these factors in detail and explain how to use them to make informed investment decisions",

But to the NFT community, NFTs are a natural evolution of the art and collectibles market.\nIn this class, we will explore NFTs as an investment vehicle. We will address what they are, how to buy them, and look at how they walk the border between art and absurdity, as they fall into the realm of novel modern investment options that have skyrocketed in popularity, attracting proponents and detractors alike. We also look at various different types of NFTs, some that have made high profits, some that have not, and we address how the average person can begin selling their own NFTs.\nThroughout the course, we delve into the era of blockchain memes, virtual property, and collectible cats that represent a fork in the road of society, all in the hopes that you better understand these fascinating investment options. What does the future hold for NFTs? Will they become priceless or worthless? And what exactly does \"Non Fungible Token\" even mean.

      "description": "Learn how to reduce your risk in trading on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchain networks by using Flash Loans via the Flash Swaps functions on the Uniswap and PancakeSwap Smart Contracts. In this course, we will cover all aspects of being able to borrow capital via the mechanism of a Flash Loan - which can only be done on the blockchain. Nothing like this exists outside of the blockchain. With this mechanism, if as long as the amount is paid back within the same transaction, you keep your arbitrage gains. If not, it's as though the transaction never happened and you're only left covering the gas fees.\n\n\nWe go deep into how to program and deploy a smart contract, but even more importantly, how to read, write and interact with Smart Contracts on the blockchain with Ethers JS. Hardhat is also used extensively for testing and deploying our own Smart Contracts too.\n\n\nIf you love Python, we have you covered too. There is a whole module just on how to interact with Smart Contracts where Shaun trades live to show the theory working in practice too.\n\n\nIf you have been trying to figure out Flash Loans or Flash Swaps and just can't find the code, or simply need help understanding it, then this is the course for you. We will go through each line of code and explain what it does. In this course you learn the principles, so that you can apply these in your own way to your own strategy.\n\n\nNow if you are a complete beginner to programming, this is probably not the course for you. That said, we do have a crash course on Solidity and in the Appendix - Python and Javascript too.\n\n\nFor traders looking to improve their programming skills, you will likely love this. For programmers looking to learn some trading techniques, you will love this.\n\n\nSee you in class!",

We will respond to your questions and feedback. We appreciate you and hope you enjoy the course and prosper.\nBefore you start, a closing thought and example of our approach:\nIn 2012, Bitcoin was growing from an obscure experiment into a legitimate digital asset. Bitcoin's first halving this year reinforced Bitcoin’s scarcity and government attention signaled that Bitcoin was here to stay.\nIf you had skipped your annual indulgence—whether it was a Super Bowl ticket (average cost $4,000, about $11/day for a year), a luxury vacation, or another splurge—and instead invested that amount into Bitcoin each year since 2012, your investment would be worth $30,161,220.26 today!\nBitcoin halving is when the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half roughly every four years. This reduces the supply of new BTC, making it scarcer over time, like digital gold. Fewer new Bitcoins = higher potential value\nToday’s volatility is tomorrow’s opportunity. Are you ready to achieve your dreams? Welcome aboard, let's go!\n\n\n* This course will include new AI-powered role plays, part of an upcoming Udemy feature scheduled to launch around May 27. Udemy controls the official release timing.

      "description": "Nowadays, you have probably heard the terms Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, crypto wallet, etc. in your day-to-day life. People usually treat it as an investment opportunity. But apart from that, the technology behind bitcoin, which is blockchain, is really amazing.\nBlockchain is a new concept that works on the idea of decentralization. There is no centralized authority present in the blockchain. In traditional concepts, there is one centralized authority present which tracks all the activity of the user. But in blockchain, there is none. So, there is no fear of compromising all user's data when the central authority gets open.\nBlockchain was initially intended to use in the field of money transactions but now, different fields are also trying to include it in their domain because of its security.\nWith the help of blockchain, it is almost impossible to cheat or hack the system. In this course, you will get to know the concepts behind blockchain technology, its importance, its key components, its data structure, and the key elements of blocks. In the last section, of course, we will create one very simple Django-based blockchain project which will perform simple tasks like; mining block, checking chain validity, and getting the entire chain.\nGood luck and see you in the course...",

They are like a guy selling an investment course and then leaving you high and dry with no support and incompetent employees.\nA tour guide actually goes with you and is with you every step of the way. Not only showing you the best places to go, where to save money, but also where not to go.\nMy name is Eric Carnes and I am qualified to be a tour guide in this particular field that I am about to reveal to you; you see I have been trading financial instruments for 4 years (and manage a family fund).

Perhaps, it has become inevitable.\nThere seems to infinite use cases which will revolve around this technology.\nAshok\n\n\nThanks Eric for this very enlightening course. I have a much better understanding of bitcoin technologies now.\nCourse is more of bitcoins with some basic background. I recommend this to anybody who is interested to get awareness of bitcoins, how it works & how we can get engaged in that (if we choose to).\nA little more deep dive on other real life applications of blockchain technology & how it is making impact (Walmart story etc...) - would be very helpful.\nCharles\n\n\nHey Eric , I really liked the course, the way it progresses, precise bullet points to cover limitations etc. good accent to get along. As of now, I have just gone through the videos but I will explore more using your reference links. Thanks for that.\nI think that you do it but still sharing just in case- for future, I think you should keep adding videos/examples/case-studies/pdfs once a topic pops-up in the market or you feel that students should be aware of or updated with.\nSandra",

      "description": "Are you looking for an easier way to trade Bitcoin? Algorithmic trading is possible now for cryptocurrency trading, and in this course, you will learn how to trade with a Bitcoin trading Robot.\nWith every positive trade, you will add $200 to your account, and the negative trades will be closed without losses with the help of the mathematical formula that you will learn.\nIn this course, Petko teaches his semi-automated system with Bitcoin trading Robot. He will provide you with a Robot(Expert Advisor), and he will show you how to use it to open trades automatically using 2 of the most popular indicators.\nThe system follows the trend, which makes it more reliable. The beauty of the strategy is that you do not need to stay in front of the screen. The Expert Advisor will do the analysis and execute the trades for you. All you need to do is to combine it with the Never Losing Formula.\nPetko Aleksandrov - Head Mentor in EA Forex Academy,  will provide you with the cryptocurrency Never losing formula that he uses successfully with the Bitcoin trading Robot. This formula can be modified for any cryptocurrency trading asset, but it works brilliantly with the Bitcoin trading robot.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this Bitcoin trading robot course?\nhow to apply the Never Losing Formula to avoid losses in the trading account\nwhat is the Bitcoin trading robot, and how do we use it\nidentify the trend with Bitcoin, and trade with the major direction\nhow to place the Bitcoin trading robot over the chart and all the indicators from it\nwhat are the RVI, Stochastic Oscillator, and Envelopes indicators\nexecute the trades with the Bitcoin trading robot\ncombine the opened trade with the Never Losing Formula\ntrade in both directions and have maximum profit\nThe course is supported by many live examples, which will make the system very clear to you, and you will be able to apply it by yourself.\n\n\nThe idea in the Course?\nRegardless you are a beginner or advanced trader, or you do not have any trading experience, you are just curious about the Bitcoin that everybody is talking about. Mr. Aleksandrov will go through each step and show you all you need to know in detail to trade cryptocurrencies, especially with the Bitcoin trading robot, without losses.\nThe Mentor will share a fantastic formula that he calls the \"Never losing formula,\" which you can use to handle losing trades in your cryptocurrency trading in such a way that you will always end up on profit or worst case scenario on 0.\n\"The Huge investors are selling out the Bitcoin to buy it at a lower price, which is very normal,\" says Mr. Aleksandrov in the course.\nThat is why a Robot is needed to catch these moves, and the Never Losing Formula is required to protect our capital.\nPetko shares that the profitable traders are not the ones with the most knowledge, but the ones that are not greedy and have no fear of trade. That's why in this course, you will see his Bitcoin trading Robot system for always having a $200 of Take Profit on each trade, which is just enough according to him.\nYou will learn how to optimize the Expert Advisor for your broker because all brokers provide different quotes of price, which forms different Historical data. In the course, Petko demonstrates the professional strategy software EA Studio (if you wish to use it, you may sign up and use a free trial period).\n\n\nWho is the Instructor?\nAfter University, Petko Aleksandrov graduates from the London Academy for trading, where he starts to develop his trading strategies with surprising profit from cryptocurrency trading. He was invited to stay in as a mentor and trader, but he decided to proceed on his own with the algorithmic trading because he already knew that this was the future.\nHe created the Academy, where he teaches Bitcoin trading Robot algorithmic systems to avoid these two students' feelings. He also has Semi-Automated systems and Manual courses where he depends on mathematically proved formulas and reliable statistics and research.\nIn this Bitcoin trading robot course, he will show you the Meta Trader platform, where you will need to place the trading robot. It is the only trusted platform for algorithmic trading.  More, this is a FREE platform for trading.\nAs with all his other courses, you will receive full support personally from Petko.\nThe Bitcoin trading robot course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked.\nThe best thing - you receive lifetime access to this course, which means that all improvements of the Bitcoin trading robot system from Petko you will have at the moment!\nEnroll now and become a better trader!\n\n\nDon't just take my word for it. See what my past student had to say about the Bitcoin trading robot course:\nIvaylo Belev -> Magnificent!! I gained extremely valuable knowledge from this course, and I can't wait to put it into practice!\nAllan Philip -> Great lessons, everything I need to be a better trader and understand the formula for calculating how to not loss whether the market moves up or down. I finally found a method that explains very simply how to calculate what had been a mystery to me.\nRaymond Oh -> Mr. Petko Aleksandrov is a genius! The NLF is simply a MASTERPIECE! I think it could even be the holy grail I have been looking for! I have been a daytrader and an investor in the markets for stocks, ETF’s, forex, futures, and options over 15 years but have yet to achieve consistency with most of my prior experiences. This NLF will change that. I can see it now and I am so excited. I want to point out a few things to a newbie looking to learn about trading or a seasoned trader looking to improve his P&L, but is not sure which course to choose from the vast offerings of Udemy. Base on the lectures of this course and combining a few observations with what I have learned about trading, investing, and other education services for investing in my past, I can give the following compliments to Petko. 1) There’s a saying in the investment education industry: those who trade (successfully) don’t teach, and those who teach don’t trade. This assertion absolutely does not apply to Petko, because in my opinion, he is a top trader and an excellent educator at the same time. His lectures are well planned, well narrated, and easy to follow. And did I mention the NLF is a Masterpiece! 2) There’s also another saying in the trading community: keep your losses small and your winnings will take care of themselves. Well, if you have been struggling to achieve this level of trading success, you are looking at a set of instructions given in this course that could turn that struggle around right here, and right now. As I moved along the course and watched Petko executes his trades using the NLF method, I could visualize my trading success or the lack of it being about to change for the better, and much better. So, thank you, Petko. You have already changed my life. Now I just need to roll up my sleeves and trade with your instructions - like a robot. Lastly, 3) Petko is a generous man for offering his NLF formula to the public with such a reasonable and affordable price. In addition, he gives away the EA without hiding the source code. The source code will prove to be valuable to his students who are experienced with programming. Again, thank you Petko, for your great work and an awesome trading course!\n\nAlejandro Scian - Great course. I had the chance to test it and checked that the formula works. Also de EA Robot works perfectly, up to this moment.\nChristopher Avenant - I was afraid to start because I knew nothing about trading. Petko has a very calm and logical approach and his teaching style really helped me to overcome my fears. The course is all you need, no-frills, and no fuzz. Fact: no course in the world can change anything for you unless you apply what you've learned.",

As the continuing banking crisis, trade wars and political divide seek to crush modern life, a grass-roots system of trade is beginning to bloom....crypto currency.\n\nThis new form of digital currency was born out of the 2008 financial crisis, where banks abused, defrauded and printed their way out of the mess they created. Leaving us to foot the bill. Crypto currency was designed to prevent those behaviors by limiting the supply of currency, thus increasing it's value with the demand for its use.\n\nIn the decade since its creation, Wall St. and the banking system has laughed, scolded and even tried to scare people who've lost faith in their rigged game, that cryptos are a \"scam\".\nToday, they're singing a different tune.\nWorld central banks, world governments and Fortune 500 companies are diving in to cryptos head-first.\nThrough both utility (such as cross border payments) and a store of value to replace gold.\nCompanies like AT&T, Facebook, Square, Twitter, Starbucks and over 250 other Wall Street firms are meeting the crypto space.\nThey now see the writing on the wall. If they want to survive a collapsing dollar, something else needs to take it's place that is both secure and easily transferred to create profit. Gold and Silver bars no longer fit the bill.\nLearn how you can become one of the elite wealthy while the wealth transfer is happening, not after it's already taken place.",

While the impact of the first kind of failure remains limited to the platform builders and their backers - the failure of the second kind may erase millions or billions of investor funds, can begin ripple effects resulting in the failure of other platforms, and draw unwanted regulatory attention.\n\n\nAs of mid of August 2022, the asset under management for DAO treasuries is more than 10 billion dollars. If we put that into perspective, the AUM for DAO treasuries was just 380 million in early 2021. Managing DAO treasuries is becoming more and more crucial due to the growing volume of treasuries and the systemic risk failure of treasuries pose.\n\n\nTreasury management is not new - traditional organizations need to allocate considerable resources and time to manage the cash reserves but treasury management is web3 introduces various new challenges and needs much more deliberation. Also, the decentralized nature of decision-making adds to the challenges.\n\n\nThis course looks into how can we go about treasury management for web3 by borrowing well-proven tools used in traditional organizations and what kind of adjustment we may need to use these tools for web3 platforms.\n\n\nNow, this course will introduce you to various tools and concepts but this is not a standard operating procedure. Treasury management is a complex subject and this discipline for the web3 ecosystem is still evolving. This course is designed to introduce you to the choices you have in treasury management for web3 platforms and how can you deliberate on the choices.\n\n\nWe will discuss the concepts and a broad overview of the tools. Please refer to the study materials for examples of the use of the tools.\nSo, let us get started",

This is a course on both the study, analysis, and design of token economies and the relevance of this new area given the current economic context.\nContent\nThe first section deals with tokenization, asking what exactly is a token and how do they work. We firstly lay down some of the basics of distributed ledger technology and triple entry accounting before going on to talk about the process of tokenization; the conversion of any asset into a digital token. Here we will look a the two primary categories of tokens, the utility token and security token and their workings.\nThe second section looks at decentralized organizations and the design of incentive structures. We look at how token networks can be used to remove the centralized management structure to organizations and work to better align the incentive structures of producers and end users. We touch upon game theory and talk about mechanism design; the design of incentive structures to align the interests of the individuals with the whole organization within user-generated networks.\nThe third section deals with the formation of large-scale blockchain networks that span across organizations and industries to create powerful new ecosystems. Our focus here is on blockchain as a new infrastructure for a global services economy, we talk about the workings of service networks and how they can be automated through smart contracts. Finally, in this section, we look at service-oriented architecture as an important design pattern to these emerging service networks.\nThe last section of the course is dedicated to the growth and development of token economies. Recently we have seen the rise of initial token offerings as a new model for bootstrapping these economies, we look at the dynamics of how token networks can fund their own development and then use prediction markets and advanced analytics to guide their future development.\nAudience\nThis course is not an introduction to blockchain, it only deals with what economics will look like once built on that technology, thus you will need to be familiar with the basics of blockchain as a technology before taking this course, if you are not already then we recommend taking our blockchain introductory course first, which provides an accessible and broad overview to the domain. Likewise, game theory is an important component of crypto economics which we will only have time to touch upon in this course, we recommend that you are either familiar with the basics of game theory or take our introduction to game theory course.",

      "description": "So you've heard about bitcoin? Ever wondered what's going on with the data in a transaction, or how bitcoin gets locked up and transferred from one holder to another? Are you a programmer, developer, or engineer? This course is for you! We'll get you programming your first bitcoin transactions in no time.\n\n\nThis course by Base58 instructor niftynei, will take you on a deep dive of the fields, bytes, and scripts that make up the bitcoin blockchain data. In an software engineer focused manner, we'll go over everything you need to know to build your own bitcoin transaction parser, write your very own custom bitcoin locking scripts, and adapt your transactions to the modern SegWit format. This class will get you started in bitcoin development. Go farther, faster with Base58!\n\n\nStep 1: Intro to bitcoin transactions\nWe'll start off learning about what a bitcoin transaction is. Specifically, what fields do they contain? We learn how to calculate a transaction id and what transaction fees are, and how are they calculated. Finally, we'll talk about coinbases and block rewards.\n\nTopics: transaction fields, endianness, transaction ids, fees + transaction weights, coinbases\n\nStep 2: Enter Script\nIn week two we start talking about Bitcoin's native \"programming language\": Script! We'll write our own script this week (and learn about hashes and preimages). Once we've written a script we'll try locking some bitcoins up to it, as well as unlocking them.\n\nTopics: Script, standard scripts, P2SH, opcodes\n\n\nStep 3: Transacting with SegWit\nNow that we've seen how transactions are constructed and built, we'll introduce the bitcoin omnibus update bill, the SegWit soft-fork. SegWit impacted the structure of a transaction and its fee calculations, so we'll dive into how these updates work and two of the 'new' SegWit script types: P2WSH and P2SH-P2WSH.\n\nTopics: SegWit!

Mastering Bitcoin & Blockchain Fundamentals demystifies the birth, evolution, and inner workings of Bitcoin and the decentralized technology powering it: blockchain.\nWe begin by unpacking the origin story of Bitcoin, born during the 2008 financial crisis as a peer-to-peer alternative to traditional money. You’ll understand how Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper laid the groundwork for a trustless, permissionless financial system—one that’s since outperformed all major asset classes.\nWe then dive into blockchain mechanics—what it is, how it works, and why it’s considered tamper-proof. You'll explore wallets, mining, nodes, consensus mechanisms, and the differences between Bitcoin and altcoins. Along the way, we spotlight real-world risks: volatility, regulatory uncertainty, hacks, and scams—giving you a practical view of the challenges every Bitcoin user must understand.\nBut this course goes further. We introduce you to on-chain analysis, a powerful method of tracking and interpreting blockchain data to anticipate investor behavior, market trends, and network health. Learn how to read wallet movements, whale activity, and long-term holder trends—tools used by serious analysts.\nWhether you’re just starting out or looking to sharpen your digital asset strategy, this course equips you with the insights and frameworks to think long-term and critically about the Bitcoin revolution.",

      "description": "Update November 2022: Professionally created captions were added.\n..................................................\nIn 2021 blockchain game activity grew by 2000%...yes 2000% and 52% of blockchain activity come from gaming dApps.\n\n\nNow, When it comes to mass adoption of crypto and web3, no other industry is likely to play a more important role than online gaming.\n\n\nSome web3 concepts such as virtual currency ownership, trading of virtual goods, user-generated content, and tokenization already existed in the online gaming world.\n\n\nAnother aspect is that the regulatory scrutiny that most applications areas of web3 are exposed to, is virtually non-existent in the case of gaming. So, gaming web3 platforms can scale fairly rapidly without the fear of regulatory interventions.\n\n\nUnlike most other web3 application areas, incumbents are themselves driving the growth of the sector. For example, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, one of the biggest California-based video gaming companies in a $68.7 billion dollar deal to build its own Metaverse. Major game publisher Ubisoft launched in-game NFTs.\n\n\nThe point is that like any other industry blockchain gaming has challenges but it is most likely the best-positioned sector for mass adoption of blockchain and web3.\n\n\nNow, this course is not about which game tokens to invest in, neither it is about game design or game building. This course is about the economics of blockchain games and more specifically play to earn games.\n\n\nBlockchain games especially play-to-earn game platforms are intricate economies that require special attention from the game builders.\n\n\nThis means designing the game economics should involve utmost care and this is what this course is about. Yes, we will discuss some projects in blockchain gaming and play-to-earn but the focus will be on economics.",

      "description": "PROJECT ANDROMEDA\nI have a postgraduate degree in investment banking, worked at a financial institution, took all the top courses in the field of professional trading, and traded every single type of financial security available on Wall Street. I trade 5 days a week, 90 minutes a day - making more money than some of the CEOs of the companies being traded. And I will teach you how to do exactly that in less than 4 hours.\nCryptocurrency is the newest addition to the arsenal of financial securities on Wall Street. Traders were quick to adapt to this newly explored area of finance and found out ways to capitalize on it. After all, one thing Bitcoin offers that every trader is always hungry about - volatility. In this course, I will teach you one method that you can use immediately and earn from the never-ending volatility of Bitcoin.\nOn the other hand, cryptocurrency mining is a thriving business. Knowledge of power. When a miner looks at a bitcoin mine, he sees efficiency, age of the miner, and the cost of electricity - while a novice only sees a spaghetti of cables. If you know how to mine, you can. If you don't know, you will always be in the dark. In this course, we will go deep. If you know how to change a bulb, you can mine bitcoin. I will teach you how.\nMintaka Technologies  is my way to give back. Udemy is a terrific place where serious people can come and get information that was only owned by a handful of people a while ago. I want to give them this information for cheap, but not for free. Cheap, so that everyone who wants to know, can know. But not for free so that nobody thinks of it as 'one of the free videos' - because it is not!\nI will keep my identity private for reasons as such - I am telling you some of the top secrets institutions play on the rest of the world. The model I am going to give you is a proprietary asset for many.\nWall Street is complex. Its complexity works as an entry barrier to this industry. Perhaps that's the reason why there is a word called 'wall' inherent with it.\nMy goal with this project is this - simplify professional trading. I also want to make sure that this project doesn't waste your time or mine. When I went through the process, it was quite frustrating to see how people waste so much time and energy to explain things that could have been explained in minutes. I bet you also have an experience like this.\nThis is a course that you will be able to finish in one day. On the other hand, you will not miss anything that you are required to know.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn -\n1. The Bitcoin Network\nYou will learn about the domain you will be working on. Its history, functionality, and value proposition to our lives.\n2. Altcoins\nYou will learn about other cryptocurrencies also known as altcoins. You will learn how to find them and understand their differences.\n3. Cryptocurrency Mining\nThis is an education that you won't find that easily. You will learn exactly what you need to mine at home and also how to build a commercial rig.\n4. Entry & Exits\nYou will learn where to enter and to exit on a trade by the value of a cent. You will never find a system that has this level of objectivity.\n5. Quality Assurance\nThe proprietary strategies are here to make you a professional trader while quality assurance is designed to make you a master in your game.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. No content of this channel should be taken as direct or indirect financial advice. The video is only my personal view on certain securities and is meant to be viewed as educational material.

They're running nodes. Quietly. Consistently. And they're getting rewarded like early VCs.\n\n\nThis course breaks it all down. No fluff. No crazy tech talk. Just real steps, real projects, and real rewards—even if you’re not a dev.\n\n\nWhy You Need This Course:\nRunning nodes is one of the most underrated ways to make money in crypto right now. Projects are literally paying testers—in tokens and airdrops—for helping them run their network.\nYou're not buying coins. You're earning them early, before the hype.\n\n\nYou don’t need a supercomputer. You don’t need to code. What you need is a VPS, this course, and a little consistency.\n\n\nInside the Course:\nSection 1: The Real Game Behind Node Running\nGet the insider knowledge. Understand why node runners are the new early investors. Learn what no one tells you about how these projects decide who gets rewarded.\nSection 2: Set Up Once, Reap for Months\nWe walk you through getting a VPS (cheap, simple), and setting it up right. One-time setup. Long-term reward potential.\nSection 3: Hands-On Node Setup for High-Potential Projects\nWe’re not teaching theory. We're running real nodes:\n\n\nDrosera Network – Early mover advantage\nInitivers – Mine $INI with low hardware, high upside\nBitz Network – Scalable and reward-rich\nHyperSpace – Unique airdrop dynamics\n\n\nAnd more…\n\n\nYou’ll get full step-by-step videos on each, plus how to install Chrome on Linux VPS so you can manage things easier—even if you're new.\n\n\nWho This Is For:\nAirdrop farmers ready to level up from basic social tasks\nWeb3 explorers tired of being late to the money\nNon-techies who want a clear, guided system to earn from nodes\nCrypto users who want consistent income, not just hope-and-pray meme coin pumps\n\n\nThis Isn’t Just a Course—It’s a Strategy\nYou're learning how to position yourself for future token drops, testnet payouts, and early access that others only wish they knew about.\n\n\nDon’t be the person asking “how’d they get that airdrop?” Be the one already running the node and getting paid.",

      "description": "Are you confused and don't know how to day trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\nAre you struggling to find a reliable way of trading cryptos?\nAre you feeling lost even after taking so many crypto courses on udemy?\nInformation overload?\n\n\n..if all the above are YES..then keep reading my friend I will solve all your problems...\n\n\nInformation overload is a big problem these days and many people don't know they are a victim of this dangerous mind problem.You might have gathered a lot of information in your mind about crypto trading and their few workable trading strategies as many online experts show you on youtube and some other social media websites. Trading cryptocurrencies is not hard if you know what you are doing and if you have a ready strategy to implement every day and churn out consistent profits.\nMany newbies have a million-dollar question in their mind, how to make money with bitcoin? Would you like to learn a unique crypto trading strategy from a guy that has started his journey from $200 and went up to $72,000 in just under 2 years?\nThen, you are in the right place...\nHello and welcome, I am your trader friend Faraaz, I have been trading cryptocurrencies for the last 3 years now, and in these 3 years what I have learned is.....\nYou need to have patience.\nYou need a well-planned strategy to survive in the crypto market.\nYou need to plan your entry and exit points to win trades on a regular basis.\nYou need to set your trading goals and achieve them.\nOk FARAAZ, How do I trade then? show me a way buddy...\nYes, sure that is why I have created this course, to show you guys a way to trade cryptos using a very simple and effective strategy, even a novice trader can use and generate profits from DAY 1.\nYes, you hear that correctly...from DAY 1 you will see results after using my unique strategy.\nSee how my students are doing it......\n===============================================\nThis is a very straightforward, short and simple course. Very easy to implement for beginners. I have been struggling for many months with crypto and many of you who read this probably won't believe me but I gained 7.5% on day 1 of using this strategy. I did not use a lot of money to trade this strategy yet because I was just testing the waters. But I did earn enough to cover this entire course in just one day.\nBut don't just read my review, try it out and take action yourself. 20 bucks is a very small price to pay to learn and upgrade yourself. Even if it doesn't work out, what will 20 bucks be to you? Don't waste it on other things and use it as an investment for yourself. In my case, I paid off the course in just one day so after this, what do I even have to lose?\nYour future is in your hands. If you are willing to learn and improve and you are looking for a way to make money, take this course. It is worth well more than the price Faraaz is selling it for. - Goh Xuan Kai\n===============================================\nI'm a novice. I took one other course on Udemy that shared techniques for confirming a chart reading, but it didn't share an actual method for making profitable trades. This course, on the other hand, shares the exact method for making profitable trades--and it really works! Today I made 6 trades, and profited on all of them ;-) The course is easy to follow, not too long or complicated, and Faraaz offers a telegram group where you can get extra help from him & fellow peers. I 100% recommend this course. You will not regret it! Thank you again Faraaz, you're an angel for so kindly sharing this info. - Marjorie\n===============================================\nThis is a hidden gem in Udemy's crypto training section. Faraaz explains his strategy very clearly, and I have made my first two trades using his strategy on Binance with success! (2.5% gain). I also lost one, but that was to be expected. Will set a better stop-loss order next time, which he talks about later in the course. Really good course, great instructor, and I will keep trying this strategy to improve my day trading skills. Well done!!! - Sophie Nadolny\n===============================================\nExcellent Course, Really the coolest way to earn money, I am paper trading since the last few days and the results are really awesome!! The strategy works really great, I am gonna start with real money soon!!! - Yogendra\n===============================================\nGreat course, I have to say I feel much more confident in my trading skills after taking this course. I enjoy applying the strategies, they've helped me get the trades I want ! - Tynia L Allen\n===============================================\nI am very impressed with the things I learned in this course. It's not too long, which is GOOD, and it's very practical knowledge. I liked it very much. I also joined their group and Faraaz is very interactive with his students, including me (a newbie in the group), so I am just very impressed overall. I am giving this 4 stars because I haven't tested the strategies YET myself, because I just finished the course a few minutes ago, but I think it will work.\nEdit: I came back to change this to 5 stars because I tested his strategy and it really works!! I don't have prior experience in trading, so this course REALLY taught me something great! - Ronald Cheung\n===============================================\nTaking this course was one of the best decisions I've made recently.\nThe strategy is simple and totally suitable for trading newbies. So there's no need to worry about inexperience.\nWhat I also liked is that the course was short and straight to the point. I didn't feel any second of my time wasted!\nAnd the teacher is super supportive and has time for you personally :) - Kaja Kaljurand\n===============================================\nThis course was great, exactly what I was looking for. Even though I've been in crypto since late 2017, I've mostly been a HODLer since charts were so confusing to understand. Since we've been in this long bear market since Feb. or March 2018, I realized the people making money were the traders. So I took a lot of time to choose Warrior Faraaz as my first course on Udemy. Wow, what an amazing teacher he is. The course is not too long, easy to understand and follow his set of rules. But more amazing is how when I joined the Telegram group, I got to know how truly caring he is, he helps everyone from the newbies to the experienced people. He is open to new ideas, suggestions and isn't rigid in his thinking at all. He even gives us free signals to follow, we can ask him anything and he'll respond almost instantly. In my opinion, you cannot go wrong taking this course if you are really serious about changing your life. - Bea Nguyen\n===============================================\nWhy I choose this course?\nFor me is it important to invest money in investments in addition to my daily job. Cryptocurrency is becoming more and more important these days. I expect that our “normal” money will change to cryptocurrency in the future. It is now the time to get in crypto because the prices of many altcoins are very low. In time, these will have more value. See the boost from the bitcoin, in January 2017 the exchange rate was $ 1000, and at the end of 2017 almost € 20,000. I believe that this will certainly happen more often with altcoins. And with a small investment of a few $ 100, is it possible to gradually build up more capital.\nWhat can I say about the teacher?\nFaraaz, who set up this course, is an experienced trader who understands his profession. He has been looking for a system that is easy to follow for everyone. The theory is therefore limited. This is also less relevant. I was looking for a simple system that is profitable. Faraaz has succeeded! He uses 3 strategies: the short, the medium and the long term strategy. He uses practical examples for each of the strategies.\nThe teacher's mission?\nFaraaz is amazing and is very involved. His mission is that his students will succeed and that they will earn profits and use them for their families. In addition to being able to ask questions in the learning environment, he has recently started a Telegram group so that you can ask questions and share experiences with fellow students. He also gives MID-term signals so that you can analyze these for yourself so that you ultimately learn to trade independently. He also provides information about Altcoins that will probably make a boost in the coming year.\nTotal assessment:\nA top course in the field of cryptocurrency. Very practical, simple and easy to use. Faraaz is a committed teacher who wants you to succeed. If you want to invest or maybe a new (part-time) job as a crypto trader, I would really recommend this course! - Marc\n===============================================\nThe best course.\nIt's hard to believe that I got those amazing skills and techniques for just $15.

      "description": "\"Blockchain is the NEXT Internet. Block Chain will revolutionize Business, Healthcare, Finance, Banking, Development\"\n- BBC News\n*******************************************Please Note********* *****************************\nWe are not going to show you how to write code. But we are going to explain everything else, which is relevant and important to know about blockchain.\n*******************************************************************************************\n\n\nBlockchain offers the storage of records of transaction data through distributed networks. It retains the full history of transactions, which makes them verifiable and independently auditable. It also enables peer-to-peer transfer of value, potentially eliminating the need for intermediaries. In addition, event triggered programmable contracts, also known as smart contracts, can be stored and executed on Blockchain.\n\n\nWhat this Blockchain technology is so powerful ?\nBlockchain has several intrinsic features which  allows it to record and transfer value over the internet in a peer-to-peer manner:\nIrreversibility: This technology prevents double spending, fraud, abuse, and manipulation of transactions because it contains certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made that cannot be altered without altering the entire chain.\nNo intermediary: It allows any two parties to transact directly with each other, without any trusted third party.\nNear real time: It enables near real time settlement of recorded transactions, removing friction, and reducing risk.\nCensorship resistant: Crypto economics ensures that Blockchain continues pumping out new blocks and that blocks are not being reverted or altered.\nDistributed ledger: The peer-to-peer distributed network records a public history of transactions, making Blockchain distributed and highly available.\n\n\nThere are several specific use cases where the Blockchain technology can prove to be useful for the Finance Function. Some of these are listed below:\nBudgeting and Forecasting\nIntercompany reconciliations\nFinancial Audit\nVendor Management\nShareholder Voting\nWho can take this course?\nAny person with interest in Finance and emerging technologies\nAny individual from Software Development\nAny Student from College with any degree background\nAny individual who is working on Blockchain\nAny working professional interested in Blockchain to upgrade their skills and knowledge\nNon-IT finance professionals\nCFOs\nControllers\nManagement accountants\nPublic accountants\nPartners\nStaff\nManagers\nInternal auditors\nWhat should students must know before taking the course?\nBasic terms of Technology\nBasic terms of Finance\nBusiness Workflows\nWhat will students gain after completing the course?\nAdvanced Concepts in Blockchain\nImplementation of Blockchain\nCryptocurrencies - How, What and When\nNext Generation Blockchain Technologies\nFinancial Use Cases in Blockchain - Deep Dive\nBlockchain Frameworks\nHow to transform to a blockchain Startup - Success Stories of implementation\n\n\nIn fact, in 2018 global blockchain survey, 84% of organizations reported that they were working with blockchain. When combined with AI, the internet of things (IoT), and intelligent automation, blockchain can play a central role in moving finance organizations toward the future they envision—one in which routine tasks are completed without a second thought, giving finance professionals time to focus on strategy and operations.\nToday, most finance organizations are held back by inefficiencies. They spend inordinate amounts of time sifting through and manipulating data that is often either inconsistent or located in several disconnected systems—just to retrieve answers to basic questions.\nLegacy systems can be far more powerful when combined with blockchain, which can bring business users closer to a single, trusted source of truth.\nBlockchain can pave the way for this future. The technology promises other benefits, as well: Internet-connected devices seamlessly uploading data, and artificial intelligence (AI) systems tapping into historical records and proactively suggesting actions that finance professionals can use to bring their company to the next level in their digital transformation.",

      "description": "We currently live in an era of economic paradoxes that have left an indelible impact on our daily lives.\nInterest rates have soared more than tenfold within 18 months, yet the stock market continues its relentless ascent, while inflation refuses to abate. The younger generations find themselves in a particularly precarious situation today. Despite both adults in a home often holding highly qualified jobs, the dream of a comfortable life with a house and children seems increasingly elusive to an ever larger number. This reveals a widening wealth gap in today’s economy despite the advent of technology that has exponentially increased productivity.\n\n\nBehind these contradictory observations lies a new monetary context. Between 2021 and 2024, the US deficit ballooned from $27 trillion to $34.4 trillion, marking an almost 25% increase in less than four years. This unprecedented surge in the deficit clearly reveals an acceleration of a tendency that had slowly started in the seventies and that has significantly accelerated after 2009.\n\n\nAt the heart of all of this lies a fundamental tool and technology we all use and interact with every day: money. Our money, the currency we use every day, was also transformed in 1971, a date that marks the beginning of an increasing deficit trend. Interestingly, amidst the turmoil of the 2008 financial crisis, which was the largest of its kind, a mysterious and anonymous individual introduced a new type of money to the world, Bitcoin. A money that was designed and introduced as a way to address the weaknesses and limitations of the new type of money we started using in 1971, FIAT, and the unusual economic paradigm we find ourselves in today. As we navigate these uncertain times, it will be fascinating to see the role Bitcoin, the original and dominant cryptocurrency, will play in shaping our economic future, but in order to understand our current economic context, it is necessary to understand the relationship between money, inflation, the deficit, and Bitcoin.\n\n\nThis course is divided into two parts, examining the history and evolution of money from ancient times to the modern day. The first part will delve into what constitutes money, its failures throughout history, sound principles for a stable currency system, and how paper-based fiat currencies emerged as a replacement for gold-backed standards.\nIn the second half, we'll turn our attention to exploring a solution, Bitcoin, to the current problems plaguing fiat systems, including inflation, debt, housing bubbles, stock market volatility, and more. This is the First Cryptocurrency, and that relied on - among other technologies - blockchain that was created and is also the largest Crypto by Market Cap. We will explore Bitcoin's design principles, governance model in its decentralized network, and how it can function as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. Additionally, we'll examine the unique relationship between Bitcoin and energy grids, assess its potential as an investment opportunity, discuss security concerns related to hacking and regulation, and address common criticisms (FUD) surrounding Bitcoin's adoption.",

Then we will look at the history of DeFi and get an overview of all the different DeFi categories we see out there. Plus, we will put an emphasis on the key differences between DeFi and TradFi (Traditional Finance) and get a deep understanding of the opportunities and risks inherent in Decentralized Finance.\nThen, we will move on to the core of the course: We will look in detail at the key mechanics and fundamental principles underpinning all DeFi protocols. For example, we will examine the different building blocks of DeFi applications and look at how they play together to create completely new financial services. Or we will look in detail at different incentive structures which are common to the most successfull DeFi protocols.\nOnce we have gained this fundamental understanding, we will switch to the praxis-oriented part of the course where we will deep dive into three concrete DeFi protocols; namely Uniswap (a decentralized exchange), Aave (a decentralized lending and borrowing solution), and Unslashed Finance (a decentralized insurance protocol). During all three deep dives we will not only examine in detail how the different protocols work but I will demonstrate to you as well on chain how to best use these applications in practice. Of couse, you will learn lots of practical tips and tricks along the way and you are invited to directly try out the protocols yourself. And don't worry in case you don't have a DeFi wallet yet: I will show you step-by-step how to set up your own DeFi wallet in a secure way to kick-start your DeFi journey.",

      "description": "What moves cryptocurrency markets?\nCryptocurrency markets move according to supply and demand. However, as they are decentralized, they tend to remain free from many of the economic and political concerns that affect traditional currencies. While there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, the following factors can have a significant impact on their prices:\nSupply: the total number of coins and the rate at which they are released, destroyed or lost\nMarket capitalization: the value of all the coins in existence and how users perceive this to be developing\nPress: the way the cryptocurrency is portrayed in the media and how much coverage it is getting\nIntegration: the extent to which the cryptocurrency easily integrates into existing infrastructure such as e-commerce payment systems\nKey events: major events such as regulatory updates, security breaches and economic setbacks\nWhat is cryptocurrency trading?\nCryptocurrency trading is the act of speculating on cryptocurrency price movements via a CFD trading account, or buying and selling the underlying coins via an exchange.\nCFD trading on cryptocurrencies\nCFDs trading are derivatives, which enable you to speculate on cryptocurrency price movements without taking ownership of the underlying coins. You can go long (‘buy’) if you think a cryptocurrency will rise in value, or short (‘sell’) if you think it will fall.\nBoth are leveraged products, meaning you only need to put up a small deposit – known as margin – to gain full exposure to the underlying market. Your profit or loss are still calculated according to the full size of your position, so leverage will magnify both profits and losses.\nBuying and selling cryptocurrencies via an exchange\nWhen you buy cryptocurrencies via an exchange, you purchase the coins themselves. You’ll need to create an exchange account, put up the full value of the asset to open a position, and store the cryptocurrency tokens in your own wallet until you’re ready to sell.\nExchanges bring their own steep learning curve as you’ll need to get to grips with the technology involved and learn how to make sense of the data. Many exchanges also have limits on how much you can deposit, while accounts can be very expensive to maintain.\nHow do cryptocurrency markets work?\nCryptocurrency markets are decentralized, which means they are not issued or backed by a central authority such as a government. Instead, they run across a network of computers. However, cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold via exchanges and stored in ‘wallets’ .\nUnlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies exist only as a shared digital record of ownership, stored on a blockchain. When a user wants to send cryptocurrency units to another user, they send it to that user’s digital wallet. The transaction isn’t considered final until it has been verified and added to the blockchain through a process called mining. This is also how new cryptocurrency tokens are usually created.\nWhat is blockchain?\nA blockchain is a shared digital register of recorded data. For cryptocurrencies, this is the transaction history for every unit of the cryptocurrency, which shows how ownership has changed over time. Blockchain works by recording transactions in ‘blocks’, with new blocks added at the front of the chain.",

Those who flip a coin may do well in some cases, but they take a huge risk, which is a mistake in terms of risk management. The process of getting rich is a long process, with a lot of patience and sacrifice, but believe me, it’s worth it. Look at the really rich people in the world… Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Robert Kiyosaki, Elon Musk… Did they get rich quick? The answer is no, what really brought them success is long persistent work and patience.\nWhy did I create this course?\nThe internet is full of fake gurus smiling in a Lamborghini to tempt you to buy their book or course. They promise you can get rich quick. Well in my opinion, with methods like those, there is at least as much chance of you getting impoverished just as quickly. Investments should always be viewed in a risk / reward ratio. This course was created to show in my opinion the best risk / reward ratio investment, the trading bots. These bots, like a professional broker, constantly monitor the market and take buy and sell orders on stock and crypto markets based on pre-defined inputs. I show a solution that allows you to provide these inputs based on your own risk tolerance. I will show you step by step how the bots work and how to set them up. I will show you how to make your passive income on a daily basis easily and securely. Don’t waste your time, start earning money today!",

      "description": "Welcome to Hidden Passive Income: Staking Cryptocurrency course. Here, in this course you will learn and explore unknown secret of generating sustainable passive income from cryptocurrency by staking your asset for certain period of time which normally ranging from months to a year and as a reward for staking your asset which contribute to stability of the blockchain network, you will get APY (Annual Percentage Yield) ranging between 5% to 20% depending on crypto that you stake and platform which is being used to stake. In addition to APY, you can also potentially get another benefit from capital gain where the amount of cryptocurrency asset that you hold increases by value within your staking period. This particular method suits the most if you are currently looking for long term investment with low to medium risk. It would be obvious to claim that the risks associated with cryptocurrency staking are definitely lower compared to cryptocurrency trading. Therefore, this course will prepare you to understand all things that you need to know about cryptocurrency staking, you will learn detailed analysis on risks associated with staking, what are some best platforms to stake your cryptocurrency asset, extensive training on how to conduct technical and fundamental analysis to evaluate a future prospect of crypto before making decision to do staking, small market cap vs big market cap comparison, full step by step tutorial on how to set up digital wallet and stake your crypto asset on several different platforms. At the end of the course, we will also learn about APY and APR calculation to estimate the predicted amount of profit you can generate after staking your cryptocurrency asset for a certain period of time.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question: why should I take cryptocurrency? And what’s the difference between staking and holding a cryptocurrency asset for the long term investment? Well, if we are talking about holding crypto asset for long term, the only possible way to make profit is through capital gain where you hope the value will increase over time by and that’s obviously not guaranteed since there is also potential for the value to decrease, however, when it comes to staking cryptocurrency, there are two possible ways to make profit, the first one is guaranteed and the other is not guaranteed. The one that is guaranteed is through fixed APY where you will be rewarded with a certain percentage of your initial investment and meanwhile the other one that is not guaranteed is through capital gain since the price fluctuates, it can increase but it can also decrease. Hence, by doing so, you are maximising your income from the investment you made. Lastly, for people who are new to cryptocurrency with limited knowledge about this field, there is nothing you should worry about since this course will teach you from the perspective of beginners.\nBelow are things which you will learn in this course:\nHow staking cryptocurrency works\nRisks associated with staking\nTechnical analysis for staking\nFundamental analysis for staking\nSmall vs big market cap comparison\nAPY & APR calculation\nStep by step tutorial on how to set up digital wallet (Trust Wallet, Metamask Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet)\nStep by step tutorial on how to stake cryptocurrency assets on Trust Wallet, Binance, and Kucoin\nAlternative passive incomes from cryptocurrency other than staking\nCalculating Risk-Reward Ratio:\nIn this section, you will learn how to calculate the risk-reward ratio to assess potential staking investments. This ratio helps determine whether the potential reward justifies the risk involved, enabling you to make more informed decisions about where and how much to stake.\nMarket Cap Impact on Liquidity:\nUnderstanding how market capitalization influences liquidity is crucial when choosing cryptocurrencies for staking. A larger market cap typically indicates greater liquidity, making it easier to buy or sell assets without affecting their price significantly, while smaller market caps may offer higher returns but come with increased volatility and risk.\n4o mini",

      "description": "Decentralized finance, or DeFi, refers to the use of blockchain technology to enable financial services that are open and accessible to all, without the need for traditional intermediaries such as banks or credit card companies. These services include lending, borrowing, trading, and payments, among others. DeFi has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about and access financial services, and has already gained significant traction in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community.\nThere are many programs that teach decentralized finance, each with its own unique approach and focus. Some programs may emphasize the technical aspects of DeFi, teaching students how to build and deploy smart contracts, or how to use different blockchain protocols. Others may focus on the business and financial aspects, helping students understand how to create and manage DeFi projects, or how to analyze and invest in DeFi assets.\nRegardless of the specific focus, a good DeFi education program should provide students with a strong foundation in the principles and practices of decentralized finance. This includes an understanding of the underlying blockchain technology, as well as the economic, legal, and regulatory considerations involved in DeFi projects. It should also cover the various applications of DeFi, such as stablecoins, prediction markets, and decentralized exchanges, and help students develop the skills and knowledge needed to evaluate and participate in these projects.\nIn this program we will teach you how to create a passive income through the use of the amazing and powerful tools found in Decentralized Finance (DeFi).  We will start with the fundamentals and build your knowledge through easy to follow lectures, practical exercises and explanations along the way.\nWe will cover what blockchain technology is, how cryptocurrency coins and tokens are used, different ecosystems, what DeFi is and how to utilize available tools to make your money work for you.  In addition we provide helpful tips on how to ensure safety with every action.  Once we go through the steps of on-ramping funds and deploying them to the blockchain we will go through several fundamental strategies of investment.  These strategies to emphasize the highest returns with the least amount of risks.  You will be surprised at how easy some of these approaches are as we create step by step instructions for each strategy.\nWhether you are a developer, a business professional, or just someone looking to learn more about this rapidly-evolving field, this DeFi program can help you gain the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in this exciting and rapidly-growing space.",

      "description": "Update: 23rd April 2022.\nAdded GitHub repo link for the NFT Minting System. If you are technically inclined, you can download the project and give minting NFTs a try.\nThe link is available in Section4: lecture 9 - \"Is it possible to have multiple NFTs with the same asset?\"\n\n\nFrom merely 25 million USD in 2019 annual trading volume of NFT or Non-fungible tokens reached 17.7 billion in 2021.. which is more than 700 times in 2 years….and the average price of NFTs increased from merely 15 us dollars to more than 800 us dollars.\n\n\nBut amid all this exuberance, there are a lot of misconceptions about the very nature of NFTs and NFT transactions.\n\n\nThese misconceptions have created two distinct groups - advocates of NFTs who claim that NFTs are going to disrupt the creator economy..another group who think that the whole NFT system is fraudulent and compare it with the Tulip bubble.\n\n\nAs in the case of all things - the truth is somewhere in between and much more complex.\n\n\nWhile the rapid increase in the trade price of NFTs points to a market driven by hype, the fundamental technology behind NFTs has tremendous potential in various industries.\n\n\nNow, this course is designed for investors who are interested in adding NFTs to their portfolios but do not want to take impulsive decisions and want to perform proper due diligence. This course does not consider NFTs as a groundbreaking revolution nor as instruments to carry out fraud. This course considers NFTs as another type of prospective investment which needs to be understood not only from a return perspective but also from a risks and liability perspective.",

While others are turning small investments into fortunes, you’re left staring at missed opportunities, feeling like you’ve been left behind.\n\n\nYou’ve probably jumped into a few TON memecoins, hoping to catch the next Moonden or Pepe. But instead of striking gold, you watched as the price tanked, your portfolio bleeding value. Maybe you were hit by a rug pull, or you got in too late, just as the hype fizzled out.\n\n\nIt’s frustrating. It hurts. Every time you check your wallet, you wonder, “What am I doing wrong? How are others getting rich while I’m stuck losing money?”\n\n\nYou’re not alone. Many traders just like you are feeling the same sting. The pain of missing out—it’s real.

      "description": "Get the head start with all the insights you need to start creating and investing in Metaverse Technologies from one comprehensive course.\nDescription:\nThe future is here already. And, whether you are a skeptic or you are already knee-deep, investing or leading the way into this future… Everyone is talking about this brave new world - the vastly uncharted territory called the “Metaverse.”\nIt’s easy to see why. However, the big problem is this. With all the big talk around the “Metaverse,” it’s extremely hard for anyone looking to tap into the opportunities and join the heated debate surrounding this innovation to separate facts from fiction.\nWhat exactly is the Metaverse? How does it work? Why is everyone suddenly talking about NFTs, BlockChain, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and co.? Looking into the future, what thoughts and agents would drive these technologies? More importantly, what is in it for me?\nIf you have given any thought to any of these questions, you are certainly not alone.\nThis is exactly why this short but comprehensive course was crafted.\nNo matter how much or how little you know about the Metaverse right now… You no longer have to sift through endless heaps of myth and misinformation to find real insights you can use to get the best out of all the opportunities growing out of this technology, right away.\nThe course has value for anyone exploring the uncharted territories of the Metaverse.\n\n\nThis “Metaverse Essentials” course is exactly what you need if you are :\n\n\nTech Professional and Enthusiast\nAre you super excited about this new and exciting frontier and all the ways it would transform the tech landscape, but your knowledge of this field is quite sketchy? Yes! You need to get a grasp of the mechanisms and discourse surrounding the Metaverse. You have a deep interest in fields like VR, AR, blockchain, NFTs, gaming, fin-tech, hardware, and more. And, you want to explore the potentials and limitations of the Metaverse as a tool for creating novel solutions to problems in these areas. The “Metaverse Essentials” course would equip you for the future of tech businesses with insights into the fundamental workings and potentials of Metaverse technologies.\n\n\nInvestor\nAre you thinking about jumping on the train of investors who are already raking in massive RIO from cryptocurrencies, gaming, NFT arts, virtual-reality hardware, and content creation? Today, there is already a trillion-dollar Metaverse market, and revenue from this technology is projected to have doubled by 2025. So, if you have never thought about investing in this growing field, you should start to think hard about it. The short course would arm you with the right information so that you can make informed decisions about all your investment options.\n\n\nCreatives and Professionals in Other Fields\nNo matter what your specialty is, the Metaverse holds out a whole new world of untapped potentials. So, whether you are an e-commerce looking to give your customers a fully immersive feel of your product, an artist or filmmaker looking for mind-blowing ways to express, or a business looking for ways to pay staff, you can leverage your business growth on the Metaverse. The “Metaverse Essentials” course would give you a quick run through all the potentials and limitations of the Metaverse.\n\n\nJust about Anyone\nMatter of fact, this course is for anyone who wants to get all the facts behind the Metaverse fad. It is an excellent course for anyone who just wants to understand better why Facebook changed its name to Meta, or how artists like Travis Scott have managed to fit millions of people in one concert. It doesn’t matter if you think it’s all a fad that would phase out or not… It doesn’t matter what side of the heated debate concerning the Metaverse and involution you belong to… There is something for everyone in the “Metaverse Essentials” course.\n\n\nBut, why should you care about the Metaverse and all the hype surrounding it?\nThere is a simple answer. The Metaverse is already shaping how humans interact dramatically.\nIt would not be too bold to say that the Metaverse is the next leap forward in the evolution of human interaction and society. And, it should say a lot that the world’s tech giants have begun to invest massively into creating and shaping this frontier technology.\nNo doubt, Facebook was one of the most memorable brands in the world by November 2021. So, it took the world by storm that the brand decided to ditch its nearly two-decade-old name. Meta, its new name was a bold statement that it was betting its future on the “Metaverse.”\nBlockchain technologies, decentralized autonomous systems, and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are becoming intricate parts of how people exchange value. New forms of digital assets could drive privacy and property laws that disrupt commerce as we know it forever.\nAdvances in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are creating opportunities for people to connect with one another in real-time and in ways that were once inconceivable.\nRealtors might soon build a market for virtual plots in the Metaverse. A hyper-realistic 3D-rendered Metaverse with sensory feedbacks could revolutionize gaming and education. Researchers could simulate human interactions using prototypes in the Metaverse.\nA team of surgeons from across the world could complete a heart transplant on a child in the Alps. Digital 3D Arts could transform our cityscapes. Virtual concerts would rock in a Metaverse. The possibilities are endless.\nToday, human connection is evolving faster than ever. Emails must have been a marvel to anyone in the 1960s. By the late 1990s, humans could connect in real-time via social media. Today, we are organizing concerts for 30 million fans on the Metaverse, and there is more.\nThe pandemic thought us many hard lessons. But, more than anything, it thought us (or forced many of us) to consider more efficient ways of connecting in virtual spaces.\nDuring the lockdown, millions of students and professionals had their first taste of remote meetings using virtual collaboration platforms. And, afterward, there was no going back.\nSo, whether you are a cynical critic or a staunch enthusiast of this innovative technology, the Metaverse is one juggernaut no one can just ignore in this day and age.\n\n\nNow, is there anyone this course isn’t for?\nOf course!\n· Folks who really don’t give two hoots about where the human society is headed\n· Folks who prefer to buy into life-changing opportunities a little too late\n· Folks who prefer to be blind-sided about trends that are shaping the world around them\n· Folks with zero interest in any field of human endeavor\n· Folks who have no interesting to embrace the future\n· Folks who give up the opportunity to choose the future but have future choose them\nI believe, you certainly don’t want to be one of these folks, left behind and missing out...\n\n\nNow, if you are still asking what is in this Course for You...\nThis course would help you\n\n\nUnderstand the Fundamental Mechanism behind the Metaverse\nIt would build your understanding of the mechanisms and logic that drive the Metaverse and the factors shaping the development of software and hardware for the Metaverse. You would gain critical insights into how much and how fast the Metaverse has developed as well as provide projections on future trends that would shape the Metaverse. This short course would provide an introductory exploration of the different levels of law and policy framework that currently define the development of the Metaverse. By the end of this course, you would deeply understand what stakeholders are involved in the development and application of this technology and what contracts govern how people participate in this Metaverse.\n\n\nGain Insights for Investments into the Metaverse\nYou would get a clear picture of the size of the vast market and investment opportunities growing around Metaverse technologies, and gain valuable insights to inform your investment decisions in areas like blockchain technologies, NFTs, hardware, content creation, and more.\n\n\nExplore Potential Areas of Application for Metaverse Technology\nThis course would turn the spotlight to an expanding array of fields with significant potentials for the application of Metaverse technologies. Whether it is gaming and entertainment or collaboration, by the end of the sixth lesson, you would begin to see an endless world of possibilities with the Metaverse.\nSo, why not start your journey into this bold new frontier with the right knowledge?\nIt would be a thrill to point you in the right direction as you take bold steps into the exciting world of the Metaverse. Join me now to explore what’s in the Metaverse for you.\nI’ll see you shortly. I can’t wait.",

Human comprehensible identities are building blocks for the required user experience and trust structures.\n\n\nHow many people would trust the IP address of a website say 157.240.23.35 over the domain name of the website Facebook(dom)com? Thanks to the domain naming system, we do not need to remember the IP addresses for our favourite websites. The names make the internet not only more user-friendly but more trustworthy. Just think how difficult it would be to search for something on the internet without domain names.\n\n\nSimilarly, blockchain-based naming services are playing a pivotal role in making web3 user-friendly - Naming services are going to play a major role in the mass adoption of web3.\n\n\nNow, the use of blockchain will not be limited to creating an identity for accounts on a blockchain, as we will discuss in this course, blockchains can also improve the domain naming systems for the traditional internet.\n\n\nSo, we can see that there are two problem statements here\n\n\nHow to create human comprehensible identities on blockchain networks?\nHow to improve naming systems on the traditional internet using blockchains?\n\n\nGiven how intertwined these two problems are - we will discuss them together. But, before that, we need to understand how domain naming system works on the traditional internet. So, we will spend some time on that.",

      "description": "This course will teach you how to take your Bitcoin ownership seriously. The focus is getting your Bitcoin off of centralised exchanges (ie Coinbase, Binance, FTX) and into self custody. This is extremely important for both yourself and the network itself.\nOver 90% of Bitcoin is currently being kept on exchanges creating unnecessary counter party risk. You will learn fundamental steps you need to take in order to keep your Bitcoin and crypto safe.\nThis course focuses mainly on Bitcoin, but the concepts here can be applied across all other cryptocurrencies.\nYou may have heard the term, “Not your keys, not your coins”, which basically means, that if your Bitcoin is on an exchange, you don’t actually own the keys controlling that Bitcoin and therefore those coins are not really yours.\n\n\nIs this course for me?\nIf you want to keep your bitcoin and crypto safe from everybody; including yourself., then this course is for you.\nIf you’re scared of screwing something up when using Crypto, then this course is for you.\nIf you want to use Bitcoin the right way, then this course is for you.\nIf you want to keep your Crypto safe from prying eyes, then this course is for you.\nIf you want to do your part in securing the worlds first decentralised monetary system, then this course is for you.\n\n\nWhat skills will I learn in this course?\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to:\nSleep at night, knowing your Crypto is safe.\nSend and receive Bitcoin safely from your own wallet.\nEncrypt your computer, emails, network traffic and sensitive data.\nReduce your digital fingerprint across the internet and take back your privacy.\nEarn Cryptocurrency just by browsing the internet.\nAccess any website in the world by using a VPN.\nAudit and inspect your computer for viruses and malware.\nVerify software downloads are not infected with malware.\nLearn the best ways to get and protect your Bitcoin.\n\n\nHow will I learn?\nYou will be guided through a series of videos accompanied with additional text based material.\nThroughout the course:\nI will guide you from first steps of operational security all the way to transactions.\nYou will be shown different ways to accomplish one thing, making sure you understand the differences between each approach while highlighting which approach I recommend.\nEach module contains optional additional material and resources designed to smooth any rough edges.\nI will answer any and all of your questions!\n\n\nIs this course worth my time and money?\nBecause this is a highly subjective question relating to personal experience, conditions, knowledge, mental characteristics, and states; the answer depends on the person taking this course a.k.a. YOU.\nWith that in mind let me offer some objectives for your perceptions.\nIn just over 2 hours, you can substantially increase your digital privacy and security. Two hours hardening your security now, can prevent the days/weeks after recovering from a hack. Not to mention the cost of any loss of funds.\nI teach practical things you can use now, so you can save yourself the headaches of researching the right tools needed for operational security by simply adopting my recommendations.\nIf you ever get stuck, I am available to answer questions and help you out! I have been involved in the Bitcoin and crypto space since early 2017. I’ve lost money, made money, been hacked, rugged, sanctioned, KYCed, scammed and lost my keys. I know how difficult and technical things can get. And I know a lot more than what is featured in this course, so if you want to dig deeper or just need a simple question answered, I am here for you.\nThe world is a dynamic place, and so are all my courses. I will do my best to improve the course content and expand it as time allows.\nFinally, you can always get your money back if you’re not satisfied!\n\n\nWhat will each section cover?\nI’ve built this course with my friends and family in mind because they’re always asking me for help. They’re not technical people like me and I don’t expect you to be either. But now I can just send them this course the next time someone in my inner circle decides to join the Bitcoin revolution.\nHere is an overview of each section with descriptions.\nIntroduction – This is where we get familiar with the course forums, set expectations and learn more about what Bitcoin is and isn’t.\nOperational Security – This section is pretty much an entire security crash course on how to use computers, software and the internet safely and privately. This section is the longest and most important because owning Bitcoin comes with some serious responsibilities. You are the bank.\nUsing Bitcoin –This is where we finally get to use Bitcoin. We set up wallets, secure our keys, then create transactions. Ultimately, the goal of this section is to show you how to safely send and receive Bitcoin from your own wallet.\nWhat you get with the course:\nOver 20 On-Demand Video Lessons packed with text based content and additional resources for learners who like to dive deeper.\n2+ Hours Of Content\n30-day money-back Guarantee\nInstructor feedback – Yes I care about my students and want you to be successful\nFull lifetime access to the course,Forums and any future updates.\nAccess on mobile and Desktop",

Don’t forget you ALWAYS get your money back for 30 days if you regret your choice!\nDoubts gone, aren’t they?\n_____________________________________________________\nSo, are you ready to make your first step to the amazing world of Cryptos and Blockchain technologies with Private Key?\nIn 2009, a transformative technology was born: cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. While over a decade has passed since their inception, these concepts remain relatively uncharted territory for many.\nIn a world where digitalization is reshaping how we interact, transact, and envision value, understanding cryptos is more than curiosity, it is a necessity. Grasping the mechanics of these innovations — from their decentralized nature to the security they provide — is like having a map to navigate the digital landscape with confidence.\n_____________________________________________________\nWhat will you learn in this course?\nBy enrolling in this course, you'll gain the essential insights needed to explore the crypto technology with complete assurance. In this introductory course, we've opted for a 10-question framework. These questions establish a common foundation, enabling us to progress collectively into upcoming courses and content. These 10 questions are - for us - the main questions that all beginners interested in cryptos (should) ask themselves.\nHere is the full list of the topics we will cover:\nWhat is a Cryptocurrency?\nAre Cryptos all the same?\nWhat is a Blockchain?\nWhat is Crypto Mining?\nHow to Buy and Sell Cryptos?\nHow to Store Cryptos?\nWhat are Crypto's Risks and Benefits?\nWhat is Crypto Regulation?\nHow to use Cryptos for Payments?\nWhat are other Cryptos Applications?\nPlease note that our approach for THIS specific course predominantly revolves around theoretical exploration; this isn't a hands-on, practical course! As we said, it’s just an introduction for beginners.\n_____________________________________________________\nWhy is this course different from the others I can find on the same subject?\nThis course is different because our ambition is to create a crypto community where you can share and discuss ideas, but most importantly keep on learning as we grow.\nBy joining this course, you then get the opportunity to join our Private Key community, where we will do our best to provide you with the best content about cryptos, and answer all the questions you can have about cryptos! You will also get preferential access to the future courses we will create.\nThis means you don’t have to worry, because you won’t be alone on this journey!\n_____________________________________________________\nAbout Private Key\nPrivate Key was created in 2023 with the ambition to facilitate the learning of Cryptos and Blockchain technologies. As we have been around the crypto space for a few years now, we have seen good … and bad things. At Private Key, our goal is to help anyone interested in cryptos to navigate the space in complete security, and in full knowledge.\n_____________________________________________________\nIf you’re ready to kickstart your journey to crypto technologies with us, there is only one thing left for you to do ... learn with us and join this course!\nI’ll meet you on the other side!\nBenjamin from Private Key",

Understanding the risks, market trends, and different coins helps you make informed investment decisions.\nUnderstanding Decentralization: Crypto highlights the concept of decentralized finance (DeFi), where financial services aren't controlled by central banks or institutions. This knowledge gives insights into alternative financial systems.\nTechnological Innovation: Blockchain technology has wide-ranging applications beyond finance. Learning about it helps you grasp cutting-edge technology shaping the future economy.\nCritical Thinking About Money: The volatile nature of crypto markets underscores the importance of risk assessment, diversification, and responsible financial planning.\nSpotting Scams: The crypto space, unfortunately, attracts scams.

And only very few NFTs actually get popular - far below 1% of all NFTs that are created.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to position your NFTs so they are attractive. If they are attractive and compelling, people will buy them, and NFTs will become a revenue source for you. Plus, I'll show you how to position your NFTs to promote and reinforce your business or brand.\nADVANTAGES OF CREATING NFTs OVER BUYING THEM\nIf you buy NFTs, you risk your own money. Plus, trading other people's NFTs doesn't boost your business or brand. If you create your own NFTs, you can be promoting your own brand. And as your brand grows, it can sell more NFTs. Basically, when you are creating your own NFTs, you are investing in yourself. And when you buy other people's NFTs, may make or lose money, but you are doing nothing to boost your own brand or business.\nInvest in your future! Enroll today!",

Do you wonder if it is even worth investing in NFTs at all?\n\n\nThen this course is for you.\n\n\nThis is a PRACTICAL course that has one SINGLE objective; which is to teach you STEP by STEP, in a detailed and easy way EVERYTHING, you need to know about the world of NFTs, so that you can start investing and making the most of the knowledge you are going to gain.\n\n\nTrust me, I am very well aware that you might only have a vague idea of what NFTs are, how they work, and how they could benefit you. Don’t panic, we’ve all been there. Ask how many friends or colleagues have even heard of NFTs, I bet not many.\nIt is a relatively new phenomenon after all. And that is exactly why I created this course so that you will learn all the basic knowledge, tricks, and keys you need to know in order to be one of the front-runners this time. NFTs should be something everyone can learn and use and not just for tech-heads and the super-rich.\n\n\nNo previous skills are needed to successfully finish this course.\nYou will be guided through the entire process, from understanding all the technology behind NFTs, their use and value, setting up a crypto wallet and NFT marketplace account to finding opportunities and minting your first NFT today without wasting precious time and money through trial and error. The curriculum follows a logical sequence, so it will be easy for you to follow along with the entire course.\n\n\nThe NFT market is a place where a lot of money is being made, but first, you need to know how it works, what to look for and what you need to be careful of. I will help you to understand the best technologies, techniques, and tools while seeing behind all the hype and just a clear focus on the benefits for everyone involved.\nThis well-rounded guide is all it’s going to take to truly level you up so that you’re well ahead of the game when it comes to NFTs.\n\n\nImagine if you had heard of Bitcoin in 2010. Or if you had invested in Google stocks in 2004. One of the reasons you didn’t, is probably that you didn’t have the necessary knowledge back then and this is why I have created this course. So you don’t have to feel the same way about NFTs in a few years from now. Then there is nothing worse than a what if...\nI honestly believe there is no better moment to get familiar with NFTs as we are talking about a revolutionary phenomenon that is taking the world by storm and leaves even experts baffled given the enormous potential.\n\n\nBe assured that you are not gonna be alone in this process, that might seem a bit overwhelming at the beginning. We will take this journey together as I am gonna guide you through the exciting world of NFTs.\nThe teaching approach is clear, simple and to the point (including valuable secrets and tips) and it will be an informative and fun ride as real examples are being used to illustrate the most important steps.\nBy the end of this course, you will feel comfortable in the NFT field, and you will be working on the important platforms with ease.\n\n\nThe highlights of the course are:\n\n\nImportant background knowledge about the digital space\n\nExplanation of the entire investment process with real examples\n\nThe best techniques to identify investment opportunities (tips and tricks how to flip)\n\nThe different factors that make an NFT valuable and how to validate these\n\nHow to read the different graphs and find the collections that have a future\n\nAvoid NFT scams\n\nDifferent strategies to save money when you operate\n\nDetect collections with an active and supporting community\n\nThe most popular and best NFT marketplaces\n\nDetailed explanation on how to use and make the most out of crypto wallets\n\nComplete demonstration of Opensea and how to take advantage of it\n\nThe smartest ways of buying on Opensea\n\nHow to use Rarity tools to be one step ahead\n\n...and so much more!\n\n\n\n\nNow is the perfect time to jump in and start making things happen. So be a pioneer, join now and let’s start investing in NFTs today!\n\n\nI see you in the first video...",

Perhaps not. Every time the price of Bitcoins goes through the roof, we are drawn into the same discussion over the end of the state’s dominance of money and the rise of private money. These arguments arise from a simplistic understanding of what money is and more importantly, what modern money is.\nThis course will cut through all the jargon to reveal the essence of modern money and demystify the hype over digital money. From an understanding of the economics of digital money, you will be able to clearly analyze sensational and exaggerated headlines and news that we are bombarded with on almost every day. When El Salvador announced that Bitcoin would be accepted as legal tender, one periodical proclaimed:\n“Emerging markets could be the next big frontier for crypto. A slew of politicians want to follow El Salvador and adopt bitcoin as legal tender.”\nIn this course, we will help you separate the wheat from the chaff, to identify the real disruptions that today’s financial architecture face on account of the proliferation of digital money across the world.

This course rather looks into how a proof-of-stake system works and its internal economics of it.\n\n\nWhile there is a lot of chatter and speculation about how much return proof-of-stake blockchains generate, how these returns are generated and how sustainable these returns are often very obscure. To understand how the returns are generated through proof-of-stake (PoS) we need to understand how PoS works.\n\n\nThis course will look into how PoS consensus actually works, how PoS systems are different, different types of PoS consensus mechanisms, apart from the internal economics of the proof-of-stake systems and what drives the incentive mechanism of these systems.\n\n\nWhile we will cover some concepts related to staking as a crypto investment strategy, that is not the focus of the course.\nThis course covers:\n\n\nPrimer on Ethereum Merge\nMajor Proof-of-Stake Blockchains\nRole of Staking in crypto investing\nRole of consensus in blockchain design\nAnatomy of a Proof-of-Stake\nProof-of-Stake Economics - Overview\nProof-of-Stake Economics - Ethereum",

Scalability has the most layers and target the most amount of people. The interoperability holds the keys for others to unlock in the future. Sustainability is achieved through Proof of Stake (POS) system.\n\n\nDid you know Bitcoin is built on a Proof of Work blockchain? Do you know what that means? We'll cover that in the Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake portion.\n\n\nFor more analysis - check out \"Why Cardano\" on Youtube. It's for the investment-minded Cardanian where we dive in to investigate the data to tell a story with a macroeconomic approach.\n\n\nOnce you own ADA, want to receive free 5% ADA annually?\n\n\nIf so, stake it! I've included a *bonus* video about how to stake. Features of Staking Include:\n- Liquidity (Able to Unstake the Tokens Whenever)\n- Network Involvement\n- High Security When Stored in a Daedulus Wallet\nPersonally I stake with 1PCT Pools and recommend them to friends & family.

Recent interest in metaverse development is influenced by Web3, a concept for a decentralized iteration of the internet.  Web3 and The Metaverse have been used as buzzwords to exaggerate the development progress of various related technologies and projects for public relations purposes.

As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the biggest, most influential, and best-known. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown as digital alternatives to government money in the past decade.\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin are the most popular cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Tezos, EOS, and ZCash are other well-known cryptocurrencies. There are some that are like Bitcoin. Those that are based on different technologies or have new features can do more than just transfer money.\nCrypto allows you to transfer value across borders, almost instantly, 24/7, without the need for a middleman like a bank or payment processor.\nGovernments or other central authorities don't usually issue or control cryptocurrencies. Computers running free, open-source software run peer-to-peer networks. Participation is generally open to everyone. In this master course, you can learn the concepts of Crypto, Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solidity, Smart Contracts, Blockchain development and technology.\nBlockchains are \"distributed databases that keep track of ordered records, or blocks.\" They're linked using cryptography. There's always a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and some transaction data in every block. Blockchains are decentralized, distributed, and public ledgers that record transactions across many computers so that they can't be changed retroactively without affecting all subsequent blocks and majority consensus.\"\nThe blockchain is still mostly used for recording and storing transactions for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but blockchain supporters are developing and testing other uses for it, like these:\n· Transferring money and processing payments with blockchain.\n· Supply chain tracking with blockchain.\n· Digital IDs with blockchain. .\n· Data sharing with blockchain.\n· Copyright and royalty protection with blockchain.\n· Management of Internet of Things networks with blockchain.\n· Healthcare on blockchain.\nI'm going to teach these 5 major topics in this master course,\n1. Cryptocurrency and blockchain: What they are and why they're important\n2. BlockChain version, job roles, and business benefits\n3. Cryptocurrency and blockchain architecture: types, benefits, and examples\n4. Metaverse and blockchain, blockchain development\n5. How to become a blockchain developer",

EOS is a cryptocurrency much like Ethereum, and it has been heralded as Ethereum's successor.  Whereas Ethereum currently has issues scaling with an increasing backlog of transactions, EOS is poised to surpass Ethereum in performance, popularity, and value.  EOS was created to help developers like you create applications focused around transferring money or value from one party to another.\nWhy not Solidity?\nSolidity is a programming language for writing Smart Contracts.  Essentially, think of it as a way to control a bank account with code.  With Solidity, we can write applications that simulate a crowd funding campaign, a lottery, a loan, or any other type of financial instrument.  The problem is, Solidity is inefficient, and unsafe.  This lack of safety and security around the language has led to numerous bugs and hacks that've lost the Ethereum community millions of dollars.  Dan Larimer has chosen to use C++ as the primary language for EOS development due to it's speed, efficiency, safety, and the multitude of libraries available to developers.  Where Solidity is forcing developers to reinvent the wheel for even the most simple of programming constructors, C++ has been around for decades.\n\n\nWho is the target audience?\nProgrammers looking to leverage blockchain technology for advanced apps.\nEngineers who want to understand EOS and how to build dApps with it.",

      "description": "As per the Chainalysis State of Web3 Report June 2022 Report, cryptocurrencies with the smart contract functionality that powers DeFi and web3 now account for 45% of all blockchain transactions. This means growing demand for programmable blockchains. Ethereum is still leading but there is a multitude of problems with Ethereum. Apart from low throughput at just around 15 transactions per second compared to 1700 transactions per second for the visa network, a high gas fee creates a major bottleneck for Ethereum to drive mass adoption of web3 tech. As the gas fee does not depend on transaction value, smaller transactions are especially expensive on Ethereum as shown by the mentioned report.\n\n\nNow, many emerging fields in web3 such as gaming involve frequent microtransactions creating an urgent need for blockchains that can handle higher transaction throughput at a low cost and offer security comparable to ethereum.\n\n\nThis brings us to scaling solutions. Various Layer-1 and Layer-2 scaling solutions are being built to keep pace with the rapidly growing web3 ecosystem. These scaling solutions come in various forms and use a multitude of technologies.\n\n\nUnderstanding scaling solutions can be challenging because for that we need to understand the fundamental working of blockchains.\n\n\nThis course wants to help you understand different types of scaling solutions - from sidechain and plasma chains to rollups and shards.\n\n\nSo, let us get started.\n\n\nAs these topics can be considerably esoteric….I request you to go slow with the course material and understand one topic at a time before moving to the next one.

      "description": "This course provides a high-level overview of the regulatory structures relevant to Web3 ventures. It covers key regulatory bodies, the general regulatory framework, and the emerging regulatory landscape specific to Web3.\n\n\nGiven the vast scope of the subject, the course focuses on building a general understanding of the regulatory environment, with an emphasis on both current and emerging regulatory structures in major economies. Due to the complexity and volume of legal materials, students are expected to explore the provided reading materials for a deeper understanding.\n\n\nNavigating regulations is one of the most significant challenges for Web3 founders. The global and novel nature of Web3 networks makes it difficult to determine which regulations apply to specific use cases. The regulatory risks in Web3 are substantial. For investors, this can result in financial loss, but for Web3 founders, it can lead to reputational damage, lengthy legal battles, and even imprisonment. The absence of Web3-specific regulations does not exempt these networks from regulatory scrutiny. Unfortunately, many founders only realize that existing regulations apply to their ventures after it's too late.\n\n\nThis is why it is crucial for Web3 founders to thoroughly understand the current regulatory framework. Additionally, a basic grasp of legal principles is essential to anticipate future regulations that may impact the Web3 sector.\n\n\nThis course aims to equip Web3 founders with the legal knowledge necessary to navigate the current regulatory landscape and anticipate potential changes. Starting a company is a long-term commitment, and regulatory loopholes that exist today may close in a few years, posing an existential threat to your venture. Awareness of current regulations and potential changes can prevent significant challenges for you and your business.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, Web3 founders will have the tools and insights they need to stay ahead of regulatory challenges, ensuring the long-term viability and success of their ventures.",

      "description": "Build Smart Contracts with Remix, Web3, Ganache and Truffle\nThe blockchain is a revolutionary technology that allows for the secure, distributed, decentralized storage of information. Over the past few years, the blockchain has taken the engineering landscape by storm. Many people in the industry predict that the blockchain will disrupt the ways we interact with technology on the same way the Internet did in the early 2000s.\nThe blockchain is the main technology behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other prominent cryptocurrencies that we read about in the news today. By leveraging the blockchain, cryptocurrencies create a system of “trustless”ness. This cuts the need for middle men like banks and traders in economic systems.\nAlexandra Kropova is a software developer with extensive experience in full-stack web development, app development and game development. She has helped produce courses for Mammoth Interactive since 2016, including the Coding Interview series in Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, Python and Swift.\nWhen does the course start and finish?\nThe course starts now and never ends! It is a completely self-paced online course - you decide when you start and when you finish.\nHow long do I have access to the course?\nHow does lifetime access sound? After enrolling, you have unlimited access to this course for as long as you like - across any and all devices you own.\nWhat if I am unhappy with the course?\nWe would never want you to be unhappy!

      "description": "Terms like blockchain, cryptocurrency, and non-fungible tokens are making the news, but what do they really mean?\nThis course begins with a brief history of the internet, explaining how it’s a network that moves information across the world. The blockchain is then introduced, showcasing the innovation to move real value across the internet. The course explains how cryptocurrency is only one of several very interesting applications for the blockchain.\nProof of Work (POW) is shown so you can understand how mining rigs are solving cryptographic puzzles and earning passive income. Necessary details such as hash and digital signatures are explained at a high level. Wallets and centralized exchanges are described, to help you get involved with crypto investing.\nSmart contracts are briefly explained using the example of a home mortgage. The core principles of Ethereum are shown, since it was the pioneer of code compilation within a blockchain. Next, decentralized exchanges are summarized, including the way liquidity pools are used to create the supply/demand economics necessary for proper operation. Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are explained in detail, so you can finally understand the technology behind the hype. Different kinds of tokens, such as utility, security & governance are also explained.\nNext, interfaces known as oracles are explained. These platforms are used to interface real-world data with the blockchain. This is how everything from light switches to temperature sensors to stock exchanges can move data into Web 3.0. Similarly, smart contracts on the blockchain can control real-world devices such as motors, switches and printers.\nThe course concludes with a discussion about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). These are Web 3.0 “companies” that operate on smart contracts and have “employees” that can be pseudo-anonymous. Several of the most successful blockchain projects are created by DAOs, and are funded by a variety of tokens.\nViewers will satisfy their curiosity by learning how this amazing new technology actually works! The course is designed for a broad audience beyond computer scientists and programmers. If you’re looking to spend just one hour to learn about a refreshing, modern and different subject, this course is for you!",

With algorithmic trading, robots:\nTrade 24/7 without emotions\nFollow fixed rules for entry and exit\nAdapt quickly by replacing underperforming strategies\nAllow you to diversify with many EAs at once\nBy trading with 99 Expert Advisors simultaneously, you are never dependent on one single robot. This gives you flexibility and better long-term consistency.\nTools and resources included\n99 Bitcoin trading robots (Expert Advisors) each month\nScripts to export historical data from your broker\nStep-by-step setup tutorials for MetaTrader 4/5\nFull support from me and my team\nEA Studio guidance if you wish to create your own robots\nAbout the instructor\nI am Petko Aleksandrov, professional algorithmic trader and founder of Trading Academy.

Instead of spending lots of money in a single EA, with this course not only you have access to 99 EAs every month, but also a good strategy to run them all and optimize their performance. Good job Petko!\nJoz Naude  - I already love every course I have completed from Petko, straight forward, no frills information and tips ... Petko is amazing at passing his priceless information and knowledge to anybody taking his courses ... Keep going Petko!!\nSteven Roberts - As a beginner I have learned so much from Petko and really recommend his training. I can't wait to give these EA's a go. Thanks!\nLawhar Sarah - Straight to the point, i loved the course!\nDustin Wheelock - Very good course and a positive motivated teacher! Also to have the 99 EA is the biggest bonus because you don't have to know how to write them if you are new to ea and trading!",

I am a full time trader dedicated to cryptocurrency and the unique style of trading required to be successful. Despite what other traders will tell you it is not the same as trading forex or the stock market. You will need to develop unique skills and pay attention to outside influences that affect the price of Bitcoin and Altcoins.\nIt is not enough to learn the patterns and entry strategies, you also need to learn when to trade and when not to trade. And most importantly, how to maximise the gains on your winners.\n\nRight now cryptocurrency if offering a once in a lifetime opportunity to make life changing wealth, and you will need the right education to do it. I am not a YouTube influencer having a crack at trading, I am a professional crypto trader with a proven track record and a following built almost exclusively on word of mouth.\n\nThis journey you are about to embark on will be one of the most difficult but rewarding experiences of your life, are you prepared?\n\nIn 2017 as a mildly profitable trader I wrote a trading plan and in it was this statement:\n\n\"Short term Goals:\nContinue to execute ‘flawless” trades, 100% rule following/mechanical trading.\nRisk percentage to be 1% per trade and continue to compound trading capital.\nFlawless trading maintained above >90% (I look back on screen shots and am unable to find fault in my trades).\nLonger term Goals:\n100k trading capital.\nFull time trading - my income from trading alone can sustain my living expenses. At this point I will look to leave the “9-5” grind I have been in for over 20yrs.\nThis is important to me as it will allow me to live a lifestyle with freedom and enjoyment.\"\n\nAnd just recently I gave this to a young trader as an example of what a plan should look like. And before I did, I read it for the first time in over a year. I realised I had achieved everything in my plan and more.\n\nAnd now it's your turn, are you ready?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeyword scramble\nCryptocurrency blockchain trading trader crypto bitcoin ethereum technical analysis\nCryptocurrency blockchain trading trader crypto bitcoin ethereum technical analysis\nCryptocurrency blockchain trading trader crypto bitcoin ethereum technical analysis\nCryptocurrency blockchain trading trader crypto bitcoin ethereum technical analysis\nCryptocurrency blockchain trading trader crypto bitcoin ethereum technical analysis",

      "description": "Welcome to Cryptocurrency Flash Loan Arbitrage with Furucombo course. As the popularity of cryptocurrency rise since past couple years and the demand of people who are interested in exploring limitless opportunities within this field also keeps increasing, therefore, this course was created with an intention to provide crypto enthusiast an alternative to execute flash loan arbitrage trade without having to code/program solidity smart contract since there are a lot of folks out there who are curious and excited about this new concept of trade, however, they do not have skills and experience in Solidity programming previously. This course will mainly concentrate on guiding you to perform cryptocurrency flash loan arbitrage trade on DEFI platform called Furucombo where you will not be required to write any code nor create solidity smart contract to execute your trade, instead, you will play around with combination of cubes which represent pair of cryptocurrency assets in decentralised exchange platforms to discover the most profitable option before placing the trade. In addition, you will also be taught on how to use several different sites like Coin Market Cap and Cryptorank IO to monitor price fluctuations and ideally find arbitrage opportunities. The course will also be complemented with study case about gas fees comparison among different blockchain networks to decide which one is the best to rely upon. Last but not least, flash loan arbitrage might be a new concept for vast majority of people where you will be able to execute trade without using your own assets, instead, you utilise the loan from AAVE, hence, basically the only thing you are risking here is the gas fees to execute the trade which will be discussed in a more detailed and structured way inside the course.\nAs this course was designed specifically for beginners with limited knowledge and experience in cryptocurrency and flash loan arbitrage, hence, all material will be explained from the very basic version, starting with introducing basic concept of arbitrage and slowly developing our understanding to learn how its actual implementation in crypto, then followed by risk associated with this type of arbitrage continued by solutions to mitigate those risks. Lastly, it is very essential to set your expectation clear, you will not be millionaire overnight since finding arbitrage opportunities is quite hard and you are competing with thousands or even millions of traders with more advanced smart contract which has the capability of detecting  those opportunities in a matter of seconds and automatically execute the trade as soon as that price discrepancy has been detected. Therefore, the next action to be more competitive and sustainable system, learning how to code using Solidity and Javascript would be recommended as having your own smart contract gave you more authority over the trade.",

However, the excitement has been marred by substantial financial losses for those who blindly followed the hype without understanding the fundamentals.\nConsider the Tera Luna investors who faced losses in May 2022 or the buyer of the Jack Dorsey NFT Tweet, valued at $29 million in March 2021, plummeting to $29 in May 2022. While losses are not uncommon, there are success stories among large institutions, famous investors, and individuals who navigated the market profitably.\nThe key distinction lies in knowledge and understanding. Winners had a grasp of the technology, market dynamics, and more, while losers succumbed to greed, lacking financial and technological education. In the cryptocurrency market, results are directly tied to comprehension—education is not just an option; it's a necessity.\nWhy make Bitcoin your starting point?\nPioneer of Blockchain: As the first and simplest blockchain use case, Bitcoin offers accessibility.\nLong-Term Viability: It stands out as a crypto asset with the best chance of enduring over time.\nHistorical Significance: Beyond technology, Bitcoin unveils the history of cryptos and decentralized payment systems.\nThis course is the essential guide for every Bitcoin enthusiast before venturing into the broader cryptocurrency realm.

This was reduced to 25 BTC in 2012, and again to 12.5 BTC in 2016, when you could solve an algorithm of a block the result of 50 bitcoin those algorithms you can solve it as a person but it would take you a long time to solve a single bitcoin mathematical exercise if you will work day and night human power is not able to solve it as fast as machines To solve a hash an average human would take 17min while a Miner for example one of the most popular the ANTMINER S9 would take 1Sec to solve 13.5Ths\n\n\nSo when they began to implement the use of processors to decipher these codes the difficulty was not so difficult and you could decipher blocks fast at first the main miners did it on their own mined one block a day two blocks a day three blocks a day of bitcoin a day were 100 200 300 or even more depending on the speed. However its value was very low it does not generate a lot of money and it was not accepted almost anywhere they do it mostly for a Hobby of any person, As the currency became more popular computers started to become slow and no longer mined two or three blocks a day sometimes one every two days as time went by it became more and more popular and the difficulty every day more and more difficult because there were more and more people mining and reached a point where mining a block of bitcoin already spent three months 4 months or even a year with a single block of bitcoin. You could spend a year with a single computer that made people at that time a person created a pool or pool and pooled their mining power in that sense used two three three four five computers of those four or five computers together the power in one and there are born the pool After that begins to resume the power of mining And again to gather about 20 30 or 40 computers, You could mine a block a day a block every two days but it was irrelevant because as time went by the difficulty and little by little the technology was rising and they began to realize that they could mine in video cards with the graphic power of the cards saw that it was superior to the processor for mining focused on mining and from there came the workers they began to mine bitcoin with video cards and with greater strength greater mining capacity the difficulty was rising and after a few years they began to create the first specialized machines to mine bitcoin.\n\n\nFinal objective of the course\n\n\nAt the end of this course you will have all the necessary knowledge about cryptocurrency mining and not only that you will have the specialized knowledge to be able to install, repair, configure and detect failures in any of the digital mining equipment. You will be able to offer your services as a specialized technician for the installation and maintenance of digital mining equipment.\n\n\nWhat else will this Cryptocurrency Mining course have?\n\n\nLifetime access, when you get this course it will always be available to you.\n\n\nThe course will always keep you up to date in case a new way of mining is implemented.\n\n\nWhy is this course worth your time?\n\n\nMy 7 years of experience in this world of digital mining makes me want to transmit all my knowledge about successes and failures with this type of equipment and by collecting different cases of failures I can give you the certainty that you will not fail where others have failed or even where others can lead you to failure.\n\n\nWho is this course for?\n\n\nPeople interested in learning about the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nPeople with no previous knowledge who want to learn about cryptocurrency.\n\n\nComputer technicians who want to update their knowledge.\n\n\nCompanies or people who want to enter the world of digital mining.",

Why? Because they keep on chasing the wrong narratives.\n\n\nIf you’re still figuring out what a liquidity pool is or how to connect a wallet, start with our foundational program—the DeFi Investor: Earn No Matter the Market Conditions. This advanced experience builds on that base and dives straight into the strategies and tools that elite DeFi operators are using to multiply capital, hedge intelligently, and automate their edge in the ever-evolving world of decentralized finance.\n\n\nWhy would you need this?\nBecause DeFi isn’t about “getting in early” anymore. It’s about outsmarting the noise, knowing what others don’t, and automating what most are still doing manually.\n\n\nThis program is for the investor who’s done being average—who wants access to the exact tools, strategies, and systems that real capital allocators use to generate yield, protect downside, and move fast across chains.\n\n\nWhile others are farming the same recycled protocols or aping into hype, you’ll be operating with precision, backed by real-time data, perpetual trading skills, and automated income streams that never sleep.\n\n\nYou don’t need more theory. You need an edge.\n\n\nInside Advanced DeFi Investor, you’ll unlock:\n\n\nPerpetual Futures Mastery – Learn how to use Decentralized platforms to trade perpetuals directly from your wallet with zero middlemen. We’ll break down leverage risks, liquidation protection, and strategic trade setups built for high-volatility conditions. Also a secret charts strategy to make your trading more accurate.\nLiquidity Provider Protection – Providing liquidity is not enough. We show you how to hedge your LP positions to protect against impermanent loss, use options where available, and pair stablecoin strategies to keep your downside limited while farming yield.\nAutomated Position Management – Discover how to set up advanced tools and scripts that automate LP adjustments, yield harvesting, rebalancing, and portfolio reallocation—allowing your DeFi income stream to run even while you sleep.\nMarket Intelligence Systems – You’ll be handed the exact tools, dashboards, and on-chain scanners used by top-tier DeFi players to track inflows, smart money moves, early alpha signals, and sentiment shifts across multiple chains in real-time.\nCross-Chain Ecosystem Flow – Understand how value moves across Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Sui, and more. Learn how to position early on new chains, spot upcoming catalysts, and take advantage of layer-specific opportunities before the crowd.\n\n\nThis course is tactical, not theoretical. Every module includes hands-on walkthroughs, live examples, and a full breakdown of every tool and protocol in action, so you can follow along and implement in real time.\n\n\nIf you already understand DeFi—but want to elevate your game, earn 24/7, and operate with the edge of a pro—this is your playbook.\n\n\nNote: as DeFi evolves, so will this program. New videos will be added on a regular basis!",

      "description": "Last year, I made a small investment in Cryptocurrencies. And the returns, well, to put it mildly, have been spectacular! It's been the best trade I’ve ever made. How much? 3,300% in 12 months. That’s not a typo.\nThat’s enough to turn $1,000 into $33,000.\nOr $100,000 into $3.3 million.\nAnd what's more, I still continue to earn around 100% each year on that investment!\nEvery day, I get a call or message from a friend, asking me to explain Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoins.\nIt’s no surprise, Cryptocurrencies are all over the news with breathtaking returns. But before I tell you more, keep this in mind - I believe this is just the beginning.\nExceeding 400% growth earlier this year, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have finally started to catch the attention of most of the world. The Blockchain is being called the greatest invention since the internet (or even sliced bread) with companies worldwide flocking to take part in this digital revolution.\n\nSee, most of my friends know me as a professional investor in private markets - markets which are not liquid, are private and only meant for High Net Worth Individuals or HNWIs.\nHowever, in the last few years I’ve been noticing a mega trend developing, where juicy returns are no longer exclusive to the rich.\nHere’s a list of gains Cryptocurrencies have been handing to those in the know…\nEthereum (ETH) 109,254%\nIOTA (IOTA) 103,882%\nAntshares (NEO) 88,368%\nStratis (STRAT) 40,226%\nStorj (SJCX) 5,524%\nQTUM (QTUM) 3,442%\nAugur (REP) 2,818%\nOmiseGo (OMG) 3,045%\nAnd the list goes on. What’s more, is that these massive gains are changing peoples’ lives too. And that’s what I love to see.\nAnd the second most asked question is… is it the right time to invest?\nMy answer… YES! Now is the time to make generational wealth, using this foundational technology called Blockchain.\nAnd the best part is… all this is possible, even if you’re not an geek or hacker, even if you know nothing about blockchain or cryptocurrencies, even if you’re not a venture capitalist or trader and even if you don’t have lots of free time!\nYou can participate in the digital gold rush! But if you wait, even for just a few weeks, you’ll likely miss the easy gains!\nFeel like waiting a year or two, to see how others are burnt because this is the Wild West… no problem, but you’ll miss out all the big gains - and that’s your loss.\nIf you wait too long, the biggest opportunity in a lifetime will be gone. (Enroll NOW!)\nThink about this for a moment, it was from the Wild West that companies like Amazon were born. All the wealth we’ve seen generated in the last decade have risen from this Wild West period. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, you name it.\nSo why would I share all this insight with you? Why not keep it secret and enjoy the fruits and make a tonne of money?\nWell, that’s a good question. One that I’m happy to answer.\nI come from a middle class background. One thing my father taught me, is to work hard. But for some reason, despite all the hard work - I couldn’t really make much money. Then I started to study the ways of the rich, and realized they were playing a totally different game.\nAnd the more I studied, the more I realized what was going on.\nSlowly but surely, a tremendous shift was taking place - glacial speeds you could say, which is why you can’t see them overnight. People really can’t figure out what’s going on because the mainstream media will never report it until it’s too late.\nAnd all I can say, is that this… is just the tip of the iceberg.\nAs a kid I used to collect stamps and coins. What is interesting is that these stamps had a value - more than the value printed on it some times. And the coins, well they served as a reminder. A reminder of what happens over time in history.\nI honestly hated history, but decided to study the history of currencies and how they corrected the course of empires and civilizations.\nRight now, money is going through a fundamental change. I’ll explain this in detail through the course and you’ll realize why this is so important to understand and how you can profit from it.\nAnd of course when there’s money to be made, there are going to be scam artists for sure. And it’s true with Cryptocurrencies today, some of these shouldn't even see the light of day. People have raised millions of dollars, only to spend the money vacationing in Spain!\nPeople are getting scammed out of their hard earned money. I know how hard it is to work for money, to earn it with integrity. So I decided to help them make sense of this transformational shift we’re going through - and give them an edge.\nThat’s why I decided to do this. I want to make sure that everyone in this world, has a chance to profit from this change. That’s why I’m sharing this.\nWe’re at the dawn of the next massive transfer of wealth. I want you to be a part of it. And the best part is, you don’t need a lot of money to start using this insight.\nI’ll share with you how I generated over 3,000% returns in less than 12 months, and how I transformed just $300 into $10,000 and still continue to earn a 100% return on my investment.\nBut I’m not stopping there.\nToday, I’m going to tell you about my trading and investing strategies… for FREE. And you might think I’m nuts giving away these strategies. I actually sell them for over $800. And here I am giving them away for FREE as a part of this course!\nAND…\nYou’ll also get a downloadable PDF “The Rise of Blockchain & Cryptocurrency” — a beginners guide in plain English as a bonus.\nThink about this, there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies being issued and more are being added each day. The cryptocurrency space is currently over $170 billion and growing, with billions being exchanged each day.\nAnd here’s the interesting thing, this is just the beginning. You see currency markets or forex markets as we call them are over $5 TRILLION - so we’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg in terms of cryptos and there’s so much more upside to be had.\nHow do you participate in this space, or should you even do so and how do you do it safely? That’s what I hope to answer in this course. So, don’t delay - it could be costing you those easy gains. Enroll today!",

Far from it. It is important to understand about the use of blockchain as you will ultimately become the beneficiary of all its benefits, and if you were not aware of all those benefits, now is the time to start learning.\nThis online course will cover the basics of blockchain and cryptocurrencies:\nEverything about what blockchain means, how was it created, why it matters, what it consists of, what makes it unique and useful, and why you should care. It also explains everything about cryptocurrencies, how they work, and why are they so volatile using some of the most popular ones in the market such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and many others.\nFurthermore, this course explores implications of different blockchains such as smart contracts, how they function, what are the advantages, and cryptography which makes them so secure.\nAfter getting grounding on cryptocurrency and blockchain, the next time there is a conversation about these topics, you can actively participate in them. You should fully understand what cryptocurrencies and smart contracts are, the meaning of the words “miner” and “FIAT”, and you will not be dragged into scams.",

The course discusses the basic concepts such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).\n\n\nThen we spend some time understanding the role of blockchains in these identity systems.\n\n\nWe then will cover real-life implementations such as Decentralized Identity in Ethereum, polygonID, and a few other Decentralized Identity solutions.\n\n\nHowever, no analysis is complete without acknowledging the limitations of current decentralized identification solutions. So, we will spend some time understanding the limitations and discussing how these limitations can be overcome.\n\n\nPlease note that this course does not cover any coding for Decentralized Identity systems. The primary goal of this course is to introduce the fundamentals of identity systems and how Decentralized Identity systems are solving some of the pressing issues in this sector.",

      "description": "Hey Guys! Welcome!\n\nThis highly-requested course has TREMENDOUS VALUE!!\n\nFIRST, Everything That You Learn In This Elliott Wave Theory Course Can Be Applied To Any Financial Market! Cryptocurrency, Stocks, Forex, Metals... etc. ALL markets follow a natural rhythm and in this course, we show you how to find that pattern within chart data! We introduce you to the Elliott Wave Theory, We go through the Elliott Wave Rules and Guidelines, and We demonstrate them on the live market. THEN, We individually break down Impulse waves and Corrective waves and show you how to get the Fibonacci Price targets for every single wave in a market cycle!\n\nThis is basically giving you our recipe and our developed method to trading the Cryptocurrency Markets! This strategy of ours has been highly requested and has already been shared with hundreds of other emerging Traders!\n\nWith this course you'll be able to predict upcoming trend reversals, Know where we are in position relative to a larger market cycle, Identify short term AND long term Fibonacci price targets, Apply the Elliott Wave Theory and SO much more!\n\nThere's TONS of knowledge hidden in chart data and this course just barely scratches the surface. However, We are confident that after completing all FOUR of our courses, you'll be able to analyze markets, start to develop your own wave interpretations, predict upcoming trend reversals and know when to enter into a position and when not to!\n\nCongratulations on starting your Elliott Wave journey, we look forward to being your guide!\n\nINTRO TO ELLIOTT WAVE THEORY\nWhere Fibonacci levels provide us with significant price targets, Elliott Wave Theory takes it further to narrow the targets and provide a map for how these price targets are achieved. You can imagine how powerful this knowledge would be to a financial trader or investor! The two theories work together in beautiful harmony and make up the bulk of our trading strategy. It's important that you continue to practice applying what you learn within each course on the live market to develop an eye for wave cycles and to be able to form your own wave interpretations!\n\nELLIOTT WAVE RULES + GUIDELINES\nWe examine Elliott Wave rules and guidelines that detail specifically how market structures are to be constructed according to the natural governing law. While these may seem cut-and-dry, being able to identify elliott wave pattern failures is critical for you to become successful with this strategy. We'll review each one, what it means and identify it on the live-market. Do not move on until you fully understand the concept behind each rule + guideline!\n\nELLIOTT WAVE IMPULSES\nImpulse waves are the beloved trading time for most traders. It's a time when the trend and your wave counts are the most-clear, and your confidence is high. most of your profits will be made within impulse waves and so, understandably obtaining everything there is to know about them will no-doubt give you an edge over the market. We intensely examine these wave structures and their price targets- defining the best trading opportunities and setups.\n\nELLIOTT WAVE CORRECTIONS\nIt's true- many traders get left behind and die in corrections. The back-and-forth price action (or the non-existent price action) is an intense challenge on the psyche, and most can not handle it. emotion leads to costly mistakes in trading and is a battle that you need to be constantly aware of in every trade. Control your emotions by understanding how the fundamental components are constructed. We'll cover how to spot corrections forming on the live market, what waves you should be (or not be) trading, and most importantly, how to safely trade them!",

I show you how to see the majority of all cryptocurrencies currently active on different exchanges. How to trade on those different exchanges from setting up a new account, to utilizing their different models. They all come down to the basics of buying, selling, and trading, but they all differ in one, or many different ways. We will go through setting up wallets, security via texting, email, and Google Authenticator which will ensure your security to the greatest possible extent.\nI will show you how to make money with several different types of investment models, while avoiding the many scams out there, which can be an extremely tricky task. There are so many HYIP, and get rich quick scams out there. Some seem to be extremely successful, even if some are, how long can they sustain for? This and other topics are covered throughout quizzes and assignments.\nDon't be worried by the speed of the videos as I have designed them to go at a fairly quick pace. But they are broken up into different parts so you can come back and navigate quickly, to whichever part you need help with.\nThis is an interactive course so you will be able to discuss your thoughts, trades, predictions, and much more with other students as well as myself.\nDon't be upset if you have missed out on the Bitcoin growth in the early days, because it is still early enough for you to capitalize on bitcoin itself, and on the many other alternative coins rising through the ranks. You won't be an early adopter, but you will certainly be in the middle. Less than 1% of the world's population has a wallet address at the time of this writing. This technology will make it easy for anyone to have access to banking without centralized banks.\nAs soon as you understand the value of block chain technology and the ease of its use, you will no longer want to know how many dollars you can trade your bitcoins in for. You will start to realize that soon enough, you won't have to or even want to.\nThe ICO worksheet I have in the course comes from months of making mistakes, as well as some solid success. Make sure you utilize it on every investment you make in this market. We will go into more detail in the intermediate and advanced courses on trends and tools to help make new investments.\nAt the end of this course, you will know how to buy, sell, and trade different cryptocurrencies. You will have the ability to do so with confidence in yourself, and in your security. You will also be able to go through the hundreds, maybe thousands of different ICO's and know what to look for in picking a winner!\nDon't keep putting it off, act today! The longer you wait to get into this market, is another day you are missing out, whether you get this course or not.\n\n\n\nAs a bonus to this course, I will upload one new ICO pick each month from November 2017 to November 2018!!!",

      "description": "The Blockchain is a term that has come to mean many things to many people. For developers, it is a set of protocols and encryption technologies for securely storing data on a distributed network. For business and finance, it is a distributed ledger and the technology underlying the explosion of new digital currencies. For technologists, it is the driving force behind the next generation of the internet. For others, it is a tool for radically reshaping society and economy taking us into a more decentralized world.\nWhichever way you look at it, blockchain has become a term that captures the imagination and fascinates many, as the implications of such technology are truly profound. For the first time in human history, people anywhere can trust each other and transact within large peer-to-peer networks without centralized management. Trust is established, not by centralized institutions, but by protocols, cryptography and computer code. This greatly strengthens our capacity for collaboration and cooperation between organizations and individuals within peer networks, enabling us to potentially form global networks of collaboration without centralized formal institutions; unprecedented but hugely relevant in an age of globalization and a new set of 21st-century challenges that require mass collaboration.\nThe blockchain is a complex technological, economic and social phenomenon. It calls into question what might have seemed to be established parameters of the modern world like currency, economics, trust, value, and exchange. To make sense of this one needs to understand it in a holistic context all the way from its technicalities to its aspirational potential, this course is designed to do exactly that, by giving an 360 degree overview to the different dimensions of the technology, its potential application within various industries and its far-reaching implications for society and economy.\nIn the first section of the course we give an overview to the blockchain both on a technical and nontechnical level we also discuss the importance of the blockchain within the context of the emerging next generation internet. In the second section we talk about the blockchain as a so call \"trust machine\" and how it enables transparency and collaboration, we will look at distributed ledger technology, talking about smart contracts, Ethereum, and decentralized applications. In the third section, we introduce you to the workings of token economies illustrating how the blockchain and distributed ledgers can work to build vibrant ecosystems through the use of tokens to incentivize behavior. In the last section of the course, we will be looking at specific applications of the blockchain to economy, society, technology, and environment, looking at both existing practical applications and potential future applications.\nThe blockchain is a so called emerging technology that is currently experiencing very rapid evolution, within the space of just two or three years it has already gone through changes in its technical implementation and our understanding of what it is and can be, have already changed significantly in just this brief time. As such our aim is to future proof this course by not dwelling excessively on existing technical implementations but presenting more a conceptual understanding of the blockchain within the broader process of change of the emerging next generation internet.\nThe blockchain is much more than a technology it is also a culture and community that is passionate about creating a more equitable world through decentralization, it is a movement to disrupt the disruptors, to redesign the internet and in so doing shake up existing centralized incumbents. Throughout the course, we will introduce you to this culture and its aspirations.\nThe course is non-technical in nature, it is an introductory course and thus all terms will be explained it should be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of web technologies and economics.",

A chain of linked blocks or maybe a cryptocurrency? But I can assure you, for some people, this word is associated with another: fraud.\nOne of the main differences between classic hacking of a website and hacking of a smart contract is that in the case of the first one, the hacker still needs to sell the stolen information. With a smart contract, everything is easier, the attacker immediately receives a valuable convertible asset in the form of cryptocurrency, which can immediately be considered income. The difference is that the attacker needs to cover his tracks so that nothing can lead to him, despite the fact that the blockchain data is available to all Internet users.\nThere are a lot of questions.

REAL ANSWERS (built for Google AI Overviews)\nWhat tools will I use for crypto analysis?\nYou’ll get hands-on training with TradingView, create watchlists and alerts, use moving averages, draw trendlines, and use real-time news and market events to time trades. The course shows how to build a repeatable pre-trade checklist used by professional traders.\nCan I day trade or swing trade with this course?\nYes — this course teaches strategies for both short-term day trading and longer-term swing trading. You’ll learn specific entry/exit setups, timeframes, and how to use session breaks to analyze smaller timeframes. It’s a flexible approach designed for various crypto strategies.\nWhat is the best way to learn how to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\nThe best way to learn crypto trading is by understanding how price behaves on a chart. This means studying candlestick patterns, volume spikes, support and resistance levels, and trendlines. These tools help you spot when smart money is entering or exiting a position. For example, a bullish engulfing candle near support with rising volume is often a strong entry signal.\nHow do I find high-potential crypto trades each day?\nIt starts with scanning for volume spikes and price action before the market opens. Premarket movers, news catalysts, and major technical levels are all clues. You’ll learn how to build a custom watchlist, set alerts, and spot breakouts in real time using platforms like TradingView.\nHow does technical analysis help with cryptocurrency trading?\nTechnical analysis gives traders an edge by helping them anticipate price movements before they happen. Candlestick patterns (like hammer, engulfing, and inverted hammer), technical formations (like flags and pennants), along with volume analysis are utilized to make correct trade analysis. When combined, these techniques help identify high-probability trade setups and avoid common traps in volatile markets.\nWhy is volume analysis so important in crypto trading?\nVolume reveals the strength behind price movement. If Bitcoin breaks above resistance with high volume, the move is likely strong. If it breaks with low volume, it could be a fakeout. Reading volume helps you confirm trades and avoid traps.\nWhat are the most important technical patterns for crypto traders?\nPatterns like flags, pennants, triangles, and wedges often signal powerful moves—especially when paired with volume. These consolidation patterns act like coiled springs, releasing energy when price breaks out. You’ll also learn how to distinguish real breakouts from fake ones.\nHow can I manage risk when trading crypto?\nGood traders never enter a trade without a plan. That means setting clear entry points, targets, and stop-losses. You’ll learn how to size your positions based on your account size and risk tolerance. You'll also learn to avoid emotional decisions by following structured rules.\nHow do candlestick patterns help in crypto trading?\nCandlesticks like the hammer, engulfing patterns, and hanging man give insights into buyer/seller behavior. For example, a hammer candle at support suggests buyers stepped in and rejected lower prices. When combined with trendlines and volume, these patterns become powerful signals.\nWhat’s the difference between day trading, swing trading, and investing in crypto?\nDay trading involves fast trades within the same day, swing trading spans several days, while investing means holding for the long term. Each requires different strategies, position sizes, and time commitments. You’ll learn how to use different timeframes and tools for each style.\nWhat’s the key to becoming consistent in crypto trading?\nConsistency comes from mastering a repeatable process—from scanning the markets and analyzing setups to executing trades with discipline. No “gut feelings” or guessing. You’ll use tools like alerts, watchlists, and economic calendars to prepare like a pro.\n\n\nREADY TO GO BEYOND THE BASICS?\nThis course teaches strategies for both short-term day trading and longer-term swing trading. You’ll learn specific entry/exit setups, timeframes, and how to use session breaks to analyze smaller timeframes.

Anyone can start mining in 3 simple steps with any PC, I'm inviting you to start your crypto journey with me.\nThe only thing required from you is a strong desire to be successful by following the instructions. Ask for help when you get stuck and never give up.\nIn this course I'll be teaching 2 different ways of mining for beginners, I recommend you start with the basic one first and then when you feel comfortable move into the advanced way. Along the way you will be learning about coins, the blockchain, wallets and even Decentralized Finance (DEFI).\nThe course is designed to give you an initial introduction with simple steps so you can start mining right away.\nIn this course you will learn:\n- How to mine with CPU and GPU on Laptop or Desktop.\n- How to download and use the mining Software.\n- How to get the best wallets.\n- How to use your coins for Decentralized Trading.\n- How to stake coins and get rewards, in this case Tron TRX.\n\n\nThe course shouldn't take you longer than 30 minutes to complete, I encourage you to ask all the questions you need when you encounter any issue with your hardware or the process. I'll be sharing documents with useful links and instructions for you to get personalized support & troubleshooting with me via Discord chat.\nFollowing this methodology you can mine Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, CAKE, Binance BNB, Shiba Inu, Zilliqa, Tron, Decentraland, Ripple, Tether USDT, Dogecoin, Zcash, Verge, Monero, Dash, Matic and many more ...\nThe strategy behind the course is to mine those coins with lower price point where you can make a larger amount of coins (depending on your hardware) so you can hold them, Stake them or even trade them in decentralized platforms like Pancakeswap or Uniswap.\nCoins like Tron TRX can easily be obtained through this way of mining at the moment so you can then Stake them to get a nice APR return, other coins people are mining intensively at the moment is Shiba Inu because of the price increase potential in the coming year.\n\n\nHope to hear from you after you complete the course, best of luck for you in this new path and Enjoy Mining !!",

While this gives you security against hackers, it makes your Cryptocurrency susceptible to your own human errors or accidents like loss, theft, or simply forgetting where you put your offline wallet.\nPAPER CRYPTOCURRENCY AND BITOIN WALLETS\nThis class focuses heavily on paper wallets because they are one of the common forms of cold storage. Paper wallets are what they sound like - you save your public and private keys on a piece of paper, and never share it online so hackers can't get to them. I'll show you how to do it correctly, and how to avoid common pitfalls when using paper wallets.\nHARDWARE CRYPTOCURRENCY AND BITOIN WALLETS\nHardware wallets are another type of cold storage. Many hardware wallets are in the form of USB drives that are specifically made for storing and making transactions with Cryptocurrency.\nDIVERSIFYING YOUR STORAGE TYPES?\nIt's OK to have some Cryptocurrency in offline wallets and some in online wallets. We'll discuss you can decide on what proportion is right for you for your lifestyle.\nInvest in your future. Enroll today!",

Now, tokens incentivize platform participants so that they behave in a way platform builders intended them to and ultimately contribute towards the growth of the platform.\n\n\nToken Engineering is not a simple subject to learn - It is an interdisciplinary subject that borrows concepts from economics, system design, behavioral science, etc.\n\n\nSo, mastering Token Engineering is neither easy nor can be done quickly. But understanding Token Engineering is absolutely vital for designing well-functioning web3 platforms.\n\n\nNow, this course will introduce you to different facets of token engineering so that you understand the basics and create a framework for future learning. We will also try to design a token model for a hypothetical decentralized application.\n\n\nSo, let us get started.",

Here, in this course, you will learn and discover ways to receive free cryptocurrency coins or tokens without having to buy them on cryptocurrency exchanges. In this course, you will extensively learn how to use several different tools and database to find upcoming cryptocurrency airdrop alongside with requirements that need to be satisfied to be eligible, you will learn how cryptocurrency airdrop works, starting from registration process to token distribution, we will have discussion about risk to reward ratio specifically on how to identify if the airdrop worths our time and effort, you will be fully guided step by step on how to participate in the airdrop as this course also comes with three case study where we will pick we will pick three upcoming airdrops for further analysis, we will conduct background check on the development team to make sure they have clean track records from their past projects, evaluate the real utilities or use cases of the project to see if the project has high demand in the market and will attract a lot of investor, in addition, we will review the requirements that need to be met to be eligible to participate in the airdrop as well as the token distribution method. At the end of the course, we will also learn how to keep track of all airdrops that you have participated in by using Google Sheets and Google Calendar to ensure you don’t miss any deadline.\nAlthough getting free cryptocurrency might sound a little bit unrealistic to some people since it just sounds too good to be true but actually this is real and legit. As a matter of fact, airdrop has been one of the most effective marketing strategies to promote a new cryptocurrency project and to raise awareness among investors. Hence, it can be concluded that airdrops mutually benefit both the investors and the development team at the same time since the investors get free cryptocurrency coins meanwhile the development team builds potential customer base as well as attract early adopters.

How to Add Your Free Course NFTs and Poly Network to MetaMask\nMay 2022 - NEW! Added Invite Link to Private Discord Learning Community\nApril 2022 - NEW! Course Updated\n\n\nDo you want to learn how to create, buy, and sell NFTs? If so, this is the course for you! In The Complete 2022 Guide to Creating and Selling NFTs, we will teach you everything you need to know about this exciting new investment opportunity. NFTs are non-fungible tokens that represent unique digital assets. These tokens are quickly becoming a hot commodity in the cryptocurrency world, and now is the time to get involved! This course will cover everything from the basics of NFTs to how to create and sell your own NFTs. By the end of this course, you'll be an expert in all things NFTs! So what are you waiting for? Enroll today and let's get started!\n\n\nWhat is an NFT?\nAn NFT is a non-fungible token that represents a unique digital asset. NFTs are stored on a blockchain, just like Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs cannot be exchanged for other tokens. Each NFT is unique and can represent anything from a piece of digital art to a virtual world asset.\n\n\nNFTs are becoming increasingly popular as a new way to invest in digital assets.\n\n\nFor a few years straight, I spent a lot of time researching different ways of generating passive income online. It was only recently that I stumbled across NFTs, and I was immediately hooked. The idea of owning a unique digital asset that can be sold or traded intrigued me, and I knew I had to learn more. In this guide, I'm going to share everything I've learned about NFTs so far. By the end, you'll know everything you need to know about NFTs and how to get started with creating and selling your own NFTs. Let's get started!\n\n\nThis course is designed for beginners who have little to no experience with NFTs but if you are intermediate with this topic, here are a few things you may take away from this course:\n\n\n\n\n- A better understanding of NFTs and how they work\n- How to create your own NFTs\n- How to sell NFTs\n- The different types of NFTs\n- The benefits of investing in NFTs\n- The risks associated with NFTs\n- And more!\n\n\nI have also completed a workbook that I will be updating from time to time as the market changes. Please use the workbook as your cheat sheet and NFT planner.\n\n\nWhat is NOT covered in the course:\nMy goal with this course is just to get you started. You could stop after taking this course, but I recommend diving deeper into some of the topics I cover. Here are some things I may touch on but won't dive deep into:\n- How to code your own NFTs\n- In-depth market analysis\n- Setting up NFT Ad campaigns\n\n\nI'm excited to get started and I hope you are too! Let's jump in.",

      "description": "Scammers are using social media to perpetuate giveaway scams. They post screenshots of forged messages from companies and executives promoting a giveaway with hyperlinks to fraudulent websites. Fake accounts will then respond to these posts affirming the scam as legitimate. The fraudulent websites will then ask that you “verify” your address by sending cryptocurrency to the scam giveaway.\nHow To Avoid Cryptocurrency Scams\nScammers are always finding new ways to steal your money using cryptocurrency. One sure sign of a scam is anyone who says you have to pay by cryptocurrency. In fact, anyone who tells you to pay by wire transfer, gift card, or cryptocurrency is a scammer. Of course, if you pay, there’s almost no way to get that money back. Which is what the scammers are counting on. Here are some cryptocurrency scams to watch out for.\nInvestment and business opportunity scams\nSome companies promise that you can earn lots of money in a short time and achieve financial freedom.\nSome scammers tell you to pay in cryptocurrency for the right to recruit others into a program. If you do, they say, you’ll get recruitment rewards paid in cryptocurrency. The more cryptocurrency you pay, the more money they promise you’ll make. But these are all fake promises, and false guarantees.\nSome scammers start with unsolicited offers from supposed “investment managers.” These scammers say they can help you grow your money if you give them the cryptocurrency you’ve bought. But once you log in to the “investment account” they opened, you’ll find that you can’t withdraw your money unless you pay fees.\nSome scammers send unsolicited job offers to help recruit cryptocurrency investors, sell cryptocurrency, mine cryptocurrency, or help with converting cash to bitcoin.\nSome scammers list scam jobs on job websites. They’ll promise you a job (for a fee), but end up taking your money or personal information.\nLook for claims like these to help you spot the companies and people to avoid:\nScammers guarantee that you’ll make money. If they promise you’ll make a profit, that’s a scam. Even if there’s a celebrity endorsement or testimonials. (Those are easily faked.)\nScammers promise big payouts with guaranteed returns. Nobody can guarantee a set return, say, double your money. Much less in a short time.\nScammers promise free money. They’ll promise it in cash or cryptocurrency, but free money promises are always fake.\nScammers make big claims without details or explanations. Smart business people want to understand how their investment works, and where their money is going. And good investment advisors want to share that information.\nBefore you invest, check it out. Research online for the name of the company and the cryptocurrency name, plus words like “review,” “scam,” or “complaint.” See what others are saying. And read more about other common investment scams.\nBlackmail emails\nScammers will often send emails that say they have embarrassing or compromising photos, videos, or personal information about you. Then, they threaten to make it public unless you pay them in cryptocurrency. Don’t do it. This is blackmail and a criminal extortion attempt. Report it to the FBI immediately.\nSocial media scams\nIf you read a tweet, text, email, or get a message on social media that tells you to send cryptocurrency, it’s a scam. That’s true even if the message came from someone you know, or was posted by a celebrity you follow. Their social media accounts might have been hacked.",

      "description": "Dr. Saifedean Ammous teaches an online course based on his book, The Bitcoin Standard. The course expands on the material in the book, and delves deeply into the sources and readings that shaped it.\n\nThe Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.\nWhile Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. This course embarks on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse.\nWith this background in place, the course moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments—a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.\nAmmous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders.",

Some people say that it's the future, some people say that it's just a fad, but either way, people are talking about it! Though there are many cryptocurrencies on the rise these days (there are currently more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies out there!), there's no doubt that Bitcoin is the world's most popular cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin has actually been around for almost ten years, but it hasn't ever had as much buzz as it has right now. However, with all of that buzz, comes many misconceptions. Though many of them aren't true, the whole concept of cryptocurrency is quite complex, so if you are confused about how it works and what it even is, you are not alone! There are tremendous upsides for crypto investors, but also great risks for those who do not understand this new market. This course will make sure that you are informed and ready to confidently move forward on your crypto journey!\nWhether you already have Bitcoin, or are thinking about investing in Bitcoin, I firmly believe that you should not put money into something that you do not understand, so I am here to teach you everything you need to know about it. Upon completion of my course, you should be able to confidently answer the question everyone is asking right now… should I buy Bitcoin?\nIn addition to investing, the tech side of Bitcoin is fascinating! In the course I included several deep dives into the technology behind bitcoin and how it works. If you're a nerd like me you'll love seeing behind the curtain.\nIn this course I will do a deep dive on Bitcoin and teach you everything you need to know, including:\nWhat is Bitcoin\nHow Bitcoin came to be\nWho controls Bitcoin\nHow Blockchain technology works\nHow to get started with Bitcoin\nHow mining works\nWhat a Bitcoin wallet is\nHow to buy Bitcoin\nWhere to buy Bitcoin\nHow to sell Bitcoin\nWhy Bitcoin has value\nCommon misconceptions\nTrading strategies\nAnd more!\nBesides Bitcoin, we will also touch on other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. I have also included a section where I interview some of Twitter and YouTube's top cryptocurrency experts. And as an extra bonus, there also is a section on taxes, which I know is everyone's favorite topic ;) I am no tax expert though, so I brought in a CPA to answer all of our questions on how our cryptocurrencies will be taxed, especially after the new 2018 US tax reform. Luckily taxes really are her favorite topic, so this section is definitely worth a listen.\nI honestly believe that this course has everything you need to get started with, be informed about, and have fun with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, so let's get started!",

      "description": "The collapse of TerraUSD and with that the whole Terra ecosystem comprising Luna Coins and Anchor protocol is a watershed moment in the history of digital assets. This can accelerate regulations in the sector and can significantly slow down the development of private digital assets.\n\n\nOn 9th May 2022, TerraUSD or UST the USD pegged Stablecoin the Terra ecosystem lost its peg..its price deviated significantly from 1 USD and the slide continued for next few days - the price fell to less than half a penny…the depeg of TerraUSD caused a sell-off of the sister coin LUNA too.\n\n\nA market cap of more than  40 billion USD was erased between TerraUSD and Luna Coins in just a few days. Apart from that other digital assets on the Terra platforms such as TerraKRW, Anchor Protocol, and Mirror Protocol assets …additional hundred of millions of dollars were lost if not billions more.\n\n\nNow, there are two ways to react to it - either we can say that all stablecoins or even all crypto assets are worthless or try to understand why TerraUSD and some other stablecoins failed.\n\n\nJust want to point out that even in this market turmoil many other stablecoins remained stable. That includes centralized fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC and USDT and crypto collateralized decentralized stablecoins DAI. Even sUSD i.e. Synthetix USD on the Synthetix platform seems to gain stability after negligible volatility.\n\n\nWe should also note that TerraUSD is not the first stablecoin to fail. So, why did some Stablecoins fail and others survived.\n\n\nThis course will hopefully help you understand why stablecoins fail and how robust stablecoins systems can be developed using concepts of Asset-Liability Management.\n\n\nThis is my second course on Stablecoins. The first course covers the basics of stablecoins. This course is an intermediate-level course that delves into more intricate concepts. For sake of completeness, this course includes some basic concepts on Stablecoins too.",
