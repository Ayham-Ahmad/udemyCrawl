      "description": "Mystic Flow is the final installment of The Yoga of Awakening Series by Seane Corn, a renowned yoga teacher and social activist.\nThe first Udemy course, The Yoga of Awakening by Seane Corn, includes Body-Mind and Chakra Flows. In these two programs, students practice yoga poses from the ground up, learn foundational breathing techniques, and open up the seven chakras.\nThe entire Yoga of Awakening Series goes deeper into the dimensions of yoga, offering in-depth training for discovering our vast potential for greater consciousness and connection. It's an invitation to wake up, find our voice, and create a better world for all beings, everywhere.\nAll of these practices in The Yoga of Awakening series, from Mystic Flow, Chakra Flow and Body-Mind Flow, are meant to influence and inform the other.\nNow that you have better tools for this Awakening, what do you do with the light?\nIn Mystic Flow, practitioners explore the realm of spirit. Mystic Flow calls us to connect with God, to creation, to our own divinity. “When we bring this dimension into yoga,” Seane explains, “our practice becomes an offering and an embodied prayer. We align ourselves for fulfillment, love, and service.”\nHow does the Mystic Flow course work?\nEach session begins with personal intention-setting and prayer and then progresses into movement, restoration, mindful reflection, and meditation.\nEach sequence has 4 videos in total (with options for videos with music or without)\nEach sequence has 2 audio track options: one with intensive guidance and the other for customized, self-guided practice\nIn total, there are 7 sequences that guide students from a beginner to an advanced practice:\nBeginner/Slow Sequence (30 min): Focuses on your relationship with God, or the mystery\nBeginner/Slow Sequence (30 min): Focuses on prayer\nIntermediate Flow (1 hr): Dedication to Mother Earth\nIntermediate Flow (1 hr): Dedication to someone who has inspired and influenced us to make the choices that we have made\nIntermediate Flow (1 hr): Dedication to someone in your life who needs healing\nIntermediate Flow (1 hr): Dedication to someone in your life who you hold a resentment towards\nAdvanced Flow (1.5 hrs): More complex poses, and space to create a prayer that is most meaningful to you\nThis course provides tools to cultivate awareness, open our hearts, and live a life that is more mindful and compassionate. The goal is to apply what we learn on the mat to our lives. Otherwise, as Seane says, \"Yoga without prayer is just calisthenics.\"",

      "description": "Are you ready to go on a journey of self-discovery…\n… and rid yourself of stress by releasing the tension in your connective tissue?\nJust imagine. Settling down from a stressful day and melting the tension in your body as you relax into a meditative Yin Yoga session. This easy practice is designed to invigorate your body and open it to feelings you've never experienced before. Feelings of complete relaxation.\nYin Yoga provides an opportunity to heal the mind and body by diving deep into the roots of your tension, stress and unease. What's more, it's the perfect counterpoint to an active yoga practice. Each pose is held for 3-5 minutes allowing you to target the deep connective tissue. It's great for those who live a stressful lifestyle who would like to improve flexibility, joint health, and mental focus.\nJust picture the peace of mind you'll feel as you settle into the serene, gentle and contemplative practice of Yin Yoga. It's a great way to get to the meditative roots of yogic practice. While it might not be as difficult as other forms of yoga, it offers its own unique set of challenges and rewards.\nThis course is designed for all levels including beginners, intermediate and advanced yoga practitioners. Kassandra walks you step-by-step through each of the poses. Her detailed instructions allow you to follow along without having to keep your eyes glued to the screen. You can practice at your own pace in the comfort of your home, and you'll get the feeling of being in the studio. It won't feel like you're “missing out\" on anything. You'll also find it's more time and cost effective than a regular class.\nBenefits You Can Get From This Course:\nSoften the upper body and melt the tension in your neck and shoulders by focusing on the scalene, trapezius and deltoid muscles…\nRelieve lower back pain as you open the front and back of your body through focusing on stretching the pectorals, latissimus dorsi and rhomboids…\nEliminate daily stress and emotional trauma by diving deep into your lower body and opening tight areas by doing poses that target the glutes, psoas, hamstrings and rectus femoris…\nRelax completely and deeply, and rid yourself of stress and unacknowledged emotions as you experience peace and self-reflection…\nAnd finally, bring positive changes to your mental and physical well-being.\nHere's What a Few Students Have to Say… ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ “This is an excellent course and since purchasing it, I have made it part of my daily exercise routine. I have tried different styles of yoga over the years, but I am finding that Yin yoga is best suited for me. The long extended poses work muscles and joints in a deep, yet safe fashion and allows a restorative meditation to soothe the nerves and release tension. Kassandra is a wonderful teacher. She explains the poses with a relaxing voice and says just enough. I find instructors who speak all the time quite distracting. I recommend this course highly and I expect to continue using it in the months to come.\" -- Tom Daddesio\n“Super easy to follow instruction - Great relaxing voice and music - Awesome poses that are really effective and easy to do - Duration of the videos are perfect! (In person classes here are 1hr 15 which is wayyy too long for me. I love that this is shorter.) I couldn't be happier. Thanks so much for putting this course together!!! You've done an amazing job.\" -- Max Imus ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDownloadable Content and Free Bonus Included\nEach video lesson is downloadable so you can put them on your tablet or smart phone. Watch them anywhere! What's more, you'll also receive a FREE BONUS “Yoga at Home – 100 Yoga Poses\". In this eBook you'll see illustrated pictures of Kassandra's favorite 100 yoga poses with complete instructions.\nIncluded is a Money-Back Satisfaction Guarantee. If for ANY reason you aren't satisfied within 30 days, we'll happily refund every penny. In fact, go ahead and TRY the course out right now. See for yourself. If it's not everything and more… get your money back promptly.\nThis course has already impacted many people. You don't have to be flexible or strong to receive the benefits of Yin Yoga. As long as you're willing to give it a chance and practice consistently… your life will change.\nPlease consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program. By participating in this exercise or exercise program, you agree that you do so at your own risk, are voluntarily participating in these activities, assume all risk of injury to yourself, and agree to release and discharge Yoga with Kassandra from any and all claims or causes of action, known or unknown, arising out of Yoga with Kassandra's negligence.",

Classes which include Pranayama run for about 75 minutes.\nStudents are encouraged to repeat each class twice before proceeding to the next. While the suggested frequency of practice is 4 times a week for maximum benefit, a minimum of two classes a week is recommended.\nHowever, the intensity of practice is entirely dependent upon the the practitioner. The asana are healing for body and mind only if the principle of non-violence towards one's self is adhered to. Never force the body to stretch to the point of strain, keep the breath calm and come out of a posture if tired.  Use props such as the wall, yoga blocks and belts .\nAll classes are devoid of any background music helping to create a silent focus on the breath and the postures.",

      "description": "The Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali are 196 Indian sutras (aphorisms). The Yoga Sutras were compiled prior to 400 CE by Sage Patanjali, taking materials about yoga from older traditions. The Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali was the most translated ancient Indian text in the medieval era, having been translated into about forty Indian languages and two non-Indian languages: Old Javanese and Arabic. The text fell into obscurity for nearly 700 years from the 12th to 19th century, and began to regain popularity in late 19th century due to the efforts of Swami Vivekananda, the Theosophical Society and others. It gained prominence again as a comeback classic in the 20th century.\nBefore the 20th century, history indicates the Indian yoga scene was dominated by the Bhagavad Gita, Yoga Vasistha, texts attributed to Yajnavalkya and Hiranyagarbha, as well as literature on hatha yoga, tantric yoga and pashupata yoga rather than the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali. In the 20th century the western practitioners of yoga elevated the Yoga Sutras to a status it never knew previously.\nScholars consider the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali formulations to be one of the foundations of classical Yoga philosophy of Hinduism.\nIn this course, R. Alexander Medin shares his interpretation of the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali. He translated the Sanskrit writings into Norwegian many years ago.\nYou will uncover the meanings of many Yoga principles including:\nYama\nNiyama\nAsana\nPranayama\nPratyahara\nAbhyāsa\nKleishas\nVrttis\nIshvara\nNiyamas\nAntarayas and much more...\n\nWith this new knowledge you will embark on a new voyage of discovery, discipline and connection.\nAdditionally, you will learn about Norway's number one Yoga Retreat center, how to make some delicious smoothies, and our thoughts on Love, connecting and Ashtanga Yoga.\nEnroll today.",

      "description": "I have been practicing and teaching Kundalini Yoga for over twenty years, since 2003, and have found it to be an incredible powerful tool for personal transformation.\nHowever, being from Wales (Cymru), the land of the Dragons, in Britain, my psyche resonates deeply with the language of the West, particularly of Northern Europe, and the Celtic lands, rich in lore of Wizards and Dragons.\nI have travelled all over Ancient Britain, to Sacred Sites, full of the energy of the Dragons, to film for this course, and breathe life back into the Ancient Wisdom.\nI have come to realise that our ancestors were working with the Kundalini, which they associated with the Dragon, aka the Winged Serpent.\nThey had many names for the Serpentine Life-Force Energy, such as Nwyvre, Wyvern, and in old Gaulish Wouivre, which all would seem to be related to the word 'weave'.  For it is this 'dragon-fire' that weaves the rich tapestry of the fabric of reality, the web of life, which is serpentine in nature, the Spiral of the Cosmic Serpent.\nIt is said that the Celtic warriors would raise their dragon energy before battle, by passionately engaging into an 'initiation' with a Priestess.\nThe Welsh bard, Taliesen (often conflated with Merlin) is known as the last Celtic Shaman, and it was he who wrote the famous poem 'The Spoils Of Annwn'. He speaks of King Arthur Pendragon, who is said to have travelled into the Celtic Otherworld of Annwn. There, he navigates the seven ethereal, spinning castles known as 'Caers' (or Caerau), which we can clearly compare with the seven Chakras, which is why I call them the Celtic Chakras.\nIn this revolutionary course, I weave together my expertise in Kundalini Yoga, with my extensive experience of Druidry, Shamanism, Wizardry and working with Dragons themselves.\nIn the Dragon Yoga, or Shamanic Kundalini Yoga, we use a unique combination of movement, sound, breath and the 'Dragon Gates' to wake up the inner dragon fire, and prepare you for your journey into the Otherworld.\nThen learn to find your  'Shamanic Dragon', in the Shamanic Journey Initiation, ready to ride it into the Celtic Otherworld.\nYou will then ride your dragon into a Spiral of 7 Shamanic Journeys, and visit each, and every one of the 7 Celtic Chakras (Caers).\n\nCaer Sidi - You begin your journey by entering the Magical portal of the faery-mound into the Otherworld, the realm of the Sidhe Faery Folk, to open the 'Third Eye', and 'SEE' where you are going.\nCaer Pedryvan - Then discover your roots and foundation of your inner Kingdom, the Red Castle, akin to the Base Chakra.\nCaer Vedwit - Curiously you now fly sky high, to arrive at the lofty realm of ambrosial mead and bliss (Crown Chakra) quite early in your journey!\nCaer Rigor - Discover the lost secrets of opening your Dragon Egg, to hatch your pure potential, and creativity. (Sacral Chakra)\nCaer Goludd - Release and express your Dragon Roar! This island vortex corresponds to the Throat Chakra!\nCaer Vandwy - Strength, honour and integrity are the virtues of the questing Knight here, the most noble of the Caerau, which will allow you to reclaim the lost power of Excalibur, akin to the Solar Plexus Chakra.\nCaer Ochren - You finally arrive at your Heart centre, to reclaim the wisdom of the Magic Cauldron of the Celtic Goddess of Ceridwen, the most precious gift of all. Of course, in later tellings of the mystical wisdom, this becomes known as the Holy Grail!\nTravel with me to Ancient Britain to reconnect with the timeless energy and wisdom of the Dragons in the land.\nYou won't find a course like this anywhere else, this is a powerful and potent re-imagining of the ancient Druidic wisdom of the Celts, who above all else were, Dragon Riders!\nReclaim this lost ancient memory of yourself as a Celtic Shaman and Dragon Rider.\n\nIt's time to take Yoga to the next level, back to its Shamanic origins.\n\nIt's time for you to remember your shamanic heritage, and find the truth of who you really are.\nBe brave, be bold and be true, and enrol now!\n\nUpon completion you will receive certification from both Sleeping Serpent, and Udemy",

      "description": "If you have ever tried to study the muscles and found the information to be dry and tedious with little connection to what happens on the yoga mat- then you need this course! The study of muscle FUNCTION will transform the way that you understand movement and the way that you structure your yoga classes. The information in this course will make studying the muscles an interesting and engaging process.\nThis is the 2nd in a series of 3 courses that contain the Comprehensive Anatomy module that I teach in 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training.\nThis Course is also eligible for Yoga Alliance Continuing Education Credits through the YACEP dashboard.\nI am also a CEU provider for the International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT)\n_______________________\nUpon Completion of this course you will be able to answer the following Questions:\nWhat is a Yoga Teacher’s Scope of Practice?\nWhat are the Connective Tissues of the Body?\nWhat is Fascia?\nWhat are the 3 types of muscles found in the Body?\nWhat are muscles Made of?\nHow do muscles get Stronger?\nWhat are the 5 Forms of Stretching?\nWhat are the 3 types of Muscle Contraction?\nWhat are the different forms of Range of Motion at the Joints?\nHow does Gravity impact Movement?\nHow do Muscles work together in groups?\nIs tension in the body always a bad thing?\nWhat is functional Movement?\nWhat are the “Missing Pieces” of yoga practice?\nHow can I best support my students Motor Learning?\nHow does the study of Muscle Physiology prepare me to learn the names of the muscles?\n_______________________________________________\nEach topic is explored through an educational lecture that incorporates slides and video. The concepts that were covered in the lecture are then demonstrated in a practice video where you can follow along to feel these concepts in your own body.\nOne of the greatest benefits of studying Anatomy online is that you can go back and review the topics as many times as you like. This really helps to absorb the information and to become comfortable with this new language.\nI created this course because I love teaching Yoga + Anatomy and I want other yoga teachers to have a solid understanding of the body that guides the way they teach.  When we feel confident in our knowledge that shines through to our students!\nI hope you will join me on this journey to creating a generation of confident, well-educated & effective Yoga Teachers!\n__________________________________________________\nQuestions? Contact me through Udemy & I will get back to you as soon as possible!",

      "description": "We lose strength, naturally, as we age and unfortunately, modern life is accelerating the process. We spend most of the day sitting at a desk or a computer and struggle to find the time to stay as fit and healthy as we should.\nMD, Peter Attia tells us:\n\"Virtually every injury a person has is due to an instability because we can’t hold the body in its correct place.\"\nVery few of us need to be as a strong as a powerlifter but if we don't maintain a baseline level of strength, we leave ourselves vulnerable to pain, injury, poor posture and weak bones.\nTraditional strength training at the gym is problematic for many reasons and bodyweight training is fast becoming the most popular and effective solution. If you practice yoga to build strength, you also have some additional advantages.\nThe benefits of building strength through yoga\nYoga combines strength with flexibility.\nYoga strengthens the core stabiliser muscles that support your spine.\nYoga integrates muscle groups to work together rather than focussing on muscles in isolation.\nYoga emphasises the importance of the breath in building strength.\nYoga trains balance, which is an important component of functional strength.\nYoga trains strength dynamically, in all planes of movement.\nYoga enhances body awareness.\nYoga is not demanding on the joints.\nYoga can be done anywhere with minimal equipment.\nYoga is endlessly variable, which can lead to greater compliance.\nPracticing yoga barefoot strengthens the muscles in the feet, ankles and lower legs.\nWhat you can expect from this course\nIn this 15-day online yoga course, renowned yoga instructor and founder of Yoga 15, Abi Carver teaches you the essentials of Yoga for Strength. In just 15 minutes a day over 15 days, you’ll be well on your way to increasing your muscular strength, stabilizing your joints and redefining your endurance.\nThe videos start off easy but they don't stay that way for long, so buckle up! We cycle through routines for the upper body, core and lower body, incorporating all the foundational yoga poses—including Warrior 1, Warrior 2, Reverse Warrior and Extended Side Angle.\nTestimonials on Abi's Yoga 15 “Yoga For Strength Challenge”\n“I've completed the 15-lesson program, and I loved it! A completely different exercise experience. Exactly what my body needed at this point in my life. I will continue with the lessons until I'm comfortable the basics.” Vanita Glenn-Adams\n“Es genial porque lo puedes practicar en cualquier sitio y el hecho de que sólo dure 15 minutos cada cápsula ayuda a encontrar siempre el momento. Una práctica muy dinámica con la que siempre te sientes mejor y ayuda a fortalecer tus músculos, algo muy importante dependiendo del trabajo de cada uno. Es fácil seguir los pasos que marca la instructora ¡Muy recomendable!” Judit Aranda Moreno\n“Abi's instructions are very clear and concise. Once I was a little more familiar with the poses, I could listen to the video without looking. The whole experience is very smooth, her voice, the way she teaches how to transition into different poses and how to assess them. I like how when she says, 'Relax your face,' chances are I was really scrunching up my face, and I'd have this 'How did she know!' moment :) I started with her other videos, the total body yoga series for beginners, and moved on to these. It's great slowly building up my strength and body confidence with this. Now that I've completed the course, I went from not being able to do a side plank, to being able to do harder variations of side planks. Highly, highly recommend this :)” Adelyn\n\"This is a great course! It's challenging and relaxing at the same time. I would have liked some background music but that's just me. Overall I recommend it if you're looking for a quick, engaging and strengthening yoga series!\" Mella Barnes\n\"The time duration is so good. It's perfect courses to continue practcing for a long time.\" Rajendra Prasad Neupane\n\"I enjoyed the course. I learned how to do many yoga positions to improve my flexibility.\" Maria Sanchez\n\"Short 15 mins Yoga and mostly simple postures helped me greatly to strengthen my arthritic muscles. Thank you so much. I actually enrolled myself on your other yoga 15mins challenge courses as well. This is my 2nd one. Thank you once again for the team (especially the calming voice over and the expert yoga trainer.\" Iswariya Natarajan\n\"All of her courses are just great, I did them more than once ??\" Nadine Weszelits\n\"This course is more exigent than the others but I really enjoy it. Thanks Abi! I really like the rhythm , the explanations of each exercise and how I feel when I finish each lesson :)\" Lucía Pérez De La Rubia\n\"very good, as usual\" Dominique Guenroc\n\"Great course! Thanks! Need quite a lot more practicing to master the more difficult poses. Will keep circling through this course and the other challenges as well from this series.\" Mathieu van Schaik",

The 200-Hrs sets the foundation of every Yoga Teacher and 300-Hrs will take it to the next level altogether!\nThe certification will be of 300-Hrs after completing the 300-Hrs Yoga Teacher Training.  If you have already done the 200-Hrs before, You will become 500-Hrs Yoga Teacher!\nFor a strong base as a Yoga Teacher, We would recommend opting for the 200-Hours first before going for the 300-Hours Yoga Teacher Training!",

      "description": "If you feel stiff when you wake up or struggle to manage your energy throughout the day, now is the perfect time to start focusing on your health and wellbeing, before the negative effects of modern life take their toll.\nWhen you practice yoga for a short time every day, you'll find that you can move more comfortably, that you have much more energy and no longer suffer from recurring niggling aches and pains, especially at the lower back, neck or shoulders.\nThe most effective at-home training\nI started working from home in 2009, which meant that before the popularity of at-home fitness training, I had to find a way to keep myself fit and healthy that I could stay consistent with over the long-term and that didn't require much space or equipment. Although I was already certified as an NASM Personal Trainer, I had become disillusioned with the repetitive style of training and no longer had access to a fully-equipped gym.\nFor me, yoga was the obvious solution. I started practicing yoga every day for my physical health and meditation for my sanity with online teachers. However, unfortunately, very quickly I came up against some significant road blocks.\n* Time\nI rarely, if ever, had 90 minutes to spare for a full yoga class.\n* Focus\nI couldn't find classes had a clear objective that I was guaranteed to achieve if I put in the time.\n* Spirituality\nI am a very introspective and spiritual person but it's not something I think about when I'm working out! You can find out more about more personal thoughts on this subject on my blog.\nMy solution?\nSo I did the only sensible thing. I went to Guatemala to take my first Yoga Alliance 200-Hour Teacher Training certificate and designed my own, comprehensive yoga program!\nThe birth of Yoga 15\nI broke the discipline of yoga into 5 core skills—Flexibility, Strength, Mobility, Relaxation and Balance. And then created a system that works you through each of these areas systematically, all the time increasing your level of ability and expertise. I cut the time needed to practice down to 15 minutes, which is the MED (minimum effective dose)—giving you just enough time to warm up, stretch out and cool down. And decided to focus on achieving just one skill or objective in each session. (eg. to improve my hamstrings flexibility, opening up my hips or building core strength).\n5 years later and these are still the only sequences that I need to keep me performing at the top of my game.\n15 Minutes x 15-Day Total Yoga Challenge\nIn this 15-day online yoga course, I lead you through a total yoga challenge that takes just 15 minutes a day. We cycle through each of the 5 different Yoga 15 skills—strength, flexibility, relaxation, balance, and mobility—practicing 5 sequences for each. The videos become increasingly more difficult as you progress through the challenge, as your abilities incrementally improve. Unlike other yoga programs, this course is designed to be highly effective and super efficient. It is part 1 of a 6-part series that you can repeat as many times as you like—learning something new each time you practice the sequence.\nWhy practice yoga?\nGain a better understanding of your body.\nImprove your flexibility.\nIncrease your range of motion.\nStrengthen your entire body, especially your core.\nSleep better.\nImprove your coordination.\nLearn how to breathe better and more effectively.\nEliminate aches and pains.\nAlleviate post-workout soreness.\nReduce your injuries.\nStart each day on the right foot—alert, centred and in the zone.\nWhat you can expect\n15 unique sequences taught by a world-class yoga instructor with an in-depth experience of yoga and your body.\n15 beautifully-designed, downloadable handouts.\nA definitive step-by-step guide to creating your perfect yoga environment.\nAn extensive pose library with highly-detailed tutorials.\nTestimonials for Abi's \"15 Minutes x 15-Day Total Yoga Challenge\"\n“Fantastic course. Bitesize 15-minute yoga. I have done it daily for weeks now and I feel a huge benefit” Anna Davey\n“I keep rotating among 6 of Abi's 5x15 series and obviously am a fan. Excellent in all respects.” Randolph Harper\n“It is a real treasure and a gift this course. Abi is an instructor who transmits balance, serenity and focus. I am very happy and grateful for it.” Claus Charley\n“This is amazing course, made me practise yoga consistently in lockdown era. Some balancing poses are super hard, I am nearing the end of 15 days now, I am going to redo the whole course again because there is a huge margin to improve. Thanks to everyone involved.” Bharat\n“I woke up with stiffness and this class help me to relieve the stress my body was in.\" Margaret Duran\n“Was a beginner and this allowed me to do yoga comfortably in my own home and build up slowly. Will continue to use regularly.” Kristina DM\n“It is one of the best yoga course. The duration is very good with the well-managed course.” Rajendra Prasad Neupane\n“Course is really good..Step by Step Progression is helpful for beginners.\" Swapnil Jain\n“Perfect length of time and level of effort to give me a boost at the beginning or middle of my day!” Terry Brogan\n“Good short lessons that you can fit into a busy schedule.” Schuyler Berg\n“This course is what i was looking for!! 15 min per day is a great combo, i think i will buy the others form the same author!! Good job keep doing it!” Giorgio Guidazzi\n“I think the 15-minute segments are the perfect length. Since I'm working from home these days, I can easily silence my phone and email for a bit, do some quick yoga, and then get back to work feeling refreshed.” Gabriel Jones",

      "description": "*******Over 5,000  students are enrolled in this course*******\nYoga is a whole life process. Om mantra is an extremely useful part of that process, both at practice time and right in the middle of daily life.\nOm Mantra is the very heart of Yoga. It is the centerpiece of the Yoga Sutras, the essence of the Vedas and Upanishads, and the soul of the Bhagavad Gita. Om Mantra outlines the entire schema of all levels of human consciousness, and the universal path of contemplation and meditation, leading to the realization of one’s unity (Yoga) with the one infinite, universal consciousness.\nIn this course we will thoroughly describe the symbolism of the seven levels of consciousness, and guide you through the traditional ways of practicing Om and related mantras. We will review how mantra is used as a means of purifying the mind, how it is used for meditation, and how it is used for contemplation. We will discuss how Om is at the heart of major yogic texts. We will also discuss how several other mantras rest on the foundation of Om, and expand upon its profound essence.\nOm will become a most important companion on your journey of Yoga.\n\nA Suggestion: Our descriptions of traditional Yoga tend to be thorough, broad, and deep. This can lead you to think this is complicated, and that it's going to take a great deal of study like in a college class. But the suggestion is to take it easy; watch the presentations leisurely, like you might watch a movie while sitting on a comfortable chair or couch. Just absorb it, take it in. Don't worry about memorizing. It will gently sink in, and you can practice the principles in daily life. Go back later and look again at the presentations, whether all of them or a few. Terminology, principles, and practices will gently become familiar.",

      "description": "Stress is the one of the biggest challenges that we face, both at work and in our private lives. It can manifest as depression, anxiety, anger, irritability, restlessness, feelings of overwhelm, a lack of motivation, or an inability to focus. We have difficulty sleeping or want to sleep too much. Our minds race and we find it impossible to feel at peace.\nUnfortunately, the consequences of chronic stress may be even more serious. Excessive cortisol causes damage to our bodies, we become addicted to habits that harm us and make poor decisions.\nI experienced a prolonged period of high stress that lasted over 10 years. My father died suddenly when I was 25, I was in an unhappy relationship during that time and I suffered serious eating disorders as a method of coping with the stress.\nThankfully, I can tell you that all that is in the past, in no small part because of a daily yoga practice that has been a bedrock of my life for over a decade.\nYoga For Stress Relief\n“Learn to relax. Your body is precious, as it houses your mind and spirit. Inner peace begins with a relaxed body.” Norman Vincent Peale\nIt’s very hard to think your way out of a stressful state but you can influence your physiology to alter your psychology. In yoga, when we slow down our breathing, reduce our heart rate and release tension from tight muscles, our brain perceives a reduction in the threat level and turns down the stress response. We switch from sympathetic “fight or flight” mode, to a more peaceful state of \"rest and digest\", giving us some much needed clarity and the chance for restoration.\nIn This Course\nIn this 15-day stress relief course, I'll take you through 15 sequences that combine deep, diaphragmatic breathing, long, passive stretches and body awareness techniques to trigger your relaxation response and lower your levels of stress. The poses that I have chosen are restorative and should be accessible, even to beginners. With repeated practice, we can train the body to switch more quickly and efficiently from a state of perpetual crisis into one of calm and clarity.\nOur Objectives\nTo quiet the mind.\nRelease muscular tension.\nReduce aches and pains.\nTrigger the relaxation response.\nSupport the immune system.\nHelp you to sleep.\nYour Teacher\nAbi Carver, founder and instructor of Yoga 15, is a two-time 200-Hour Yoga Alliance Certified Yoga Teacher and National Academy of Sports Medicine Certified Personal Trainer. She is trained in Hatha, Power Yoga and Zenthai Flow.\nTestimonials\n“Makes relaxation concepts, benefits and total body relaxation readily accessible. really impressed. Love it.” Brent Fleming\n“The first session delivered exactly on what it promised. My mind and body feel very relaxed. I look forward to the next session.” Florencio Garcia\n“Just brilliant!” Anna Davey\n\"I keep rotating among 6 of Abi's 5x15 series and obviously am a fan. Excellent in all respects.\" Randolph Harper\n\"It is a real treasure and a gift this course. Abi is an instructor who transmits balance, serenity and focus. I am very happy and grateful for it.\" Claus Chargoy\n\"Very clear and well done.\" Camille Wei's\n\"Very different from the other courses I've done so far in that it is very calm and relaxing (which is what it's supposed to be!). I would recommend taking this course in the evenings before bed, or (if possible) mid-day to relief stress and calm down. I can also see this one being a good supplement to the other available courses.\" Anna-Sofia Myszka",

      "description": "Attention weightlifters and athletes…\n\nDo you have any nagging aches and pains in your body after a day of lifting?\nYou know… the ones you get from repeating the same movements over and over. Lifting patterns that leave you sore. If you want your training to be sustainable in the long run, cross training with yoga is a must.\nLifters tend to deal with muscle soreness in a few areas of the body: the chest, shoulders, hips, hamstrings, quads, and calves. How would it feel to finally have an option that allows your body to recover and get your muscles primed for another day of activity and lifting? … That reduces the muscle aches and relaxes your entire body?\nYoga for Weightlifters was designed with these things in mind. Not only will it help you become a better lifter by strengthening these muscle areas, it can also help you:\nImprove your posture and joint health…\nEliminate aches and pains from heavy lifting and repeated muscle use…\nIncrease flexibility quickly…\nFirm, tone and lengthen your muscles…\nAnd, feel more relaxed and limber.\nStart your day off right with one of the best “medicines” you'll find by integrating even just 20 minutes every day. You'll feel more energized, calm, and at peace.\nHere's What a Few Students Have to Say… ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ “Great flows for recovery and getting the muscles ready for the next day. Reduces muscle ache from squats/pulls and the classics.” -- Graeme Baird\n“It's easy to spend all of our time trying to lift more and more, without taking the time to make sure our body is in the right condition to keep doing so. Working on mobility is such an important aspect that is often over looked. This is a great way to make sure we can keep lifting to the best of our abilities! As I tend to go to the gym in the morning, this is a nice way to wind down in the evenings and set me up for the next day.” -- Richard Hart ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis Course Includes 8 Classes:\nx2 Beginner Vinyasa Flow Classes: Stretch and strengthen the key areas of your body required for proper form and alignment in weightlifting. It will help “open up” the tight areas of your body including the chest, shoulders and hips.\n\n\nx2 Intermediate Vinyasa Flow Classes: Kick it up a notch with classes that will strengthen your core while reaching deeper into your hips and hamstrings to cultivate strength. You'll also develop your balance which will allow you to develop proper alignment throughout your body.\n\n\nEnergizing Morning Yoga Class: Start your morning off right with this 45 minute practice that will energize you for the rest of the day!\nRelaxing Evening Yoga Class: Calm down after a long day or post-workout with this simple 40 minute practice to wind down and stretch.\nYin Yoga Flexibility Class: This class winds you down and helps target the deep connective tissue that will permanently increase your flexibility. That means in the gym, you will have increased range of motion and relief from the aches, pains and tightness. And improved joint health. What's more, it will enable your body to “let go” … and provide full restoration to all the stress and anxiety that gets built up every day in your life.\n\n\nPost-Workout Practice: And finally… if you'd like a quick 15 minute post-workout class to “prevent” muscle soreness… you have that option here. It's the perfect way to unwind your body after it takes a “beating” from pumping all that heavy iron.\nThis course is designed for all levels including beginners, intermediate and advanced yoga practitioners. Kassandra will walk you step-by-step through each of the poses. Her detailed instructions allow you to follow along without having to keep your eyes glued to the screen. You can practice at your own pace in the comfort of your home, and you'll get the feeling of being in the studio. It won't feel like you're “missing out” on anything. You'll also find it's more time and cost effective than a regular class.\nDownloadable Content and 5 Free Bonuses Included\nEach video lesson is downloadable so you can put them on your tablet or smart phone.

The yoga classes were hard for me at first, but I was amazed by the progress I made. I set a goal to achieve ‘full wheel pose’ by the end of the program, which I was not too sure I’d accomplish… Not only did I accomplish my goals I set, I exceeded them!Now I can walk by a mirror with pride in my body for the first time in many years. I made a ton of new friends and discovered a new passion for yoga. Thank you so much Dashama!\"\n~Chris, Alabama, USA\n\"Upon starting the 30 day challenge I thought of Yoga as an easy way to strengthen the core without high impact cardio. Incredible how wrong I was. Although it is these things I came to realize very quickly it is SO MUCH MORE! In the first month of the program I learned so much about where my body was at, where I wanted it to be, what it could and could not do, what it should be able to do, as well as why I was not feeling well. The pounds shed off of me, every day was an amazing renewal of body, mind, and spirit. I woke up feeling refreshed and excited. My body was sore one week and limber the next! Asanas that I could not conquer one day were becoming more and more a part of my every day actions. My hair began to grow out long and lush. My skin began to clear up and glow. My muscles began to tone and even my self confidence and mental well being heightened! I then began to practice mediation and yoga every day. I learned about breathing, how it starts and ends each and every day, and where it can take and keep you!”\n~Shannon, USA\n“This program has helped me to refocus and, though I wasn’t able to complete all 30 days, it made me very mindful of what was going on or why I wasn’t doing the yoga on the days that I missed. And I felt very off when I didn’t practice. The feelings that I get when I was taking the time to do yoga are addicting and I just want to keep doing the videos and keep improving!\nI’m telling everybody that will listen about what a difference it has made and send them to your website!”\n~Jessica M.

      "description": "“Mobility is the body’s own anti-ageing agent. When you bathe each joint in nutritive and lubricative flow, you revitalize.” Scott Sonnon, martial artist\nAre you ready to accelerate your yoga skills? Are you looking for a challenge and some brand new yoga sequences to master?\nIn this online yoga course, renowned yoga instructor, founder of Yoga 15, and athlete Abi Carver, takes you through a 15-day lesson plan designed to advance your yoga skills, energize your body, improve your mobility and increase your dynamic flexibility. This course is highly effective and efficient and is part 4 of a 5-part series.\nThe style of yoga taught in this course is known as vinyasa or flow and it's fairly advanced. Vinyasa is a Sanskrit term that means \"to place in a specific way\". In this series of videos we practice a number of different flows, based around the fundamental yoga poses—Warrior 1, Warrior 2, Warrior 3, Extended Side Angle and Reverse Warrior. At a fairly fast pace.\nWhat can you expect from the course?\nIn each of the sequences, I will guide you though a continuous series of poses, synchronizing breath and movement and emphasising precise transitions between postures. My method has proven to be highly effective both for my Yoga 15 students and in my own action-packed daily life. This course will become a longstanding reference for you in improving your yoga skills and feeling stellar throughout your workweek and into the weekend!\nTestimonials on Abi's \"Yoga 15 Mobility\" Course\n\"This was a good match for me and helped me to clear my mind and wake up each morning. When I started work my mind was clear and uncluttered so I could go through my daily tasks and prioritize in a calm and collective manner.\" Neil Hasegawa-Yates\n\"fantastic!! the first thing I ever do every day is my 15 min of Yoga followed by a meditation, only after that I 'start' with my day! Abi is every day more beautiful!\" Daniel J Esains\n\"I’m really in love of the way she talk. It’s great that she film the sequence and then add the voice afterwards. I feel improvements on my flexibility, balance and strength and I really like this mobility challenge. I’ll probably repeat it. Looking forward more courses, ;) thanks Abi!\" Lucía Pérez De La Rubia\n“This course has helped me with my mobility and recovering from some pain. From following this course consistently, I can also learn how to focus better.” Genieva Croley\n“GREAT!!!!” Sakshi Shokeen\n\"I like it it s short and u can easily and always find time.\" Leilaki\n\"I love this course. The mobility challenge is a great way to start my day. 've done two other courses by Abi; the strength and introduction course. Her instructions are very concise, and her self-checking tips are on point as always. I feel the difference after completing each exercise, and I see how I'm gradually progressing. I highly recommend this course to anyone who's looking to try out yoga without any of the spiritual woo-woos that some teachers may have. :)\" Adelyn\n\"Abi's 15 minute routines are perfect for those who need a quick yoga workout at the beginning of a busy day or at the end of a long one. I've tried one hour programs that seem to take up too much time in the morning and resulted in more often than not, me skipping the workout all together. Fifteen minutes is just enough to get a good stretch in to get you ready for the rest of your day.\" Scott Chin",

In Meditation, you remain in the Waking state of consciousness, and gently focus the mind, while allowing thought patterns, emotions, sensations, and images to arise and go on. However, in Yoga Nidra, you leave the Waking state, go past the Dreaming state, and go to Deep Sleep, yet remain awake. While Yoga Nidra is a state that is very relaxing, it is also used by Yogis to purify the Samskaras, the deep impressions that are the driving force behind Karma.\nIn recent years it has become common to use the term \"yoga nidra\" to mean virtually any form of relaxation practice. However, Yoga Nidra is traditionally a profoundly deep practice that is refined over an extended period of time. In this course we will review this traditional perspective and teach you to patiently allow the amazing depth to be revealed over time.\n\nYour presenter is Swami Jnaneshvara, whose famous Yoga Nidra CD has been the most popular in the world for over 15 years.",

      "description": "Yoga + Anatomy & The Body Sciences\nIf you are seeking a deeper understanding of the BODY & the relationship between the body & YOGA you have come to the right place!  This course was created for Yoga Teachers, or those going into Yoga Teacher Training, that want to have a solid foundation of knowledge in Anatomy. It is not just anatomy though, this course goes beyond naming the parts, to focus on how the body functions and how that impacts what we do in our practice.\nThis Course is eligible for Yoga Alliance Continuing Education Credits through the YACEP dashboard.\nThis is the first 10 hour course, in a multi-part series on Yoga Anatomy. In this first course, you will learn the basic language of anatomy & movement that is necessary for all future learning about the body. You will also learn about the Skeletal System, Bones, Joints & Ligaments, with special attention to how this information is applied to the way you teach yoga.\nThe Segments include:\n- Why Should Yoga Teachers Study Anatomy?\n- The 12 Body Systems\n- Anatomical Terms of Position & Relationship\n- The 3 Planes of Movement\n- The Biomechanics of Balance\n- The Language of Movement\n- The Components of the Skeletal System\n- Types of Bones\n- Classification of Joints\n- The Axial & Appendicular Skeleton\n- Surface Anatomy\n- Common Conditions of the Skeletal System\nEach topic is explored through an educational lecture that incorporates slides and video. The concepts that were covered in the lecture are then demonstrated in a practice video where you can follow along to feel these concepts in your own body. There are also segments where I use the Complete Anatomy program to give you a 3D image of the bones and joints that we are discussing. Finally, there is a practice video where we find these structures in our own body, through what is called Surface Anatomy. This is a valuable skill when looking at students in yoga poses to assess their alignment and posture.\nOne of the greatest benefits of studying Anatomy online is that you can go back and review the topics as many times as you like. This really helps to absorb the information and to become comfortable with this new language.\nI created this course because I love teaching Yoga + Anatomy and I want other yoga teachers to have a solid understanding of the body that guides the way they teach.  When we feel confident in our knowledge that shines through to our students!\nI hope you will join me on this journey to creating a generation of confident, well-educated & effective Yoga Teachers!\n_________________________________________________\nQuestions? reach out to me through Udemy & I will get back to you as soon as possible",

Fix your Posture & Change Your Life with Yoga!\n\nAnyone who sits behind a desk all day knows only too well the aches and pains that can creep into their body. Sitting for long periods of time while doing office work all day is clearly very unnatural for humans!\nAccording to the U.S Bureau of Labor, there are jobs that workers have to spent 90% of their workday sitting! Think about it! You might drive to work, sit down to work at your desk for at least 8 hours, then drive back home. And what exactly do you do there? You sit down again to eat, watch TV or read a book. Right? All this comes with some serious health risks!\n\nSitting for long periods of the day has now been equated to smoking, in terms of the damage it has to your health. Little or no physical activity, in conjunction with stress from work can literally strip years off your  life, unless necessary action is taken. Fortunately, practicing yoga  can counteract the variety of negative health effects an office job can bring. Yoga  has countless benefits for people who sit at a desk job.  Yoga can  reduce stress and tension.  It can improve your focus and concentration.   It also detoxifies and tones your muscles.  Yoga can relieve head, neck,  and back strain along with carpel tunnel syndrome and high blood  pressure.  It can improve your posture and flexibility and also improves your  outlook for a better day!\nYoga has become increasingly popular in the corporate world – and for good reasons too.  Proven to be beneficial for overall physical, mental and emotional well-being, yoga is the ideal practice for any professional in the corporate world looking to de-stress, be healthy and happy. With corporations such as Apple, Nike and Google, along with numerous companies in London incorporating yoga into the work week for their staff, it’s clear that yoga has something vital to offer to your everyday office worker.\nBe Proactive!

      "description": "The face yoga program for hormonal balance is composed of more than 21 exercises with a focus on the face, neck, and cranial areas resulting in:\n· Toning of muscles and decreasing wrinkled areas - reducing the wrinkles around the mouth, nasolabial folds, sagging cheeks, sagging jowls, double chin, eye bags, puffy eyes, forehead wrinkles, and frown lines\n· Better facial circulation and blood flow\n· Positive impact on the endocrine system and organs\nThe program is designed to slowly guide you from the simple to more complex exercises. In each session, you will get to know the benefits of the exercise we are going to learn, its connection to the glands and organs, and details that are important for the best possible performance and top results. With regular practice of this program, you will feel better, have more energy, and look younger!\nActivating facial as well as scull muscles helps tighten the muscles, increases blood flow, and brings more oxygen to the skin. Impulses of this activation are proven to affect the hypothalamus, pineal, and pituitary glands situated in our brain.\nOther exercises that activate the neck area activate thyroid and parathyroid glands. Every part of the face is also connected to a different organ. Activation of specific facial, neck, and cranial regions activates our glands.\nWith the face yoga practice, we are not only toning our muscles and reducing wrinkles but also influencing our organs and the entire hormone system. We activate our hormone system and bring it into balance!\nAll exercises are performed with the focus on deep breathing and this helps that more toxins are freed from our body.",

      "description": "This is the course you need to improve your flexibility.\nIn just 15 days, world-renowned yoga instructor and founder of Yoga 15, Abi Carver will take you through a systematic progression of videos, designed to improve your flexibility from head to toe. And it only takes 15 minutes each day!\nAbi has spent years deconstructing the practice of yoga to bring you a method that you can fit into your daily schedule. She combines the ancient wisdom of yoga with contemporary biomechanics and physiotherapy science to bring you a mind-body discipline that is designed to help you reach your mental and physical goals.\nIn each sequence, Abi guides you though a quick warm-up, a series of static and dynamic flexibility poses, and ends with a relaxing cool-down. In the first workout, we deconstruct the primary yoga poses and begin to lengthen muscles throughout the body. We then progressively work on improving the flexibility and range of motion in your calves, hamstrings, quads, hips, spine, abs, obliques, lats, shoulders and neck. This course includes all the essential yoga poses including sun salutations A and B.\nWhat you can expect:\n· Lessons taught by a world-class yoga instructor with an in-depth experience of yoga and your body.\n· 15 beautifully designed, downloadable handouts.\n· A clear and clean step-by-step guide to creating your perfect yoga environment.\n· Extensive pose library with detailed tutorials.\nTestimonials on Abi's 15-Day Yoga For Flexibility Challenge\n\"I love this class! Usually when taking online classes because I get nervous taking my eyes off the screen or closing my eyes because I'm scared I'll miss something. But the verbal instructions in this class are so clear that you can do everything without even looking at the screen. I also love the non-spiritual approach the teacher takes. Lastly, I love how each video clearly states what part of the body we'll be working on.\" Michelle Angela Santos\n“Fantastic course. Bitesize 15-minute yoga. I have done it daily for weeks now and I feel a huge benefit.” Anna Davey\n“This is a great course and Abi is a fantastic teacher. The pace is just right, and she always seems to give instruction at just the right time that I wouldn't expect from someone who's not in the room with me. For example, just when I do not realize that my jaw, shoulders, etc are tensing up in a pose, her voice will come over and say to relax them. There are always a few minutes of warm up/wind down at the end of each video, so about 10 minutes of new instruction. I like that each video focuses on a different part of the body. I found it helpful to repeat a prior day's 10 minutes in addition to the current day's video and repeated each video several times. Over the course of a month, I find myself much more flexible and eager to move on to another of her series. I know that I will continue to practice many of the postures that I found helpful in this series as I build my own routine. Thanks, Abi!” Christi Ciccolone",

This course will take what you know about human anatomy and show you exactly how that information impacts the way that you sequence a yoga class. This is where we step into the space of being an Anatomy Informed Yoga Teacher!\n\n\nThis course is structured around the 12 Major Body Systems and how Yoga interacts with them:\n- The Skeletal System\n- The Muscular System\n- The Nervous System\n- The Respiratory System\n- The Digestive System\n- The Vascular System\n- The Lymphatic System\n- The Immune System\n- The Integumentary System\n- The Reproductive System\n- The Urinary System\n- The Endocrine System\n---------------------------------------\nHere is the Structure of each module:\n\n\n1.) For each body system, I will talk about the Key Components that we can utilize on the Yoga mat. This will include postures, sequences, breathwork, and meditation techniques.\n\n\n2.) I will get on the mat and practice these techniques so that you can see how I integrate them into a yoga class.\n\n\n3.) I will give you a sample lesson plan that I created for each body system. I will talk you through why I selected each technique and sequence for that particular class theme and how it interacts with that body system.\n\n\n4.) Putting these skills into action: You will use the lesson planning template to write your own class plan. You will have my sample lesson plan and resources to pull information from to inspire your creativity as a yoga teacher!\n\n\n---------------------------------------\nIf you are a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT): Yoga Alliance Continuing Education Credits are available for this course\nIf you are a Yoga Therapist: Continuing Education Credits are available through the International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT)\n---------------------------------------\nPlease note: that this course is about the APPLICATION of previously learned Anatomy Knowledge.  This course is taught in a way that assumes you have already completed some basic training in Human Anatomy and yoga.  I will be using the language of anatomy and anatomical terminology in these lectures.  If you want to learn about the structure and function of the body systems enroll in the \"Anatomy of Yoga\" part 1 & 2.\nFor those that have completed a Yoga Teacher Training that included an Anatomy & Physiology module- this course is a great way to build on that knowledge and learn how to APPLY it to your lesson planning.\n---------------------------------------\nYoga Teacher Training: The \"Anatomy of Yoga\" Part 1, 2 & 3 combine to fulfill the 30+ hour Anatomy and Physiology module for a 200 hour Yoga Alliance certified training. These courses can be utilized in your YTT program with additional support and guidance from Laura if needed.\n---------------------------------------\nI hope you will join me on this journey to creating a generation of confident, well-educated & effective Yoga Teachers!\n_________________________________________________\nQuestions?

      "description": "FOR PARTICIPANTS:\nLooking for a safe and gentle, yet effective yoga practice that doesn't have you performing those “pretzel-like\" yoga positions? A practice where you can enjoy all the benefits of traditional yoga while being comfortably supported by a chair?\nThis Chair Yoga course has you in mind. If limited mobility or injuries are holding you back from enjoying your body to the fullest, then you owe it to yourself to give this course a try. It's an amazing way to safely stretch and strengthen your body.\nTo see if Chair Yoga is right for you, identify any of the following limitations you might have:\nLiving with chronic pain…\nLimited mobility due to illness, injury or disease…\nInflammation in the joints…\nWorking at a desk all day…\nNever done yoga before…\nAnd difficulty standing for long periods of time.\nFOR TEACHERS:\n\nIncreasingly, people are turning to yoga to help them feel comfortable in their own bodies. As a yoga instructor, you want to be able to offer clientele safe and fun modifications compared to traditional poses. This course will give you three full-length chair yoga practices, as well as a breakdown of 30 yoga poses. It's a great course for anyone looking to teach yoga to seniors or people with reduced mobility. This is not a certification course and is simply meant to be educational for yoga teachers who want to expand to new clienteles.\nIf You're Experiencing Any of These Limitations…\nChair Yoga might be the perfect practice to help you slowly develop balance and stability—while improving strength and flexibility.\nPeople with limited mobility often think yoga is not accessible to them. It absolutely can be. By moving slowly and mindfully, you can open up tight areas of your body in a safe and supportive way.\nKassandra walks you step-by-step through each of the poses. Her detailed instructions allow you to follow along without having to keep your eyes glued to the screen. You can practice at your own pace in the comfort of your home, and you'll get the feeling of being in the studio. It won't feel like you're “missing out\" on anything. You'll also find it's more time and cost effective than a regular class.\nThis Course Includes 3 Easy Classes:\nSlow Flow - Level 1: Starts off slow so you can build a strong foundation. You'll stay seated on the chair for the entire practice and focus on opening up your neck, shoulders, and hips.\nBalance & Stability - Level 2: Slightly faster paced. You'll integrate some standing poses while using the chair for balance and stability. This is the perfect class for people who are working at slowly regaining their strength and mobility back.\nQuick Energizer - All Levels: Designed to quickly give you a boost of energy through several simple poses including: twists, side bends, and forward folds. It's the perfect class to do on your lunch break at work or any time you're feeling lethargic.\nDownloadable Content and Free Bonus Included\nEach video lesson is downloadable so you can put them on your tablet or smart phone. Watch them anywhere! What's more, you'll also receive a FREE BONUS “Yoga at Home – 100 Yoga Poses\". In this eBook you'll see illustrated pictures of Kassandra's favorite 100 yoga poses with complete instructions (no chair poses in this).\nIncluded is a Money-Back Satisfaction Guarantee. If for ANY reason you aren't satisfied within 30 days, we'll happily refund every penny. In fact, go ahead and TRY the course out right now. See for yourself. If it's not everything and more… get your money back promptly.\nThis course has already impacted many people. You don't have to be flexible or strong to receive the benefits of Chair Yoga. As long as you're willing to give it a chance and practice consistently… your life will change.\nPlease consult with your physician before beginning any exercise program. By participating in this exercise or exercise program, you agree that you do so at your own risk, are voluntarily participating in these activities, assume all risk of injury to yourself, and agree to release and discharge Yoga with Kassandra from any and all claims or causes of action, known or unknown, arising out of Yoga with Kassandra's negligence.",

Remember: In order to get this additional Certificate & Badge, all you have to do is just finish the Course you've started!\nYoga for Back Pain Relief & Prevention Certification Course is THE longest Lower Back Pain Yoga Course Online!\nBack Pain Facts:\nDid you know that experts estimate that as much as 80%  of  the population will experience a back problem at some time in their lives? Think about it. That’s 8 out of every 10 people!\nAnd there’s more!\nLow back pain is considered to be the single leading cause of disability worldwide! (Source:Global Burden of Disease 2010)\nOne-half of ALL working Americans admit to having back pain symptoms each year\nAmericans spend at least $50 billion each year on back pain\n50% of all pregnant women will suffer from some kind of low back pain at some point during their pregnancies\nWelcome to Yoga for Spinal Health! LOWER BACK PAIN Course! This amazing Therapeutic Yoga Course is a Yoga Combination Program in which more than one exercises for different  body parts is recommended for addressing the area of pain. (e.g if a problem exists in the upper part, exercising the lower part is equally essential).\nFor a better student engagement and for a better learning experience, this Yoga Course comes with FULL  (NOT Auto-generated) English and Spanish (machine generated) Subtitles!\nMost Yoga programs do not properly understand back function as it relates to the rest of the body.They just recommend upper extremity exercises in the same rep and set sequence with no diversification.No back flexibility, core, or leg exercises are recommended. A balance of strength and flexibility of all the muscles around the back is essential for injury prevention. In addition, proper back function is linked to the movements of the lower extremity, the pelvis, and the trunk.

It is easy to follow and easy on the joints.\nThe focus of this program is on actual class time where we practice yoga together. So you follow along with the teacher, and we always practice both sides, where applicable. There are seven classes in total, including one class with a massage focus, and every class is between 35 and 40 minutes long. As a series they start simple and gently build in complexity and coordination, but each class is also a complete stand-alone practice in itself.\nEvery session begins and ends with a brief guided meditation to help you get centred and grounded. This in turn helps you to relax and self-regulate, resulting in less stress and anxiety.\nOnce purchased, all classes are available as downloads, meaning you can enjoy them even when you're offline, at your own convenience, at your own pace, and you can repeat them as often as you wish!\nIncluded in this course is access to a Facebook community group where you can ask questions, share your experiences, and find support.\nThis course is backed by a 30 day money-back guarantee.",

      "description": "This course, by renowned yoga instructor and spiritual leader, Seane Corn, will guide you to the deeper dimensions of yoga.\nYou’ll discover your unique and vast potential, as well as your capacity for connection, empowerment, and consciousness.\nAs you progress from a physical to an energetic practice, you’ll use yoga poses to tune into the body-mind connection within.\nIn other words, you’ll develop a yoga practice that heals you not only physically, but also emotionally and energetically.\nAlign Your Body and Chakras to Create a Strong Mind-Body Connection\nEstablish and Deepen a Yoga Practice for Body and Mind\nUnblock the Seven Chakras for Emotional and Energetic Wellness\nDevelop a Profound Connection with Your Inner Self\n\nUse Yoga to Encourage Physical, Emotional, and Energetic Healing\nSeane Corn has created this course to help you connect with your physical body before going deeper into your energetic body.\nYou’ll begin with foundational lessons in vinyasa flow yoga. As you create a foundation with this ancient practice, you’ll release tension and deepen your mind-body connection.\nOnce you learn to harmonize breathing, movement, and awareness, you’ll release stuck emotions by working with your edges. This will lead to both physical and emotional strength and wellbeing.\nAfter harnessing the benefits of a physical practice, you’ll use yoga as a gateway to your chakras (seven energy centers in the body) to energetically heal.\nContents and Overview\nYou’ll begin this course with Seane’s body-mind flow so that you can build yoga poses from the ground up. This will ensure the process will be safe and effective.\nYou’ll also master proper breathing with a lesson on ujjayi pranayama before you dive into vinyasa flow yoga and experience an all-levels practice.\nWhen ready, you’ll move onto lessons on how to further deepen your yoga experience, and you’ll also have the opportunity to move through an advanced practice.\nAfter you’ve completed the body-mind flow, you can move on to the chakra flow section of the course. At this point, you’ll be ready to go even deeper into the mind-body connection you’ve already established.\nYou’ll learn about the chakras, how they absorb and reflect information, and how they impact your health.\nWhen your seven chakras are blocked, you’ll feel unbalanced and unwell, so you’ll tackle how to open up and balance each chakra for physical and emotional wellness.\nBy the time you complete this course, you’ll have a thorough understanding of the connection between the mind and body, as well as the impact that your thoughts have upon your health.\nYou’ll realize that there’s no separation between body and mind, and you’ll know how to heal yourself by witnessing your thoughts, aligning your chakras, and allowing abundance to flow into your life.",

      "description": "Make the most of your precious time on the mat! In our time-starved lifestyle, the moments we spend in yoga practice must have the most beneficial effect possible. This essential course is designed for any level of yoga practitioner—from aspiring to experienced yogis—to learn to approach any class or practice with greater integrity, so you can gain the maximal therapeutic effect possible, no matter when, where, or how you practice.\nThe founder of Yoga Medicine, internationally acclaimed teacher Tiffany Cruikshank, L.Ac., MAOM, E-RYT, has designed this course to make the groundbreaking techniques of Yoga Medicine accessible to everyone. Yoga Medicine teachers are rigorously educated in a fusion of anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics with the traditional practice of yoga. Yoga Medicine extensively trains teachers to work with students and healthcare providers to find a yoga practice that is an appropriate therapeutic adjunct to medical care.\nAfter teaching for over two decades, training thousands of yoga teachers, presenting at conferences around the world, and working with tens of thousands of patients, Tiffany has distilled the Yoga Medicine training down to the most important factors that help everyone get the most out of their yoga practice. Sharing many of these findings for the first time, Tiffany’s course is an essential supplement for anyone who practices yoga and wants to enhance the therapeutic effects of their practice.\nIn Yoga Medicine’s teacher trainings, we pride ourselves on teaching our students the what, why, and how of the poses, so teachers can empower their students to take their practice and health into their own hands. In this course, you’ll access this teacher training directly, learning Yoga Medicine’s key insights on anatomy, physiology, and mental health that you will be able to immediately put into use. You will learn how to develop your practice with a three-dimensional approach to address the physical body, the internal organs, and the mind simultaneously, in harmony with your body’s physiological reflexes and instincts.\nThis course features five sections with 28 unique lessons. In each lesson, you will learn critical information, alignment tips, and pose modifications that help you elevate your practice in whatever time you have. By the end of this course, you will be able to confidently approach any style of yoga with greater integrity, knowing you have the skills and knowledge to get the most out of every moment on the mat.\nEach lesson will begin with a structured lecture by Tiffany, during which she will review the key points of learning and how the training will build upon itself with each section. During her lectures, Tiffany will refer to medical illustrations and notes that are provided in your handouts, to help you make connections and deepen your understanding. After each lecture, you’ll begin a thematically-linked yoga sequence, guided by Yoga Medicine’s most accomplished teachers, to help you make the embodied connection between the ideas and the practice so you can feel the core concepts of that lesson at work in your body.\nThe course flows as follows:\nSection 1: Introduction\nIntroduction (1:59)\nOverview (6:10)\nKey Preliminary Points (7:01)\nHandout for this course (Yoga-Medicine_Udemy-Handout.pdf)\nMindfulness in Action (3:44)\nSection 2: Physical Practices in Yoga\nIntroduction to Physical Practices (4:37)\nShoulder Structure (6:03)\nShoulder Anatomy (11:50)\nShoulder Therapeutic Applications (6:07)\nShoulder Asana (35:06)\nSpine Structure (9:13)\nSpine Anatomy (9:54)\nSpine Therapeutic Applications (13:01)\nSpine Asana (36:40)\nHip Structure (3:41)\nHip Anatomy (5:13)\nHip Therapeutic Applications (6:45)\nHip Asana (47:28)\nSection 3: Yoga and the Nervous System\nAnatomy of the Nervous System (10:26)\nApplication of the Nervous System to Yoga (6:04)\nPranayama Effects on the Nervous System (10:17)\nAsana Practice for the Nervous System (36:07)\nSection 4: Mindfulness in Yoga\nAnatomy of the Mind in Yoga (3:11)\nAnatomy of the Mind in Meditation (6:37)\nTraditional Yoga and the Mind (8:27)\nAsana Practice for Mindfulness (52:17)\nSection 5: Conclusion\nBringing it All Together (4:59)\nEstablishing a Regular Practice (3:47)\nRather than simply provide a set of classes for you to repeat (and become dependent upon!), this course teaches you the key biomechanical concepts needed to approach any type of practice with the maximum physiological, mental, and emotional benefit. You’ll learn about the interaction of the nervous system with the poses, and how mindfulness meditation and specific methods of breathing can help you further tap into your body’s innate rest-and-recovery response. By the end of the course, you will have learned to move your body in more specifically healing ways, in all settings, so you can experience greater integrity and therapeutic effect from any yoga practice. These individual lessons and practices will be here for your review at any time, but the intention is for this education and these core concepts to travel with you, enabling you to tap into them at will.\nPain and stress are reaching epidemic levels, affecting so many aspects of our health and well-being. The ability of yoga to combat the ravages of daily life has become essential in today’s world. But with more and more scientific research validating yoga’s therapeutic and medical applications, the more intensive healing power of yoga has become undeniable, making an individual yoga practice an indispensable tool in any complete holistic health and wellness approach. These lectures and practices help you tap directly into that therapeutic effect, pairing cutting-edge scientific findings with hands-on instruction that helps you get the most targeted positive impact possible from your yoga practice.\n(Note: This course is not a replacement for medical advice nor is it a replacement for a yoga teacher who can give personalized guidance.)\nCheck out Yoga Medicine’s Find a Teacher resource on the YogaMedicine website to locate a qualified instructor near you.",

This course comes with 11 full length sessions with me so you can put to practice immediately what you've learned.\nWe will break down and practice poses that you'll most often see in my classes and most Hatha yoga teachers' classes. We'll look at poses where the front leg is neutrally rotated in the pelvis and poses where the front leg is in external rotation. We'll also break down sun salutations (Surya Namaskar A and B) and variations. We also practice proper alignment in chatturanga, upward dog and downward dog. Inversions are discussed and practiced as well.\nOur course is structured so that you'll watch the interactive lectures first and then practice the 30-minute vinyasa flow classes. The course will take you about 8 hours to complete. I would recommend practicing one section at a time and then the practice. Each section will take 45 minutes to an hour to complete (including the practice) and I've included quiz's after each lecture to be sure the information stays with you.\nTake this course if you love yoga! I want us all to practice until we're well into our 90's, so let's make our alignment as good as it can be. This course is based on my 10 years of teaching as well as my experience as a teacher trainer. I've taught over ten 200-hour teacher training courses through YogaWorks and I'm also a teacher on the faculty of the 300-hour professional program. The YogaWorks method is the \"Gold Standard\" of teacher training, so the information you'll receive here is awesome!",

      "description": "Do you struggle with your balance? Are you looking to take your yoga to the next level? Do you want to incorporate fun and challenging, bitesize yoga sessions into your day?\nIn this 15-day online yoga course, world-renowned yoga instructor, founder of Yoga 15, and athlete Abi Carver, teaches you the poses and sequences you need to improve your balance and body awareness skills.\nIn yoga, we train balance with one-legged standing poses, arm balances and advanced twists. We hold these postures for 2-3 breaths each and sequence them together into dynamic flows. In this course, you will learn them all, so that you too can be a Balancing Master!!\nThe benefits of balance training:\nOur daily lives are increasingly complex, and training balance can help in many ways beyond the physical. Studies have shown that balance training can lead to benefits for your brain as well!\nBalance training strengthens networks in the brain that control mental efficiency, improving concentration, focus and alertness.\nEnhances coordination, body control and agility by speeding up neuromuscular communication.\nImproves the ability of the muscles to react quickly and precisely.\nImproves the integration of sensorimotor control from visual, proprioceptive, vestibular, and motor inputs.\nDemands full concentration and the dropping of extraneous thoughts, which quiets the mind.\nRequires determination and perseverance, which builds mental resilience.\nAdvantages of training balance with yoga:\nYoga offers a variety of complex movements and poses to incorporate into your balance training.\nIn yoga, we practice static-hold as well as dynamic-flow balance sequences.\nPracticing barefoot enhances the effectiveness of the mechanoreceptors in your feet. These mechanoreceptors pick up subtle sensations as your balance shifts, making your movements more accurate and precise.\nIn yoga, we practice drishti or ‘focused gaze’ in balance poses. Using the drishti, much like the breath, enhances concentration and focus.\nPracticing balancing sequences increases your confidence to try more difficult poses and take on new challenges.\nTestimonials\n“Really like this course, I can feel how I ve improved on balance! It’s not my first with Abi and I love her lessons! Totally recommend it” Lucía Pérez De La Rubia\n“Skill of the instructor, thought that went into ho to shoot the videos & the clarity of the narration are all superior to most other available yoga/Pilates courses” Murray Hofmeyr Craib\n“This was my first yoga course and Abi made the experience so delightful that I enrolled at all the other courses she delivers. I always read the handouts carefully and find them very helpful.” Khadija Jafarova\n\"Me gusto mucho, empieza fácil y le va subiendo de intensidad, en general muy muy bueno. I like it so much, In the begin it was easy, but it continues growing in difficult.\" N Cárdenas\n\"Another amazing course by Abi. Having completed the other yoga courses in the series, the balance challenge is the most difficult. I'm seeing improvements in my strength and balance as I move through the course. I can't wait to go back and restart the course to continuously push my body. Highly recommend this to beginners. I like Abi's approach to teaching yoga, with simple names for the poses and emphasis on the muscles you're working on, no frills. Keep up with the excellent, excellent work Abi!\" Adelyn\n\"This was my first yoga course and Abi made the experience so delightful that I enrolled at all the other courses she delivers. I always read the handouts carefully and find them very helpful. HOW TO CREATE A YOGA HABIT is not only about yoga but any other habit we wish to develop in us. The instructions are very clear and the pace of the lessons are just right to feel challenged and at the same time enjoy the new movements and become stronger, more flexible, and more relaxed. I've recommended it to all my friends.\" Khadija Jafarova",

This includes our private practice time, as well as when living our actions (karmas) in the world. Thus, karma yoga is not a separate practice, but a very useful aspect of that one, whole life process of Yoga.\nThe law of Karma is a universal process, whereby causes lead to effects. This is something that all of us are already familiar with, whether or not we use the word Karma to describe it. Newton's third law of motion, that every action leads to a reaction, is an application of the law of Karma. Whether we are talking about physics or daily life in the world, it is extremely useful to understand the law and process of Karma so that we may regulate or direct the process. Then, gradually, we can come to know, in direct experience, the Joy of Being that is Beyond the Karma.\nWe can soften the impact of the playing out of our past Karmas, and can choose our own future Karma if we are willing to put in the effort to learn how to do it. This course offers both clear explanations of the traditional concepts of karma, and practical ways of living in and going beyond karma.",

      "description": "Kundalini Yoga is a highly effective yoga that transforms a person quickly and effectively. I filmed this course in 2012 before the abuse charges about Yogi Bhajan came out. I want to make it clear that I had no knowledge about the abuse by the teacher Yogi Bhajan who brought this practice to the West in 1969. I stand with the survivors of abuse and here is my statement of intention moving forward as of August 2020: Contact me for my statement (Udemy will not let me post external links).\nIn this course you will be guided by Valinda Cochella-(Viriam Kaur) MA, E-RYT an Experienced Registered Yoga Teacher (with over 20,000 hours plus 20 years teaching) certified in Kundalini and Hatha Yoga at the advanced levels.\nShe has a Master's degree in Dance/Movement Therapy from UCLA and worked as a therapist for many years.\nYou will learn simple and effective tools to practice in your daily life in as little as 30 minutes a day to transform stress, anxiety, and depression to calm, centered, peaceful feelings.\nThere are 5 Kundalini Yoga sessions in this course.  Each session is about 30 minutes. The first session starts with Kundalini Yoga Basics then progresses with more challenging poses. Kundalini Yoga is an effective system of yoga for everyone! Feel free to do the first lesson 1-3 times a week, then progress to 2nd, 3rd, 4th & 5th lessons and do the same!\nUsing breathing techniques, chanting, and simple movements you will balance your nervous system, glands and organs. This is a simple practice, not the Yoga of getting your leg behind your head!\nJoin my FREE Facebook group, Conversations with my Soul Sisters, Kundalini Yoga, Meditation and Wellness for print-outs of all the chants and daily support from members and creator of this course.\nWe are here to support YOU in your Journey to Wellness.\nWe can't wait to see the progress you will make in your home practice. We also do FREE 40 day meditation challenges together! We did 8 last year and are on our 4th this year (Quarantine year). These are 3, 6, 9, 11 minute meditations YOU CHOOSE what works for you and your life!\nSat Nam (Truth is your name)\nValinda/Viriam",

      "description": "This course teaches you the ancient Vedic science of mastering vital power, which teaches you how to consciously direct pranic energy with your mind. First you learn to expand awareness of subtle energy, then you awaken prana shakti using tantric meditation. Once the vital power is active then you learn to amplify and consciously direct it for healing, empowerment or spiritual awakening.\nWe all have a natural ability to consciously direct subtle energy with the intention of healing ourselves and others. Yogis have long known about this innate healing power within each of us, and have developed a systematized approach for learning this science.\nMany people know that yogis claim to have the power to consciously direct subtle energy, but not many people know that this is an ancient science called Prana Vidya that is still being taught and learned even today! Thanks to the information age it is now possible for you to learn these potent ancient practices yourself!\nBenefits:\nLearn to work with the nadis and chakras to consciously direct subtle energy.\nAwaken your dormant prana shakti, thus increasing your personal energy levels significantly.\nLearn to heal yourself and others with prana.\nLearn the ancient Vedic science of Prana Vidya.\nAccelerate and add a powerful boost to your body's natural healing systems.\nKill all types of viruses, bacteria and other invasive microbes.\nRevitalize various organs, glands and other systems of the body.",

We have designed these sequences to help you stretch out sore parts, strengthen weak areas and bring awareness to postural habits that might be contributing to back issues. Learn to take charge of your back health and create long-lasting change!\nYoga is a gentle practice that is ideal for maintaining back strength and flexibility. It's also one of the more effective tools for helping reduce low back pain, the most common source of pain and disability among adults.\nFor low back pain, yoga can be especially helpful to the muscles that support the back and spine, such as the specific muscles that help you bend your spine, the multifidus muscles that stabilize your vertebrae, and the transverse abdominis in the abdomen, which also helps stabilize your spine.\nThe benefits of yoga go beyond muscles. The slow movements and the continuous focus on proper breathing can improve the emotional aspect of back pain by helping to lower stress and alleviate anxiety and depression.\nThis program is also ideal for Yoga Teachers who would like to explore more about how to guide their students safely when back care issues arise. It is also ideal for those wanting to incorporate yoga safely if they are concerned about physical challenges.\nAn official school-issued certificate is optional for students using the course solely for Continuing Education purposes. This is at an additional cost of $55 USD. This course qualifies for 30 CE Credits.\n\n\nWe are a Registered & Certified Yoga School with Yoga Alliance and GOYA listed under: Your Yoga Flow or OM Yoga Flow\nPrivacy Policy: All personal information you provide to our school is used only for administering this program.

This is really an entirely different kind of workout.\n–James Bradshaw\n\nI’ve always been skeptical about yoga, mainly due to being shown as a woman’s workout (pardon me ladies), however, I got my ass kicked hahaha. Good stuff, keep it up!\n–Chevalier Bleu\n\nThis workout is the hardest of all yoga workouts I’ve ever done. This was the first time I felt my hamstrings actually burning! The instructions were awesome, too!\n–Daniel Kovacs\n\nI try to do this workout twice each week, and it’s remarkable how much my core and upper body stability have improved. I like that there is so much core worked into the usual upper body stuff.\n–Chris Lingard\n\nGreat workout, Dean. Very good for my wife and I at mid-forties and rather soft. Your workouts have been our first and favorite power yoga fitness endeavor. Your teaching is very clear especially seeing we have no yoga background. We love that you use simple to understand terms. Keep up the good work. We are telling our friends about your workouts!\n–Christopher Wheeler\n\nYeah… but how soon can I expect results?\n\nThe great thing about these workouts is that it won’t take long for you notice the difference in your body, and you’ll notice the differences everywhere, in how you feel, how you carry yourself, and how you move. You can expect these changes to happen within just days or weeks.\n\nWe created these workouts specifically to transform the way you look, too. If you do the workouts, follow the tips in the bonus materials, and put in the effort, you can expect noticeable changes within a month.\n\nHow difficult is Yoga Body?\n\nYou’re able to choose the right level for you. We’ve created 3 variations for every workout to match your fitness level. Start off with the shorter, beginner workouts, and then progress to intermediate and advanced once you’ve mastered beginner.\n\nNot only will this make you stronger, it also gives you room to grow, so you can use Yoga Body for months and months!\n\nYou also don’t have to worry about whether or not you’re flexible. We’ve carefully selected poses to ensure that you’ll be able to do each exercise, especially if you’re not very limber yet!\n\nHow much time will I need?\n\nWorkouts last as little as 20 minutes, with some of the advanced workouts reaching 40 minutes long.",

You’ll deepen your knowledge of numerous holistic therapies and learn how to follow a constitutional approach to healing, along with how to gain health benefits from your diet.\nThis course will provide you with the information you need to follow a naturopath approach to health safely and confidently. So, whether you’re completely new to holistic therapies, wanting to expand your knowledge or have studied nutrition and are looking for a way to enhance your diet with holistic therapies to improve your health further, there’s something for you here.\nAs it is a foundation course, it is an introduction to Naturopathy on a professional level as it provides important information relating to the types of qualifications achievable should you wish to continue your training to a professional level thereafter.\nThis course can also be used to help you gain further understanding of the therapies to explore for your own self-healing and well-being.\nThe body has an amazing way of healing itself and those qualified in naturopathy take a holistic approach to health considering the obstacles that prevent healing, removing them and identifying treatments that would start the healing process.\nWhere mainstream medical treatment looks at the symptoms of any condition, in naturopathy the underlying cause is important and must be established with the belief that symptoms are just manifestations of an inner imbalance. This imbalance may be due to emotional, physical or mental causes. Treatment plans are gentle and the primary role of any professional naturopath is to educate, enabling patients to take responsibility for their own health by embracing a healthier way of life.\n\n\nUsing a range of alternative methods of diagnosis, a Naturopath can often successfully pin-point a predisposition in the body, before the onset of acute disease, and treat the patient with specific therapies and changes in the patient’s lifestyle.\n\n\nThe principles of Naturopathy were first used by the Hippocratic School of Medicine in about 400 BC. The Greek philosopher Hippocrates believed in viewing the whole person in regards to finding a cause of disease, and using the laws of nature to induce cure. It was from this original school of thought that Naturopathy takes its principles.\nThe healing power of nature – nature has the innate ability to heal\nIdentify and treat the cause – there is always an underlying cause, be it physical or emotional\nDo no harm – a Naturopath will never use treatments that may create other conditions\nTreat the whole person – when preparing a treatment plan, all aspects of a person’s being are taken into consideration\nThe Naturopath as a teacher – a Naturopath empowers the patient to take responsibility for his/her own health by teaching self-care\nPrevention is better than cure – a Naturopath may remove toxic substances and situations from a patient’s lifestyle to prevent the onset of further disease.",

      "description": "*******Over 4,000  students are enrolled in this course*******\nThis course is designed to be an aid to the millions of people who have been exposed to modern yoga, which has become predominantly focused on physical postures and exercises. Our journey in this course is to introduce ways of transitioning from those approaches into the more traditional principles and practices as systematized and taught by the ancient sages of Yoga, without being opposed to what you are already doing. This is a process of blending in with your current practices, not merely replacing yours with the ours.\nWe will extensively draw upon the yogic wisdom of the Yoga Sutras, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, as well as a few of the traditional Hatha Yoga texts. We will also review some of the more modern resources and teachers, which focus on these more traditional approaches. Please note that we are not trying to recruit you into any particular tradition or lineage. We come from a specific lineage or tradition, but attempt to keep the perspective very broad, so that you can apply the principles to your own life in your own way.\nThere are three major reasons you may find this course to be useful:\nFirst: You are already practicing and/or teaching any version of modern, postural Yoga, and have come to see that there is more to Yoga than postures.. You would like to begin the process of transitioning into the traditional Yoga of the ancient sages.\nSecond: You are already practicing both modern, postural Yoga, and one of the many faces of traditional Yoga of the ancient sages. For your personal growth, you would like some added suggestions about how to expand your practices of traditional Yoga.\nThird: You would like to increasingly be able to teach or share with others (students or friends) some of the subtler, deeper, traditional perspectives of the Yoga of the sages, and help them know where to start. In this course, you will gain some tips that you can share with others.\n\n\nThe transition to traditional Yoga is an extremely exciting journey, and I hope you will enjoy being together with us.\nIn loving service,\nSwami Jnaneshvara (Swami J)",

Step by step instruction will give you confidence in your alignment and greatly enhance your knowledge of what modern day yoga poses have to offer.\nBuild a strong foundation in Yoga Asanas, increase your knowledge of healthy alignment, strength and yoga vocabulary in this course for beginners.\nIncrease flexibility and strength.\nAddress common misalignment issues\nGain better posture\nWork step be step on individual yoga postures at your own pace\nMaster Yogic breathing\nWork confidently up to a full 50 minute yoga class\nYoga is for Every-Body\nLearn the basics of a yoga practice from a 20 year veteran. Claire teaches in short form videos the essential yoga postures that bring you all the way up to building a full and satisfying yoga class.\nThe course is laid out in an intelligent and sequential manner so your body opens slowly and builds on the pose given prior as well as great detail in each video so you can avoid common alignment mistakes that hinder a yoga practice and can cause injury.\nContent Overview\nYoga is incredibly for increasing your range of motion, building strength in the entire body and decreasing common aches and pains, but without proper alignment and direction we may find that we are actually aggravating our pain rather then healing it. Claire has created 20 short detailed tutorials that show you step by step how to enter into the fundamentals poses of yoga and how to gain the most out of them no matter what stage you are in your yoga practice. Through these 20 videos she addresses common misalignment issues and gives you solutions to continue to grow in your yoga practice even if your range of motion is small and you require a lot of strength building work.\nThe videos build on each other, so if you only get to 2 or 3 in a session you will find that you can stop there and still gain a lot from only 15 or 20 mins of work that day.  Each day you can add another posture and because of the way the postures are listed, you will safely continue to build on the prior session and gain more control over your body and practice.\nOnce you have completed all of the 20 videos and have spent some time practicing with each one you will be able to move onto the 50 minute beginner flow class.  While the pace picks up here and you will feel you really got a workout you will be move from one pose to the next, knowing where you are in your body and in the practice and confidently make adjustments to suit you. You will also be able to walk into any beginner yoga class with a vast database of knowledge and the awareness of what your body needs and what it is capable of, thereby avoiding injury and progressing much quicker then those who haven't studied slowly and in depth.",

      "description": "Before you enroll, please WATCH the course video and READ the full course description.\nKnowing your anatomy and physiology is fundamental if you want to gain a deeper understanding of the body and your yoga practice.\nAnatomy refers to the structure of the body and the physical relationship between body parts. Physiology refers to the function of body parts and the functional relationships between them.\nTeaching yoga without knowing your muscles or comprehending anatomical language is like travelling without directions; you might get where you want to go, but it will likely take longer, or you could end up lost! Your anatomy and physiology is the ‘map’ of the body; if you live and breathe your anatomy and physiology, your understanding increases tremendously.\nThe most fundamental principle of anatomy is that everybody’s anatomy is different.\nFortunately, you don’t need to be an expert or a scientist to have a useful working knowledge of anatomy for yoga. You just need to be curious, interested, and willing to learn.\nThis dynamic online course will give you a good broad understanding of 4 major systems of the body:\nSkeletal system\nMuscular system\nNervous system\nConnective tissue system\nThis program is designed to be fun, interactive and educational.\nAn official school-issued certificate is optional for students using the course solely for Continuing Education purposes. This is at an additional cost of $55 USD. This course qualifies for 30 CE Credits.\n\n\nWe are a Registered & Certified Yoga School with Yoga Alliance and GOYA listed under: Your Yoga Flow or OM Yoga Flow\nPrivacy Policy: All personal information you provide to our school is used only for administering this program.
