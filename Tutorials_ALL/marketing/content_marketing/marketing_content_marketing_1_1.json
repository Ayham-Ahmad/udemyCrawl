Do you know bad copywriting when you see it, or when you write it? This course teaches you the ten most common blunders that new and amateur copywriters make.\nI’m Alan Sharpe, and I’m your instructor. I’ve been writing copy, and I’ve been teaching other folks how to write copy, since 1989. I’ve seen all of these mistakes, and I’ve even made a few of them myself.\n\nThe main benefit of taking this course is that you’ll learn how to spot the ten most common mistakes that wreck otherwise good copy. Once you learn them, you’ll avoid them.\nYou and I are going to look at 10 copy killers. Here they are:\nSlow in getting to the point\nNo single-minded proposition\nNo logical flow\nRedundancies\nGeneralities\nFeatures only\nNavel gazing\nClaims without proof\nNo offer\nNo call to action\nSome of these mistakes you already know about, and you don’t make them anymore. But a few of these blunders may have crept into your copy unawares. You’ll be glad to learn what they are, and you’ll be glad to know how to avoid ruining your copy with any of these common mistakes.\nI designed this course mainly for aspiring copywriters and new copywriters. The perfect student is someone who is new to copywriting, and who is worried about making mistakes that make them appear incompetent. But this course is also for intermediate and senior copywriters who want to make sure their copy is clear, concise, and compelling.\nYou’ll see from the course description that there are ten copywriting blunders to avoid. But there’s actually an eleventh mistake as well. And that’s the mistake of not taking this course. Despite what some people say, what you don’t know CAN hurt you. These copywriting blunders will wreck your copy, and sink your career.\nSo take this course.",

Students will develop a storyboard of the email sequence, the messaging in each email, and how it speaks to your target demographic, plan out the calls to action, create powerful subject lines, and more. This can be used by beginner to intermediate writers to create an email sequence for new customers, subscribers, or followers. You can use this email sequence technique for any product or service; you can use it to upsell customers, get them to reorder if your product is perishable, engage with your brand or company in any way you want, launch something new, and lots more.",

In an age dominated by fleeting messages and rapid information exchange, the power of well-crafted writing in marketing your brand cannot be overstated. Amidst the noise of a competitive digital landscape and the ever-expanding reach of social media, effective copywriting emerges not just as a tool but as a critical bridge to your customers' hearts and minds.\nThe Art of Invisible Persuasion\nThe essence of compelling copywriting lies in its ability to convey your message seamlessly, without the reader ever pausing to consider the mechanics behind your words. The moment a reader stumbles over clunky phrases or jarring word choices, the magic is lost. They're no longer immersed in the value you're offering; instead, they're pulled away by the friction of poor writing. Effective copywriting flows effortlessly, guiding your reader through your message with grace and ease.\nCrafting the Perfect Message\nWhat truly resonates with readers is content that respects their time and intelligence. Today's consumers are inundated with choices and distractions, making it all the more crucial that your writing cuts through the clutter with precision and simplicity. Excellence in writing is characterized by its clarity and approachability. It avoids the pitfalls of overcomplication, opting instead for a vocabulary that's rich yet accessible, devoid of the excess that muddies your message. Strip away the superfluous—every redundant phrase, every cliché, every word that dilutes your message's impact, like \"very,\" \"really,\" \"just,\" \"quite,\" and \"rather.\" In writing, as in all forms of art, substance triumphs over style. Prioritize content that delivers your message in its most potent form, ensuring it resonates deeply and elicits a powerful response from your audience.\nUnlocking the Power of Persuasion Through Masterful Copy\nImagine your copy—whether nestled within an advertisement, brochure, or the digital corridors of your website—as the unsung hero of your sales force. This silent ambassador carries the weighty task of not just capturing attention, but compelling action. It's essential that your copy not only resonates with your audience but also embodies the essence of your brand, ensuring a lasting impression in a world awash with competing narratives. The efficacy of your message in this vibrant media landscape can be the difference between captivating your audience and fading into the background.\nThe Essential Toolkit of the SEO Copywriter\nMastering the art of copywriting is just the beginning. The true craft lies in merging persuasive writing with the strategic finesse of salesmanship. Even the most eloquent prose falls short if it lacks the persuasive edge to convert readers into customers. Understanding the intricacies of business operations is equally crucial, as it informs your approach to each unique client, shaping copy that aligns with their specific goals and challenges.\nBeyond these foundational skills lies the heart of a successful copywriter: an insatiable curiosity and commitment to learning. The realm of copywriting is as much about diving deep into research as it is about crafting compelling narratives. It demands a genuine interest in unraveling the unique stories behind clients and their industries. Without this curiosity, navigating the diverse landscapes of copywriting becomes a daunting task.\nTransform Your Digital Presence with Our Comprehensive Copywriting & Content Marketing Mastery Course\nEmbark on a journey of growth and discovery the moment you enroll.

However, this perception couldn't be further from the truth. At its core, SEO is grounded in principles that are not only straightforward but also incredibly rewarding to learn. Given that a staggering 58% of all web traffic originates from Google, understanding SEO is not just beneficial—it's essential for anyone looking to make a mark in the digital space.\nIf you're under the impression that mastering the basics of SEO won't make a dent in your website's visibility, it's time to rethink. The reality is that the vast majority of website operators possess only a superficial understanding of SEO. By getting to grips with the fundamental concepts, you position yourself well ahead of the competition, paving the way for remarkable success online.\nUnlocking the Power of SEO: Why It's Your Website's Best Friend\nAmplify Your Reach: SEO is the key to unlocking a significant increase in web traffic. By optimizing your site, you're essentially rolling out the welcome mat for a steady stream of visitors.\nEnjoy Continuous Visibility: Unlike the ebb and flow of paid advertising campaigns, SEO provides a continuous stream of traffic. Once you've laid down a solid SEO foundation, your website will keep drawing in visitors, day in and day out.\nCost-Effective Growth: Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of SEO is that it leads to 'free' traffic. Unlike paid advertising channels, where every visitor comes at a price, SEO helps you attract visitors without the ongoing expense, making it an incredibly cost-effective strategy for growing your online presence.\nSEO: The Launchpad to Online Visibility\nSimply having a website does not guarantee visibility in the vast digital landscape. Before you can aim for the top rankings, search engines need to know your site exists. This initial step—getting indexed—is akin to securing your spot at the starting line. However, to truly compete and excel, embracing SEO as a continuous effort is key. A well-executed SEO strategy not only boosts your chances of leading the pack but does so by setting the foundation for sustained online success.\nProper website setup paves the way for effective SEO, transforming the complex process into a manageable and rewarding endeavor.\nContent Marketing: Your Path to Natural Engagement\nIn today's digital world, your audience craves content that adds value without feeling intrusive. Content marketing stands out as the strategy that aligns with this need, guiding businesses to attract, engage, and delight audiences in the most organic way possible. Through a meticulous process of planning, creating, distributing, and sharing content, you can connect with your target audience on a deeper level, fostering an environment of trust and value.\nEmbracing content marketing offers a multitude of benefits:\nEducate Your Audience: Offer insights about your products and services, empowering your leads and prospects with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions.\nEnhance Conversions: High-quality, relevant content leads to higher conversion rates by effectively communicating the value of your offerings.\nStrengthen Customer Relationships: By consistently providing valuable content, you build a stronger bond with your audience, enhancing loyalty and trust.\nPosition Your Brand as a Solution: Highlight how your products and services address the specific challenges faced by your audience, positioning your brand as the go-to solution.\nFoster a Community: Beyond individual transactions, content marketing helps in cultivating a vibrant community around your brand, enhancing engagement and loyalty.\nBy mastering the art of content marketing, you not only improve your brand's visibility and reach but also establish a powerful, loyal community that sees your brand as an indispensable resource.\nThe Rising Star of Digital Skill Sets: Copywriting\nIn today's dynamic digital landscape, copywriting has emerged as a pivotal skill, commanding annual salaries that can exceed $100,000 USD. Its impact spans across the board—from fledgling startups to global conglomerates, the power of persuasive writing plays a critical role in the success of any business.\nThe beauty of copywriting lies in its accessibility. Contrary to many professional skills, breaking into copywriting doesn't require formal education or a specific degree. This opens up a realm of possibilities for aspiring writers looking to carve out a career in freelance copywriting or business owners aiming to enhance their brand's messaging.\nThe Essence of Copywriting: More Than Just Words\nCopywriting is the craft of creating compelling marketing content with the goal of prompting an action—be it a purchase, a subscription, or any form of engagement. It serves as the voice of your brand, shaping how your audience perceives and interacts with your offerings.\nThis skill transcends a wide array of formats, from traditional advertisements and brochures to digital-centric web pages, social media posts, and beyond. Yet, at its core, copywriting is far more than the sum of its words. Effective copy weaves a narrative that resonates with readers, sparking emotions and aspirations that drive decision-making.\nIt's not just about selling a product or service; it's about selling an experience, an emotion, a lifestyle. In an era where digital content floods every corner of our lives, the art of crafting messages that stand out and speak directly to the heart is more valuable than ever.

These can include blog posts, pages, ebooks, infographics, videos, and more.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, content marketing is not just publishing a thin piece of content and hoping people will find it. It’s about purposefully tailoring your pages, videos, ebooks, and posts to your target audience so that they find you the inbound way rather than the outbound way.\n\n\nToday, outbound marketing strategies (or anything that interrupts your audience members) aren’t as effective at resonating with and converting audience members as they once were.\n\n\nToday, your content needs to reach your audience in a way that feels natural (a.k.a. inbound). A common way of doing this is by creating a narrative for your content — or telling a story. In doing so, your content will feel more authentic, engaging, and tailored to your audience.\n\n\nSo, what defines content marketing anyway?\n\n\nWhat is content marketing?\nContent marketing is the process of planning, creating, distributing, sharing, and publishing content via channels such as social media, blogs, websites, podcasts, apps, press releases, print publications, and more. The goal is to reach your target audience and increase brand awareness, sales, engagement, and loyalty.\n\n\nWhy is content marketing important?\nEducate your leads and prospects about the products and services you offer\nBoost conversions\nBuild relationships between your customers and business that result in increased loyalty\nShow your audience how your products and services solve their challenges\nCreate a sense of community around your brand\nNow let's look at the various types of content marketing.\nTypes of Content Marketing\nThere are many types of content marketing that you may choose to incorporate in your strategy — here are some of the most common:",

      "description": "This course is a nuts-and-bolts examination of the strategies and skills needed to present your books, articles, ideas, and/or yourself in a compelling and competitive manner to potential buyers. It centers on a standard part of any professional writing career, the Query.\nBasically, the Query is a short letter (1-2 pages) addressed to an editor, producer, or agent that tries to get them interested enough in an author’s work to read the entire project.\nThe course consists of twelve video lectures detailing how to create Queries, taught by author Stefan Petrucha based on his two decades of experience in novels and graphic novels. Ranging from two to 12 minutes, they run just under two hours and are presented in three sections:\nStory Basics\nQuery Basics\nCreating Summaries.\nStory Basics hones in on the most challenging component, Content, where the professional author must pitch the core of their work in a brief, yet captivating manner. By focusing on Story as the basic unit of human communication, students will be able to quickly understand what does and doesn’t work.\nQuery Basics describes how the Query developed, then defines and explores its five essential components: Content, Market, Bio, Availability and Project Status. A focus on marketing teaches students what buyers want, and how to give it to them.\nCreating Summaries explores how summaries evolved in different media (film, tv, publishing) and how that context effects the working writer. It then presents specific strategies for condensing story ideas, a process that can also become an effective way to reliably generate content. A final lecture concentrates on the biggest obstacle not only to creating summaries, but to good writing in general: Redundancy.\nA free PDF of the book, Writing for a Living is also included.",

      "description": "This is the only course you need to gain Instagram followers, attract collaborations from premium brands, and earn an income with your Instagram account – with as little as 1,000 followers.\nIn over 7 hours of HD video content and downloadable PDFs, we will go over exactly which strategies you need to use in order to grow and monetize your Instagram account.\n\n\nThe content of this course includes the strategies learned from running over 7,000 influencer collaborations for Enterprise level brands. You'll gain from the knowledge and experience of Head Instructor, Ryan Kucey, who has consulted thousands of influencers on how to profitably collaborate with brands on social media.\n\n\nYou will be able to download email pitching templates, media kits, terminology guides and growth hacks that you need to work with brands and get paid.\n\n\nThis is the most comprehensive course on becoming an influencer anywhere online. It's built to be timeless -- the principles you will learn apply to all brand and influencer sponsorships... now and forever!\n\n\nWith over 7 hours of video and custom resources & guides, you won’t find a more thorough and up to date course out there.\n\n\nWe cover everything you need to know to start from scratch with 0 followers to grow an account to 20k, 40k, even 100k+ followers.\n\n\nThis course is for both beginners to Instagram and advanced creators that have experience with being an influencer on Instagram.\n\n\nWe'll first start with the basics:\nChoosing your primary and secondary channels\nDiscovering your niche (& which ones make the most $$$)\nUnderstanding account insights & analytics and how to use it to increase engagement\n\n\nAfter we cover the basics, we'll cover more advanced material in our Intermediate and Advanced sections, teaching topics such as:\nScreenshares as I walk through and analyze top content creator's Instagram accounts\nHow to calculate & increase Instagram engagement rates\nHow to calculate & increase Instagram sponsorship fees you'll charge\nWhere to find paying brand sponsors (+ how to contact them)\nLearn all about Instagram pods and engagement groups\nAnd much much more!\n\n\nThis course is designed to apply to both individuals that want to grow a following for themselves, but also businesses that want to start a presence on the platform and use it to grow their brand.\n\n\nFor some, becoming an influencer on Instagram is a dream. For others, it's a reality.\nName another position where you can get paid tens of thousands of dollars, receive free products & services and travel on someone else's dime – all with only a few hours per week. It's alright, we'll wait...\n\n\nCan't think of one? That's because there isn't.\n\n\nOne of the common mistakes people make in thinking about how to become an influencer is that you need hundreds of thousands, or millions of followers to attract brands or some special, unique talent. Wrong.\n\n\nThe soon-to-be $10 billion industry is flocking towards nano and micro-influencers – commonly identified as those with between 100 - 100,000 followers... normal, everyday people. That's right, as little as a few hundred followers and a mobile phone in hand. You could sneeze and open your eyes and have an audience of that size – it's that easy.\n\n\nBut simply having enough followers doesn't guarantee your 12-month clothing brand sponsorship contract, or an all-expense paid trip to Bali to shoot content. That'd be too easy.\n\n\nThere's a not-so-clear line between someone who just happens to have followers, and one who is monetizing their account and making more than what their 9-5 pays them.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn the how-tos, tips, tricks & tools to grow a loyal, trusting following online. We'll teach the secrets of what separates influencers with 50,000 followers earning $0, and those who have 2,500 followers who are under long-term contracts and getting paid thousands to create content they love & share it with the people who admire and respect them.\n\n\nBefore you complete the 100+ lectures included in our blueprint on how to become an influencer, you'll discover the brands & influencer marketplaces so that you know exactly where to go to start leveraging your skills as a paid influencer on social media.\n\n\nWe surveyed dozens of influencers to determine what they struggle with the most. Their answer? They struggle to find brands on social media to work with. That's why we're not only providing you with all the knowledge you need to become a successful influencer, we're also showing you exactly where and how to find brands that pay you those lucrative, long-term contracts.\n\n\nAre you ready?\n\n\nCommonly Asked Questions\n\n\nDo I have to sell my soul to the influencer devil to become an influencer?\nNo. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to hold up a package of Fit Tea or wear FashionNova to become an influencer on social media.\nWithin the course, we actually teach you the opposite – you'll find out what brands and product categories to avoid and how to attract brands you have an interest in and can feel good about standing behind as an Instagram influencer and content creator.\nHave a passion for mental health? How about a collaboration with Pura Vida Bracelets, who manufacture bracelets in third-world countries – providing jobs and donating proceeds to hundreds of charities & causes? Or how about Ten Tree clothing? Their brand is built on the promise of planting 10 trees for every unit sold.\nFor every trashy Instagram brand, there's a solid brand with a drive to improve the lives of their customers and the people they impact.\nWe'll show you where to find them.\nWhat will brands be assessing me for and how will this course help attract them?\nThe three most important aspects of a paid influencer that a brand looks for when assessing what the sponsorship rate will be (and if they're even going to approach you) is follower count, engagement rate & content quality.\nFortunately for you, you'll learn how to grow your Instagram followers with an investment of fewer than 10 minutes per day.\nWe'll show you how your current Instagram engagement rate stacks up and how you can instantly increase it for the next time you post. You'll find out which niches are most lucrative and which ones provide you with free travel opportunities. Then, you'll learn how to create expert level content that attracts premium quality brands.\nI'm really not confident or experienced in this industry – I'm too intimidated.\nBy the end of this course, you'll know all the industry terminology you need to confidently navigate your way through sponsorship deals as a social media influencer. After teaching you how to price your services, you'll be given negotiation lessons that you can instantly integrate into your arsenal to increase your rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#instagraminfluencers #becomeaninfluencer #influencermarketingcourses #influencermarketing #gainfollowers #instagramtips #instagrammer #instagramfollowers #instagramarketing #digitalmarketing #socialmediahelp #contentstrategy #socialmediatip #socialmediamarketingtips #socialmediamanager #growthhacking #socialmediatools #influencerswanted #brandambassdorswanted #microinfluencer #influenceragency #influencerstyle #influencerlife #instainfluencer #brandinfluencer #digitalinfluencer #digitalmarketingtips #socialmediaguru #socialmediamarketing\nInstagram Influencer Course 2022",

We know that to give the book a fighting chance in the Amazon Kindle marketplace that it must have a really good cover. The problem is well-designed covers are usually very expensive to create. Alternatively, many independent publishers and writers try to create the covers for themselves and, unfortunately, they possess neither the talent nor the skill to pull that off. This course aims to solve both of those problems.\nEffectively this course consists of step-by-step tutorial videos of how to emulate and/ or copycat the design elements of bona fide New York Times Bestselling book covers so they can create their own Kindle covers this way. Each template tutorial is designed to be a free standing training. Additionally, the course teaches these templates using the free online graphics creation software known as Canva.\nAdding to the value of the course we also teach how to use free public domain image websites for obtaining great looking and very professional photographs and vector graphics for use with their covers.\nUltimately, we tie the whole package together for Amazon Kindle publishers by showing them how to create ebook covers that look great using Canva and free, but high quality, graphics available on public domain stock photo sites.",

      "description": "If you want to earn a decent living as a freelance content marketing writer, you must embrace one simple, proven, and indisputable fact.\nWEALTHY CONTENT MARKETING WRITERS DON’T USE JOB BOARDS.\nContent marketing writers who earn $75,000 a year, $100,000 a year, or even $150,000 a year and more don’t use Upwork. They don’t offer their content marketing writing gigs on Fiverr, for a fiver. They don’t have a profile on Freelance dot com.\nWhy don’t wealthy content marketing writers use job boards? Three reasons. First, because the level of competition on job boards is brutal. Every job post receives proposals from dozens or even hundreds of other content marketing writers. You can’t possibly stand out amidst all that noise.\nSecond, because there’s a race to the bottom in rates. Job boards attract businesses who want to pay the lowest possible price for your content marketing writing services. On job boards, you are in direct competition with overseas freelancers who charge a fraction of what you charge. They get the gigs. You go hungry. Or, you lower your rates, YOU get the gigs, and you STILL go hungry.\nThe third reason wealthy content marketing writers don’t use job boards is simple: they are a massive waste of your life. Spend any time on Upwork, for example, and you’ll discover that you can waste an entire day responding to job posts, crafting customized proposals and pitching your services, and have nothing by the end of the day to show for it except sore fingers. I know writers who have applied to hundreds of jobs on Upwork, let me say that again, hundreds of jobs on Upwork, and they have heard absolutely nothing in response.\nIf you want to earn a decent living as a freelance content marketing writer, you must shun all the job boards, and find your writing gigs another way. That other way is what I teach you in this course.\nHi, I’m Alan Sharpe, and welcome to my course on finding content-marketing writing clients without job boards. I wrote my first piece of marketing content for pay back in 1989. Today, I make around 150 thousand dollars a year as a freelance copywriter and content marketing writer. And I don’t use a single job board, ever.\nThe secret to earning decent money as a freelance content marketing writer is to shun job boards and reach out to potential clients directly. When you land clients directly, you have less competition, you earn more, and you take control of your future.\nIn this course, I teach you where to find content marketing writing clients, including professional associations, mailing list tools, supplier directories, trade publications, trade show directories, trade associations and other uncommon but effective sources. I teach you how to find clients in all the same places where I look for prospects. I have been at this for more than 30 years, and I know all the best places to look. By the end of this course, you will, too.\nOne thing to know about this course is that I don’t tell you to look for clients in any of the usual places that so-called “experts” tell you to look. I don’t tell you talk to your family and friends, or to join Facebook groups, or to follow people on Twitter, or to attend networking events. WRONG!\nIf you want to get the same results that mediocre content marketing writers get, keep looking for clients in all the wrong places, including job boards. But if you want to earn six figures or more, do what I teach you in this course. Find your clients yourself by looking in more than a dozen uncommon, but effective places. You’ll find better clients, you’ll earn more money, and you’ll take control of your future.\nSee you soon.",

      "description": "Does it seem like every Udemy course on podcasting focuses on the wrong things?\n\nEquipment and Software, Marketing and Distribution - the science of podcasting. All good stuff, BUT . . . beware!\n\nA new website, new instagram handle, and a big Amazon cart may make you feel productive, but it won't make your podcast GOOD! After all, you do want people to actually listen to this thing right?!\n\nThe truth is the 'science' of podcasting is table stakes, expected, the lowest common denominator. If you have google, you can figure out how to technically launch a podcast, but that’s the last thing you should do – recording your voice should literally be your LAST step. Imagine building a music studio BEFORE taking singing lessons! Pretty ridiculous, right?\n\nOk enough ranting.\n\nThe Art of Podcasting is packed with real world tips and examples from my 10+ years of successful podcasting. I’ve mastered the art of keeping people’s attention. The audience's attention, the guest's attention, the host's . . :)\n\nWe focus on real tangible skills that will make you a better interviewer. Learn what I learned from the experts: I’ve been following the biggest names in podcasting and learning their unique styles my entire career. I can help you ask questions like Howard Stern, connect with guests like Oprah, and go deep without anyone noticing like Marc Maron.\n\n\nOk but who am I? Why should you care?\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to build two successful podcasts in my life. Investing in Cannabis is the leading podcast in the exploding legal industry. I grew my baby to 50k listens & $15k profit EVERY MONTH. In my 20s, I cut my teeth in San Francisco working on This Week in Startups w/ Jason Calacanis; a legendary podcast and the go-to for the biggest names in tech.\n\n\nHere’s a quick look at just some of what we cover in The Art of Podcasting:\n\nHow to build a concept authentic to you and your audience\nHow to build rapport with a guest\nHow to get guests that will grow your show\nHow to build a narrative people will remember\nHow to prepare your notes and YOURSELF for the interview\nand much much more.\nJoin us!\n\nFind your online persona and your place in the creator economy!

Are your sales not improving even though you’re publishing article after article, video after video? Assignment Selling might be the missing piece of your inbound marketing puzzle.\n\n\nWhen implemented, Assignment Selling, one of the fundamental pieces of They Ask, You Answer, puts the content you create into the hands of your sales team to help them address prospect questions, objections, and concerns head-on and close deals faster.\n\n\nFor your business, it can lead to:\n\n\nBetter informed leads: Because leads are being showed exactly what content to consume for their needs, assignment selling allows them to be better informed about your business, service, and what using it entails.\nMore effective sales conversations: Since leads are better informed, sales conversations can focus on the prospect's specific needs and issues. There's little need to go over general background information as that was covered by content shared earlier.\nFaster sales process: Less time spent on educating means the sales process can move along more quickly. In other words, deals can close faster — while leads that aren't a good fit can be disqualified faster.\n\n\nWe have helped hundreds of businesses across multiple industries improve their sales processes using Assignment Selling, and in this course, Marcus Sheridan teaches you everything you need to know to make it a success at your organization.",

      "description": "This course is about three sales techniques that will increase profits while at the same time enhance customer experience.\nThey are upselling, cross-selling, and down-selling.\nUpselling is when a sales person encourages their client to purchase the more expensive or premium version of the product they’ve selected. The sales person must reassure the client that by buying that upmarket product, they are getting better features and benefits that will enhance their experience with the product they just bought. The intelligent sales person is always pointing out how this is good for the customer. This process will increase the total value of the transaction for the seller, too.\nCross-selling is when a complimentary product is suggested to go along with the main purchase. For example, if a customer buys a smart phone, the sales person might suggest a protective case to go along with the phone. The idea is to give the customer peace of mind that their newly purchased product will be protected if the phone is dropped.\nDown-selling is about suggesting a lower-priced option when a customer is concerned about the cost of the higher-priced item. An example would be offering last years car model instead of this years.\nIn all three cases, everyone is pleased. The merchant is increasing revenue while the customer genuinely feels they are getting an enhanced experience from the transaction.\nThe term “win-win” is often thrown around a little too loosely, but in these three styles of selling, everyone walks away with something better.\nWhat upselling, cross selling and down selling is not is high pressure, brow beating, or bullying a customer into buying or up grading their purchase.\nAll customers must truly walk away feeling they made the right move for themselves while merchants upped their profits by helping their customers.",

From the Marketing Communication Mix to Marketing Communication and Relationship and Corporate Communication, this 4 Hours course is packed with information and insights.\nThis first section serves to clarify ideas about the principles of marketing communications. After exploring the scope, role, and tasks of marketing communications, ideas concerning the reconfiguration of the marketing communications mix are presented. This includes explanations about the individual tools, media, including the impact of digital media, and the many ways content is generated today.\nThe second section, the role of marketing communications within the development of buyer/seller relationships is explored from an audience perspective. The first part of the lecture considers a range of forms of communications, and the second examines a range of exchange preferences.\nThe third and final section brings these two elements together in the form of a marketing communication/relationship dynamic.

      "description": "If you want your B2B blog posts to rank high on Google, you must ensure that they are original. And for them to be original, you can’t rely only on Google for your subject matter. You must interview subject matter experts.\nAfter all, thought leadership is all about having insights, original ideas, and novel ways of seeing your marketplace. You don’t get these original insights from Google. That’s where everyone else looks. You get original insights by interviewing subject-matter experts.\nThe secret to your success is picking the right subject-matter expert and conducting an awesome interview. When you pick the right expert, and when you get them to give you original insights, you end up writing an original blog post that Google, and your customers, love.\nHi, I’m Alan Sharpe, and welcome to my course on how to Write an Original B2B Blog Post by Interviewing an Expert. I designed this course for marketers, content writers and copywriters who need to write unique blog posts that rank well in search, drive traffic, and nurture leads throughout a sales pipeline.\nIn this course, you learn how to pick your expert, prepare for your interview, pick your format, write your opening, establish context, write the body, write your conclusion, write your call to action, and optimize your post for search.\nLook over my shoulder as I start with a blank screen and write a B2B blog post from scratch, guiding you every step of the way. Learn the things you must do, the blunders you must avoid, and the best practices you must follow to make your original B2B blog post awesome, and effective.\nI have been writing blog posts since blogging became a thing, some time around the year 2003. I have been interviewing subject matter experts and turning their answers into unique blog posts for two decades. In this course, I show you all that I’ve learned the hard way, along the way.\nIf you need to write original B2B blog posts that attract website visitors, engage your buyers and position you, your company or your client as a thought leader, check out the detailed course description below.

We often doubt ourselves and our own writing skills and then we experience something that no writer would like to go through - writer's block.\nNevertheless, considering that we are living in the digital era, there are millions of resources that could be the solution to our problems and they are just a click away. Therefore, it would be a real shame if we don't take advantage of them, right?\nWell, it doesn't have to be that way. Yes, finding those resources isn't just a click away like I just mentioned if you do it all by yourself because finding quality resources take a lot of research and effort. To save your time and to contribute to the entire writing community, I have decided to create this course and share with you 50 FREE tools that will make you a better writer.\nAnd those are NOT tools that I randomly found on the internet, those are tools that I have been using through my career as a professional writer... Or better said, those are tools that made me improve my writing and become a professional writer in the first place.\nIf you are experiencing self-doubt as a writer and you want to ensure that your writing is THRIVING and SHINING then say no more, just JOIN THIS COURSE!\n\n\nRemember, you are just 50 FREE tools and other BONUS tips and resources from BECOMING THE WRITER THAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE!",

Content is the one thing that will prove the value you possess all without you saying a word.\nBut it takes months and even years to master content creation. You have to spend thousands of dollars to hire a content management team or an agency to do it for you. Or spend months and years creating your own content and distributing it anywhere.\nAnd that’s why most people fail.\nImagine being in a orchestra and doing all the music playing yourself for each musical instrument! There’s no way you can do everything yourself and you’ll get burnt out even more you start! Until now.\nWith the right process, you can have AI plan out your entire month of content ready to be distributed to all the social media platforms or blogs and website you want.\nWith the right framework, you can have AI create each and every post in seconds all written with the expertise of someone who spent their entire life mastering it.\nAnd with the right prompt, you can refine every content you create to be high engaging. Why? Because it’s created specifically for your audience and no one else.\nBeing a digital creator of the future is like being a conductor in an orchestra. You do not spend a second playing the piano yourself or blowing the flute yourself. You don’t do the work yourself but do the conducting.\nThere’s not a moment to lose. Your content should have been done yesterday and collecting you followers, leads, and sales yesterday.\nDive right in and steal my proven AI processes, framework, and prompts to get everything done in seconds.\nLet me show you the 3 biggest weakness of ChatGPT so you don’t make the same mistake as 99% of people complaining AI don’t create good content.\nLet me show you the 6 Levels of prompting so that you instantly communicate with AI better than anyone else.\nAnd let me give you the prompts to unlock the 7 superpower that AI has when it comes to creating content for you so that you will have 1000 content ideas done all before you can say “prompt engineering”.\nAre you ready to stop doing the grunt work, the boring work, the mundane work that’s preventing you from being heard and seen by your ideal audience and customers?\nIt’s time to turn you into a content generating machine so you can focus on the creative things that you love to do and leave the heavy lifting to AI.\nYour conductor chair is waiting for you.\nAre you ready?\nJump in and let’s get started.",

      "description": "The AI wave is already here, and it’s replacing millions of jobs.\nYou are here because you want to create stunning images with Midjourney in seconds.\nBut why is it so hard to use Midjourney?\nDid you know artists and designers are usually better at Ai image creation than most people? And it sucks because it takes years to master this skill. To know what styles to use, what design to use, and what prompts to use. Guess what? I’m going to give you everything they have so that you can implement\nthe secrets from the top Midjourney users so that you’ll have the prompts, the strategy and the examples to get your images done for your project in seconds.\nWhy is it so important that you get good at using Midjourney?\nBecause unless you are making tons of money, stock photography can get really expressive.\nI was paying for Gettys images, Shutterstock, istock, Adobe stock, just to name a few, and it cost me over $750 a month, that’s $9000 a year, and over $90,000 over 10 years before using AI. I nearly went broke.\nAnd if you are using only stock images, it may also lead to legal issues. In fact, Getty Images, the parent company of Shutterstock and iStock makes a lot of money just going after people using their images without permission. They send demand letters seeking payments of at least $5000 to drop legal action.\nI also will never forget the time that I used a stock photo for one of my clients only to have the client complained that he ran into another ad that was using the same image. Imagine my embarrassment!\nThis will never happen when using Midjoureny because the AI Images created have never been seen before. You can incorporate, specific colors, logos, brandling elements, with endless creative freedom using styles and themes, ranging from photo realistic to abstract and from modern to classic.\nFor your website, your social media, advertising, or packaging, and I’ll give you the prompts, the strategies, the examples to not only keep your quality consistent, but to produce them very, very quickly.\nThis course is designed for everyone with no prior knowledge required. So, whether you’re a newbie, a beginner, or a season pro, here’s what you can expect.\nIf you’re afraid of complex prompts, don’t worry, we’ll break it down and give you everything you need to create amazing images in seconds.\nRelaxed vs fast hours, basic prompting, upscaling, variation, redo, weighted prompts, prompting with images, style, themes, artists, perspectives, parameters, aspect ratios, chaos, seeds, stylize, and quality.\nAre you ready to not just learn but master, not just master but finally get that image you want for your project done and receiving likes, comments, shares, and sales?\nThen jump in and let’s start your AI Image adventure right now. I’ll see you inside.",

      "description": "Go from a complete beginner with no experience, to a highly-paid premium freelance blogger. In this course, I’ll take you through every step and help you work your way up to the top of the pyramid.\nGet paid hundreds of dollars for a single blog post that you can write from anywhere in the world.\nLearn what freelance blogging is all about and why businesses will pay you to write blog posts for them.\nFind your niche as a blogger and set up your portfolio website.\nLearn how to find work as a freelance blogger and work your way up from unpaid to highly paid.\nAttract the best companies in your niche\nLearn how to continuously increase prices to $200, $300, $400, or even more, for a single post.\nA new career and a rich, location-independent life awaits you.\nThere's a revolution happening in the marketing world, and content marketing, the form of marketing where businesses attract customers with content, is fast becoming the most popular form of marketing. Every day, more companies are starting blogs to produce interesting content that will bring them readers, subscribers, and, ultimately, customers.\nIn fact, businesses spend 30% of their marketing budget on producing blog content. Where does that money go? To the people who create that content - Freelance Bloggers!\nThe best part is, there are more businesses requiring awesome content than there are freelance bloggers. That means the demand is more than the supply, so there's a huge opportunity for you to take advantage of it.\nContent and overview\nLooking to boost your income with a side job that you can do from home? Or maybe you want to quit your job and switch to something that gives you more free time and flexibility? Perhaps you want to travel the world and work from beaches.\nWhatever it is, freelance blogging is the best way to do it.\nThis course will show you, step-by-step, how to go from having no experience to getting paid premium rates as a freelance blogger. This is the exact journey I followed, starting from low rates, $30 to $40 a post, and making my way up over weeks and months, to hundreds of dollars per post.\nMany freelance bloggers get stuck right at the start, earning only $30 a post. They have to write hundreds of posts each month to make a decent living. And then they complain online about how businesses don't pay enough and that freelance blogging is tough. This in turn scares away other new freelance bloggers.\nWell, in this course I'll show you how to break out of that. I'll start you off by creating a foundation for you. These basics are important, and something that most bloggers miss.\nOnce you have that covered, we'll move on to some actual writing. I'm not going to teach you grammar, sentence structure or how to write. I will teach you how to construct a good blog post, and get you in the habit of writing posts for business blogs.\nThen, we get to the fun part. You'll start earning some actual money. I'll show you how I started and, if you want some quick and easy cash, you can also start with earning $30-$40 a post.\nBut it's important not to get stuck there like everyone else. I'll quickly show you how to move up the ladder, entering a medium income level, and earning anywhere between $50 to $200 per post.\nI'll give you all the tools you need to get your way up to $200 per post, including lists of blogs that pay well, and word-for-word scripts and templates I use to pitch to businesses and offer my services as a blogger.\nIt might take you weeks, even months, to get to the stage where you're earning $200 per post but, when you get there, you'll join the ranks of premium bloggers like me. After that, I'll show you how to go higher. I'll help you find the blogs that are willing to pay $300, $400, and more per post, and I'll teach you how to price yourself to earn more and more.\nBy the end of the course, your journey will only be just beginning. As a premium freelance blogger, there are a number of new career paths open to you. You could keep traveling the world, earning thousands of dollars a month writing from anywhere, or you could join a company as a content marketer, like I did. The choice is yours, and I'll show you what options you have.\nNow, this course is not meant to be finished in one sitting, or one day, or one week, or even one month. It's long, with 46 lectures and hours of video content, along with worksheets and assignments. But, I guarantee you, you'll be earning money within the first few weeks if you do it right.\nI'm so confident about that, that I will return the money you paid for this course if you haven't already earned it from freelance blogging within the first 60 days.\nSo, the only question is, are you ready to start a new journey in your life? It doesn't matter how old you are, where you're from, whether you have a degree or what you do professionally. I guarantee that ANYONE can benefit from this course as long as they are willing to put in the time and effort.\nThere is no better time to become a freelance blogger than now. Your road to financial freedom is only a click away, so start now and don't look back!",

      "description": "Thoroughly revised in September 2021!\nIf you’re a blogger, author or online publisher looking for a competitive edge, consider reliability and accuracy.\nIt takes just a little bit of consistent effort to achieve writing that readers can enjoy and fans recommend without hesitation, because you’ve cleared it of careless bloopers and mortifying blunders. With a simple fact checking routine, you’re elevated to a higher echelon of writers.\nInstructor Marcia Yudkin has been a published author for more than 30 years. She has written for national magazines like the New York Times Magazine, Ladies Home Journal and TWA Ambassador, for big-name publishers like HarperCollins and Penguin and for National Public Radio.\nShe created the course because she witnessed how humiliating it can be when readers and important industry contacts catch a blogger or author making dumb mistakes, like putting Sydney in Austria rather than Australia or mixing up sudoku (the number game) and seppuku (ritual suicide).\n“Fact Checking Made Easy” consists of 13 practical lessons totaling more than an hour and a half of video instruction. At its heart are three complete now-you-try-it exercises (and another partial one) where you give fact checking a go and then compare your findings with Marcia’s answers and analysis. It’s hand-on learning at its best.\nBesides the video lessons and exercises, you have access to full written transcripts of the lessons, along with several handouts that make the learning process more convenient.\nAmong the points you learn in this course:\n* How to create a fact-checking routine that catches errors and inconsistencies\n* Where and how to check various kinds of facts - including an amazingly helpful, taxpayer-funded free research resource\n* The difference between opinions that don’t warrant a fact check and statements that do\n* Pitfalls in getting names and numbers correct\n* The importance of recognizing and discounting biased or outdated sources of information\n* How not to fall for and pass along hoaxes, baseless rumors and myths that have already gone around the Internet thirty thousand times\n* The kinds of mistakes that run the greatest risk of landing you in legal trouble, and how to avoid those\n* The best way to handle it if an error does nevertheless slip by you\nWhether you write a blog, a newsletter, a book or ebook or simply private emails to potential joint-venture partners, avoid loss of face, build credibility and be a writer that people praise, instead of pointing out your should-have-known-that errors.\nIt’s fun, it’s practical, it’s important - and you get lifetime access to the course once you enroll.\nSo sign up for “Fact Checking Made Easy” today!",

Our course offers practical examples that you can customize to fit your unique requirements. Sit back and prepare to apply the comprehensive copywriting knowledge you've acquired, from sales pages to video scripts, blog post headlines, meta descriptions, email campaigns, and social media content.\nCraft Copy That Connects and Converts\nUnderstanding how to create impactful copy is pivotal for enhancing your marketing campaigns. When done right, good copywriting not only increases conversion rates but also improves the structure of your blogs, boosts social media engagement, and encourages wider content sharing. But the cornerstone of effective copy is a deep understanding of your audience.\nKnow Your Audience, Amplify Your Message\nTo craft copy that resonates, you must first intimately know your audience—their motivations, aspirations, fears, and desires. This course equips you with the tools to gain these insights, enabling you to write in a way that speaks directly to your target audience. By mastering this, you'll make your content significantly more effective, encouraging your audience to take desired actions effortlessly.\nA Marketable Skill with Broad Applications\nGood copywriting is more than a marketing tactic; it's a crucial skill set that boosts your marketability. In fact, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 73% of employers prioritize hiring individuals with strong writing abilities. By honing your copywriting skills, you not only enhance your digital marketing campaigns but also open doors to new career opportunities, ensuring your professional growth and success in an increasingly digital world.\nCapturing Maximum Engagement Right from the Start\nTo achieve the highest click-through rates, your headlines must resonate deeply with your audience, sparking intense emotion or curiosity. The most effective headlines are concise yet powerful, crafted to instantly grab attention. Using numbers can significantly enhance the specificity and appeal of your headlines, such as \"10 Unbeatable Tips to Sculpt Your Body\" or \"5 Expert Strategies to Safeguard Your Online Privacy.\" However, ensure your headlines accurately reflect your content to maintain trust and credibility with your audience.\nEmbrace the Power of Emotion in Your Copy\nWhile facts and statistics are crucial for establishing trust and authority, overreliance on them can lead to disengagement. Your copy must breathe with relatability and humanity. Infusing your content with emotion, through the use of impactful language and relatable anecdotes, allows your audience to see themselves in your narrative. Adding a personal touch or a dash of humor can significantly enhance the connection with your readers, setting you apart from content creators who strictly adhere to facts.\nPinpoint and Address Your Audience's Pain Points\nUnderstanding and addressing the specific challenges and concerns of your audience is key to effective marketing. These pain points are the hurdles your audience encounters and seeks solutions for. Conduct thorough market research to uncover these issues within your target demographic, focusing on their fears, desires, and needs. Remember, market research can be as unconventional as observing discussions on platforms like Reddit to gain insights into what truly matters to your potential customers.\nBy emphasizing these pain points and subtly suggesting that your product or service offers the solution, you create a compelling narrative that encourages immediate action. Highlighting the urgency of addressing these issues not only underscores the value of your solution but also motivates your audience to act swiftly to alleviate their concerns.\nMastering the Art of Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\nUnlock the secrets of SEO, the strategic practice essential for directing targeted traffic to your website via search engines. This course demystifies the process, teaching you to craft valuable content, secure authoritative backlinks, and strategically incorporate keywords that resonate with your target audience. Recognize that SEO isn't a one-size-fits-all strategy; success demands a tailored approach, focusing on organic search results to maximize your digital footprint.\nAdapting to Search Engines' Ever-Evolving Algorithms\nUnderstand that each search engine employs unique algorithms aimed at delivering the most relevant search results. Your mission is to ensure your site ranks as the optimal match. This involves a deep dive into the multifaceted criteria search engines consider, such as content quality, backlink integrity, site traffic, and the technical performance of your website.\nThe Complexity of Modern SEO\nGone are the days when simple meta tag adjustments sufficed. Today's SEO landscape requires a comprehensive understanding of advanced elements like rich snippets, video SEO, and the pivotal role of voice search. You'll learn how Google's RankBrain affects your site's ranking and how to optimize your content to align with Google's intricate algorithms.\nThe Rising Importance of Local SEO\nWith nearly half of all Google searches displaying local intent, mastering Local SEO has never been more crucial. This course covers the explosion of \"Near Me\" searches and how you can capitalize on this trend to significantly boost your visibility.\nThe Technical Foundations of SEO\nTechnical SEO lays the groundwork for search engines to effortlessly access, crawl, and index your site. Neglecting this critical aspect could severely impact your search ranking. Our course ensures you grasp the nuances of Technical SEO, preparing your site for optimal search engine interaction and visibility.\nThe Growing Demand for SEO Expertise\nAs the digital content landscape expands, the demand for professionals skilled in SEO and copywriting has surged. Brands seek content that not only engages but also performs seamlessly in search results.

      "description": "If you are not seeing the email channel as a money making machine, you have the wrong strategy ~ Hans Smellinckx\nA recent study conducted by the The Radicati Group, a technology research firm, shows that there are 3.9 BILLION accounts. They predict that this number wlll grow to 4.9 BILLION by 2017.\nThey say email is the Jason Bourne of online apps: somebody's always trying to kill it. It can't be done. So it's safe it assure we still have email marketing for a long time.\nList building is probably the fastest and most secure method of creating a stable source of recurring income.\nMy name is Max and I'm a list builder. I've been collecting email addresses since 2009. I've always known about the relevance of owning your own list and the window of possibilities that opened when you start building yours, but It wasn't until I got the chance to see email marketing from the inside that I decided to do something about it.\nFor 3 years I worked as the educational content publisher and support team manager of an email service provider (ESP) in the Netherlands called INinbox. Once of the benefits of working there is getting an unlimited account, with unlimited subscriber and unlimited emails with no costs associated. I've been building my lists with that account, and up until this date I have over 85.000 subscribers combined.\nWorking at an ESP, and building my own lists has given me a lot of insight into the rightful practices of email marketing. What tools to use, what emails to send, where to publish your forms, how to drive in traffic, how to maximize open rates and a lot of other questions have been answered along the hand of years of experience.\nI'm now one of the teachers and co-founders of iMarketXL, an education brand focused on providing our students the essential skills needed to build an entire online business from scratch.\nIn our latest addition to our teaching palette, list building is going to provide you with all the tools, resources and strategies needed to start building your own lists in a unique and comprehensive 3 phase process in which you will see me build yet another list of subscribers from scratch.\nEvery day in which you're not building you list is a wasted one.

Nick’s delivery is exceptional with an easy to listen to voice and helpful tone. His knowledge and experience comes through at the outset creating a reassuring environment from which to learn and process the material.

      "description": "If you are a B2B content writer or B2B copywriter, and if you want to make your skills as valuable as possible, you should learn how to write social media posts that point readers to long-form, online assets.\nThose assets are likely going to be whitepapers, blog posts, guides and videos. The social media platform you are likely going to be writing for is LinkedIn. And the number of posts you are likely expected to write is going to be 10, 20, 30 or more.\nWhen you write effective LinkedIn posts that drive traffic to long-form assets, you improve response rates, build engagement, and generate leads.\nHi, I’m Alan Sharpe, and welcome to my course on how to Write 15 LinkedIn Posts by Extracting them from a Whitepaper. I designed this course for B2B content writers and B2B copywriters who need to master this common writing task.\nIn this course, you learn how to write more than a dozen unique posts in just 45 minutes, how to search PDF whitepapers for keywords, how to extract social media posts from a whitepaper, how to find multiple social media post ideas from just one long-form asset, and how to proofread and re-write social posts before posting.\nLook over my shoulder as I start with a blank screen and write three sets of posts for LinkedIn in under an hour, guiding you every step of the way. Learn the things you must do, the mistakes you must avoid, and the best practices you must follow to make your LinkedIn posts awesome, and effective.\nI wrote my first social media post around the time LinkedIn was founded, which is to say, 2002. I’ve been writing social media posts on and off ever since, which is over two decades. In this course, I show you all that I’ve learned the hard way, along the way.\nIf you need to find social media post ideas and topics inside whitepapers, blog posts, videos, guides and other long-form, B2B content, take this course.

However, eLearning is a world of its own and requires a lot of effort. In this course I will teach you all the best practices to succeed with online courses on Udemy: how to create quality educational content and how to sell as much as possible to increase your earnings.\nI will share with you my methodology that allows me to hold the badges \"Bestseller\" and \"Highest rated\" for most of my courses, to constantly appear of top of search results for the most important keywords, to get good ratings and reviews from students and finally, to reach a higher student engagement rate.\nWhen I first started here I went through many mistakes and lost 2 years before I understood how to optimize my courses in the best way. Thanks to this course, you'll be able to skip this self-learning process and jump directly to being productive and successful.\nIf you have any expertise to share, it's time to launch a course! In fact, we are living through a massive transfer of wealth.

And sign it for your readers? Or give it to someone in your niche, so they get to know you, like you and start trusting you through your story? It would mean BIG for you, I know!\n\nYou know you have a story.. A story that has the power to inspire many people around you.. But somewhere, deep down inside your heart, you still have these limiting beliefs because of which you haven’t give your own story enough weightage.. You might have an inspirational story of birthing your child or of transitioning your life from rags to riches, but you think you’re not the first one achieving this feat! So why bother writing a book on it, right? You might think:\nMy success happened by chance and you just got lucky.. OR\nI'M not the only one who overcame that particular hurdle in life.. So what’s the big deal for it to be written in a book about.. OR\nWho would want to read my book? Or even if they did pick it up, why would they read it? OR\nWho am I to teach them this stuff?\nOr even worse, if you are anything like I was before I published my first book, I used to believe, that successful authors were born with some special super-powers, and they had a secret code, not accessible to the common man! Hilarious, right? But really, that was my belief! Until I wrote my first book.\nAnd as if all these beliefs were not enough, your mind tries to logic it out, saying things like:\nIt’s too many words to write to make up a book (Forgetting the fact that you very comfortably speak more than a book’s worth of words in 1-2 days alone!)\nI could barely write a school essay.. Writing a book is far out! OR\nNow is not the time.. I’ll definitely do this someday, though.. OR\nWriting a book takes a lot of time and I don't know if I can commit to that.\nShould I name the book or write the contents first?\nI’m too old to do it now OR\nI’m too young and no one will take me seriously OR\nI don’t have a great vocabulary OR\nI’m weak in grammar\nAnd the list is endless…\nIn this 10-day challenge, we will teach you our complete book-writing formula, with the exact steps to write your first book, which we teach our premium clients in our 90-day author program. You will be able to extract all the knowledge and experiences from your heart and mind and lay it out in the form of a well-structured book!\nAll of the above and many more queries will find a resolution in the 10-day challenge #ICanWriteABook\nYou get a daily Worksheet and a video to play with and lots of feedback, accountability and teamwork!\n\n\nIs it time you wrote your book? Or even gave it a fair chance by starting to take some inspired action around it?\nCan't wait to see your progress,\n\nCheers,\nShilpa",

      "description": "I don’t want to scare you but If you do copywriting, create content, write blogs, articles, ads, social media posts, pod casts, YouTube scripts and more by yourself and only yourself?… you are going to be in trouble.\nWhy? Because AI can do your job faster, better, and for free.\nThat’s why most people who don’t use AI correctly, will be left behind, without followers, without clients, without customers, and maybe even have their job replaced by a robot in the near future.\nAnd the interesting thing is AI will just get better and better. If you think it’s smart right now? You have not seen anything yet. So, right now, this forces you to be at a crossroads.\nYou have 2 options.\nOption 1: Continue as you are, do nothing, and get replaced by AI as companies continue to outsource their content needs to AI. Because instead of hiring 5 writers, they can hire one writer, a person who knows how to use AI to do the work of 10 or more people.\nOption 2: Adapt, learn, grow, and increase your value with AI\nAnd you have to make a decision. Because not making a decision is a decision to go with Option 1. Would you agree?\nThis means the business and industry of paid ads, SEO, content marketing strategy, email marketing, social media marketing, graphic design and more are all affected.\nBut communicating with AI, using it correctly, is not as easy as what YouTubers want you to think.\nJust remember, AI can only do what You tell it to do. It can’t come up with a high-level detailed strategy for you if you don’t know what you are doing. So, in that way, AI is no different than outsourcing or delegating something to someone in real life.\nLet me show you what that means:\nChatGPT works by recognizing patterns and context. And based on the context, it can predict “what” phrases or words come next.\nIf you I asked you to fill out these blanks. Could you?\nThe cat in the ______\nThe Little Train that ________\nGreen Eggs and __________\nAI can fill those blanks in seconds. Why? Because it was trained on all the information of the world. Past and present and if you give it context in what you want, it will do it for you in seconds.\nThis means AI is only as good as the prompts, you, the writer, the strategies, the thinker, gives it.\nThat’s why the “more clear” your thinking as to what you want AI to do, the higher quality of writing/result you’ll be able to coax out of it.\nImagine right now you were teaching a 6-year-old on how to tie their shoes.\nHow would you go about it?\nWell, you would patiently explain every step of the process\nStep 1, do this, step 2, do that. Now that you’ve done that, do step 3. And so on.\nThat’s what we are doing when we are training AI on how to write and create content for us.\nAnother way to think of chatting with AI is like telling a family member over the phone, how to cook something they don’t have the recipe for.\nWhat would you do? You’ll first tell them all the ingredients they need and how much do they need of each.\nLike 225g of butter, 200g of cane sugar, 130g of sugar, man and I thought oatmeal cookies were heathier, it has so much sugar omg!\nOkay, anyways after you make sure your family member have all the ingredients, you’ll then tell them step by step how to use the ingredients and how to combine them to get the result, which is a tasty but unhealthy cookie.\nIt’s the same thing when working with AI, we’ll first have to give AI the context of what you want it to do. Then, think about what Ingredients the AI will need to make sense of everything, and then tell it your goal. What is the end result you want?\nAnd that’s exactly what we will do in this course.\nGive you the prompts so that you can tell Ai exactly what you need\nTo get your viral content created for yourself, your business, or your clients and customers.\nSo dive right in and become a master copywriter, a master content creator, and start charging more for your services with half the work.\nSo pick an episode and let’s get started. I can’t wait to hear your success story!",

      "description": "Do you wonder why some businesses easily attract more clients, more sales and more sign-ups for their email lists ... while other businesses work just as hard and get nothing but headaches?\n\nHave you written some copy that hasn't brought you the results you hoped for?\n\nAre you getting ignored because your competitor out-performs you in marketing (even when your product is better)?\nThis course helps you create marketing materials that bring results, even if you're not a copywriter. We'll present these points in a straightforward style so you can learn quickly and easily.\n\nCopywriting can seem complicated. Professional copywriters study for a long time. In this course, I've identified the most important core concepts that copywriters use every day. I've set up the course to focus on key principles so you can get started right away. And you can follow the course in step-by-step fashion, so you implement each section before going on to the next.\nYou get 5 easy-to-follow modules. Each module includes a series of videos with specific steps. You'll get what you need - and only what you need - to elevate your marketing.\n\nWhat are the requirements?\nThis course recommends that you have a computer (or laptop, tablet) and a high-speed Internet connection.\nYou will benefit most if you have a specific project in mind, such as a website or sales letter, especially if you've started writing and you have a draft to revise.\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\nOver 12 lectures and 70 minutes of content!\nConfidence that your marketing content comes across as professional with a clear, captivating message your audience will understand.\nAn understanding of copywriting principles that often seem complex and mysterious (and specific examples of how to apply them)\nTips to create content more quickly without sacrificing quality (you'll learn why copywriters offer fast turn-around and make your offer available faster)\n\nAbility to critique your own content objectively so you'll write more purposefully and reach your goals\nBy the end of the course, you'll understand how to write copy more effectively. If you've applied what you learned as you move from module to module, you'll have a much improved piece of marketing content. You'll be far more likely to get the results you've been hoping for.\nAnd when you keep coming back to the course and reviewing what you learn, your marketing will get easier over time. You'll acquire the \"copywriting mindset\" that takes the hassle out of all your marketing.\nWho should take this course:\nAnyone who wants to create more effective marketing content without committing to becoming a copywriter.  The course is directed to business owners and most examples relate to services.",

      "description": "HIGH CONCEPT\nIf you want to snag an agent you will be miles ahead of others if you will write a great query letter for a high concept novel. In this course we will brainstorm high concepts and we will take the mystery out of writing query letters. This will help you understand what a high concept novel is and why agents and publishers are looking for them. And then it will help you to brainstorm your own high concept ideas.\nIt will force you to stretch until you've made your humdrum concept into a high-flying concept that will grab attention from the pitch. This is not a course on plotting. It is a course on pitching. It is a course that will help you with the premise of you book, not the plot. It comes before the plotting. You have to come up with a salable premise first and a killer hook. If you don't have those it doesn't matter how great your plot is--you'll have a hard time selling your book in today's busy, noisy, crowded marketplace.\nThink of it like this: The marketplace is full of a vendors, all standing in the booths. They all have flapping white canvas over their tables and  they all have grey boxes full of their wares. In those boxes are some lovely treasure. But which booth do you approach? You can't see the treasures--they all are kind of hidden away in their grey boxes.\nBut there in the middle of all the white, flapping canvas, there is  one table under a bright yellow canvas covering. The table is covered in vibrant purple cloth and the boxes that  hold the wares are lime green and  orange and shiny red.\nThe treasures in the boxes may not be better than the treasures in the grey boxes on the other  tables. But which table do you go to first? And which treasures do you pick up? And which treasures do you buy?\nThis is why you need a high concept plot that can be pitched with pizzazz. Because the marketplace is full of grey tables and white flapping canvas.\nQUERY LETTERS\nIt does little good to write high concept books if you can't write an effective query letter.In this course you will learn to write query letters that will make the agents ask to read the manuscript. The main thing? You don't need to try so hard. You don't need to put the whole book into the query letter. Just a short summary. Just enough to make the agent want more.\nWe look at short hooks in this course, too--this section is repeated from my plot course. We look at them here because they are needed for the query letters.\nIn short, this course tells you all you need to write a great query letter: you need a high concept novel, a short pitch for that novel, the ability to be friendly without being stalker-ish, and to come across as healthy and happy and a person agents would enjoy working with.",

        "You will benefit from this course if you're getting rejections that say, \"This doesn't fresh.\" Or, \"This feels like it's been done before.\"",
        "If you have an agent but haven't had any contract offers, this class will probably help you.",
        "If you are a master plotter and agents and editors are asking for full manuscripts so you know your hook and pitch are working, then this class isn't for you."

The most common mistake I have seen people doing is not following a proper roadmap.\n\n\nFollow A Roadmap\nYou see, there is a roadmap behind every successful email marketing campaign.

The investor is someone who’s trying to get an audience interested in them. They work day in and day out to make original content to create a demand for their videos.\n\n\nA good example is Mr. Beast. He keeps making original content that’s so unique that creates more and more demand for his videos.\nAnd once there’s a lot of demand, they are the only one to give away that supply for the demand. Sounds good right?\n\nAnd that’s why most youtubers fail.\n\n\nMost don’t realize that it takes years and years to build a personal brand. Build a demand for your content. And most can’t post 3 original videos per week, let alone 1 original video per week.\n\n\nThere’s going to be a lot of trail and error, a lot of time wasted, a lot of money invested to find out, Hey, no one wants to watch your videos that you pour our heart and soul into making.\n\n\nBut how did one of my clients, in less than 7 months, grew their channel to 19M views, 47,000 subscribers, and $92,000 in revenue?\n\n\nThat’s because my client chose the second pathway. The pathway of the Trader.\n\n\nThe trader’s way is someone who goes around YouTube searching for niches that have very high demand and very low supply.\n\n\nAnd once they find a niche, they’ll execute on it and create content based on what’s already proven. They don’t guess, they don’t shoot in the dark, they simply copy and model after what’s already working.\n\n\nBecause they are creating content that are in high demand, YouTube will automatically send them traffic from other channels. These channels become so successful that they can afford to hire a team of people to create the content for them. On Autopilot. That’s why it’s called YouTube automation.\n\n\nFrom Script writers, to video editors, these teams cost very little to maintain, while YouTube pays you double, triple, and even quadruple the amount you invest in your team.\n\n\nThe key difference between a trader from an investor YouTuber is that the trader already know there’s an existing market for the content they are producing and they are simply just taping into that market.\n\n\nWould you agree that the trader’s way on YouTube is faster?\n\n\nNow, being a trader is not for everyone.\n\n\nIf you already have a chosen niche, a very specific niche, and you only want to create content within that niche. You won’t be a very good trader.\nBecause a trader is not tied down to one niche and only that niche. They are fluid, and don’t care what niche they’re going to enter. They only care if it will be profitable or not.\nThe trader will look at a niche, try it and if it doesn’t work, they’ll move on to the next thing.\n\n\nSo are you willing to try the path of a trader?\n\n\nIf so, then welcome to the world of Faceless YouTube Automation.\nWhere we’ll show you how to grow a channel from scratch and create content that is already in high demand.\n\n\nSo just how did one of my clients grow their channel to 19M views in just a few months?\n\n\nContinue on to the next episode where I’ll reveal the foundation of how to quickly copy what works, instead of reinventing the wheel and coming up with the next original idea yourself.",

      "description": "Content Writing for Beginners\nThis course will help you become a better writer. Your content must not be machine-like. You are making it for humans. Although adding keywords and optimizing the content is important. But you will have to make sure that it is easy to read. You can also do a market analysis and use your competitor's best practices to your advantage. This will depend on the style that you pick and choose.\n‘Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.’\nPlanning the content also means that you search for short and long-tail keywords. This can also be your brainstormed ideas and you can use this time to organize them.\nYou must gather further evidence and create outlines. Once you know the amount of research that you need to do?\nIt is then time to start your research. Find and use only authentic sources. You can use this time to collect all the available evidence that supports your topic.\nThe third step is structuring or organizing the content. By now you have collected a few articles books and research papers. It is then time to structure and restructure.\nOnce everything is in order, you can then start writing. Preparation is the key to producing an engaging piece. With this process you\nwill be able to get a high rate of conversion for your copy.\nIt is now time to take your copy through a series of revisions. You have to keep it short.\nOnce you are done with your revisions, you can then edit and publish.",

How does it get from place to place? Where do you park it? Network executives and investors will ask lots of questions before and after they see your visual presentation. This course will prepare you for most of those questions.\nIn this course I will use my original pitching package that earn a 24 hour green-light from a television network executive and went on to become a hit celebrity talk show on a top tier cable network. I will utilize videos and power point slides to dissect the written proposal and showcase some of the original TV pilot. Footage from the TV pilot will be used as examples to drive home certain key elements needed in a written proposal.\nThis course was designed to be \"On Demand\" & \"Time\" friendly .

      "description": "Do you want to learn an excellent method to boost your reader engagement, make your content and copy more comfortable to read, and call alert to the points your audience must understand?\nConsider it or not, it's our buddy, the bullet point.\nThat's correct. The nemesis of every deathly-dull presentation on earth can be employed in fun, fascinating, and highly reader-friendly ways.\nHere's how.\nFirst, you need to learn the following five \"basic\" elements.\n\n\n5 tips for better bullet points\nReaders adore bullets — they make your content less difficult to skim and pull out the vital facts, so it's positively digestible.\n\n\nBut don't just toss them into your copy— use them wisely and creatively. Here are five recommendations for well-done bullets:\n\n\nGood bullet points raise awareness of something that satisfies the reader.\nGood bullet points are proportional. It's best to keep them around the exact number of lines on the screen.\nGood bullet points are orderly. This isn't an overview for your high school English class — bypass subsections, sub-bullets, etc.\nGood bullet points are parallel. Begin each bullet with the same amount of speech — if one begins with a noun, don't make the following one a verb.\nGood bullet points (like headlines) aren't always whole sentences … but keep them compatible.\nAnd note — bullet points can be in a numbered list or in the form of \"unordered\" bullets. But both work perfectly fine.\n\n\nNow for the excellent effects … fascinations.\nFascination is an ancient copywriting word, signifying the mesmerizing elements or characteristics of a product (or service, or email newsletter, or ebook … you get the point) that can be teased out and used to draw your audience's attention to read further.\nFascinations are a particular kind of bullet point that is so exhilarating and benefit-driven that the reader just can't help but read more to discover the promised secret.\n\n\nIt's a fantastic strategy for:\nLuring readers back into the copy they skimmed\nProvoking the download of a free book\nCompelling someone to click on a link\nPropelling subscriptions to your site or newsletter\nTriggering the desired \"Add to Cart,\" click\nThe key to a fascination is sagging the blessing teasingly without really giving away the \"Secret\".\n\n\nFascinations originate way back from traditional direct response copywriting. For instance, look at some copy from Bottom Line Secrets, a subscription periodical that promises insider data to make your life more comfortable. The business established itself many years ago with a sales article that was basically nothing but very captivating bullet points.\nHere are some samples from that original ad:\nWhy some patients are given favored status in hospitals … almost preferred treatment. This little-known information could save your life.\nHow to learn about medical discoveries before your doctor.\nHow and when blood pressure can fool you … and drinking alcohol without hangovers.\nThe two famous cold remedies that, taken together, can give you ulcers.\nA simple way to prevent Montezuma's Revenge.\n\n\nDo you see how perfectly these are combined together? They hint at a product's benefit without slopping the beans about how to get that gift. You need to subscribe if you want a simple way to prevent Montezuma's Revenge.\n\n\nThat's a fascination.\n\n\nWhere do fascinations come from?\nThe best way to discover stunning fascinations is to examine your product or service and determine what benefits you provide to your clients.\n\n\nRemember to hold them favorably appropriate. Focus on the advantages that are most persuasive for your particular audience.\n\n\nIf at all feasible, use numerals and statistics. So \"How to reduce your blood pressure\" is good, but \"How to lower your blood pressure as much as 10 points … without medication\" is a lot more fascinating.\n\n\nAttempt to discover an aspect of practical surprise as well. \"Learn to improve your flexibility\" is good, but \"Add 6 inches to your toe-touch in 10 minutes … even if you've never been able to touch the ground before\" is much more promising.\n\n\nPut time and effort into creating your bullet points fascinating (or at least transparent and valuable), and customer response will increase.",

However, hundreds of thousands of such stories are seldom seen, heard, or shared. Why?\nIndividuals and brands that only focus on digital publishing miss the storytelling sweet spot by a mile. This results in low credibility, shallow insights, or even inauthentic experiences. Sounds familiar? Content marketing sorely needs a robust foundation like no other. Vishwas Anand has coined the philosophy of \"contentworthiness\" in a post-truth digital world. What creditworthiness has built over time, contentworthiness can destroy in no time!\nThe secret lies in embracing the power of differentiated storytelling for thought leadership.\nContent marketing must cut through the noise and evolve into thought leadership to make the best voices heard, seen, and shared. A cumulative storytelling advantage with painstaking consistency will help you understand what works and what doesn't with practice, persistence, and a keen sense of learning.\nIn this one-of-a-kind Masterclass, you will learn from a multi-award-winning thought leadership marketing leader how to create stories that shape and reshape your thinking, recognize untapped ideas, and take them to market for a true return on innovation.\nVishwas Anand has been at the forefront of content marketing.

      "description": "How To Write Great Content Effortlessly\nIf you struggle to write content that attracts attention and engagement regardless of your expertise, this is the most crucial page you’ll see today.\nThe Content Writing Course\nThis opportunity can massively boost the quality and quantity of the content you write and publish and increase your earnings by following a simple and repeatable process.\nIt serves as the basis for repurposing long-form articles you write into shorter pieces and other forms of content—social media campaigns, podcasts, webinars, eBooks—the list is endless.\nThis course could be the difference between sitting on the sidelines OR grabbing the content-writing bull by the horns and writing like a pro.\nI call it The Content Writing Course (call a spade a spade), and because I know you’re serious about this opportunity, I've put this step-by-step course covering all of this “blueprint” on Udemy, where you can pick it up for a very reasonable price. Inside this blueprint, you’ll discover the steps I’ve used to publish multiple long-form articles on my blog.\nHere’s a preview of what you’ll find inside:\nHow I reduce my time researching topics (keywords) on which to write from hours to just minutes while finding low-competition 'longtail' topics that attract clicks.\nWhy researching and fact-checking long-form articles almost drove me crazy, and how I found a solution to this that all writers can use.\nThe exact five steps I’ve identified from publishing my first long-form article and how I formalized them to write hundreds more. These are detailed as you come over my shoulder in a practical demonstration in this course.\nAre These Steps Any Different Than Yours?\nPerhaps not. All serious content writers research, outline, write, fact-check, and format. Those are the basic steps taken by anyone who cares about the content they write. But in this course, see how these steps can be significantly simplified, speeded up, and repeated without sacrificing quality—quite the reverse.\nThese Secrets are Responsible for My Content Writing Success\nRemember, when you enroll today, you get immediate access to The Content Writing Course, which contains hours of actionable advice, processes, and even an over-the-shoulder demo as I combine all the steps to find a suitable topic, research it, write about it, and publish it live.\n100 Satisfaction Guaranteed\nYou’ll have full access within minutes of placing your order.\nYour satisfaction is guaranteed. If you’re unhappy with it for any reason or no reason at all, you can request a full refund from Udemy with one click within a month.\nNo questions asked.\nI obviously could charge a small fortune for this, but I want as many content writers and publishers as possible to have access to it.\nIf you’re like the few others who saw this process when I shared it with them privately, you’ll immediately discover its power.\nClick \"Buy Now\" and get the process going. You’ll have access to it within minutes.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow many years have you been writing? I have been writing for over 30 years as a film director, business owner, content writer, and publisher.\nHow large is your customer base? I have over 65,000 students enrolled in my Udemy courses studying storytelling, audiobook narration, and other creative skills.\nCan I work with you? Sorry, no. Udemy's terms prevent this; my schedule is packed with writing and running my business!\nThis Is Truly A Special Offer, So Claim Your Copy Now Before It's Gone\nAlthough this course is up on Udemy now and available for immediate enrollment, I may not always be able to keep the course public at this price.\nTherefore, if you see this page and the price works for you, I'd suggest enrolling immediately.\nThanks for reading this letter. I look forward to seeing you soon on the course!\nPaul Jenkins\nP.S. In case you're one of those people (like me) who skip to the end of the page, here's the deal:\nI'm offering you lifetime access to The Content Writing Course that outlines the exact approaches I've used in my content writing to create successful, high-quality, long-form articles. All you pay is the price Udemy displays on this page.\nYou also get access to me via the Udemy QA to answer any questions you might have about the strategies, steps, and tools shown in the course. All of which I use daily in my writing and publishing\nYou get this because I want you to implement what you learn in my materials immediately.\nThis may be a limited offer because I'm testing this course. If it proceeds as I think it might, I may need to remove it from the public listing on Udemy (students who enrolled before that de-listing will continue to enjoy lifetime access to the course and its materials).\nThere is no \"catch\" to this course. You will get full lifetime access.\nIf you don't like the course, let me know via Udemy's Private Messaging system and refund it via Udemy within 30 days with one click. No questions asked.\nIt’s Decision Time\nYou have a choice: Do what you’ve been doing (or worse, do nothing). You know where that will lead. To me, it has always been that horrible struggle with content writing. Is that really where you want to go? If the answer is NO, then take a new action and get a new result. Start today and sign up for the course that gets your content writing back in shape. The course builds up your confidence as a writer. The course helps you write the content you always wanted. All that in just days. Does that sound like what you want for yourself? Here’s what to do now…click the Buy button on this page and get started today!\nLastly A Disclaimer\nPlease understand that the results I'm sharing with you are not typical. I’m not implying you’ll duplicate them (or do anything, for that matter).\nI have had the benefit of writing professionally for many years and have advanced skills.\nYour results will vary and depend on many factors …including but not limited to your background, experience, and work ethic.\nAll business entails risk as well as massive and consistent effort and action. If you're unwilling to accept that, please DO NOT GET The Content Writing Course.\nThat said, let me jump in and show you exactly how I write long-form high-quality content easily, rapidly, and in a daily repeatable process—and how you can, too!",

      "description": "How To Write A White Paper In One Day is the compressed video course that will teach you everything you need to know to write (and even design) a 2,000 word white paper, completing your first draft in a single day.\nAfter watching one lesson a day for one week, you'll know:\nWhat a white paper is (and even more important what it isn’t).\nHow to make yours compelling from the first second your reader sees the title. How to structure your argument so they read it through to the end.\nHow to write your first draft using my step-by-step White Paper In A Day Template.\nHow to edit your copy like a pro.\nHow to distribute your white paper for maximum exposure.\nCreated By A Veteran Copywriter (Me!)\nMy name is Brian Boys and I’d been successfully writing advertising and marketing copy for 20 years before I was asked to work on a white paper.\nI knew less about them than you do now.\nSo I read everything I could find about white papers. I compiled lists of tips and techniques offered by copywriters who specialize in white papers. Every day I would go hunting online for the best examples.\nAnd, using the most effective ones I could find, I created a point-by-point outline of an ideal white paper argument–a copywriter’s blueprint I could use to write my own.\nWhat I Learned About Writing White Papers\nAlong the way I discovered that the toughest part about writing the white papers isn’t the actual writing. It’s the structure. Where do you start? What do you say to hook your reader? How do you take them on a logical path to your conclusion?\nSo from my outline I created the White Paper In A Day Template–the fill-in-the-blanks pattern we’ll use for this course.\nThe reason you’d pay a copywriter like me $2,000-$4,000 to write your white paper for you is that it takes a lot of time to comb through your research and figure out how to turn it into a coherent argument from beginning to end.\nSurprisingly, I gured out that if you ip the process around, you save a ton of time and your white paper can be even more compelling.\nYou get all this and more in a course designed for experienced professionals with basic business writing skills.\n“But,” you say, “I have NO time to take a long course.” No problem.\nLet’s Do Lunch For A Week\nHow To Write A White Paper In One Day is divided into seven video sessions, averaging about 20 minutes long. Each lesson comes with a print-out that includes a Quick Quiz (to make sure you’re awake) as well as other resources.\nMost importantly, you get several versions of my White Paper In A Day Template to make it easy to get the big picture and then create a more detailed plan of what your white paper is going to say.\nJust watch one lesson a day for a week. And by the time you’re tired of looking at my face on video you’ll be ready to start your white paper.",

That means creating content that ranks and converts your traffic in some meaningful way.\nWriting content for your blog is not the same as writing an essay. While essays focus on academic structure and linear arguments, blog writing must be scannable, structured for the web, and optimized for search engines. Blog readers skim,  they look for headlines, bullet points, and actionable insights.\nIn this course, you’ll learn how to break free from academic habits and adopt a blog first writing style that uses:\n\n\nProper headings (H2, H3)\nShort paragraphs\nKeywords\nInternal linking\nFormatting strategies that improve on-page SEO and more.\nVarious ways to make money blogging.\nYou’ll also discover how to guide both your readers and search engines through your content with clarity and structure that include CTAs to drive conversions, elements essays ignore.\nOne of the biggest mistakes new bloggers and small business owners make is treating their blog like a personal journal. Writing whatever they feel like, whenever they feel like it. While blogging can be fun and creative, successful blogs focused on revenue are strategic, not random.\nIf you want readers, traffic, and growth, you need to create content that’s focused, valuable, and aligned with what your audience is searching for.\nIn this course, you’ll learn how to go from casual writing to purposeful blogging, combining creativity with content strategy and AI tools to produce posts that people actually find, read, and share.",

I got it while I was in the middle of writing an online sales page for a client. Long story short, I applied just 3 of your hacks to one part of the page, and my client is super-excited about its generating lots of sales for her two-book bundle.

I don’t like to think of myself as a “copywriting guru” as many experts call themselves. Then only thing that I have been privileged with, is to work for about 5 years in the advertising industry and test out dozens of copywriting ideas in tens of markets and see what works and what doesn’t.\nHOW DOES THIS INTEREST ME? You might ask.\nWell it’s simple…instead of you spending thousands if not more on advertising to learn from your own mistakes, you will skip all the headaches I had and my years of trial and error. Consider this copywriting course your head-ache pill that you take before even feeling any pain.\nAnd just to make sure…\nDo you think I never had failed campaigns? Of course I had.\nHere are some other failures as well…\nMichael Jordan lost over 300 games in his career.\nDyson had 5,000 failed prototypes before making a vacuum.\nEdison failed 10,000 times before creating the light bulb.\nEXPERIENCE IS FAILURE.\n\nBut since we live in this information age, everything is now accessible and you can skip parts if not all of the trial phase by learning from someone who has been there done that.\nI’m not saying, you will be a world class writer after taking this copywriting course, but if you follow the rules and guidelines I laid out for you I guarantee you will be a damn good copywriter.\nBetter than most copywriters I’ve seen at top 5 ad agencies anyway…\nSO HERE IS WHAT THIS COURSE WILL DO FOR YOU\n·At least double your conversion rate\n·At least double your sales\n·At least double your Click-Through-Rate\n·Make you get results and turn heads\nDON’T BELIEVE ME?\nFine….\nIf in 30 days you don’t get all and more of the results I said, feel free to ask for a 100% refund.\nIt’s totally within Udemy’s refund policy. And I will ask it for you, that’s how sure I am of the quality and value of this course.\nBUT considering I have 3000 students so far with 45 reviews with an average of 5 stars I think my word means more than an empty promise to you.\nWHAT THIS COURSE COVERS (IN A NUTSHELL)\n·Essential copywriting elements\n·Creating head turning headlines\n·Writing the perfect sales copy\n·Tweaking your message to perfection\nWHAT THIS COURSE IS BASED ON\n·5 years of personal advertising experience\n·Classic knowledge from the founders of copywriting (Ogilvy, Caples, Scwab)\n·Updated knowledge from modern experts (Bencivenga, Makepeace, Kern, Godin)\nTO SUMMARIZE\nWhat this course will do for you?\n·-get you more sales\n·-make your message more effective\n·-allow you to tell your story the way it deserves to be told\nWhat this course won’t do for you?\n·-write sales copy by itself\nBesides following the lectures, taking notes, you have to PRACTICE.And you won’t have to do it alone.\nYou can ask me anything in the discussions section.\nI offer constant support along the way.\nI answer all questions within the same day to all my courses (Facebook, Twitter, Copywriting). (Weekends as well…yes I am a workaholic).\nSo whenever you feel stuck, want feedback or just need a push in the right direction feel free to reach out.\nALSO, I MADE IT EASY FOR YOU\nI put a lot of effort in creating video animations so you will find this easy to follow and remember because of the fun and relevant visuals.\nAlso you have additional resources in case you want to become even better at some of the topics covered.\nPrint ready snapshots of the lectures that you can easily look at without having to scroll through the full videos.\nAnd quizzes that you can take and solidify your understanding of the principles and concepts of copywriting.\nSeriously NOW? What are you waiting for?\nThis is a no risk shot at making more money promoting what you love!\nSo either click TAKE THIS COURSE at the top right of this page or continue to accept standard results. It’s Your Choice.\nSincerely (and hopefully not too blunt),\nDoru Catana\nPS: I really care about the quality of my courses and put a lot of work in research, formatting and also design (that’s why I publish one every few months) but what I do care even more about is getting people across the finish line and getting them to take action. So if you really want to get better at copywriting, I honestly encourage you to take this course.",

Learn how to capture the real value you create every day with your clients and turn that value it into digital assets.\n\n\nImagine if you had to build a new car every time you drove to work. That makes just as much sense as you answering the same questions with the same responses every day in your career. This course will teach you how to record your answers and making them available to the largest possible audience.\n\n\nYou only have so many minutes in a day. No matter how much you charge per hour or per minute once you sell or spend that minute of your life you are never getting it back. A digital course or info product allows you to generate long term residual income from those minutes of life that you can never achieve in a conventional service delivery business model.\n\n\nIf you are a therapists, you could create and sell home treatment programs for each of the most common conditions you treat on a daily basis. You could provide answers to the most common questions as a low cost option to conventional therapy.\n\n\nIf you are a divorce attorney, you could help thousands of individuals find the information they need without spending any more time than it takes to make the recordings.\n\n\nIf you were a dentist, you could help people all over the world who may have no access to appropriate dental care, but have internet access and enough money to buy access to your knowledge and experience.\n\n\nInstead of spending countless hours working one on one with clients in a conventional model you can now use that time to create content that is infinitely scalable and will help people anywhere in the world at any time of the day or night.\n\n\nPlatforms like Thinkific, Udemy, Kajabi, Podia, Wordpress, and even just a simple email course has democratized access to information and made it possible for professionals like you to reach anyone who needs your knowledge or expertise.\n\n\nOnline learning and digital courses are a huge industry and expected to grow rapidly.\n\n\nSome ideas for courses you could start with include:\nThe top 10 questions you should ask your surgeon before scheduling a total knee replacement.\nShould I use heat or ice after an acute injury?\nWhat are the best exercises to STOP sciatica pain?\n9 best ergonomic changes to make while working from home.\n\n\nBelieve it or not, you have likely already created 100s of courses over the span of your career.

      "description": "With over 2 billion monthly users, Instagram is the third most used app in the world today.\nIn fact, surveys have shown that over 81% of people use Instagram to help research products and services.\nWhen launched, Instagram was simply a photo-sharing and social networking application. Now, it has evolved into a platform where you can share images, videos, short and long-form video content, and even written guides. Hence, it has become a medium through which businesses, brands, and influencers can find and connect with their target audience effectively.\nFrom sharing funny memes and short 10-second videos to sharing detailed guides and long one-hour videos, Instagram makes it possible for you to do all that and more.\nThis is why creating an effective Instagram Strategy for products and services has become extremely important if you want to upscale your business.\nWhy use Instagram Marketing?\nA major difference between Instagram and other social media platforms is that Instagram is a visual platform. This means that even though you can add text, the app itself gives preference to photos and videos.\nIt has been proven that viewers retain up to 95% more information while watching a video as compared to just 10% while reading something.\nAs a result of this, top and local brands in the world are now using Instagram Marketing. With Instagram Marketing, they have the opportunity to be as creative as they want and promote their products or services through visually compelling and eye-catching graphics. And in turn, are able to drive a considerable amount of sales towards their businesses.\nNot using the features available on Instagram would result in you missing out on what the app has to offer.\n\n\nWho should watch this Masterclass?\nThis masterclass is perfect for people who want to leverage the power of social media marketing through Instagram.

There is no silver bullet to going viral.\n\n\nOrganic traffic is often considered superior to paid traffic for several reasons.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, organic traffic is driven by the genuine interest of users in your content or offerings, resulting in higher quality leads and potential long-term customers. It is also a more cost-effective and sustainable approach, as once your content ranks well in search engines or gains traction through word-of-mouth, it can continue to attract visitors without ongoing advertising expenses. Furthermore, organic traffic tends to build trust and credibility for your brand, as users perceive it as a more genuine and reliable source of information.\n\n\nIn contrast, paid traffic can be costly and may lead to less engaged visitors who are more likely to bounce without converting.\n\n\nTherefore, organic traffic is often the preferred choice for businesses seeking sustainable and high-converting online presence.\n\n\nThe intention of this course is to empower you with the basics of what you need to know about content marketing so that you can start your organic content marketing plan as soon as possible.",

      "description": "Let’s take a look at this confusing self-publishing business. Not all publishing video courses are bad, but some of them run through keyword research so fast that the numbers become overwhelming and you’re left to yourself. Then you notice some people emphasizing that it’s “all about keywords” and showing off screenshots. Well, let me debunk the myth: Not ALL of it is about keywords, but they definitely make a big difference. But that’s why it’s so confusing sometimes. Some gurus will swear by their proven methods, but many of their customers struggle with finding their way.\nThis course is a definite, valuable addition to those basic methods. Over the past few years in my publishing experience, I’ve come across so many categories and keywords that I am confident to say that I know what I’m doing when it comes to doing my research, and that there is a lot that other courses won’t teach you.\nYou’ve probably already seen some of these things:\nPublishers all going after the same niches or keywords.\nPublishers who think something is a good keyword and then find out it’s way too competitive.\nBasic video courses that give you a 5-minute analysis and let you sort out the rest.\nConfusion about where to start, or if you should continue to put more books in your niche.\nWondering about what competing publishers are doing, especially the ones who make so much money.\nEndless discussions about fiction versus nonfictions, and publishers making money in both.\nQuestions about where to find new ideas, and hot or rising niches.\nThinking you’re in a good keyword, only to discover that it’s cluttered with famous authors, and that the keyword wasn’t what made the books sell.\nAnd the list goes on.\nI won’t be unrealistic here. You will still need to do your own research. But after taking this course, you will have tools and knowledge to speed that process up, and you’ll be more accurate about it, so that you won’t waste as much money or time on the wrong books, topics, or genres. I am going to arm you with sneaky tactics that can help you estimate your success better by comparing numbers, successful existing books, different platforms, and much more!\nYou will know which numbers matter most in your analysis.\nYou will learn what matters not at all, or only to a certain extent.\nYou will understand your numbers better, and you’ll see the difference between a great keyword and a mediocre one.\nYou will have more confidence when you publish a book, with a greater certainty that it will generate some sales (or a whole lot).\nYou will see the difference between a good paperback, E-book, or audio book niche.\nYou will receive ideas, creative ways to come up with new keywords, and know where to look.\nYou will be less confused about rankings, page numbers, and book reviews that don’t make sense right now.\nYou will better be able to find your way through the maze of thousands of book categories Amazon has.\nStop struggling and find out the shortcuts to facts and knowledge gurus and publishers are hiding from you. Many of them don’t want you to know this information, because it could increase competition. But you’ll be on to them.

      "description": "This course is part of our \"Psychology Driven Web Design\" collection.\nThis is a beginner level course as content design is concerned.\nPlease note that NO subtitles are available with this course.\n\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThere are more than 600 million blogs on the web today. The number of bloggers in the United States alone by now exceeds 30 million. And there is a blog about every conceivable topic out there.\nThis isn’t to say that you shouldn’t run a blog. On the contrary, the popularity of blogging is growing with each passing day. But the question is no longer about creating a blog. It’s rather about getting others to find and read what you’ve written. To be able to make the best use of the 30 seconds you might get from a visitor is the most important skill that you must possess today as a blogger.\nYou might think that content is king, and that a blog has to be judged by the material it contains. But no matter how talented you are as a literary writer, how visually appealing the template is that you are using, and how useful the information conveyed in your content is, your blog is valuable only to the extent that others can easily consume that content. Teaching you how to design your blog posts so they can, is exactly what this course is about.\nThe medium we call the world wide web has its own set of rules and peculiarities, when compared with more traditional content carriers. The information content of a blog might make it useful, but it is the content design that makes it valuable. When you finish this course, your blog posts will be findable, scannable, readable, actionable, and shareable.\n\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nIn this course, you will learn about scanning patterns and to design for easy scanning, faster reading, and easy comprehension; you will learn to write accurately, using stories, for deep reading and for easy recall; to use proper highlighting, impactful styles, effective typography and appropriate visuals; and to master creating social content, content curation, content sharing and content marketing.\n\n\nPREREQUISITES\nThere are no prerequisites other than being able to understand English without needing subtitles.\n\n\nTHE LEVEL OF STUDY\nThis course is for those who are at a beginner to intermediate level as bloggers.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: MOST PARTS OF THIS COURSE ARE ALSO CONTAINED IN OUR COURSE “PSYCHOLOGY DRIVEN WEB DESIGN”. IF YOU HAVE TAKEN THAT COURSE ALREADY, WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU TAKE THIS COURSE.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: WE DO NOT OFFER SUBTITLES IN THIS COURSE.",

      "description": "If you want to master the art of content writing, you should take this course—for six reasons.\nNumber one. This isn’t a course. It’s a masterclass. This isn’t one of those courses that some guy put together in his basement in a morning. This is a masterclass, taught by a master content writer. It features more than eight hours of content, all designed to make you a better, more-effective content writer.\nNumber two. This masterclass is practical. Enough with the theory, already. You aren’t here to learn concepts and principles. You are here to learn how to craft content that attracts readers, educates buyers, and engages customers. You are here for practical tactics, tips, and tricks. This masterclass delivers. I show you dozens of examples of real-world content-writing assignments. You look over my shoulder as I write blog posts, video scripts, social media posts and more.\nNumber three. You aren’t taking this masterclass for the good of your health. You want to master skills that make you more valuable as a content writer. That’s why I teach you how to write only the top assignments. Go only, research the most common, the most popular, the most effective types of content around today, and you’ll discover that these are the only types of content that I teach you to write. I’m talking blog posts, whitepapers, case studies, video scripts, eBooks, social media posts, and more.\nThe fourth reason you should take this masterclass is me, if I may say so. I’m Alan Sharpe, B2B content writer and copywriter. I wrote my first piece of content way back in 1988, before the internet, and before content marketing, were even a thing. In the last three decades I have transitioned from offline to online, from print to digital, and from copy to content. Today, I spend my days crafting B2B content for global brands. I know what they want, what works with today’s B2B buyers, and how to craft content that generates results. I teach you all that I know in this masterclass.\nNumber five. Let’s talk about the boredom factor of plenty of online courses. You know the ones I mean. All you get is slide after slide of a PowerPoint presentation, narrated by some disembodied voice, an instructor who talks in a monotone, and does nothing more than read the slides on your screen word for word, or rambles on and on with no clear lesson plan. Deadly! Enough with death by PowerPoint! In this masterclass, you get me, live and in person, talking with you, looking you in the eye, teaching you, encouraging you, communicating with you, and giving you examples of everything I teach.\nNumber six, and your final reason, coaching. This masterclass includes coaching, free of charge. I give you multiple content-writing assignments to complete, then I give you my constructive feedback. I read your assignments, I tell you what works, I tell you what doesn’t. I tell you what you must do to improve your content-writing skills. This coaching alone is worth the price of admission. I mark roughly 20 assignments a day. That’s 140 assignments a week, 600 a month, more than 7,000 a year. That’s how popular I am as a content-writing coach. If you need coaching, this content-writing masterclass is for you.\nOK, that’s six solid reasons for taking this content-writing masterclass right now. If you need a few more, be my guest. Read the detailed class description below. Read the reviews from my many satisfied students. Watch the many free lesson previews. Then enroll now.",

Writing is my jam and content is my peanut butter. And I make a mean PB&J.\nI’ve gone from handling public relations for a startup clothing brand to managing the entire social media program of a global SaaS company through a unicorn IPO and its subsequent acquisition.\nBlog posts, guides, tweets, brochures, landing pages, marketing emails, sales pitches, presentations…\nWrite. Write. Write. It’s what I do. Simple as that.\nI can't wait to see you in the course!\nI'm 100% confident this course will help launch and grow your freelance business!

      "description": "When it comes to creating a copywriting portfolio, there’s good news, and there’s bad news. The good news is that the only thing you need to land a job as a copywriter is a portfolio. The bad news is that the only thing you need to land a job as a copywriter is a portfolio.\n\n\nYou don’t need a university degree to become a copywriter. You don’t need experience, or a diploma in Creative Writing, or a university degree in English Literature, or a certificate from Udemy, or anything else. All that you need to get hired as a copywriter is a portfolio that demonstrates that you write effective copy. That’s it.\n\n\nBut that’s the bad news, too. You simply can’t get hired as a copywriter without a portfolio. That means your portfolio, and your portfolio alone, must persuade a hiring manager that you write effective copy. In most cases, your portfolio is your only kick at the can. If a potential employer looks at your portfolio and thinks that your copywriting ability is inadequate, nothing else you show them or tell them will persuade them to hire you. Your resume won’t help you. Your work experience won’t help you.\n\n\nYes, you can get hired as a copywriter with nothing more than an awesome portfolio, but you will get hired only if your portfolio demonstrates that you have the skills that potential employers look for.\nThat’s what you’re going to discover in this course.\n\n\nHi, I’m Alan Sharpe, and welcome to my course on how to create a copywriting portfolio with no experience. I’ve been a copywriter on and off since 1989. Back then, when I started out, I had no experience as a copywriter, but I landed my first copywriting client with nothing but my portfolio, which I created from scratch with no experience.\n\n\nThen, in 2018, I did the same thing again. I had been out of the copywriting business for 10 years, working in the non-profit sector as a fundraising consultant. I re-invented myself as a digital, inbound copywriter. The problem was, I didn’t have a single digital sample in my portfolio. My portfolio was all outdated print samples. It belonged in another century. So, I created a new portfolio, even though I had no digital copywriting experience. I started landing work.\n\n\nIn this course, I teach you how to do the same thing. I teach you how to create a copywriting portfolio when you have absolutely zero copywriting experience. I show you what to include, what to leave out, and why.\n\n\nIn this course, you discover what potential employers need to see in your portfolio. You discover six ways to create copywriting samples from scratch. You learn the difference between business to consumer portfolios and business to business portfolios, and how to capitalize on that vital difference to land work.\n\n\nYou learn how to write copywriting samples on your own, how to write them with the help of local businesses, and how to write them with the help of businesses on Upwork and other job boards.\n\n\nI take you step by step through the process of creating copywriting samples from scratch. I show you how to choose an audience, how to pick an industry, how to select a product or service to write about, and how to decide on the best tactic to use. You look over my shoulder as I write the kind of copywriting samples that you must include in your portfolio. We start with a blank computer screen, and I show you step by step how to create a copywriting sample from start to finish, even though you are brand new to copywriting.\n\n\nAt the end of this course, you will know all that you need to know to build your own copywriting portfolio even though you have zero experience as a copywriter. You will know what your portfolio should look like to attract the kinds of clients you want, or to land you the copywriting job you want.\n\n\nI created this course for any writer who wants to break into copywriting. And that’s a key thing to note. This course doesn’t teach you how to write copy. It teaches you how to create a copywriting portfolio with no experience. Having said that, as I create multiple copywriting samples for you, you learn some valuable copywriting lessons. But just remember that this course is all about how to build your portfolio when you have no experience writing copy for pay. This course assumes that you already have some copywriting ability.\n\n\nThe primary value of this course is that you learn not just the how, but also the why. For example, I teach you how to create Facebook ads from scratch, but I also teach you why those samples belong in your portfolio. I show you step by step how to create a before-and-after sample, but I also explain why you should include that sample in your portfolio.\n\n\nI do this because the key thing that potential employers look for in your copywriting portfolio is relevance. They want to see that you understand their customers and their challenges. They want to see that you can write the kinds of assignments they are likely to give you. That’s why, in this course, I not only teach you how to create each copywriting sample, but why. After all, your portfolio doesn’t just show that you know how to write copy. It proves that you are the right copywriter for your potential employer to hire.\n\n\nIf you want to stand out from all of the other candidates, you need a great copywriting portfolio. You can create that great portfolio even though you have no experience. I did it--twice. You can, too.\nSo, go ahead, watch a few of the preview lessons, read the reviews from my many satisfied students, then enroll now.",

      "description": "Welcome to \"AI-Assisted Writing - Your Tool for SuperHuman Success\"! In this innovative and exciting course, we'll introduce you to the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in writing. This course is designed for writers, content creators, marketers, and anyone interested in harnessing the power of AI to elevate their writing skills and achieve outstanding results.\nThroughout this comprehensive course, you'll learn the fundamentals of AI, discover various AI-powered writing tools, and understand how to use these resources effectively to create high-quality, engaging content. From blog posts and articles to social media captions and marketing copy, our step-by-step guide will help you master AI-assisted writing for a wide range of purposes.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\nUnderstand AI's core principles and their application to writing and content creation.\nDiscover the leading AI-powered writing tools and platforms, and learn how to choose the right one for your needs.\nDevelop best practices for using AI-assisted writing tools to create engaging, well-structured, and grammatically correct content.\nEnhance your writing productivity and efficiency by leveraging AI technology to generate ideas, outline content, and edit drafts.\nApply AI-assisted writing techniques to various content formats, such as blog posts, articles, social media posts, and marketing copy.\nLearn how to maintain your unique voice and style while using AI tools, ensuring your content remains authentic and engaging.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAn AI-assisted, human-first writing process combines the strengths of both human creativity and AI-powered language generation to produce high-quality written content. Some of the best uses of this collaborative approach include:\nIdea generation: AI can provide a wealth of ideas, prompts, or outlines to help spark creativity, enabling writers to choose or build upon the most suitable concepts.\nDrafting and editing: AI can create initial drafts or help refine existing content, offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and style. The human writer can then review, modify, and polish the final output.\nWriter's block: AI assistance can help overcome writer's block by suggesting phrases, sentences, or even entire paragraphs, keeping the creative process moving forward.\nResearch and fact-checking: AI can quickly gather information and facts relevant to a topic, saving time and effort for the writer. However, human oversight is still needed to ensure accuracy and reliability.\nLanguage translation: AI can provide accurate and efficient translations, enabling writers to create content for multilingual audiences. Human expertise can then be used to refine the translations and ensure cultural nuances are preserved.\nPersonalization: AI can help tailor content for specific audiences, industries, or interests, optimizing engagement and effectiveness.\nSEO optimization: AI can identify relevant keywords and phrases and suggest content structures that can improve search engine ranking, making the content more discoverable.\nConsistency and branding: AI can analyze existing content and help maintain a consistent tone, style, and voice in line with a brand or publication's guidelines.\nAccessibility: AI can help create alternative content formats, such as audio or simplified language versions, to reach a wider audience and cater to different accessibility needs.\nAnalytics and feedback: AI can analyze content performance and reader engagement, providing insights and recommendations for improvements in future writing endeavors.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nLearn How to Add value to the AI writing process by mastering the strategies:\nConduct thorough research: Before using AI to generate content in an unfamiliar subject area, research the topic to gain a basic understanding. This will help you evaluate the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content more effectively.\nCollaborate with subject matter experts: Work with experts in the field to review and refine AI-generated content, ensuring its accuracy, depth, and relevance.\nUse AI as a starting point: Treat AI-generated content as a starting point or a draft rather than a final product. Build upon the generated content using your own research, insights, and critical thinking to create a more comprehensive and informative piece.\nContinuously learn and improve: Develop your subject matter expertise over time by engaging in continuous learning, attending workshops, reading books and articles, and participating in relevant industry events.\nIn conclusion, while AI can be a valuable writing tool, it cannot replace subject matter expertise. Combining AI-generated content with your own research, critical thinking, and expert insights is essential to create high-quality content.\nWhy should you write?\nWriting can be a powerful tool for self-expression and personal growth. It allows you to organize and clarify your thoughts, giving structure to your ideas, revelations, and epiphanies. Writing is also excellent for problem-solving; it helps us process complex topics we are otherwise uncertain or confused about.\nIf you publish your writing, you can connect with readers worldwide and build relationships that would not have been feasible. In short, no matter your goals or intentions with writing, it can influence your daily life in many ways.\nWhy should you use AI?\nWith technological and artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, we now have access to incredible tools that revolutionize how humans interact with the world. AI brings many advantages, including improved accuracy and efficiency in tasks that would be tedious and time-consuming if done manually.\nIt can also provide real-time insights into data sets and quickly identify patterns and anomalies. Moreover, AI eliminates human error from a task, allowing for increased reliability and more accurate results. Incorporating AI into an organization's operations has become increasingly necessary for staying competitive in today's economy, as it offers ways for businesses to optimize their processes cost-effectively.\nWhere does the value come from in AI-assisted writing?\n1. Curating the structure\n2. Ensuring your article is comprehensive to answer questions and provide information fully\n3. Linking to other related comprehensive articles\nEssentially, AI helps you avoid \"reinventing the wheel\" whenever you want to write an article. If you write an article about product costs, you must have a few introductory explainer paragraphs. This is where AI is ideal for assisting. Then, you have more time and energy to focus on the insights and add expert-level thoughts to the content. Previously, writers spent too much time on non-value-added portions of the writing process.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIncluded in this course:\nOur proven Content Checklist (downloadable)\nOur Content Style Guide (to help you craft your own)\nLinks to the resources and tools you need to get started right away.\nWho would benefit from learning how to master AI-assisted writing?\nProfessional writers: Journalists, copywriters, content creators, technical writers, and authors can use AI-assisted writing tools to generate ideas, improve the quality of their work, and increase output.\nStudents and researchers: AI can assist in drafting essays, research papers, and thesis documents, providing insights and references while helping to maintain proper citation and formatting.\nBloggers and social media influencers: AI tools can help generate engaging content, optimize it for SEO, and ensure consistency across various platforms.\nMarketing and communication professionals: AI can aid in creating targeted content, ad copy, press releases, and other promotional materials, as well as analyzing the performance of such content.\nBusiness professionals: AI can help draft emails, reports, proposals, and other professional documents, ensuring clarity, conciseness, and proper grammar.\nEducators: Teachers and professors can use AI tools to create lesson plans, teaching materials, and assessments, as well as provide personalized feedback on student work.\nNon-native English speakers: AI-assisted writing can help users improve their English writing skills by providing real-time grammar, syntax, and vocabulary suggestions.\nEditors and proofreaders: AI can act as an initial proofreading and editing tool, identifying errors and inconsistencies before a human editor makes the final revisions.\nScreenwriters and playwrights: AI can generate plot ideas, character descriptions, and dialogues, helping to streamline the creative process.\nIndividuals with disabilities: AI-assisted writing tools can empower those with physical or cognitive disabilities to create and communicate effectively through writing",

WHY, as a coach or consultant, you should become an Authentic Content Creator\n2. WHAT Authentic Content Creation is, and how it differs from generic content creation\n3. HOW you can become an Authentic Content Creator by following 7 simple steps\n\n\nI explain the importance of creating AUTHENTIC content and how authentic content differs from other content.\n\n\nThis course is NOT about pumping out generic content or being paid by a company to create content for them.\n\n\nIt’s also NOT about becoming a Social Media Influencer because let’s face it, there’s not a lot of Authenticity in that world.\n\n\nSo, if you’re a coach or consultant with expertise and experience to share…\n\n\nIf you love helping others…\nIf you don’t love marketing and are looking for a way to build a name for yourself and get clients…\nIf you’re looking for a way to add additional revenue streams to your business…\nAnd if you want that revenue to continue to flow in for years to come…\n\n\nThis course is for you!\n\n\nBe sure to watch the Free Preview Videos.

From how to choose your blog topics, how to find bloggers and I even give you email templates to use when reaching out to bloggers for guest posts.\nThis student got his first post within a few days of starting the course:\n\"In just a few days after enrolling the course and take action to implement the lessons, I got my first guest post accepted from high quality blog. Now I'm working on the second guest post, because I have got another good response from another high quality blog.\" -Muhamad G.\nADDED BONUS: ($289 Value) When you purchase this course, you will receive the following at no extra charge.\nNEW Bonus list of 140+ high authority blogs accepting guest posts\nThe complete PDF Ebook\n2 NEW bonus modules\nThink about your ideal customer. Who do they trust? What blogs do they read every day? If you don't know, that's ok. I'm going to show you exactly how to find out, then I'll show you how to use that information to grow your business.\n\nI work with businesses across every industry and the one strategy that is consistently overlooked is guest blogging.\nThere is no better (or faster) way to gain the trust of your customers than having a website that they trust feature you and your ideas in a guest blog post.\nMy approach to finding, pitching and getting featured on these websites isn't magical - It generates results.\nIn this course I will show you the EXACT strategies I've used to double, and in many cases, triple the number of new leads for myself and my clients.\nAfter this course, you'll know how to:\nIdentify the blogs your customers visit most\nGet featured on those sites - You'll even receive email scripts\nSave time by avoiding the wrong blogs - I'll show you how to spot the red flags\nPick a guest topic that will position you as the expert you are\nThe right way and the disastrous way to promote your guest posts\nWhy did I create this?\nIt would be easy for me to keep everything to myself and let everyone else try and figure out what I've spent years developing. And I'd probably make a lot more money. But one of my fundamental values is to help as many businesses as possible.\nSo since I can't take on every business as a client, I've done the next best thing. This course is packed with bite-sized action steps that you can use immediately. And you WILL see results. If you don't or you're unhappy for any reason - let me know within 30 days and I'll give you a full refund no questions asked.\nHere's What Others Are Saying:\nThe first big guest posting push I helped create for a client using Joel's system landed a post on ProBlogger and dozens of other great sites. - Will Hoekenga\nBy applying the practices found in these lessons, I have increased traffic, personal productivity, and have been inspired beyond measure. You need this! -Lyle Phillips\nJoel did a splendid job of putting together a well-structured and actionable guide for guest blogging. The course is jam-packed with information and fully prepares someone to take on the world of guest posting. He offers real world viable examples and templates to get the party started. I'd never heard of some of the tools that he presents in the course. There are a couple that I hadn't thought of -- but you'll have to see for yourself. Fortunately, they're easily picked up and easily shareable with the rest of the population. It is indeed a reasonable blueprint for conquering the guest posting world. -Seth Czerepak Master VDT Business Practitioner and Owner of Penetration Media\nYes, I realize that you can take the entire course, implement what I teach to land your first guest post and still ask for a refund...but I'm trusting you to be cool. :)\nYou have nothing to lose. I'm looking forward to seeing you inside!\nJoel",

      "description": "You've tried content marketing. You've seen some success. Your boss or your client wants to see more. You might be wondering, where do I go from here? Well, you've come to the right place. This course gives you the advanced knowledge and practical skills you need to take your content marketing program from good to great. You'll learn how to scale your content marketing with message architecture, compelling stories, unique thought leadership, and advanced content operations. Throughout the course, you'll get well researched facts, proven techniques, and real world examples based on my 20 years of content experience. And you already know the basics, so this course focuses only on advanced material. I'm Colleen Jones, author of The Content Advantage, founder of Content Science, and former Head of Content at Mailchimp, and I love sharing what I've learned about content marketing. So, if you're ready to take a journey that goes far beyond the basics, I'm ready to be your guide. Let's start Advanced Content Marketing now.\nWhat do you want your customers to remember after they interact with your content? If you're not sure, chances are you need a message architecture. It ensures your customers get the right message. And it helps you and your team create interesting content that brings a message to life. A message architecture starts with creating a message, no surprise there. So let's walk through how to do exactly that. First, define what you want to communicate to your customers. To me, this is really focusing on what will benefit your brand or your company. A good starting point is to review your company's brand, voice, design, or identity guide. This usually lists characteristics that your company wants to exhibit. For example, when Intuit revamped TurboTax, they chose characteristics such as approachable and insightful. If your company doesn't have such a guide, that's okay. You can take a crack at writing down a few words or phrases and ask your marketing colleagues for feedback. And if you work in a large company, you can make this a group exercise, check out the attached template. Now let's consider your customers, define what your customers want or need to hear. This is where you really put yourself in your customers' shoes. I suggest reviewing any customer journeys, insights, or personas on hand. If nothing like that is available, then check whether any publicly available research or information about your customers, or your industry is available. Anything that helps you gain empathy for your customers is great. Then write down your customers' top aspirations, problems to solve, or frequent questions, strive for five to 10. Again, if you work in a large company, you can make this a group brainstorming exercise, check out the attached template. Finally, frame what you want to communicate in terms of what your customers want or need to hear. This is where message magic happens. Let's say it's important to your brand to come across as insightful. And let's say your customers are small business owners who don't have a lot of time. A key message for your content marketing might be, insights in a jiffy. Once you define the message, you can bring it to life through show and tell. Take the message, insights in a jiffy, you can show it through stories of other customers getting insights quickly, experts giving tips to get insights effectively, and more. You can also just say it occasionally. This combination of show and tell, to me, is what makes content marketing so powerful. So make your content marketing clear and compelling one message at a time. Your content marketing team will love bringing messages to life in creative ways. And your customers will find that content hard to resist.",

I will gladly recommend your online course to everyone in the coaching industry. \" - Francois\n\"Megan is an expert in her field having been a coach for the past 20 years but also has a prior career in Marketing. Her content has so many great insights - I have learnt SO much.  But more than that Megan has a fantastic approach & style to coaching you through how to market your business ??\" – Alison Coates\n\"Megan, this is AMAZING! Such fabulous content and such an approachable, informative and at the same time authoritative style. Definitely re-reading, studying and acting on it.\" - Claire Holden\n\n\nWhat you will get:\nA series of videos that will guide you through the same process that I use to define and refine my niche\nWorksheets for every step in the process to help crystallise and clarify your thinking\nPractical examples of powerful niches and the principles behind why they work so well, so that you can apply these same principles to developing your own powerful niche\nA process to help you craft your clear, compelling and concise niche statement and 3 short points so that you're never caught short when someone asks you what you do for a living\n\n\nLearn how to:\nClearly communicate to potential clients about what you do and the value you have to offer\nTake the stress out of selling and marketing your services\nDefine a clear, compelling niche that gets your potential clients saying: \"That's who I want to work with.\"\n\n\nHow can I help you?\nMy name is Megan Hudson and I've been a business and management coach since 2002.  I also spent more than a decade in brand marketing and advertising before that, so I've got a sound pedigree as an entrepreneur, business coach, and marketer.\nFor years, I wasn't able to clearly communicate about what it was that I did, and where I could add the most value for my potential clients.\nMy self-confidence suffered and I regularly lay awake at night, wrestling with whether I was really doing the right thing - even though I got positive feedback from my clients.\nOne of the problems with coaching is that it has become increasingly commoditised over the years as more and more coaches enter the industry.\nYou need to be really special if you want to stand out in a crowded marketplace, (especially if you are just starting out) and for that, you need to identify your coaching niche.\nIt took me 10 years to crystalise what I was offering into a niche that made people sit up and say: \"I want to work with her - she can help me solve my problem.\"\nPeople come to me now, and not the other way around.\nI never feel like I have to market myself or sell my services because I am so confident and comfortable about the value and results that my work offers.\nWhen anyone asks me what I do, I am able to tell them quickly and clearly, without stumbling for words or grinding to an awkward halt.\nPlus, I know exactly who I get the best results with, so I am able to strategically target my marketing message and efforts to get the best returns.\nBecause my message is so clear and simple, it sticks in people's minds and they tell their colleagues and peers: \"I know just the right person for you.\"\nI developed a system based on the step-by-step process that I used to define my niche, so that you don't have to waste 10 years getting to the core of what you offer. I created a series of 5 easy steps that helped me get clear on my niche, and the niche within my niche. The best thing about these steps is that I can re-apply them throughout my coaching career to make sure that my offering remains fresh and relevant for my potential clients. And so can you.\n\n\nStill have questions?\nQ: Will this work if my business is brand new?\nA: Yes, this is a great time to do this work for the first time so that you don't have to go through what hundreds of other entrepreneurs have gone through - trying to market themselves without getting results or being effective.\nQ: Do I need a website before starting this process?\nA: Not at all. Many of my clients effectively market themselves without having a website, but they are consistent and clear in the message that they send out via all of their marketing touchpoints so the message never gets diluted.\nQ: Can I do this in my own time?\nA: Absolutely. You will have online access to the videos and worksheets so that you can work through them at your own pace.",

      "description": "When people talk about website content writing these days, they're typically talking about the posts, articles, videos and podcasts that companies use to attract visitors to their website.\nThere are a lot of great reasons to use online content to market your business - you can attract more traffic, establish your expertise and earn the trust that turns your website's visitors into customers.\nHeck, even Google changed their search engine so that sites with great content float to the top of their search results pages.\nHowever, creating content can be challenging. It takes time. Not everyone enjoys writing and many folks just don't like to write at all. Writing content for website means trouble to them!\nBut what if there was a way to quickly and easily create the kind of content that attracts your target customers?\nWhat if you could use that content to build so much credibility, authority and trust that potential customers are driven to take action by buying your products and services, following you on social media sites and signing-up to get your newsletters?\nAnd, what if doing this was easier than what you're trying to do now?\nIt's all possible with content curation.\nContent curation doesn't do away with the writing, but it does make web content writing easier to quickly create powerful content that will:\n● Bring more traffic to your site\n● Increase the number of your social media fans and followers\n● Build your e-mail marketing list\n● Establish you as a top \"go-to\" expert in your industry\n● Keep you on top of your target customer's mind\n● Earn you good karma (and \"social credit\") from your peers\n● Increase sales\nWhat's that? You think content curation is the lazy man's way to do inbound marketing?\nWell, if you just listed a bunch of links, I would say that you're right. But content curation is much more than that.\nContent curation is all about adding value to the links you curate and this course teaches you -- using step-by-step videos, worksheets and templates -- how to do just that.\nThe course is split into four parts:\n1 Content curation overview and examples: teaches you what content curation is, why you should use it and how you can use it;\n2 Creating content curated content: how to choose topics to curate, how to find and select content for each topic, how to add value to the content you find and how to construct the actual content;\n3 Content curation tips-and-tricks: a couple of handy lessons on extending the value of content curation; and\n4 Putting content curation into action: how to get started using content curation to start writing website content and blow up your business.\nBut wait, there's more!\nI've also included a bonus video that teaches you all about inbound marketing and a content curated document which is all about content curation.\nThe best thing about this course:\nYou can use it to quickly create powerful content, content that brings customers to your site and drives them to take action, again and again and again and again and (well, you get the idea)...\np.s. Don't know a thing about me?\nHere are some nice things folks have said about other courses I've created:\n\"Thanks for the fabulous Wordpress course. You put together a goldmine of information that has taken me from a mystified WordPress \"do it myselfer\" to someone who now knows exactly how to achieve the look I want.\" -- Darlene S., WordPress for Artists customer\n\"When I was looking for freelance writing jobs in 2010, Matt provided an affordable and downloadable course that has helped me find part-time work since Day 1.\" -- Ben T., Earn More by Finding Freelance Writing Jobs Online customer\n\"If I was new to the web and wanted to make money writing, I would kiss Matt’s feet for this resource.

      "description": "Every year companies spend billions of dollars to raise awareness of their products and services in the marketplace. In 2021, Advertisers spent over $297 billion in the United States alone. To increase their chance of success, advertisers need to have the right team of people and the optimal process to achieve their marketing goals. Why do advertisers invest billions of dollars to develop and execute creative content?\nSimply put, they need to:\nSell their products or services\nCreate brand awareness\nDifferentiate their brands from competitors\nAnd build brand loyalty\nIn this course, you’ll learn the fundamentals of executing creative content to sell your products or services, including identifying key stakeholder roles and responsibilities, exploring the optimal end-to-end process, and mastering the required tasks within that process.\nThe creative content execution process has three cornerstones. First, there must be collaborative planning before production begins. Second, all parties must be aligned to ensure that every piece of content to be executed embodies the approved campaign strategy. Third, all parties must understand the ins and outs of the production execution process, which includes what needs to happen when and the subsequent implications that can hinder the process.\nWho will benefit from this course? Anyone involved in executing marketing campaigns, such as Brand Managers, Marketing or Product Managers, Advertising Operations Managers, Creative Services Managers, producers, and more.\n\n\nEndorsements\n\"This course is a great way to help clients and agency teams understand the full process to create advertising content from start to finish. It’s incredibly detailed but executed in a way that is easy for anyone new to advertising film production to understand and follow along with. It also does a tremendous job of touching on the right details throughout the process to help create a base knowledge that can ultimately be built on later. Taking this course and gaining such an understanding will not only benefit those who take it, but also the people around them who rely on the entire team to be knowledgeable and familiar with this process.\"\n- Endy Hedman\nFormer Production Executive, Wieden+Kennedy, amsterdam\n\n\n“I really liked this course! Very professional, well put together. I was impressed with the finish of it and just the general overall quality. It was great!”\n- Gary Doyle\nGroup Creative Director / Sr Vice President, Cramer-Krasselt",

      "description": "Passive Income through Digital Publishing-The Complete Guide to Selling Books on Amazon, Google Play Books, Apple Books, and Kobo PDF sample copy is added in first lesson resource area. 20230227\n\n\nOnline book publishing is the digital process of making a book available for purchase or distribution on various online platforms. Popular platforms include Amazon KDP, Apple Books, Google Play Books, Rakuten Kobo, and Barnes & Noble Press. These platforms give authors control over their work, from uploading their manuscripts to setting pricing and distribution options. They also offer marketing and promotional tools to help reach a wider audience. With online book publishing, authors can reach a global audience without relying on traditional publishers. It's also eco-friendly as it eliminates the need for physical printing, shipping, and storage. Overall, it's a convenient and accessible option for authors to publish their work and reach a wider audience.\n\n\nMaximizing Your Reach: The Author's Guide to Digitalizing Your Knowledge and Selling Your Book on Amazon, Google Play Books, Apple Books, and Kobo\n\n\nAmazon is a well-known and widely used online marketplace that offers a vast selection of products. However, many sellers overlook the fact that Amazon started as a small online bookstore. Despite its growth, Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) remains my top choice for self-publishing.\nThere are many reasons why I prefer Amazon KDP. First, it offers access to nine different markets, providing a massive potential audience for your work. Additionally, the service is creative and cost-effective, as it allows for local printing and offers both eBook and paperback formats. Amazon KDP also provides content protection, an essential feature for those selling digital products.\nAnother significant advantage of Amazon KDP is its free cover design service and quick response times. While Google Play Books and Apple Books are also major players in the self-publishing industry, Amazon KDP is the clear leader.\nIn this course, I will explore the topics of self-publishing and content marketing. By leveraging the power of Amazon KDP and other major platforms, you can take control of your content and reach a wider audience.",

They spend days trying to get the background color of every page just right. They look at other people’s blogs and wonder what it would take to make a blog that looks similar.\nIn other words, they stress out about the technical details of running a blog.\nHere’s the thing.\nThe technical side of blogging is important, however, it is not the ultimate critical factor that determines the success or failure of your blog. You can be an expert at hosting, word press, and content creation but still fail to receive any tangible success from your blog.\nThis is why, in this course, we leave the technical stuff behind. Instead, we focus on the components of blogging that empower you to make a difference and help others.\nFor example, you’ll learn\nThe hidden structure of the perfect blog post\nHow to make progress using the SPIN formula\nHow to make your blog more interesting\nHow to get readers for your blog\nand so much more.\n\nYou can see a complete list of the lessons available to you by scrolling to the bottom of this page.\nEvery lesson is filled with practical direction packaged in enjoyable, straight-to-the-point videos, worksheets, and quizzes.

You’re Already Making a Difference if you take this course today.\nThe money you pay to take this course will help me continue to further my mission to help orphans all over the world.\nSo far, I’ve touched Uganda, Congo, Nigeria, Haiti, UAE, and Mexico. My blog is an important part of this work and I have no plans of stopping anytime soon.\nIf you want to help people, you can. If you want to make a difference, you can.

All you really need is a PC or Mac and a broadband connection - plus a desire to write and a bit of flair. Three months from now that could all become a reality. You will be a copywriter!\n\"After just a few months I am writing sales copy for a huge experiential company, as well as technical copy for a well-respected tech-industry publication and building websites for small businesses.\" Martin Brennan.\nUnlike so many guides on the subject, it's not a jumped-up list of 'useful phrases'. It won't tell you 'how to make a million dollars overnight'. Instead it is a unique, detailed step-by-step guide to becoming a successful freelance copywriter working from home, from scratch.\n\nStep by step\nFollow each step and you can make between £300 ($450) a day and - with more experience - £500 ($750) a day. Not exactly a get rich quick formula, but a very respectable income. Especially for someone who is their own boss, has few overheads, doesn't have to commute to work, and chooses exactly how much or how little work they want to take on. Because my website has been live for some time now, I get more than I need and have to turn work away.\n\nIs it possible?\nSure, and in this guide I will show you – in detail – everything you need to know. Things like:\n• How to begin from scratch and quickly build a portfolio\n• How to find clients - fast\n• How to market yourself\n• How to build a copywriter website in just five days - for free\n• How to find the most profitable projects and drop the rest\n• How much to charge\n\nIn fact, I will even share my killer 'terms and conditions' that enable me to close more business at higher prices. I will:\n\n• Introduce you to the jargon – no getting caught out as a beginner\n• Show how to walk your clients through a brief, how to research topics, how to write for print and how to write for the web\n• We will look at different writing styles (or 'tone of voice' as the marketing people call it).\n• I will teach you questioning techniques for telephone interviews (I do all my work over the net and by phone) and show you some clever, low cost phone recording kit and transcription software so that you won't even have to take notes\n• Plus lots of tricks of the trade that save valuable time and mark you out as a real pro\n\nAnd give you stacks of links to real samples of different types of copy, templates, tick lists and so on, plus more detailed descriptions of some of the topics covered in this book (build your own free library).

      "description": "Both left and right, we hear of inexperienced individuals who jump into the audiobook publishing business and start making passive income, sometimes even as high as five or six figures. And although I cannot give you any promises, I have cashed in on it myself. In fact, 80% of my income consists of audio books. It pays for all of my bills and more. Books I published 3 years ago, are still making money. Go figure.\nRecently, when I was watching TV, I saw an Audible commercial. Amazon is doing everything in their reach to pull people into their audio book store and to gain a higher market share. This means they are getting more and more listeners and customers each day.\nThe demand is increasing. As of now, estimates are that just in the United States, about 85 million people listen to audio books. Audible amounts for about 41%, experts say, so about 35 million listeners. Stats also claim audiobook customers listen to an average of 15 books per year. That means almost 1.3 billion books are being listened to each year, just in the USA alone (about 0,52 billion on Audible). These are amazing business opportunities!\nBut the competition is increasing as well. More publishers are finding out how well audiobooks sell, and every day, new books are being published. With about 425,000 published and about 10,000 new titles arriving each year. So how can you even compete? By knowing what you're doing! By knowing where the money is! And still, the ratio customers to publishers shows us just how great the opportunity is. Listeners across the world are waiting for your books! There aren't enough out there yet!\nWhen I tell neighbors, friends, and family what I do for a living, most of them admit to listen to audiobooks quite regularly. If there is anything on the rise, it's audiobooks.  There has never been a better opportunity to publish a truckload of audio books and make considerate profit. So my invitation to you is: Don't be left out! Get your hands on that money now while the market is still hot, new, and on the rise!",

Abhorred it.\nI wasn't any good at it. Not at all.\nThat was over six years ago.\nToday,\nI have over 15k followers on Medium and I'm a top writer in Entrepreneurship, Ideas, Startups, and Creativity.\nI'm a columnist for Inc. Magazine where I interview people like Shark Tank's billionaire Daymond John, NPR's host of How I Built This Guy Raz, and top CEOs of huge national companies like Jersey Mike's Subs and Orange Theory.\nI started a top publication on Medium and have grown it to over 87,000 followers, gaining 125 new followers a day. I wrote the 7th most popular story on Medium in 2015. Michael Hyatt, Chairman and former CEO of Thomas Nelson Publishers commented personally on my article.\nMy writing has been published in Chase News, Thought Catalog, CNBC, Business Insider, Quartz, Axios, Smashing Magazine, The Next Web, Forbes, and more.\nI wrote a 386-page novel (the size of The Hobbit) and self-published it on Amazon.\nIn this course, I want to share with you everything I've learned so that you can become a well-paid, reputable writer with the ability to attract thousands of followers.\nMy videos are vulnerable and transparent. As we spend time together, I'll open up about my journey from the very beginning.\nHere's the truth: Anyone can write online and start a blog, but not everyone can make money as a writer. A lot of courses will teach you how to blog but they leave out the crucial entrepreneurial aspects of becoming a successful writer. I want to share with you how I generate revenue with rates at $1/word, $500/article, and $100/hour.\nI want to give you my formulas for viral articles, tools for saving time, tips for getting wide exposure, and strategies for building a passionate following online. But you'll need to be open to unlearning (almost) everything you've learned about writing in school.\nInstead, you'll learn practical skills including how to pitch your work to major publications, how to create science-backed case studies that clients pay for, how to write an ebook, how to easily self-publish a physical book.\nWe'll also dispel myths about how to find your writing voice and how to get into your creative flow so you can produce your best work. You'll learn my formulas for how to write outstanding blog posts, how to craft captivating headlines, and how to \"launch\" your work.\nFinally, the deepest outcomes you'll come away with after you've completed this course are:\nA strong confidence in yourself as a professional writer. It took me years to feel confident as a writer. And while there are no shortcuts to true success, this course will give you a framework to develop your personal confidence in your writing ability -- the kind of confidence that empowers you to persist through seasons of self-doubt, sharp criticism, and financial troughs.\nA rare and lucrative writing expertise. Not everyone can stand out from the crowd, but you'll learn how experts elevate their personal brands, attract swathes of readers, and build a generous income.\nWho this course is for:\nBeginning and ambitious bloggers who want to take their writing to the next level\nWriters who aren't making money online but want to\nSmall business owners whose blog isn't getting any traffic\nMarketers who want their brands to get serious PR exposure\nWriters who want to specialize in marketable content creation skills and work from anywhere",
