      "description": "Governmental accounting, including fund accounting financial transactions, focusing on the general fund and government-wide activities.\nWe will work through many example problems as we learn the material, posting transactions to a trial balance, so we can see how accounts behave. Many governmental accounts are new to many learners, and we will be using different accounting methods than just an accrual method. Posting transactions and seeing a trial balance will be very helpful in learning the material and is something lacking in most courses on the subject.\nWe will discuss the governmental accounting objectives and reporting requirements, comparing them to for-profit entities. The course will assume we are familiar with for-profit accounting and will, therefore, focus on the areas of governmental accounting that are different, although we will continue to work with core concepts like the double entry accounting system.\nLearners and instructor will examine state and local governmental accounting principles & financial reporting.\nWe will record transactions for budgetary accounts & encumbrances. Recording budgetary accounts will be new for many learners familiar with financial accounting, but we will use double entry accounting principles for the process.\nThe course will explain and analyze governmental operating statement accounts & budgetary accounts.\nLearners and instructor will record transactions for encumbrances, expenditures, & delinquent receivables. We will emphasize when a modified accrual method will be used, and what the differences in recording financial transactions will be when used, as compared to an accrual method.\nWe will record transactions related to revenue in both the General Fund and at the government-wide activities level.\nThe course will discuss tax anticipation notes and how they will be recorded under a modified accrual method.\nLearners and instructor will explore many examples of the closing process, closing out temporary accounts. We will compare the closing process for governmental entities to the closing process in for-profit accounting.\nWe will examine how to create subsidiary ledgers related to revenue, estimated revenue, appropriations, encumbrances, and expenditures.\nThe course will provide examples of recording supplies using the consumption method and purchases method, explaining the differences between the two.",

Using collections strategies, you can evaluate and prioritize customers from a receivables management view. Customers that fulfill the rules defined in a strategy are distributed to worklists.\nCollection management is the term most used to describe the area of librarianship that deals with collections. Collection management incorporates the variety of functions involved in selecting, acquiring, storing, and maintaining collections in a cost-effective manner.\nThese stages start with selection, acquisitions processing, cataloguing and press marking and go through to preservation, conservation, storage, retrieval, and the de-accession of duplicates.\nA collection group is a group of collection specialists (see also the characteristic Collection Specialist) whose worklists are created according to the same collection strategy (see also the characteristic Collection Strategy).\nBuckets: Used to collect the sap as it drips from the spile. Lids: Attached to the top of the bucket to prevent rain, snow, and foreign material from entering the bucket. Drill Bit: Depending upon the type of spile used, either a 5/16 or 7/16 drill bit is used to drill the tap hole into your maple tree.\nClaim Management ensures that subsequent claims against the contract partner, resulting from variances, can be prepared, and submitted at the appropriate moment, or claims by the contract partner can be headed off.",

      "description": "Accounting tips to prevent fraud in business\nYou meet many people in your life while you are in business. Are you a business owner, or do you want to help someone save their company from scammers?\nAt some point, a small business becomes vulnerable because scammers primarily target small and medium-sized enterprises due to a lack of security. Therefore, you need to be proactive and establish security measures to prevent losing your business.\nTherefore, I have clearly explained the accounting system you can implement to prevent fraud in your business. My first piece of advice for an entrepreneur is to have a basic understanding of bookkeeping. Then, you will realize the massive help that will help you with your issues. You will learn how to prevent fraud in your business by setting up proper accounting systems in your industry.\nWho is this course for\n• Small business owners.\n• Anyone looking for a job?\n• Students who want to learn bookkeeping.\n• Working from home on a job related to fraud prevention.\nThe implication of separating the accounting duties is that it will show the benefit of avoiding mistakes and dishonest work. I will show you a small example here. Say you sell goods on credit, allowing the sales staff to make sales. If so, you should not allow the sales staff to collect and record them. It is not the proper way to account for your sales, indicating that you have not implemented sufficient internal control in your accounting systems.\nWhat you will learn as an entrepreneur\n• Implement effective methods to prevent fraud.\n• How to separate the accounting duties.\n• How can mistakes in accounting work be avoided? They can lead to fraud.\n• The necessity to implement internal control.\n• The need to train your employees.\nTo ensure your business's success, it is essential to establish and enforce internal controls. It helps in many ways. When someone performs bookkeeping work on an ongoing basis and goes on leave, another person with accounting knowledge is allowed to take over the same job; therefore, this work helps identify the company's policy irregularities.\nIf you are a start-up, one of your initial tasks will be documenting the procedures of each accounting task that will ultimately become the internal control enforceable in your business. Therefore, every new staff member will read those procedures and work accordingly. Protecting the company from scammers becomes the most critical part of its survival.\nAnother vital aspect of the business's survival is excellent planning, including creating a comprehensive business plan, maintaining a budget, and ensuring effective cash flow management, as well as participating in the internal control process. When you write your business plan, you will clarify all aspects of your marketing, financial, and operational plans.\nA budget must be established to ensure that any business stays within its allocated limits. Otherwise, things will get out of hand, and the company will end up in a financial mess. Daily cash flow checks are another way to monitor outgoings and incomings, ensuring that the cash balance remains positive.\nTherefore, maintaining an effective accounting system, enforcing internal controls, and following up on written procedures will help prevent fraud and support business growth.\nMy online course explanation will help you keep you and your business safe if you follow the tips carefully.",

      "description": "Welcome to Accounting and Bookkeeping with Python & Generative AI course. This is a comprehensive tutorial for accountants and business owners who are interested in using AI for automating repetitive accounting tasks, improving accuracy in financial reporting, and enhancing the auditing process. This course is a perfect combination between accounting and artificial intelligence, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in financial accounting. In the introduction session, you will learn how AI and Python can be used to automate accounting tasks, such as categorizing transactions, generating financial reports, detecting transaction duplicates, and processing invoices. Then, in the next section, you will learn how to automate bookkeeping using Python. Firstly, we are going to calculate profit and loss by analyzing revenue and expense data systematically. This will help us understand the financial performance of the business over a specific period. Afterward, we are also going to calculate fixed assets depreciation using Python. This will enable us to accurately reflect asset value reductions on the balance sheet. Then, after that, we are going to track accounts receivable and payable to monitor incoming and outgoing payments efficiently. This allows us to maintain healthy cash flow and timely manage outstanding balances. In the next section, we are going to visualize expense data breakdown using Matplotlib. This will help us to identify major cost drivers and optimize spending. Following that, we are going to detect anomalies and duplicate transactions automatically using Python. This will allow us to reduce errors and prevent potential fraud in accounting records. Then, we are also going to automate invoice matching by comparing purchase orders, invoices, and payment data seamlessly. This will help us to streamline the accounts payable process without having to manually cross check documents one by one. Following that, we are going to automate bank reconciliation by matching bank statement transactions with internal records. This enables us to quickly identify discrepancies and maintain clean financial records. We are also going to automate tax calculation by applying relevant tax rules to each transaction accurately. This allows us to ensure compliance during tax season. In the next section we will leverage machine learning for forecasting monthly expenses, specifically we will build a forecasting model using Gated Recurrent Unit. In addition to that, we are also going to automate invoice processing using optical character recognition, specifically, we will extract text from uploaded invoice images using Tesseract. In the next section, we are going to create a system that is able to categorize transactions and generate financial statements from transaction data input using Deepseek and Open Router AI. This will help us automate data classification and streamline the financial reporting process. Following that, we are going to generate comprehensive financial reports using ChatGPT. This will enable us to transform raw data into easy to understand summaries and quickly produce insightful reports for decision-makers. Next, we are going to automate payroll processing using Microsoft Copilot. This will help us accurately calculate employee salaries, deductions, and taxes, ensuring timely and error free payroll management. Then, after that, we are going to automate journal entry creation using Claude AI. This will enable us to interpret transaction details and generate appropriate accounting entries with accurate debit and credit postings, ensuring the ledger remains balanced. Lastly, at the end of the course, we are going to analyze and summarize the cash flow statement using Julius AI. This will help us provide clear insights into company financial health, identify key trends, and make more informed strategic decisions.\nFirstly before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we use Python and AI for automating accounting tasks? Well, here is my answer, by outsourcing some of the work to AI, accountants will be able to save time by handling repetitive tasks quickly and accurately, reducing the chance of human error. Additionally, it allows accountants to focus more on strategic analysis and advisory roles instead of dealing with repetitive tasks.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn how to use generative AI and Python to automate repetitive accounting tasks\nLearn how to calculate and display profit and loss statement using Python\nLearn how to visualise expense data using Matplotlib\nLearn how to detect anomaly and duplicate transactions using Python\nLearn how to automate tax calculation using Python\nLearn how to calculate fixed assets depreciation using Python\nLearn how to match invoice with purchase order using Python\nLearn how to track account receivable and account payable using Python\nLearn how to automate bank reconciliation with Python\nLearn how to forecast monthly expense using machine learning\nLearn how to process invoice and receipt using optical character recognition\nLearn how to categorize transaction using Deep Seek AI\nLearn how to generate financial statement using Deep Seek AI\nLearn how to create financial report template using ChatGPT\nLearn how to create journal entry using Claude AI\nLearn how to automate payroll processing using Microsoft Copilot\nLearn how to analyze cash flow statement using Julius AI",

      "description": "This course has been redesigned based on valuable student feedback, with the most recent major update completed in March 2025.\nEveryone would love to be able to trade and earn money in the stock market, but very few do because they don't know how to do it.\nCan we fly airplanes or drive cars without knowing how to? We could certainly try, but the results would be disastrous, to say the least.\nWhy would anyone think they could just open a trading account and start making money in the stock market?\nUnfortunately people do that and the results are bad: 90% of retail traders (you and I) lose money in the stock market within the first year and never recover.\nTrading is a skill just like any other and it can be learned.\nTrading has 3 critical components to it:\nMarket analysis: Understand current market condition (bull market, bear market, sideways market) and know how to position one\nStrategy: Before entering any trade we need to know the risk involved (how much we are willing to risk), reasons for entering a trade (breakout...) and where to exit if price does go as predicted (where to take profit and where to place stop losses). And then we need to trade the stock (or ETF) that has the best chance to make a profitable trade (risk/reward ratio)\nManagement: You don't just throw on trades and hope they make money.

You'll tackle questions on diverse topics within Cost Management, including how companies track costs, understand different costing systems like activity-based costing (ABC), and even how they handle joint product costs. For Planning and Budgeting, you'll practice creating various types of budgets, like master budgets and flexible budgets, and understand different forecasting techniques. The Performance Management section will challenge you on variance analysis and measuring how well departments or products are doing. And of course, Internal Controls will test your knowledge of how businesses protect their assets and ensure accurate financial reporting.\nThese MCQs aren't just about finding the right answer; many courses provide detailed explanations for why each option is correct or incorrect. This feedback loop is incredibly valuable for truly grasping the concepts, reinforcing your understanding of the underlying data and logic. It’s an efficient way to identify your strong points and pinpoint areas needing more study, ensuring you're well-prepared and confident for the actual CMA Part 1 exam .",

      "description": "This comprehensive, hands-on course is designed to bridge the gap between foundational accounting concepts and their practical application in Excel.\nThe course begins by working with a structured Excel data file containing two months of financial transactions. Instead of using the traditional approach of debits and credits, transactions are formatted using the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) to provide greater clarity and ease of understanding. From there, you will create an Adjusting Entry Worksheet to handle end-of-period adjustments. Participants will learn to identify and process common adjusting entries found in accounting textbooks, such as accruals, deferrals, and depreciation. The course also explores real-world complications, such as unique adjustments encountered when using accounting software, providing valuable insights into professional scenarios.\nAs the course progresses, you will transition seamlessly from adjustments to generating key financial statements, including the Balance Sheet, which offers a snapshot of the company’s financial position, and the Income Statement, summarizing revenue and expenses to determine profitability. Step-by-step guidance will be provided on formatting these statements in Excel to ensure accuracy, clarity, and compliance with standard accounting practices.\nThe course concludes by mastering reversing entries, an optional but important part of the accounting cycle. You will learn the rationale behind reversing entries and their role in simplifying bookkeeping for subsequent periods. This section emphasizes the distinction between the adjustment process, which is made at period-end, and the bookkeeping process, which is ongoing.\nBy the end of the course, participants will master the use of Excel for organizing and processing financial data, develop a clear understanding of the accounting cycle from data input to financial statement preparation, and gain practical experience in handling adjustments, including complex scenarios encountered in real-world accounting. You will also learn to produce financial statements directly from Excel data and understand the theory and application of reversing entries, enabling efficient bookkeeping practices. This course is ideal for students, professionals, and business owners looking to streamline their accounting processes and enhance financial accuracy.",

Accruals and prepayments—also known as deferrals—are the key mechanisms that allow businesses to match income and expenses to the periods in which they actually occur, rather than when cash is received or paid. This accurate matching is critical for creating financial statements that reflect the true performance and position of a business.\n\n\nUnfortunately, these concepts can be tricky to grasp. That’s why this course breaks them down in a way that’s clear, practical, and easy to apply—whether you’re preparing financial reports, studying for exams, or managing real-world accounting tasks.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Learn in This Course:\nIntroduction to Accruals\nUnderstand how to account for revenues and expenses that have been earned or incurred, but not yet received or paid.\nUnderstanding Prepayments (Deferrals)\nLearn how to handle payments made in advance and how they are treated in the accounting cycle.\nAccruals vs. Prepayments\nCompare and contrast these key concepts, and discover how they interact in journal entries, ledgers, and financial statements.\nThe Role of Deferrals in Financial Accounting\nGet a solid grasp of deferral accounting and how prepayments are spread across periods to reflect accurate financial data.\nReal-World Applications and Examples\nStudy practical examples and scenarios that demonstrate the real impact of accruals and prepayments on business reporting.\nHands-On Practice: Journal Entries & T-Accounts\nStrengthen your accounting skills with exercises that reinforce how to record accruals and prepayments using proper accounting techniques.\nAvoiding Common Mistakes\nIdentify frequent errors in accounting for accruals and prepayments that can misstate financial results—and learn how to avoid them.\n\n\nBy the End of This Course, You’ll Be Able To:\nAccurately record and adjust accruals and prepayments in any financial accounting system.\nUnderstand the impact of deferrals on income statements and balance sheets.\nPrepare cleaner, more reliable financial statements that support smarter decision-making.\nApproach exams, audits, or business reviews with clarity and confidence in your accounting knowledge.\nApply best practices in adjusting entries and period-end closing for accruals and prepayments.\n\n\nWho This Course is For:\nAccounting students seeking to master advanced financial accounting concepts\nEntrepreneurs and business owners looking to improve financial accuracy\nJunior accountants and bookkeepers enhancing their professional skills\nFinance professionals preparing for audits, or financial reporting duties\n\n\nThis course is practical, engaging, and built for real-world application. It doesn’t just explain theory—it helps you do the accounting, with confidence.\nIf you’re ready to unlock the power of accruals, prepayments, and deferrals, and take your accounting skills to the next level, then this course is for you.\nEnroll today and become confident in one of the most crucial aspects of financial accounting.\n\n\nYour journey to mastering accruals and prepayments starts now.",

Each new topic is introduced and then it is explained using a mixture of videos of myself teaching in a classroom, cartoons explaining the important concepts and then detailed teaching of each topic. At the end of each section there is a short quiz to ensure you understood that section. Answers and explanations are given.\nThe course is designed to be as practical as possible.

      "description": "Contabilidade: Débitos e Créditos (CDC). Nesse curso veremos a contabilidade no seu melhor modo \"raiz\", com diversas resoluções manuais de exemplos e exercícios envolvendo os registros contábeis de operações comerciais. Tudo acontecerá com suporte da utilização dos tradicionais razonetes (contas \"T\").\n\nAo mesmo tempo, o conteúdo CDC integra ferramentas tecnológicas como a disponibilização de planilhas, demonstrações contábeis publicadas e materiais complementares de estudo que são acrescidos com dicas de carreira, curiosidades sobre a profissão e tópicos avançados ao longo das 10 seções do curso.\n\nSeja você aluno de curso técnico, graduação, pós-graduação ou estudante de concurso, este curso é para você que quer aprender contabilidade ou aprofundar os conhecimentos já existentes!\n\n\nAprenda os registros contábeis por meio dos débitos e créditos;\nCompreenda os conceitos ativos, passivos e patrimônio líquido das Demonstrações Financeiras (DFs);\nConheça a relação das Receitas (e ganhos) e das Despesas (além dos custos e perdas) com as Demonstrações Contábeis;\nPratique a elaboração da Demonstração do Resultado do Exercício (DRE) e do Balanço Patrimonial (BP);\nContabilize as operações financeiras por meio de exemplos práticos e observações de exemplos de grandes empresas.\n\n\nBenefícios: caso seja iniciante no tema, que tal aprender pela forma tradicional dos razonetes contábeis aplicando os débitos e créditos? Já se você tem conhecimento prévio nos temas, que tal acompanhar os artigos, normas e materiais complementares disponibilizados nos tópicos avançados?\n\nUm curso vitalício e VIVO. O objetivo do CDC é ser um curso que faça valer a pena o acesso vitalício da Udemy. Cada atualização mensal é um convite a revisitar o curso e fixar, por meio de novos exercícios, os conceitos assimilados anteriormente e os conteúdos disponibilizados previamente. Quem se ausentar durante um tempo terá uma agradável surpresa ao retornar para a plataforma e visualizar a nossa Seção 11: Conteúdo Adicional.\n\n\nVisão Geral do Curso. Você será capaz de compreender os principais elementos relacionados com o Balanço Patrimonial (BP) e a Demonstração do Resultado do Exercício (DRE) em conformidade com os Pronunciamentos Técnicos de Contabilidade (CPC), além de uma visão geral sobre todas as Demonstrações Contábeis obrigatórias e o processo do Brasil de convergência ao padrão global.\n\n\nOportunidade: o Brasil adotou o padrão global de contabilidade (IASB). Essa adoção aconteceu por meio da Lei 11.638/2007 que modificou a Lei 6.404/76 (Lei das S.A.) e tornou a contabilidade brasileira usuária do mesmo conjunto de normas (IFRS) de mais de outras 160 jurisdições. Além disso, o CFC publicou Normas Brasileiras de Contabilidade (NBCs) que aproximam a contabilidade das médias, pequenas e microentidades das regras internacionais. Ou seja, o que você aprender aqui, é utilizado em todos os países que aderiram ao padrão global de contabilidade.\n\n\nComo diferencial, o CDC possui uma centena de exercícios objetivos para a prática dos conteúdos aprendidos. Mais de uma centena de recursos para download estão esperando por você de modo a organizar os seus estudos com normas, cases, slides e materiais de aula. Tudo preparado com muita dedicação ao longo de mais de 250 aulas, 30 horas, 10 seções, além da constante atualização por meio de novas aulas.\n\nAo final do curso, além do certificado de 31 horas do curso Contabilidade: Débitos e Créditos, você será capaz de compreender os principais elementos relacionados com o Balanço Patrimonial (BP) e a Demonstração do Resultado do Exercício (DRE) em conformidade com os Pronunciamentos Técnicos de Contabilidade (CPC), além de uma visão geral sobre todas as Demonstrações Contábeis obrigatórias e o processo do Brasil de convergência ao padrão de contabilidade global.\n\nObrigado pelo interesse e nos vemos no CDC.\nUm grande abraço,\n\nProf. Robson Pereira\nContabilidade: Débitos e Créditos (CDC)",

      "description": "Our comprehensive Financial Accounting & Analysis certification program teaches the essential accounting concepts and skills for practical financial statement analysis, looking at real-world data and applications. This course will prepare you for careers in investment banking, private equity, business valuation, and corporate finance.\nThis program is intended to act as a solid foundation for anyone needing to interpret financial information from internal or external clients. It establishes the key links between the primary financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement) before looking at accounting issues, discretion, analysis and interpretation – and why it all matters.

      "description": "Udemyメディアにて、本コースが紹介されました！！\n⇒『2020上半期のUdemy売れ筋講座TOP5（ビジネススキル編）』（2020/08/19）\nlifehacker様にて、本コースが紹介されました！！\n⇒『本とオンライン講座のハイブリット学習法を始めるチャンス』（2020/12/30）\nPIVOT公式チャンネルに出演して、本コースを紹介させていただきました！！\n⇒『【決算書を読む技術】知識ゼロでも図解で決算書が読める／キーエンスの決算書を分析／ビジネスパーソン必須スキル／Udemy人気講師が実演』（2025/1/3）\n\n\n決算書ぐらい読めるようにならないと、と思いつつ何から始めればいいのか分からない\n日経新聞を読んでも３～４割くらいしか分からない\n取引先で、知らない会計用語が話に出て冷や汗をかいた\n会議の席で決算書の話題になり、「分かってないのは自分だけかも？」と不安になった\n売上や利益は分かるけど、貸借対照表やキャッシュ・フロー計算書はよく分からない\nこのような経験や悩み、ないでしょうか？\n\n\n「会計はビジネスの共通言語」という言葉がある通り、会計はすべてのビジネスパーソンにとって必須のスキルです。\nにもかかわらず、実際は、その「共通言語」をあまり理解していない、という声をよく聞きます。\n\n\n本コースでは、その「会計」の中核である「決算書の読み方」を簡単に身につけることができます。\n\n\nこれまで、講師が開催していた集合研修や有料セミナー（数万円の受講料）の内容を、\nオンライン学習用にカスタマイズしたのが本コースです。\n\n\n決算書が読めるようになりたいと思いつつも、\n決算書は、数字の羅列のようで、どこからどう読んでいいのか分からない\n財務分析の公式を覚えても、すぐ忘れてしまう\nという方も多いと思います。\n\n\nそうなってしまう要因は、\n「数字」を「数字」のまま捉えようとするからです。\nいまだに多くのビジネスパーソンが会計に苦手意識を持っているのは、\n「数字」を「数字」のまま捉えて学習しているからなのです。\n\n\n講師が試行錯誤の末、編み出したメソッドは、\n「数字」を「図」に置き換えて把握する手法です。\n\n\n一般に、左脳は言語情報（文字や数字）を司り、右脳は非言語情報（図や映像）を司ると言われています。\nそして、右脳は左脳と比べて、100万倍の記憶定着率がある、とも言われています。\n決算書は、そのほとんどが数字で書かれています。\nだから、難解で取っつきにくいのです。\nそこで、当コースでは、\n決算書に書かれている「数字」を「図」に置き換える手法を使います。\n決算書を簡単な図に置き換えて、その図を使って理解することが、\n脳の性質上、最も理にかなっているからです。\n\n\nそのため、本講座は、\n【理解しやすく、忘れにくく、再現性が高い】\nという特徴があります。\n\n\n講師はこれまで、企業研修や公開セミナーなど、様々な場で登壇してきた経験を持ち、\n延べ1万人以上もの受講者に対してレクチャーしてきました。\n受講者のほとんどが、会計に苦手意識のあるビジネスパーソンです。\nだからこそ、受講者がどんなところでつまずいてしまうのか、どんな説明なら理解しやすいかを熟知しています。\nまた、会計の専門家であるため、\n初心者にとって「重要な箇所」と「重要ではない箇所」を明確に分けることができます。\nだから、最短ルートで決算書が読めるようになります。\n\n\nこれまで、\n「会計は自分に向いてない」\n「数字の羅列を見ただけで吐き気がする」\nという受講者も多数いましたが、\n驚くべきことに、そんな受講者も、\n「こんなに簡単だったんだ」\n「もっと早く知っておけばよかった」\nと感想を漏らすほど、分かりやすさに定評がある講座です。\n\n\nだから、あなたでもきっと大丈夫！\n\n\n「会計」は、\nあなたがすでに持っているビジネススキルと掛け合わせることができるので、\nビジネスにおいて大きな武器になります。\n「ＩＴ」×「会計」\n「営業」×「会計」\n「マーケティング」×「会計」\nなどなど・・・\n\n\nこの講座を受講することで、\nあなたも社内外で一目置かれる存在になるでしょう。\n\n\nちなみに、株式投資をする方にも有益な講座です。\nウォーレン・バフェット氏もこんなことを言ってます。\n「会計を学ぶ努力をしない限り、そして財務諸表を読んで理解する努力をしない限り、自分で株の銘柄を選択することなど夢のまた夢である」\n\n\nさあ、あなたもこのコースを受講して、一生モノの会計スキルを手に入れましょう！",

Specifically, we will learn the concept of debits and credits and how to determine the balance of any account. From there, we discuss the \"normal\" balances of accounts (i.e. how to increase an account.) We will also learn how to use those concepts to prepare initial and adjusting journal entries, post them to the T accounts/general ledger accounts, and create financial statements. The financial statements include the income statement, the statement of retained earnings, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. Finally, we will prepare and post closing entries to end the accounting period. Along the way we will be discussing three different types of trial balances: unadjusted, adjusted, and post closing. This course includes text materials, as well as various videos that have been embedded into the course. This is a free course to provide you with the basics of bookkeeping to get you started in the field of accounting. I hope you find that you enjoy it as much as I have. I look forward to working with you throughout the course.",

From understanding the basics of stocks and trading to unraveling complex market trends and investment strategies, this course equips you with the knowledge to confidently navigate India's financial landscape. Dive into stock market terminology, analyze historical data, learn about regulatory frameworks, and discover how to make informed investment decisions. Whether you're a novice or an aspiring investor, this crash course empowers you to unlock opportunities and maximize your potential in the Indian stock market.\"\nIn the Indian stock market, the primary market and the secondary market play distinct roles in facilitating the buying and selling of securities. Let's delve deeper into each:\n\n\nPrimary Market: The primary market is the initial platform where companies issue new securities, such as stocks or bonds, to raise capital directly from investors. This process is known as the Initial Public Offering (IPO) when a company offers its shares to the public for the first time. The primary market allows companies to access funds to finance their expansion, research, or other projects.\n\n\nSecondary Market: The secondary market, also known as the stock market, is where previously issued securities, like stocks and bonds, are bought and sold among investors. This is the realm of trading after the initial issuance in the primary market.\n\n\nIn summary, the primary market is where companies issue new securities to raise capital, while the secondary market is where previously issued securities are traded among investors. Both markets are crucial components of the Indian stock market ecosystem, contributing to the capital formation process and providing investment opportunities for individuals and institutions.\n\n\nIntroduction to Technical Analysis: Technical analysis is a method used to evaluate securities (such as stocks, bonds, or currencies) by analyzing statistical trends and historical price and volume data. It aims to predict future price movements based on past market data and patterns. Technical analysts believe that all relevant information about a security is reflected in its price and trading volume.\n\n\nIntroduction to Fundamental Analysis: Fundamental analysis involves evaluating the intrinsic value of a security by analyzing various factors that can influence its price, including financial statements, macroeconomic indicators, industry trends, and management quality. The goal is to determine whether a security is overvalued or undervalued relative to its actual worth.\n\n\nAfter completing this crash course, be your own boss, Be a trading pro, be a trader or investor, you may choose service provider of your choice and start your own stock trading business with free demat and trading account, may be tagged or untagged with your saving account.\n\n\nYour own financial world on your fingertip.

      "description": "I created this online course, \"How do the control accounts in accounting help your business?\" to help small business owners and bookkeeping students as they can benefit a lot from it. This course can be helpful to entrepreneurs and check cash flow and the business's budget. It can be beneficial for bookkeeping students to learn about control accounts and practice their format.\nSo, the crucial benefit of implementing control accounts is preventing irregularity and business fraud.\nHere, you will learn about a control account, the types of control accounts, and how to use that in your business. Even though the two main control accounts widely used are the sales ledger control account and the purchase ledger control. I have mentioned a few more control accounts in this course, such as wages control, inventory control, internal control, and cost control accounts.\nBesides, you will know about finding funds for business using the methods in accounting; further, if you need an investor for your business, it shows how to find an investor—additionally, the necessities of the sources of funding. You might wonder how a new start-up can promote the business without funds. I have explained that in this course.\nLarges organizations employ staff to maintain these control accounts, which helps increase productivity, accuracy, and ease when preparing financial statements and preventing fraud. If you have a manufacturing business having a cost control account allows you to keep all the costs related to the production under control and constant comparisons with the budget, keeping expenses under control.\nUsually, a small business owner keeps all its transactions in one book, extracting the balance from that book and preparing the accounts for submissions.\nIf the business grows, the owner must set up control accounts to avoid mistakes and delays in preparing reports as needed for timely submission to the tax department. Besides, the system must fix while extracting the trial balance. Therefore, it is essential to implement control accounts in the business; otherwise, they will not avoid problems and lose money.\nIt is a valuable course for business owners and students trying to learn bookkeeping, but you must pay attention when reading the study.\nI am sure you will like this course as it helps people like you in many ways.\nThank you for picking my course; please leave a review if you can use it for the best.",

Rental Property Management is a unique service that requires bookkeeping and accounting methods and techniques that would only apply to the rental property industry. That is why it is best to have the entire tutorial, from start to finish, presented and followed as a landlord. This is the only course that will do that. It also absolutely guarantees the clearest possible explanation and presentation for every possible topic you could need when keeping records of rental property units.\nYou will have total control over your tenants’ rent payments and invoices. You will be able to present them with a rent report and a separate security deposit report that will clearly show how any part was applied to damages and the amount they are entitled to be refunded.\nThis course is so great that you will be able to see your profit and loss by apartment or unit to see if any particle unit or tenant is costing to much. All of the separate reports and records that QuickBooks Desktop will help property managers with all smoothly “tie in” to the main area of financial data that all companies have, the general ledger. So, from the same data, you will have the typical financial reports like: Profit and Loss ( Income Statements), balance sheet and cash flows or anything else. You will enjoy easily learning with very simple set up steps and then simple data entry procedures shown here. Then, you will have complete mastery over your property’s financial records and your tenant reports all in the same place!!\nAlthough everything you see will be simple, you will have expert level knowledge of QuickBooks Desktop when you finish. You really will be able to handle anything you need.",

The account codes organized in a specific logical order in the COA will be used for recording the financial impacts of various transactions.\nWith time the Chart of Accounts may become outdated and pose sever trouble to the Organizations with misleading Financial, Legal and Analytical Reports. It may be because of changing business landscape or business strategies or evolving accounting standards or legal and regulatory changes. It may also be because of legacy CoA inherited by an evolving organization.\nThe financial reports required for the new age businesses not only covers the traditional accounting details of transactions but also the statistical information which is quantities and trends of transaction progression over a period of time.\nThe tussle between the time and quality often results in winning of speed over accuracy and it puts immense pressure on the Financial Comptrollers and the CFOs to ensure that the financial information is captured and analysed quickly with minimal errors.\nIt is important to keep reviewing the COA periodically, consult the finance team on the difficulties they are facing, consult the senior management and stakeholders on the challenges they are facing with the reports and redesign the chart of accounts to ensure that new structure becomes flexible and can accommodate maximum possible foreseeable changes",

      "description": "Der Kurs \"Doppelte Buchhaltung\" bietet seinen Teilnehmern eine fundierte Einführung in das System der doppelten Buchhaltung.\nDie Teilnehmer lernen zunächst, wie man einfache Geschäftsfälle auf Konten verbucht und den gesamten Buchungsstoff am Ende des Geschäftsjahres zu einem Jahresabschluss, bestehend aus zumindest einer Bilanz und einer Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung, verdichtet.\nDie aus der Geschäftstätigkeit resultierenden und im Rahmen der Buchhaltung zu erfassenden steuerlichen Konsequenzen (Umsatzsteuer, Einkommensteuer, Körperschaftsteuer) werden ebenfalls adressiert.\nDarüber hinaus erhalten die Teilnehmer das erforderliche Rüstzeug, um die wirtschaftliche Lage von Unternehmen anhand von Kennzahlen (z.B. Umsatzrentabilität, Eigenkapitalquote, Anlagendeckungsgrad etc.) zu evaluieren.\nEin Ausblick auf die nach International Financial Reporting Standards zu erstellenden Konzernabschlüsse rundet den Kurs ab.\nAn einigen Stellen wird auf die der Buchhaltung zugrunde liegende österreichische Rechtslage Bezug genommen. In der Regel existieren dann jedoch vergleichbare Regelungen in Deutschland und in der Schweiz, so dass der Kurs jedenfalls auch für Personen aus diesen beiden Ländern geeignet ist.\nDer Kurs richtet sich u.a. an nicht-betriebswirtschaftlich geschulte Personen (z.B. Techniker, Juristen etc.), die sich grundlegendes Bilanzierungs-Know-how aneignen möchten, um sich auf diese Weise für gehobene Managementpositionen in Unternehmen zu qualifizieren.\nDie Kursinhalte werden v.a. anhand von kompakten Lehrvideos vermittelt. Zahlreiche Aufgaben und Quizze ermöglichen es den Teilnehmern, die vermittelten Inhalte sofort anzuwenden und so zu festigen.\nFür die Absolvierung des Kurses sind keine besonderen Vorkenntnisse nötig.\nIm Detail werden folgende Themengebiete im Kurs behandelt.\n- externes und internes Rechnungswesen\n- Zwecke von Buchhaltung und Bilanzierung\n- gesetzliche Grundlagen von Buchhaltung und Bilanzierung\n- Verbuchung von Geschäftsfällen\n- Bewertung von Vermögensgegenständen und Schulden\n- Bestandteile eines Jahresabschlusses\n- Prüfung und Offenlegung von Jahresabschlüssen\n- Jahresabschlussanalyse anhand von Kennzahlen\n- Systematik der Umsatzsteuer\n- Gewinnbesteuerung\n- Konzernabschluss\n- International Financial Reporting Standards\nViel Erfolg und Spaß mit dem Kurs \"Doppelte Buchhaltung\" wünscht\nThomas Wala",

Bookkeepers are individuals who manage all financial data for companies. Without bookkeepers, companies would not be aware of their current financial position as well as the transactions that occur within the company. Proper bookkeeping gives companies a reliable measure of their performance. It also provides information to make general strategic decisions and a benchmark for its revenue and income goals. In short once a business is up and running spending extra time and money on maintaining proper records is critical. In order to properly implement bookkeeping companies need to first choose which basis of accounting they will follow . companies can choose between two basic accounting methods: the cash basis of accounting or the accrual basis of accounting. The difference between these types of accounting is based on the timing for when the company actually records a sales or purchase in the books.\nThe first step to mastering your business finances is pretty simple: get a business account and separate your business and personal expenses. Mixing together personal and business expenses in the same account can also result in unnecessary stress when you need to file taxes or do your bookkeeping.",

Student’s questioning the relevance of what they are learning causes students to lose interest. A loss of student interest causes students grades to fall.\nPart of the reason accounting textbooks have a difficult time incorporating the current topic into the big picture is that a textbook is restricted by what can fit on a page and the problems a textbook provides are restricted by what a student can accomplish with paper and pencil.\nThe use of instructional video providing a step by step process along with Excel that allows students to sum up large columns of numbers in a short time provides the tools to create a comprehensive problem that will demonstrate current topics in the context of the entire accounting process.\nWhy Take This Course?\nWe will start to learn the accounting cycle in a comprehensive way and learn the fundamental of Excel.\nLearning the accounting process without Excel or Excel without accounting is a waste of time and not an efficient way to learn either topic.\nLike assets being equivalent to liabilities and equity, accounting is equivalent to Excel in many ways and therefore learning Excel will accelerate our learning of accounting and make what we learn more applicable.\nAccounting is also the perfect tool to learn Excel. This course will not provide a broad overview of everything Excel can do because that is not a way to learn. Courses attempting to demonstrate all the functions Excel fail to create value for learners because learners will not retain what they learn without a foundation of core concepts and a reason for learning each new function.\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of Excel, those components used 99% of the time, and the components needed as a foundation for learning more about Excel.\nThe core components of Excel we will learn include adding, subtracting, and summing up columns of numbers.\nWe will learn the core concept of Excel through demonstration, repetition, and application to practical problems.\nWhat Will Be Included in This Course?\nIn addition to instruction video we include an Excel worksheet with just about every presentation allowing us to both see the completed answer and work through the problems step by step along with the video.\nEach Excel workbook includes at least two tabs. One tab will have the answer so that we can see how the completed worksheet is constructed and the second tab will provide us the opportunity to enter the data along with the instructional video.\nWho Will We Be Learning From?\nWe will be learning from somebody who has practical accounting experience as a practicing CPA, teaching experience, curriculum design experience.\nCredentials include:\nWe are learning from someone who has both instruction and curriculum development experience needed to construct comprehensive courses of a technical nature in a way that meets students’ needs and expectations.\nWhat Will We Learn?\nWe will learn how to complete the components of the accounting cycle and the fundamental of Excel including addition, subtraction, and the sum function.\nBelow is a short list of what is included in the accounting cycle and what we will cover in the course:\nJournalizing journal entries\nPosting to the general ledger\nCreate a trial balance\nFinancial statement generation\nHow Will We Be Taught?\nWe will learn through viewing and then doing.\nWe will demonstrate each component of the problem in small digestible parts using both a completed Excel worksheet and instructional video.\nWe will provide an Excel worksheet that can be filled in along with the instructional video or after watching the instructional video.\nPlease join us in learning Accounting, Excel, debits, and credits.\nIt will be Great\nCourse Content Includes:\nStart a New Business Section of Accounting & Excel Course\n05 Set up New Company Worksheet\n10 Set Up Inventory Items\n15 Set Up Customer Balances\n20 Set Up Vendors Beginning Balances\n25 Enter Opening Account Balances",

You'll gain the skills necessary to handle real-world scenarios, ensuring compliance with key accounting standards like GAAP and IFRS.\nSection 1: Introduction\nThis section serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts of accounting for changes in ownership interest. It provides an overview of the key principles that govern these changes, including how they impact financial reporting.

This foundation is essential for understanding the more complex topics covered in later sections.\nSection 2: Accounting for Changes in Ownership Interest\nThis section focuses on the detailed accounting treatments required when ownership interest in a company changes. It explores different scenarios such as equity transactions between parent companies and non-controlling shareholders and how these transactions are recorded. The section delves into the technical accounting methods that companies use to track ownership changes and their impact on consolidated financial statements. By the end of this section, students will be well-versed in how to record and report various types of ownership adjustments.\nSection 3: Situations in Which a Parent’s Ownership Interest Changes\nIn this section, students will explore a variety of real-world situations where a parent company's ownership in its subsidiary changes. Topics include issuing additional equity shares, equity buybacks, and changes involving non-controlling interests. The section examines the accounting implications of each situation and how it affects the parent and subsidiary’s financial standings. This section is essential for understanding how corporate transactions alter the dynamics between parent companies and their subsidiaries and the reporting challenges these changes can present.\nSection 4: Deconsolidation\nThis section introduces the concept of deconsolidation, which occurs when a parent company loses control over a subsidiary.

      "description": "This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of accounting processes through the practical application of Microsoft Excel. At the outset, students are introduced to a detailed data file containing two months of financial transactions formatted in the accounting equation framework. This file serves as the foundation for the course, allowing students to explore the structure and logic of financial records while learning how to use Excel for organizing and managing accounting data efficiently.\nBuilding on this initial dataset, the course shifts its focus to the General Ledger of the cash account. Students will analyze and reconcile the cash account by comparing the General Ledger entries against a simulated bank statement for the first and second months. The reconciliation process will teach students how to identify and resolve common discrepancies, such as timing differences, data entry errors, and unrecorded transactions. Additionally, students will learn how to make appropriate adjustments in Excel to bring the cash account into alignment with the bank statement, ensuring accurate and balanced financial records.\nThroughout the course, students will gain an in-depth understanding of key accounting principles, including the double-entry system, transaction categorization, and the critical importance of reconciliation in maintaining financial accuracy. The course also emphasizes Excel skills tailored for accounting purposes, such as creating formulas, utilizing functions, managing large datasets, and producing clear financial summaries and reports.\nBy the end of the course, students will have developed a robust skill set that combines theoretical accounting knowledge with practical, Excel-based applications. This course prepares learners to confidently handle real-world financial tasks, whether in professional accounting roles or personal financial management. It also lays the groundwork for more advanced accounting and financial analysis studies.",

W tym kursie księgowości poprowadzę Cię od zerowej wiedzy na  temat rachunkowości finansowej do bardzo, bardzo solidnych podstaw.\nDaję Ci gwarancję, że po rzetelnym przerobieniu ze mną tego kursu poczujesz się jak początkujący samodzielny księgowy. Księgowy, który \"ogarnia\" całość systemu księgowego przedsiębiorstwa i rozumie każdy jego najważniejszy element. Jeśli Cię rozczaruję, zażądaj 100% zwrotu pieniędzy!\nPotrzebujesz porządny kalkulator, brulion A4 w kratkę, długopis, korektor i... wiele, wiele wolnych wieczorów. Ten kurs to nie tylko dużo wykładów, ale i zadań obrachunkowych do samodzielnego przerobienia. Oprócz tego będziemy także studiować fragmenty ustawy o rachunkowości, kodeksu cywilnego, kodeksu spółek handlowych.\nRazem poprowadzimy uproszczone księgi rachunkowe w MS Excelu i sporządzimy sprawozdanie finansowe (bilans, rachunek zysków i strat, informację dodatkową) hipotetycznej spółki w MS Word. Na koniec spróbuję Cię zachęcić do poprowadzenia \"Amerykanki\" w Excelu przez kilka miesięcy.\nBędzie sporo roboty i \"wkuwania\" na sam początek! Ale zysk jest bardzo konkretny i wymierny! Rachunkowość finansowa to międzynarodowy język biznesu. Ucząc się podstaw rachunkowości na tym kursie możesz aplikować o pracę w działach finansowo-księgowych na całym świecie: w Krakowie, Berlinie, Londynie, a nawet Nowym Jorku. Wystarczy oprócz rachunkowości znać język obcy.\nNic też nie otwiera tak oczu na możliwości inwestycyjne i biznesowe, jak właśnie rachunkowość!  W niej bowiem zawarta jest przenikliwość i elegancja myślenia ekonomiczno-finansowego! Zapraszam na kurs księgowości!\nAha! I jeszcze jedno! Zwróć uwagę na super atrakcyjną cenę tego kursu! Gdyby ten kurs był organizowany w formie stacjonarnej w Twoim mieście, to musiałby kosztować Cię ponad 1.000 zł. Ponieważ jest w formie on-line, możesz go mieć poniżej 100 zł!",

All what the learner has to do is to feel the flow of the story and stay connected with all the logical bends therein.

Beginning with a foundational understanding of What is Generative AI, the course explores the shift from traditional automation to AI-driven intelligence in auditing. Participants are introduced to industry-leading tools like ChatGPT which are redefining how auditors engage with data, generate insights, and produce deliverables. A core focus is the automation potential across the audit lifecycle, including summarizing financial statements, reviewing prior-year reports, generating risk assessment matrices, and identifying high-risk financial areas such as revenue recognition and asset impairment.\nReal-world case studies, such as EY’s global deployment of GenAI and AI-assisted risk scoping in a banking audit, demonstrate how major firms are embracing this technology. Learners will practice creating GenAI-generated checklists for engagement planning, control walkthroughs, and test plans for internal controls, along with prompts for evaluating SOX compliance. The course covers advanced applications like AI-supported sampling logic, journal entry testing (JET), variance analysis interpretation, and substantive audit procedures—illustrated through a fintech loan audit case study.\nFraud detection is tackled using GenAI-powered red flag generation, NLP-based text reviews, pattern recognition in expenses, and predictive fraud analytics. Participants will also explore how to draft audit memos, convert emails into evidence, and use GenAI for real-time documentation and cross-referencing. Narrative generation for financial statements, cash flow evaluation, and report drafting is integrated with tone calibration and personalization. With over 1000 audit-specific GenAI prompts, this course empowers auditors to reduce manual effort, increase assurance quality, and deliver faster, smarter, and more informed audits in the AI age.",

Accounts receivables are listed on the balance sheet as a current asset. AR is any amount of money owed by customers for purchases made on credit.\nAccounts receivable is an asset account on the balance sheet that represents money due to a company in the short term.\nAccounts receivables are created when a company lets a buyer purchase their goods or services on credit.\nThe strength of a company’s AR can be analyzed with the accounts receivable turnover ratio or days sales outstanding.\nA turnover ratio analysis can be completed to have an expectation of when the AR will actually be received.\n\n\nJD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Receivable Overview\nAn accounts receivable department plays an important role in managing the cash flow of a business; it is responsible for processing invoices for goods and services sold to customers of an organization and applying payments from these same customers. In addition, the accounts receivable department might want to track payment information about their customers to gather statistical information about their paying habits. By understanding customers better, businesses can provide better customer support and manage their cash flow better.\n\n\nThe JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Receivable system from Oracle helps you manage the cash flow with the flexibility for effective cash management.

We use material ledger to evaluate the stock in their group and profit center valuation. Before using material ledger materials are only valued in their company code currency. If we don’t use material ledger, finished goods will remain in their standard price.\nIn the previous sessions of product costing, we have posted price variance which we roll up to material price using material ledger and update the PUP price.\nMaterial Price Determination Control\nThere are two types of material price determination control\n1. Transaction based\nIn the transaction based only same level price difference can be analyzed. In the transaction based are unable the valuate the inventory at their actual price because the lower-level price difference is not rolled up to the higher level. It is only used to evaluate the inventory in multiple valuation views.\n2. Single / Multi level\nIn the single and multi-level lower level price difference amount will also be rolled up to the actual price of material and the inventory will be valued at their actual price. Price control will be changed to ‘s’ for all the materials. In case of price control ‘v’ lower level price difference will not rolled up to next level.\nSingle Level Price Determination\nIn the single level system identify differences for product and some proportion of amount will be rolled up and the remaining will be added to consumption. Activity price difference will not be rolled up to the closing inventory actual price. In the single level price determination only the material price difference will be rolled up to the inventory actual price.\nMulti Level Price Determination\nIn multi level price determination inventory will be valued at their actual price. Material price difference and activity price difference will be rolled up from raw material to finished good. PUP price for the inventory will be calculated which will be considered as future standard price for the next month. PUP will then further used for\n1. Internal consumption\n2. WIP valuation\n3. Inventory actual price calculation.\nPrice Binding Indicator\nPrice binding indicator is used to fix the price determination of the material master during material master creation. After assignment system will not allow to change the price determination of the material master.\nPrice Unit Price (PUP)\nIn the single & multi level price determination PUP price will be calculated to evaluate the material at its actual price. PUP price is used to evaluate the materials in multiple valuation views.\nMaterial Ledger Update Structure\nMaterial ledger update structure is used to collects the values from different categories of valuation relevant transactions.

      "description": "Laporan keuangan merupakan informasi ekonomi yang menunjukkan performa keuangan suatu perusahaan. Sudah menjadi konsekuensi bagi setiap perusahaan untuk membuat laporan keuangan yang akurat dan dapat diandalkan. Sebagai informasi ekonomi, laporan keuangan digunakan oleh para pemakainya sebagai dasar untuk pengambilan keputusan.\nSementara itu, laporan keuangan dihasilkan dari serangkaian tahapan yang membentuk sebuah siklus. Inilah yang disebut dengan siklus akuntansi. Siklus ini diawali dengan pencatatan transaksi ke dalam jurnal umum, lalu pengelompokkannya ke dalam buku besar dan pembuatan neraca saldo. Setelah itu, proses penyesuaian transaksi dan pembuatan neraca lajur sebagai kertas kerja laporan keuangan. Terakhir adalah membuat laporan keuangan sesuai dengan format yang sudah ditentukan.\nSiklus akuntansi untuk jenis perusahaan jasa, dagang, maupun manufaktur pada dasarnya sama. Yang membedakan adalah akun yang terbentuk dari siklus tersebut dan menjadi komponen atau elemen laporan keuangan. Ada akun yang terdapat pada laporan keuangan untuk ketiga jenis perusahaan tersebut. Di sisi lain, ada akun yang hanya terdapat pada satu jenis perusahaan. Sebagai contoh, akun persediaan barang dagang hanya terdapat pada perusahaan dagang dan manufaktur atau akun persediaan bahan baku yang hanya terdapat pada perusahaan manufaktur.\nTerdapat tiga macam laporan keuangan yang secara umum dihasilkan oleh perusahaan, yaitu laporan laba rugi, neraca, dan laporan perubahan ekuitas. Dari ketiga laporan ini yang menjadi pusat laporan adalah neraca yang menunjukkan posisi keuangan perusahaan. Dari neraca terlihat perubahan modal perusahaan, laba yang diperoleh, sumber pendanaan perusahaan selain modal, dan aset yang dimiliki perusahaan.\nPraktik akuntansi sendiri tidak hanya sebatas pembuatan laporan keuangan, tetapi juga ada proses lainnya, seperti sistem kas kecil, laporan arus kas, rekonsiliasi bank, pencatatan arus persediaan, penetapan cadangan piutang tak tertagih, dan penyusutan aset tetap. Ada beberapa metode yang dapat diterapkan dalam melakukan proses tersebut. Metode ini mengacu kepada ketentuan IFRS yang menjadi acuan standar akuntansi internasional dan juga standar akuntansi Indonesia.\nVideo kursus ini hadir untuk memberikan pengetahuan mengenai konsep dasar akuntansi, pembuatan laporan keuangan pada perusahaan jasa, dagang, dan manufaktur serta metode yang dapat digunakan saat melakukan praktik akuntansi selain pembuatan laporan keuangan. Selamat menyimak video selengkapnya, semoga bermanfaat.",

Income tax is a critical compliance requirement for the payroll department.\nSimilar to other compliances like Provident Fund (PF) and Employees' State Insurance (ESI), income tax compliance involves computing and deducting income tax from employee salaries and remitting the deducted tax to the Income Tax Department with required information in the prescribed format, known as \"filing returns.\"\nThis master course on TDS for Indian payroll aims to educate learners on both aspects of income tax.\nThis part of the master course emphasizes explaining essential terminology at the beginning, facilitating understanding in subsequent sections.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\nDefine Income Tax Act concepts relevant to salaried taxpayers.\nDescribe Income Tax Act provisions related to income tax computation, deduction, remittance, and return filing.\nCompute income tax due from employees based on their earnings.\nFor detailed information on each section in this course, refer to the next part of this master course, \"TDS for Indian Payroll – For Professionals.\"\nWe hope this part of the master course provides a foundational understanding of income tax applicable to Indian payroll within 90 minutes and clarifies the basic structure of payroll department activities concerning income tax.",

      "description": "The 1961 Yankees occupy a special place in team history because, in my humble opinion, they were the only truly transcendent Yankee team between Joe DiMaggio and Derek Jeter. Mickey Mantle could have been a hero in a Sophocles play. He could have easily broken every offensive record in the book, but a tragic flaw, or rather flaws, kept him from his full potential. Yet, even at half speed, he ran laps around everybody else. Fellow outfielder Roger Maris really only had two or three good years, but what years they were. This Yankee team also featured Hall of Famers Yogi Berra (at one time, my next-door neighbor) and Whitey Ford. These guys were essentially complementary players on that squad, which should tell you something.\nIf a bleary-eyed Mickey Mantle would have opened a lawyer or accountant trade journal in December of 1961 and flipped towards the back, just before the classifieds and obituaries, he may have found a write-up about a rather obscure Second Circuit case: United States v. Kovel. Various courts and codes have whittled away at this decision over the years, but it still stands firm as a case that can extend the attorney-client privilege to an accountant or other financial professional. Very simply, any communication between an attorney and a taxpayer that is deemed privileged under the attorney-client privilege will also be deemed privileged if it is between a “federally authorized tax practitioner” and a taxpayer. If you think that’s not a big deal, you’ve probably never been audited.\nIn this presentation, I'll do a deep-dive into the Kovel case along with Kovel agreements and discuss the case that gave rise to them.\nTopics include:\n\n\nHow does the Kovel accountant concept enhance the attorney-client privilege compared to traditional accountant-client relationships?\nWhat are the potential risks associated with using an original accountant in the context of a Kovel agreement?\nIn what ways can the distinction between the roles of the original accountant and the Kovel accountant affect the outcome of a case involving IRS scrutiny?\nWhy might a client resist the recommendation to hire a new accountant, and how can attorneys effectively address these concerns?\nDiscuss the implications of the Kovel agreement on the confidentiality of communications between a taxpayer and their accountant.\nHow does the Kovel case illustrate the importance of understanding the limitations of the attorney-client privilege in tax matters?\nWhat steps should an attorney take to ensure that a Kovel agreement is properly executed and protects the client's interests?\nIn what scenarios might the privilege provided by Section 7525 be challenged, and what can be done to mitigate these challenges?\nHow does the work-product doctrine relate to the Kovel accountant, and what protections does it offer?\nConsidering the narrow scope of the accountant-taxpayer privilege, how can taxpayers safeguard their communications with their accountants?\nHow does the Kovel accountant framework compare to other methods of integrating legal and financial advice in tax matters?\nWhat lessons can be learned from the Kovel case regarding the balance between legal obligations and the need for confidentiality in financial practices?",

This course will help.\nBusiness finance concerns the management of the monetary resources of an organisation. There are two aspects to this:\n1. Raising the money to invest in the business\n2. Managing that investment properly to generate a return\n\n\nRaising the money is about having an attractive proposition and managing the risk to investors. Managing the investment is about the financial controls and reporting of the business. Topics covered include the reasons why businesses fail; the two main purposes of finance and accounting; key principles of business finance; the Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cashflow Statement; financial performance indicators; and investment analysis.\nThree are three main reasons for business failure – an under-skilled management team; ineffective marketing; and poor financial management.

Excel's spreadsheet functionality allows users to create detailed and organized financial documents, including ledgers, income statements, balance sheets, and more. Its flexibility makes it a popular choice for small businesses and individuals seeking a cost-effective solution for basic accounting needs.\nUsing Excel for accounting provides users with the ability to customize templates, formulas, and charts according to specific business requirements. The platform enables efficient data entry and calculation processes, aiding in the organization of financial data and streamlining tasks such as budgeting and reconciliation. However, it's essential to recognize that Excel has its limitations, particularly in terms of scalability and automation when compared to dedicated accounting software.\nDespite its widespread use, Excel may pose risks related to errors and data security, as manual data entry increases the likelihood of mistakes. To address these concerns, individuals and businesses employing an accounting system by Excel should implement rigorous validation processes and consider transitioning to more robust accounting solutions as their needs evolve.\nMake an Accounting system & financial statement by Excel.

The concept is that income and expenses should be matched together and dealt with in the income statement for the period to which they relate, regardless of the period in which the cash was actually received or paid. Therefore all of the expenses involved in making the sales for a period should be matched with the sales income and dealt with in the period in which the sales themselves are accounted for.\n\nSales revenue\nThe sales revenue for an accounting period is included in the income statement when the sales are made. This means that, when a sale is made on credit, it is recognised in the income statement when the agreement is made and the invoice is sent to the customer rather than waiting until the cash for the sale is received. This is done by setting up a receivable in the statement of financial position for the amount of cash that is due from the sale (debit receivables and credit sales revenue).\n\nPurchases\nSimilarly purchases are matched to the period in which they were made by accounting for all credit purchases when they took place and setting up a payable in the statement of financial position for the amount due (debit purchases and credit payables).\n\nCost of sales\nThe major cost involved in making sales in a period is the actual cost of the goods that are being sold. As we saw in a previous chapter, we need to adjust for opening and closing inventory to ensure that the sales made in the period are matched with the actual costs of those goods. Any goods unsold are carried forward to the next period so that they are accounted for when they are actually sold.\n\nExpenses\nThe expenses of the period that the business has incurred in making its sales, such as rent, electricity and telephone, must also be matched with the sales for the period. This means that the actual expense incurred in the period should be included in the income statement rather than simply the amount of the expense that has been paid in cash.",

      "description": "Accounting is the process of recording financial transactions pertaining to a business. The accounting process includes summarizing, analyzing, and reporting these transactions to oversight agencies, regulators, and tax collection entities. The financial statements used in accounting are a concise summary of financial transactions over an accounting period, summarizing a company's operations, financial position, and cash flows. Accounting is one of the key functions of almost any business. It may be handled by a bookkeeper or an accountant at a small firm, or by sizable finance departments with dozens of employees at larger companies. The reports generated by various streams of accounting, such as cost accounting and managerial accounting, are invaluable in helping management make informed business decisions. The financial statements that summarize a large company's operations, financial position, and cash flows over a particular period are concise and consolidated reports based on thousands of individual financial transactions. As a result, all accounting designations are the culmination of years of study and rigorous examinations combined with a minimum number of years of practical accounting experience. Just as managerial accounting helps businesses make decisions about management, cost accounting helps businesses make decisions about costing. Essentially, cost accounting considers all of the costs related to producing a product. Analysts, managers, business owners, and accountants use this information to determine what their products should cost. In cost accounting, money is cast as an economic factor in production, whereas in financial accounting, money is considered to be a measure of a company's economic performance.",

To be honest, some lecturers that teach this subject almost sound like they are speaking a different language Accounting-lish ! Even the text books can be as dry. I vividly remember having to study this subject when I was in University and it was a struggle. Luckily for me after working for a couple of years in a Big 4 and seeing the application of Accounting. It just clicked for me.\nSo I made it a mission of mine to give back and teach this subject to the new generation of accountants so I have created this course to help you in your accounting journey. So in this course we shall cover the following :\n- Why Even Study Accounting\nI think this section is extremely important to cover as it gives you a context on why you should even study this subject. Only upon knowing the why, this will enable us to gain some context on why we study this subject in the 1st place.\n- The Basic Lingo - What is an Asset, Liability & Shareholder Equity\nTo understand a book, we need to know the words. And like accounting, to understand the statements we need to have a grasp on the accounting lingo.\n- The Accounting Equation - Asset = Liability + Equity\nThis is the very base of accounting knowledge.",

Generally, in FMCG industries where periodic sales would be foretasted and the demand for product is based on the period, the Production is schedule and executed as per periodic demand foretasted the Product Cost by Period method will be useful for Product Costing.\nWe start the process from the Plan Activity Price calculation which is used to post the activity costs on Production Order/ Product Cost Collector(Planned order) later on during confirmations through formula,\n= (Actual qty * Plan Price KSPI)\nThe Master data preparation for manufacturing FG3 are,\n1- BOM (Bill of Material for FG3)\n2- Work Center (3001- 3002- 3003)\n3- Rate Routing (which is used in case of Repetitive Manufacturing)\nAlso in Rate Routing we assigned the control keys in which we have defined milestones/ operations at which we do the confirmation known as reporting points.\n4- Execute Planned Cost estimate.\n\n\nNow, we assigned the RM3 to Operation 010 (first reporting point) in routing so that when we do the confirmation for this operation the RM3 quantity is by default suggested and posted along with it.\nInfo : Raw materials can be issued to product cost collector using any one of the following 3 ways\nManual goods issue: We use transaction MB1A to issue goods manually to order.\nBack flushing: For this, settings need to be done in MRP2 view of material master and may be in work center master data.\nAutomatically through routing operation confirmation: For this we need to assign the components to operation in BOM master data as shown in this setting.\nAlso, we create production version which is the combination of BOM and Routing.

      "description": "What Is Accounts Receivable (AR)?\nAccounts receivable (AR) is the balance of money due to a firm for goods or services delivered or used but not yet paid for by customers. Accounts receivables are listed on the balance sheet as a current asset. AR is any amount of money owed by customers for purchases made on credit.\nAccounts receivable is an asset account on the balance sheet that represents money due to a company in the short term.\nAccounts receivables are created when a company lets a buyer purchase their goods or services on credit.\nThe strength of a company’s AR can be analyzed with the accounts receivable turnover ratio or days sales outstanding.\nA turnover ratio analysis can be completed to have an expectation of when the AR will actually be received.\n\n\nJD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Receivable Overview\nAn accounts receivable department plays an important role in managing the cash flow of a business; it is responsible for processing invoices for goods and services sold to customers of an organization and applying payments from these same customers. In addition, the accounts receivable department might want to track payment information about their customers to gather statistical information about their paying habits. By understanding customers better, businesses can provide better customer support and manage their cash flow better.\n\n\nThe JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Receivable system from Oracle helps you manage the cash flow with the flexibility for effective cash management. It provides real-time information so that you can make immediate decisions about extending credit, forwarding collections, and applying cash.\nWith the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Accounts Receivable system, you can streamline the day-to-day functions of the entire accounts receivable department. You can simplify and accelerate the process of applying receipts and you have up-to-date information that improves communication between the billing and the credit and collections department.\n\n\nFor organizations that have offices around the world, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne software provides the flexibility needed to operate in multiple countries, each with unique currency, language, and statutory requirements.\nThis course is part 2 of the course and covers following topics:\n1. Manual Receipt Processing\n2. Automatic Receipt Processing\n3. Specialized Accounts Receivable Processes\n4. Accounts Receivable Reports\n5. Tax Information & Processing of Taxes in Accounts receivable",

There are many more demands on our time – partnering the operation; making data visible and understandable in real time; supporting a sustainable future; managing the ethics of a more complex world. All of this means more time on scrutiny, insight and adding value, and less time on transactions, reconciliations and reporting. AI may be able to take part of that strain, but it cannot do it alone – or unsupervised.\nA more flexible, improvement focussed, approach is needed to the finance function – this is the Agile approach.\nAgile is an iterative approach to work that helps teams deliver value faster with frequent review points. The aim is to constantly streamline and improve processes. Such streamlining is needed for finance processes if the additional demands of the role are to be accommodated, and that means Agile skills of problem solving, teamworking and the assess-plan-do-review cycle.\nThe accountant of the future will need an Agile mindset.\nThe Agile mindset is more than just skills. It is a thought process – a curiosity about why things are the way they are and if there might be a better way; a keenness to work with others to explore new ways of working; and a desire to improve things for everyone – the team, the organisation, and society.\nThere is a phrase often heard in the continuous improvement community – “there is no failure, only learning” – and that sums the Agile mindset up well. It is learning about processes and trying to make them better; but if the new way doesn’t work out, taking the learning and trying again.\nThe “Agile Connection” community summarise the Agile mindset as five traits:\n• Positive attitude\n• Thirst for knowledge\n• Goal of team success\n• Pragmatism\n• Willingness to fail\n\n\nIt seems to be that those traits also reflect those of a finance professional striving to be part of a world class finance function.\n“The Accountant’s Guide to Agile” will help you understand what Agile means for finance processes and how you can start to apply that thinking to add value.",

Personally, I've taken financial accounting as a subject and learnt from different educators over a period of 6 years, and have served as a guide for my peers regarding this field and am bringing this value to you now!

      "description": "Section1: Accounting Principles\nAccounting principles are the rules and guidelines that companies and other agencies must abide by when reposting their financial data and results. These principles and rules make it a bit easier to standardize financial data by setting the standards and rules that Accountants must use.\nThe main purpose of Accounting principles is to establish the framework for how financial Accounting is recorded and reported on financial statements to be reliable for decision makers.\nIt’s important to have a basic understanding of these main Accounting principles as you learn Accounting.\nGenerally accepted Accounting principles are important because they set the rules for financial reporting and bookkeeping as well. These rules or guides are often called the GAAPs framework and they maintain consistency in financial reporting from company to company across all industries.\nSection2:  Creative Accounting\nCreative accounting refers to the use of accounting practices that deviate from standard principles or exploit gaps in financial regulations to present financial statements in a more favorable light. While not inherently illegal, creative accounting can manipulate figures to influence stakeholder perceptions, enhance company performance metrics, or meet specific financial targets. Techniques may include adjusting revenue recognition timing, capitalizing expenses, or revaluing assets in unconventional ways. The goal is often to present a picture of financial health that aligns with strategic objectives, such as attracting investors, avoiding covenant breaches, or meeting executive bonus thresholds.\nSection3:  Forensic Accounting\nForensic accounting is a specialized field of accounting that combines accounting expertise with investigative skills to uncover financial fraud, disputes, and irregularities. Often referred to as \"accounting detectives,\" forensic accountants examine financial records and transactions to identify discrepancies that may indicate fraudulent activity, embezzlement, or financial misconduct. They utilize advanced analytical techniques and tools to trace the flow of money, assess the authenticity of financial documents, and identify patterns or anomalies that require further scrutiny. Forensic accountants play a critical role in legal proceedings, providing expert witness testimony and supporting litigation with detailed reports and evidence.",

Gross income includes all forms of earned income, such as salary, wages, tips, and bonuses, as well as unearned income, such as rental income, investment income, and dividends.\n\n\nThis video takes a visual approach to calculating gross income and the overall impacts to taxable income. Whether you are learning about taxes for your personal finances, or studying for the CPA exam, this course will break the concepts down, provide detailed examples and solutions, and allow you to understand the intuition behind the topics. This course covers everything from included wages and earnings, to taxable portfolio income, and self-employment income.\n\nAdditional nontaxable items covered include the following:\nStock dividend - Stock dividends generally do not have any tax implications until the individual sells the shares of stock received. Therefore, only the basis of each share will change.\n\n\nStock split - Stock splits will not generate a taxable event. Instead, the individual’s receipt of stock will only evidence the same ownership interest in the corporation that issued the stock.\n\n\nReturn of capital - Return of capital is considered a non-taxable event and is not considered either a dividend or a capital gain distribution. The return of capital distribution will reduce the tax basis of an investment and can impact capital gains taxes when the investor eventually sells their shares of stock.",

      "description": "Tujuan bisnis adalah menciptakan nilai. Nilai ini tercipta melalui keseluruhan proses bisnis. Namun pada akhirnya untuk mengetahu seberapa bernilai suatu perusahaan maka kita perlu kembali ke pengukur nilai dalam bisnis yaitu arus kas. Arus kas diukur dalam satuan moneter yaitu mata uang. Hal ini ditujukan agar setiap nilai perusahaan menjadi suatu satuan yang riil sehingga dapat dibandingkan dengan perusahaan lainnya. Untuk meningkatkan nilai, perusahaan melakukan berbagai upaya mulai dari meningkatkan citra merek hingga melakukan berbagai upaya pemasaran atau melakukan efisiensi. Untuk mengetahui upaya manakah yang memberikan hasil perusahaan dapat merencanakan upaya tersebut dengan menggunakan pemodelan keuangan. Pemodelan keuangan merupakan suatu usaha untuk menghubungkan antara berbagai fungsi dari perusahaan dan konsekuensi ekonominya. Oleh karena itu akan terlihat bagaimana upaya perusahaan akan meningkatkan nilai perusahaan (value added) atau mengurangi nilai perusahaan (value destruction). Dengan bantuan pemodelan keuangan suatu upaya perusahaan dapat divaluasi sebelum dilaksanakan. Harapannya melalui pemodelan keuangan maka perusahaan dapat mengambil upaya-upaya yang memberikan nilai tambah dan meninggalkan upaya-upaya yang tidak memberikan nilai tambah. Pemodelan keuangan dapat digunakan mulai dari level manajemen menengah hingga manajemen level atas untuk mengambil keputusan strategis. Pemodelan keuangan tidak terpisahkan dan merupakan bagian integral dari setiap bisnis. Karena itu setiap orang yang berkecimpung dalam dunia bisnis dapat mengambil manfaat dari belajar pemodelan keuangan.",

Accounting uses a formalized and regulated system that follows standardized principles and procedures.\nThe job of accounting is done by professionals who have educational degrees acquired after years of study. While a small business may have an accountant or a bookkeeper to record money transactions, a large corporation has an accounts department, which supplies information to:\nManagers who guide the company.\nInvestors who want to know how the business is doing.\nAnalysts and brokerage firms dealing with the company’s stock.\nThe government, which decides how much tax should be collected from the company.\nPrinciple of Accounting can also refer to the basic or fundamental principles of accounting: cost principle, matching principle, full disclosure principle, revenue recognition principle, going concern assumption, economic entity assumption, and so on.",

Production Units Method\nYou can change the total output quantity, or the remaining output, to the exact periods. The system then calculates unit-of-production depreciation based on the new total output quantity or the new remaining output, starting with the period in which the change was made.\nSpecify the probable output quantity for every depreciation period in fiscal years that are still open.\nCalculation:\nDepreciation = acquisition value (net book value) / total output (remaining output) * period output\n2. Sum of Digits Method\nUse\nFor each year of the expected useful life, the system notes the remaining useful life for the assets and totals the figures in each year. In each fiscal year, the remaining life is divided by this total in order to calculate the depreciation percentage rate for that fiscal year. This method leads to depreciation amounts that are reduced progressively by the same amount each period.\nSince the remaining useful life is no longer defined after the end of the planned useful life, this depreciation method does not allow for depreciation after the end of the planned life. However, you can change to another method after the expected useful life has expired.\nAcquisitions after the depreciation start year or post-capitalization will necessarily lead to a positive net book value at the end of planned life. For this reason, such transactions are not allowed when using the sum-of-the-years-digits method of depreciation. With this method, you have to handle subsequent acquisitions by creating sub-numbers. It is also a requirement that the acquisition year is the same as the depreciation start year.\nCalculation :\nDepreciation = APC * remaining useful life (current period) / total of remaining useful life (over entire useful life)",

      "description": "Nell'universo dell'economia aziendale, il viaggio solitamente inizia con la contabilità. Quest'area, pur essendo essenziale, può risultare complessa a prima vista, in particolare se non si afferrano le dinamiche della partita doppia e la loro trasposizione nel bilancio. Tuttavia, il nostro obiettivo con questo corso è di semplificare queste complessità e di offrire un percorso progressivo e logico.\nIl corso si divide in tre parti ben distinte. La prima è dedicata ai fondamenti: qui, la partita doppia verrà spiegata in dettaglio, mettendo in luce come le varie operazioni contabili influenzino il bilancio. La seconda sezione avrà un taglio pratico, con esercitazioni ed esempi concreti di scritture contabili di media difficoltà, per farvi mettere immediatamente in pratica ciò che avete appreso. Infine, nella terza parte, entreremo nel cuore della contabilità avanzata, analizzando le scritture contabili legate a una vasta gamma di argomenti, tra cui merci, ratei e risconti, obbligazioni, azioni, imposte dirette e indirette, strategie di marketing come la pubblicità, la gestione dei crediti e molto altro ancora.\nNon dimentichiamoci della sezione bonus, completamente dedicata a voi! Qui, risponderò personalmente alle vostre domande attraverso video esplicativi, assicurandomi che nessun dubbio rimanga in sospeso.\nQuesto corso, sebbene pensato principalmente per studenti universitari, è perfetto anche per chi frequenta le scuole superiori e desidera avere una solida base prima di affrontare gli studi superiori. Ma non solo: è un'ottima risorsa anche per chi già lavora, o aspira a farlo, in ambito amministrativo e contabile, fornendo strumenti e competenze che saranno preziosi sia in studi professionali che in contesti aziendali più ampi.\nSpero che ora soddisfi le tue esigenze!",

      "description": "Financial statement fraud is usually facilitated by management to achieve the desired goals. Company management can misrepresent financial statements in order to make the stock attractive to investors and, as a result, manipulate the stock price. In addition, management can misrepresent financial statements to justify bonuses and high salaries given to the employees of the company. This usually happens when management compensation is related to the company's performance.\nThe main reason for financial statement fraud is that the company's position looks better on paper. Financial statement fraud is not always motivated by one person, but it is committed by many.\nAs per the study conducted by the Association of Certified fraud examiners, financial statement fraud, in which the perpetrator deliberately causes a material misstatement or omission in an organization's financial statements, is the least common (10%) amongst the other operational frauds, yet most expensive category of business-related fraud\nCorporate frauds have emerged as the biggest risks which companies are exposed to, and are increasingly becoming a big threat\nRegulations are being regularly tightened to ensure monitoring, vigilance and disclosure mechanisms including whistle blowers’ complaints. It is a universal truth that fraudsters are always a step ahead of regulators\nIn case of frauds involving large amounts causing going concern issues (raising doubts in the ability of the company to continue its operation in the near- future",

      "description": "The Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR) section of the CPA exam assesses a candidate’s understanding and application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in various financial reporting environments. This section covers a broad range of topics, including the preparation and analysis of financial statements, accounting for specific transactions and events, and financial reporting for business entities, not-for-profit organizations, and government entities.\nFAR is widely considered the most comprehensive and challenging part of the CPA exam due to its technical nature and volume of content. Key areas tested include revenue recognition, leases, pensions, bonds, business combinations, and consolidations. Candidates are also expected to understand the conceptual framework underlying financial accounting and to apply financial reporting standards in real-world scenarios.\nGovernmental and not-for-profit accounting is a significant portion of the exam, requiring familiarity with fund accounting and reporting under GASB standards. Candidates must also demonstrate the ability to interpret financial data, make appropriate journal entries, and ensure proper presentation and disclosure in financial statements.\nSuccess in FAR requires strong foundational accounting knowledge, the ability to apply standards accurately, and extensive practice with simulations and multiple-choice questions. It's essential for aspiring CPAs who want to demonstrate their technical competence in financial accounting and reporting.",

      "description": "This course provides a comprehensive guide on how to prepare financial statements—specifically the income statement and the statement of financial position—using single entry and incomplete records. Unlike the double-entry system, where every transaction is recorded in at least two accounts, single entry and incomplete records often lack detailed information. This presents a challenge in preparing reliable financial statements, but the course addresses methods to overcome these limitations.\nIt covers techniques such as using opening and closing balances, bank statements, cash summaries, and control accounts to derive missing figures. Students learn how to reconstruct accounts like purchases, sales, expenses, and drawings to estimate profit or loss. The course also teaches how to apply accounting principles and assumptions, such as the accrual basis and matching principle, to ensure the accuracy of financial reports derived from limited data.\nThrough step-by-step examples and practical exercises, learners gain the skills needed to compile a basic income statement showing revenue, expenses, and net profit, as well as a statement of financial position summarizing assets, liabilities, and capital. This course is particularly useful for small business owners, accountants, and students who often deal with businesses that do not maintain complete accounting records but still require meaningful financial statements for decision-making and reporting purposes.",

      "description": "Um guia definitivo para aprender contabilidade e usá-la em situações práticas. Captar e demonstrar os números gerados por uma empresa é da essencial da contabilidade. Entender como funciona toda essa dinâmica que resulta nos relatórios contábeis é fundamental para os gestores de qualquer nível tomar excelentes decisões.\nEste curso possibilita a compreensão sólida da dinâmica contábil que leva ao entendimento definitivo de como os números são captados, registrados e apresentados.\nO aprendizado consistente se baseia inicialmente no registro dos fatos contábeis através da técnica de balanços sucessivos, que permite ao compreensão simultânea do registro dos fatos e de sua demonstração imediata nos relatórios contábeis. A partir deste ponto se constrói o edifício do conhecimento desta ciência tão importante para o desenvolvimento pessoal, dos negócios e, como consequência, da própria sociedade.\nO uso dos avanços sucessivos é aplicado no registro de fatos patrimoniais e de resultado. Assim, é possível observar no balanço patrimonial os efeitos de cada operação realizada pela empresa. Seja uma aquisição de estoque, uma venda de mercadoria ou um pagamento de salário, esta metodologia permite que se acompanhe imediatamente seus efeitos no principal relatório das empresas, o avanço patrimonial.\nApós o estudo das operações contábeis através dos balanços sucessivos, nos voltamos para os registros da forma como eles efetivamente ocorrem: registros em livro diário e transcrição para o livro razão, com o imediato levantamento do balancete de verificação. Neste relatório se pode verificar a ocorrência de certas categorias de erros cometidos na efetivação dos lançamentos contábeis das operações de negócios ou administrativas.\nCorrigidos os erros de lançamentos, preparam-se os ajustes contábeis. Tais ajustes se destinam a contabilizar os fatos que ainda não o foram porque se deixa para fazê-los ao final do exercícios, antes da preparação do demonstrativos financeiros. Ficaria muito caro e trabalhoso realizar os ajustes à medida que as operações se desenrolam. Por exemplo, o cálculo e registro da depreciação: seria trabalhoso realizar tal cálculo todo final de dia. Não se precisa, normalmente,  desta informação a cada dia. Ela pode ser deixada para o momento do fechamento do período contábil.\nFeitos os ajustes, deve-se elaborar o balancete de verificação ajustado e, a partir dele, preparar-se os demonstrativos financeiros do exercício.\nÉ esta sequência de tópicos que é estudada e operacionalizada neste curso.",

      "description": "The smartest people invest heavily in their education and skill development, recognizing that their human capital is their most marketable resource.\nSkills are the most valuable thing you can acquire in this lifetime because they keep compounding until the day you die.\n\nWithout understanding Finance you will struggle as a leader.\n\n\nCan you truly run a business without a deep understanding of your financial numbers? The answer is a resounding no. Let's explore the potential pitfalls of this approach...\n\n\nImagine your business as a competitive sports team. Just as a coach needs to understand each player's strengths and the dynamics of the game to win, mastering your financial numbers is essential for driving your business to victory.\n\n\nWith my expertise in business and mathematics, I'm here to guide you in developing a winning financial strategy. Together, we'll unravel the intricacies of your finances, empowering you to make confident, informed decisions that drive your business forward.\n\n\nReady to make the leap?\n\n\nCritical Strategies for Leveraging Financial Insights:\n- Demystify Your Revenue Streams: Gain a precise understanding of how your business earns profit, much like knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your team. This knowledge of revenue inflows and associated costs will enhance profitability and operational efficiency.\n- Focus on Gross Profit: Recognize that gross profit is more than a number; it's the backbone of your business, supporting all other activities and facilitating future planning and investments, just as a strong defense supports a winning team.\n- Smart Allocation of Budgets: Use your understanding of gross profit to allocate funds to critical expenses like rent and payroll intelligently, ensuring they support rather than hinder your growth. It's like strategizing your resources to strengthen the key players in your team.\n- Strategic Marketing Investment: Learn the art of budgeting for marketing. Determine the optimal amount to invest in attracting new customers, which is crucial for expanding your market reach without compromising operational funds, similar to how a coach invests in training to improve the team's performance.\n- Utilize Numbers to Propel Growth: Move beyond maintenance; use financial insights strategically to drive your business to new heights. Armed with this knowledge, you'll make informed decisions that enhance growth and enable seizing new opportunities, much like a coach uses game statistics to refine strategies and achieve victories.\n\n\nLet's use these insights to sustain and significantly amplify our business success. Let's win together!\n\n\nYou will learn how to use financial statements and properly evaluate any firm's financial health, to instantly determine if a firm has a strong or weak balance sheet and evaluate profitability. You will know how to calculate financial ratios, and you will understand what the financial ratios mean and what to notice.\nDon't let lack of financial intelligence stop you from getting ahead.\n“Business is always evolving especially with advances in technology. Business and technology topics can be new and novel or difficult to understand. John has the ability to frame and present business topics in a way where the audience feels like they can quickly grasp concepts, define strategy, and begin to execute.”\nI’m proud to say that the National Association of Certified Valuators and Analysts are using MBA ASAP 10 minutes to Understanding Financial Statements as a pre-read to their Business Valuation Certification Program. Get your copy of this book included as part of this course and level up your financial literacy!\nBeing able to read and understand financial statements is a fundamental skill to understanding how businesses function. Since financial statements are the end product of accounting, understanding them provides the context for understanding accounting. Mastering this skill will help you become a better manager.\nBeing able to read financial statements will also help you make better investment decisions in the stock market because you will be able to get meaningful information out of an Annual Report or a 10K.\nIf you are an entrepreneur planning a start up then understanding financial statements is critical for your credibility as you meet with angel investors, bankers, and VCs.\nThe tax law is a series of incentives for entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe tax laws favor entrepreneurs and investors. That’s because entrepreneurs and investors generally put money into the economy to produce rather than consume.\n\nBut, paying taxes is less expensive than failing at business. Be sure to get educated before you begin.\n\nStart acting like an entrepreneur or an investor. That means the first thing you need to do is to increase your financial intelligence by investing in financial education.\n\n\nWhy take this course?  Finally understand the numbers side of Business.  Financial Literacy matters to your career and success   Senior executives routinely share and discuss financial data with marketing directors, operations chiefs, and other direct reports. But how much do those managers really understand about finance and the numbers? A recent investigation into this question concluded most managers understand not enough to be useful.  Asked to take a basic financial-literacy exam—a test that any CEO or junior finance person should easily ace—a representative sample of U.S. managers from C-level executives to supervisors scored an average of only 38%.   Lack of financial literacy matters and impacts an organizations ability to optimally perform. Those who can’t speak the language of business can’t contribute much to a discussion of performance and are unlikely to advance in the hierarchy or reach their full potential.   Does a lack of financial literacy matter? From a managers’ point of view, it surely does. Those who can’t speak the language of business can’t contribute much to a discussion of performance and are unlikely to advance in the hierarchy. They may get caught off guard by financial shenanigans, as many employees at Enron were.\nThey also are unable to gauge the health of a prospective or current employer.  The CFO of a small manufacturing company often asks candidates for engineering positions whether they would like to review the past two years of the company’s financials. None yet have taken him up on the offer—knowing, perhaps, that they could make neither head nor tail of the statements.  People don’t tell their bosses that they don’t speak finance. It’s the usual human reluctance to admit ignorance. In a survey managers were asked what happens in meetings when people don’t understand financial data. The majority chose answers reflecting that reluctance, such as “Most people don’t ask because they don’t want to appear uninformed in front of their boss or peers.”  Don’t let this be you. Take this course and understand Financial Statements.",

      "description": "Why This Course?\nThis class is for anyone who is new to accounting. It is expected that you are starting from a knowledge base of zero. The class is designed to get you up and running with a solid understanding of basic Financial Accounting. It gives you a real-world perspective into accounting without overloading you with information. The class is intended for you take accounting concepts and to be confident enough to apply those in the real world.\nWho is this Course For?\nThis course is for anyone who is interested in learning financial accounting. If you are a university student, small business owner, or want to become a bookkeeper this course is a great place to start.\nWhy I made this Course\nI made this course after I came to the realization that accounting is being taught in a very compartmentalized way. You are taught a concept and given a vague explanation of how it fits into the accounting cycle. You are then later expected to recall this information and you have no idea how it fits into the big picture. I realized this when I began to work in public accounting after college. I had these problems and so did all of the new hires. It amazed me that accountants who graduated from top universities had little understanding of the flow of accounting. My objective with this course is for you to walk away with a basic understanding of the flow of accounting and how transactions fit into the larger picture.\nNotes\nI have given you the notes I made for the lecture so you can follow along without having to spend a lot of time writing it all down. The notes are in PDF format and are uploaded to each section.\nProject Description\nFor the class project, you are given 5 different projects to work on. You are to create an Income Statement, Statement of Owner's Equity and Balance sheet for each project.\nThe idea is to expose you to real-world accounting so you become familiar with it.",

The focus will be on the income statement, one of the most critical components of financial reporting, which provides a detailed account of a company's financial performance over a specific period. Whether you're a business professional, entrepreneur, investor, or student, this course will equip you with the skills necessary to interpret and analyze income statements effectively.\nWe begin by exploring the fundamental concepts and components of financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. We then delve into the specifics of the income statement, covering key areas such as revenue recognition, cost of goods sold (COGS), gross profit, operating expenses, and net income. You'll learn how these elements contribute to a company's profitability and financial health and how they are interrelated with other financial statements.\nThe course also covers essential accounting principles and practices, including accrual and cash accounting, and the impact of accounting policies on financial reporting. You'll gain insights into how different methods of accounting, such as FIFO, LIFO, and various depreciation methods, affect financial outcomes. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the financial performance and position of companies, particularly when comparing across industries with varying financial structures and practices.\nIn addition to the technical aspects of income statement analysis, the course emphasizes practical application through real-world examples and case studies.

By the end of the course, you'll be adept at identifying key financial ratios and metrics that inform strategic decisions.\nFurthermore, the course addresses contemporary trends and future considerations in income statement analysis. You will explore the increasing importance of non-financial metrics, such as customer satisfaction and environmental impact, as well as the growing role of technology and data analytics in financial analysis. The course also covers the implications of global economic changes, digital revenue streams, and evolving regulatory and compliance landscapes.\nThroughout the course, interactive lectures and practical exercises  will enhance your learning experience. You'll have the opportunity to apply your knowledge through hands-on analysis, group projects, and simulations that mimic real-world financial decision-making scenarios.\nUpon completion, you will have a thorough understanding of how to read, interpret, and analyze income statements.

Designed for small business owners, aspiring accountants, finance professionals, and students, the course explores the theoretical foundations and practical applications of each approach, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and optimal use cases.\nCourse Overview:\n1. Understanding Accounting Fundamentals\nBegin with a solid foundation in accounting principles, focusing on how financial transactions are recorded and reported. You'll learn about the basic accounting equation, double-entry bookkeeping, and the importance of maintaining accurate financial records.\n2. Detailed Exploration of Cash Accounting\nThis module covers the essentials of Cash Accounting, a straightforward method where revenues and expenses are recognized only when cash changes hands. Ideal for managing simple business models or smaller enterprises, this section explains why Cash Accounting is favored for its simplicity and its ability to immediately reflect cash flow. You’ll also learn how this method can influence tax strategies and business decisions.\n3. Comprehensive Guide to Accrual Accounting\nAccrual Accounting, preferred by larger companies and organizations requiring detailed financial tracking, is explained in depth. This module illustrates how the method provides a more accurate picture of a company’s financial health by recognizing income when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of cash transactions. Key topics include the matching principle, the accrual concept, and their role in creating comprehensive financial statements.\n4. Comparative Analysis\nEngage in a side-by-side comparison of both methods to understand their implications for financial reporting and analysis. Discussions will cover regulatory requirements, the impact on financial transparency, and how each method aligns with different business strategies and structures.\n5. Practical Application and Case Studies\nThis course doesn’t just describe these accounting methods—it demonstrates how they work in real-world scenarios. Through detailed case studies, you’ll see how businesses of varying sizes apply these methods to manage operations, plan strategically, and comply with financial regulations. Case studies will range from small local businesses to large corporations, offering diverse perspectives on how accounting methods influence business success.\n6. Interactive Learning and Support\nAccess a variety of engaging learning materials, including interactive video lectures, reading assignments, and hands-on exercises that reinforce your understanding of the content. Participate in online forums and live Q&A sessions for additional support and opportunities to discuss the material with peers and instructors.\n7. Choosing the Right Method for Your Needs\nBy the end of the course, you’ll not only understand the mechanics of Cash and Accrual Accounting but also how to determine which method best suits different business types or financial situations. This module equips you with the tools to make informed decisions that align with strategic business objectives and compliance requirements.",

      "description": "Accounting can be an intimidating course. Accounting students look forward with anticipation but also hesitance. Non accounting majors that are forced to take accounting look at accounting with dread. This course is designed to make accounting a more friendly course by getting you ready. A big fear of the unknown will now be known.\n\n\nWho will benefit from this course?\nAre you about to take financial accounting? Would you like to better understand financial accounting? Are you a student, businessperson or manager that does not have a background in accounting but may need to deal with the accounting department? Then this course would benefit you!\n\n\nWhat you will learn\nWe will learn what accounting really is and what it is not. We will see the truth behind the ‘math’ misunderstanding of accounting. You will get a primer in accounting by understanding what accounting reports. You will get an introduction into basic accounting equation. You will be introduced to debits and credits. You will even learn to use journal entries. I will show you some examples using Excel.\n\n\nLesson Descriptions\n· Introduction to the course: You will get an overview of this course and what to expect. You will see how this course will help pre-accounting students gain an understanding of accounting. Knowing what accounting is about will take away that fear. Managers that deal with accounting may be at a disadvantage if they do not know what the accounting department does.\n· Common student fears introduced: The biggest fears students have in accounting are discussed in this lesson. One fear is that of math. Math can be intimidating or even scary. Math students often fear math because of the use of formulas. Students in math see the questions as right or wrong with no interpretation. Students also fear accounting for its use of rules. Accounting is seen as a profession of rules.  Students believe not knowing the rules can lead to failure. Students often fear the use of debits and credits in problems.  After this course you will understand that none of the common misconceptions about accounting, math, debits and credits, or rules is true.\n· Perception vs reality: What is an accountant’s life like? We perceive accounting and accountants a certain way. In this lesson we’ll discuss that perception. We’ll then discuss the reality of the profession. What do accountants really do? What is their career like?\n· Basic accounting terms: Key terms include transaction and account. These terms are used throughout business. The reason for confusion is that there are multiple definitions for these terms in business depending on your role.\n· Accounting Reports: What are the reports provided by accountants? You’ll learn the major two accounting reports that are taught in school. You’ll see what kind of information is provided in these reports.\n· Who?: In this lesson you will get to see who uses the accounting reports. You’ll find out why accounting reports are so useful and why there is such a need for accountants.\n· Math: You will get the truth about math as it is used in financial accounting. There are numbers in accounting but what accountants really do is communicate. The numbers are part of that transfer of information to the user. The ‘math’ accountants use is really just adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. The accounting problems take no special math skills, but those accounting problems may be a challenge. So how should you approach accounting problems when you take the course?\n· Accounting Equation: All of financial accounting can be boiled down to one formula: Assets = Liabilities + stockholders’ equity. You will understand this formula as a fundamental or foundation of information you will need for the course.\n· Debits and Credits Oh My!: You will know, by the end of the lesson, what a debit and credit is and what they are not. You will understand how these are merely tools for increasing or decreasing accounts.\n· Journal Entry: Learn how to do a journal entry. Get some examples from real world transactions. You will follow the journal entries as they are completed using Excel.\nCourse Prerequisites:\nNo prerequisite: You will learn the very basics of financial accounting!",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the International Accounting Standards (AS) course by Uplatz.\n\n\nAccounting Standards (AS) refer to the general guidelines and standards for financial reporting. A company's financial statements can be prepared using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nAn accounting standard is application to a company’s financial reporting. A few popular examples of accounting standards are segment reporting, goodwill accounting, an allowable method for depreciation, business combination, lease classification, a measure of outstanding share, and revenue recognition.\nThe Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), commonly referred as International Accounting Standards, are the primary accounting standards adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAAPs were designated in the United States and form the basis of accepted accounting standards for preparing and reporting financial statements across the world.\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) provides rule-based and principle-based accounting guidelines for international companies that are based outside the U.S. The International Accounting Standards (IAS) are intended to achieve the uniformity of approach and identity of meaning. Accounting standards of a specific country are strongly influenced by its governance arrangement and tax policy.\nIn essence, an accounting standard is a common set of principles, standards and procedures that define the basis of financial accounting policies and practices. Accounting standards improve the transparency of financial reporting in all countries. In the United States, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles form the set of accounting standards widely accepted for preparing financial statements. International companies follow the International Financial Reporting Standards, which are set by the International Accounting Standards Board and serve as the guideline for non-U.S. GAAP companies reporting financial statements.\n\n\nAccounting Standards (AS) have the following characteristics, to name a few:\nAn accounting standard is a common set of principles, standards, and procedures that define the basis of financial accounting policies and practices.\nAccounting standards apply to the full breadth of a entity’s financial picture, including assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and shareholders' equity.\nBanks, investors, and regulatory agencies, count on accounting standards to ensure information about a given entity is relevant and accurate.\nAccounting standards relate to all aspects of an entity’s finances, including assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and shareholders' equity. Specific examples of an accounting standard include revenue recognition, asset classification, allowable methods for depreciation, what is considered depreciable, lease classifications and outstanding share measurement.\n\n\nThis is an in-depth training on Accounting Standards provided by Uplatz. The course starts with a general introduction of AS and proceeds with comprehensive explanation of each Accounting Standard (AS 1 to AS 29) with practical examples and industry scenarios demonstrated for each AS.\nThis Accounting Standards course is absolutely a right course for you if you wish to learn the concepts of Accounting Standards.\nThe Accounting Standards training will help you gain significant edge in the understanding of AS and knowing how to apply them practically for different cases. This will help you become a successful Finance & Tax Consultant, or to prepare for the Chartered Accountant (CA) exams including CA, CFA, CS, and others.\n\n\nAccounting Standards (AS) - Course Syllabus\n\n\nIntroduction of AS\nApplicability of AS\nList of AS\nthorough discussion on all the AS (Applicability, Objectives, Scope, Definitions, Reconciliations, Measurement, Disclosures etc)\nAS 1 Disclosure of Accounting Principles\nAS 2 Valuation of Inventories\nAS 3 Cash Flow Statements\nAS 4 Contingencies and Events Occurring After the Balance Sheet Date\nAS 5 Net Profit or Loss for the Period, Prior Period Items and Changes in Accounting Policies\nAS 6 Depreciation accounting stands withdrawn\nAS 7 Construction Contracts (Revised 2002)\nAS 9 Revenue Recognition\nAS 10 Property, Plant and Equipment\nAS 11 The Effects Of Changes In Foreign Exchange Rates (Revised 2003)\nAS 12 Accounting for Government Grants\nAS 13 Accounting for Investments\nAS 14 Accounting for Amalgamations\nAS 15 Employee Benefits (Revised 2005)\nAS 16 Borrowing Costs\nAS 17 Segment Reporting\nAS 18 Related Party Disclosures\nAS 19 Leases\nAS 20 Earnings Per Share\nAS 21 Consolidated Financial Statements\nAS 22 Accounting for taxes on income\nAS 23 Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements\nAS 24 Discontinuing Operations\nAS 25 Interim Financial Reporting\nAS 26 Intangible Assets\nAS 27 Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures\nAS 28 Impairment of Assets\nAS 29 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\nAS 30, 31, 32 withdrawn",

      "description": "About  the Master Class:\n\nThis course teaches students about the costing knowledge which is required being a designer. Basic elements and components of costing have been discussed in detail along with different types of costing such as reference costing zero is costing and comparative costing. Also many components names like inventory cost machine hour rate labour cost overheads cost profit margins parking cost has been discussed in detail to get a complete view for designers when it comes to material costing.\n\nDesign philosophy:\n\n\nAs I used to say in my design courses, that design cannot be learned in the rot learning or Text book way of learning that you do through a chapter wise and remember some formulas that will yield you some solutions. Design is unique and when different people approach the same problems we will get different solutions based on the inputs that designer works on.\nSo design can be approached in the way of learning through the case studies and by doing action on your own to learn yourself.\nLearning by doing and learning by action.\n\n\nBenefits of the Master Class:\n\n\nStudents will learn about the components of costing which includes ROMaterial, processing cost, overheads in detail with examples.\nAlso this course teaches about why materials costing knowledge is required for designers and how it plays a five little role in interfacing with the engineering team with respect to economic and cost restrictions.\nIn-depth knowledge of machines, our rate and how to arrive for each machine based on the Capex of the machine, overheads of the machine, consumables and non-consumables of the machines, maintenance and its appreciation and appreciation cost.\nStudents can learn about how costing could be easily put into a product like a pen and how we are able to compare it with the market to see the difference in what mistake you made.\nIn-depth knowledge of zero based costing and how the elements are playing in that.\nAlso a very quick based costing which is comparative costing and reference costing can make costing very easy even when you have a confidential or don't know anything about the material we still are able to calculate the cost with the reference costing method.\nAfter attending this course designers will definitely have a very good knowledge about costing and its awareness and that can impact largely when it comes to designing the products more efficiently more cost-effective than putting the value stream in the process of supply chain",

      "description": "What is the Uniform system of accounting for lodging industries (USALI)\nUniform System of Accounting Lodging Industries (USALI) has been around for almost 100 years. It started out as a guidebook for the Hotel Accountants Association of New York City in the late 1920s. Since then It was adopted by the American Hotel Association and most recently by the association, Hospitality Financial and Technology Professionals, or perhaps better known as HFTP.\nUSALI is the bible for the financial standards in the hotel industry. It lays out detail and provides a solid and usable framework for the hotel industry to follow when it comes to how we present financial information.\nWhat are the Key Features of USALI?\nHotel financial information must be organized and reported by department, rooms, F&B, MODs, A&G, S&M, POMEC. Not just all thrown together like baked spaghetti. USALI puts things in order and makes sense of how your hotel business is operating in a uniform fashion so we can then compare our results to others.\nWhy do we need to understand USALI?\nUSALI is followed all over the world by big and small hotels alike. Management companies emphasize on following usali as it provides a uniform basis of accounting and analysis. If there are no standard definitions all hotels would be free to use any type of definition that may suit hotel performance.\nHotel owners will not be able to analyse and compare hotel performance with other hotels in absense of standard definitions. The management fee is tied up with Gross operating revenue (GOR) and Gross Operating Profits (GOP), there may be confusion and distrust among managers and owners in absence of standard definitions and guidelines on what should be included in these terms.\nWhat you would learn in this Course on USALI\nIn this Module, you will be able to understand the Definitions (Revenue, Expenses, Statistics) and Format of profit & loss statements for the Rooms Department in the hospitality industry prescribed by the Uniform system of accounting for lodging industries (USALI).\nWe will be covering and understanding\nkey terms used in the rooms department\nDefinitions of Revenue line items, Revenue segmentation,\nMeaning of Expenses line, what goes inside and what is not.\nWhat expenses are variable and fixed.\nWhat are operating statistics which are prescribed by USALI and helpful in understanding P&L,\nHow to read and understand Rooms department profit & loss statement.\nIf you are looking to head hotel finance teams, then this course is a must for your development.",

      "description": "This course will provide only Excel practice problems, so learners can practice working through problems. Our course entitled “Financial Accounting – Adjusting Entries & Financial Statements” will also include test questions, presentations, and discussion questions.\nThe adjusting entry process is a fundamental bookkeeping and accounting process but is often the accounting process most misunderstood.\nBecause of the name of accounting adjusting entry process we are led to believe that we are adjusting errors made by the accounting department. In other words, we may get the idea that the adjusting process would not be needed if the accounting department did their work perfectly through the period. This assumption of the adjusting process fixing errors is not the primary purpose for the adjusting process.\nThe adjusting process is a necessary part of the accounting cycle and one that is built into the accounting system. In other words, we plan for the adjusting process, and part of the plan is to enter normal accounting transactions in such a way that we will most easily be able to make adjustments at the end of the time period.\nThe adjusting process helps significantly with the understanding of accrual concepts because the adjusting process focuses on timing differences, on when revenue and expense should be recognized.\nWe enter adjusting entries as of the end of the period. Adjusting entries will have a balance sheet component and an income statement component.\nOnce the adjusting entries are complete, we can use the adjusted trial balance to create the financial statements, the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of equity. Who will we be learning from?\nYou will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\nYou will be learning from somebody who is a:\n•    CPA – Certified Public Accountant\n•    CGMA – Chartered Global Management Accountant\n•    Master of Science in Taxation\n•    CPS – Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\n•    Curriculum Development Export\nAs a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\nAs a CPS and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\nThe instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives. Experience designing technical courses has also benefit in being able to design a course in a logical fashion and deal with problems related to technical topics and the use of software like QuickBooks Pro.\nPlease join us for Financial Accounting, Adjusting Entries & Financial Statements.\nIt will be great.",

There was little context, and I was encouraged to memorise processes rather than truly understand them. And I still see this out-dated teaching and learning method being used.\n\n\nOur brain is not designed to retain what it considers to be useless.  It is when we can’t see how what we are learning relates to the real world. No wonder I would forget it so easily.\n\n\nThere is no need for you to struggle! The system is logical, and it will make perfect sense when you learn it properly. You’ll remember it forever, end the continual struggle, and benefit from being a brilliant bookkeeper and accountant.\n\n\nAnything is difficult to learn unless you can appreciate why you’re learning about it. You must begin by understanding the financial statements, as the purpose of the double-entry bookkeeping system is to produce them.\n\n\nYou’ll learn how to read financial statements in their simplest form. You’ll draw from your own experience, use real examples and be able to put the topic into context. It will make it much easier for you to be able to classify double-entry accounts correctly (income, expense, asset, and liability).\nYou’ll be adjusting the figures within the financial statements, seeing the impact that business transactions have on them and understand what they tell us about the state of the business.  The dual-effect of business transactions will be so much more obvious to you.\nIt will be much simpler for you to accurately record the same transactions in double-entry accounts, as you’ll already have a good grasp of the complete picture and how the information you’re recording is used.\n\n\nI use brain friendly learning methods and practices.  You’ll be involved from the outset using the natural abilities of your brain to optimise the way you think and learn.  So, please set more time aside than the stated length of each video.\n\n\nYou’ll be amazed by the results you can achieve when you learn something properly. Enjoy learning!",

      "description": "Bank Reconciliation Statement is very important when one studies accountancy.\nCompany incurs many transactions during any particular period which involves bank. For example company makes payment to supplier through bank, Company makes payment of salary to employees through bank, company makes rent payment through bank etc. It records these transactions in its own books usually recorded in Cash book under Bank Column. Similar transactions also get reflected in Bank Pass Book (also called as Bank Statement) of the company.  Hence balance as per Company's own books and Company's Bank Pass Book should ideally be same. But this is not the case always and end balances as on particular date under both the books varies and hence bank reconciliation statement is prepared to reconcile these differences.\n\n\nBelow are the main reasons for differences between 2 books i.e. company's own books and Company's Bank Pass Book.\n\n\n1. Company made payment to supplier through bank may be by cheque and thus records it in its own book but supplier have not deposited the same in the bank and it is thus not getting reflected in Company’s Bank Pass Book and hence difference arises.\n2. Company made payment of salary to employees through bank may be by cheque and thus records it in its own book but employee have not deposited the same in the bank and it is thus not getting reflected in Company’s Bank Pass Book and hence difference arises.\n3. Bank Levies some charges and hence same is reflected in Company’s Bank Pass book but as a company we are not aware of this charges and hence same is not reflected in our own book and hence difference arises.\n4. Bank gives interest on deposits and hence same is reflected in bank pass book of company but as a company we are not aware of these income and same is not reflected in company’s own book and hence difference arises.\n5. Sometimes mistake is made by either party and hence difference between two books arises.\n\n\nWith the help of simple mathematics we will learn through this video series how to prepare bank reconciliation statement basically under below 4 scenarios :\n\n\n1. When balance as per Bank Column of Cash Book is Given.\n2. When balance as per Bank Pass Book is Given.\n3. When negative balance (overdraft) as per Bank Column of Cash Book is Given.\n4. When negative balance (overdraft)  as per Bank Pass Book is Given.",
