With this course, you will always have a chance to follow the latest trends.\nOracle Database is an enterprise database that can handle online transaction processing needs, as well as data warehousing and workloads for enterprise resource planning (ERP). Oracle DB was designed to be a flexible way to handle large applications and massive amounts of structured data.\nWhat is Oracle SQL?\nSQL stands for Structured Query Language—the language developers use to interact with databases to create, read, update, and delete database records and manage other aspects of those databases. ANSI created the standard for SQL. Many database vendors, like Oracle, expand on this standard to create their version of the language. Oracle SQL is compliant with ANSI SQL standards, with features designed specifically for the Oracle database management system. This RDBMS was released as the first commercially available relational database management system in 1977 and holds the top market share worldwide for relational database management systems. Oracle SQL extends the SQL standard with a procedural language PL/SQL and adds the ability to use the Java programming language.\nWhat careers use Oracle SQL?\nHaving Oracle SQL skills can add value to many careers. The most obvious is being a database administrator in enterprises that use the Oracle database management system. But SQL dialects are pretty similar, and knowledge of Oracle SQL can apply to many types of relational databases and doesn't limit you to Oracle. Database developers also use Oracle SQL all day long to create new databases and table structures. Most applications require a database to function, so software engineers and web developers also use Oracle SQL frequently. Data scientists must access data to create machine learning models and find trends, and a lot of this data will get stored in databases that require a knowledge of SQL to retrieve and transform. Business analysts also use Oracle SQL to generate reports that help businesses get to their next stage.\nWhat skills should I have before learning Oracle SQL?\nThere are no prerequisites to learning Oracle SQL. Oracle SQL has a simpler syntax than many standard programming languages and reads almost like English. Most people can understand what a SQL query is trying to do before they even know the language. All you need is an interest in the language and a commitment to learning. That said, some things could help with your Oracle SQL education if you are already familiar with them. If you are familiar with Excel spreadsheets and understand how columns and rows work, you can apply that knowledge to Oracle database tables. It also helps to know at least the concepts of how a relational database management system works. Also, if you already know a programming language, that will help learn Oracle's extended features like PL/SQL.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our content is created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\n· Seeing clearly\n· Hearing clearly\n· Moving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",

Suitelets can also serve as the back-end for external HTML interfaces, providing complete flexibility in developing application extensions to NetSuite.\nThere are two types of SuiteScripts:\n· Suitelets use UI objects to create custom pages that look like NetSuite pages. SuiteScript UI objects encapsulate the elements for building NetSuite-looking portlets, forms, fields, sublists, tabs, lists, and columns.\n· Backend Suitelets do not use any UI objects and execute backend logic, which can then be parsed by other parts of a custom application. Backend Suitelets are best used for the following purposes Providing a service for backend logic to other Suite Scripts. Offloading server logic from client scripts to a backend Suitelet shipped without source code to protect sensitive intellectual property.\nWhy Take This Course?\nThis course will prepare you to take on the role of a NetSuite Developer or NetSuite Technical Consultant with confidence.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Oracle Multitenant Architecture and Database Administration course by Uplatz.\n\n\nPost Oracle 12c, Oracle came up with new architecture called Multitenant Architecture.\nIn previous versions of Oracle database versions, there was a major problem - if the user starts a new instance there are particular background processes for each instance and each of these process wasted a lot of memory and resources thus affecting the system performance badly. Hence, Oracle came up with a new idea to connect different databases into one database technique. That idea is called “Multitenant Architecture.”\nThat one main database is called CDB (Container Database) and other databases which are used to connect the main database are called PDB (Pluggable Database). A pluggable database is fully compatible with a non-CDB. In fact, Oracle has something called the PDB/non-CDB compatibility guarantee, which states that anything you would do in a non-CDB would also work in a PDB. This compatibility guarantee is important when it comes to certifying things like third-party vendor products to work in a multitenant architecture.\n\n\nHow to create a multitenant database environment in Oracle 12c\nWhen creating a database, you must designate it as a CDB or non-CDB for it to be able to support the multitenant architecture. The next set of examples walks you through the steps to create a container database with the DBCA. There is only one step that differentiates a CDB from a non-CDB when using the DBCA.\nThe multitenant architecture enables you to have many pluggable databases inside a single Oracle Database instance. The Oracle Multitenant Database Architecture is designed to host multiple “PLUGGABLE DATABASE” PDB databases within a single CDB “CONTAINER DATABASE” container instance. The architecture of the CDB instance maintains more PDBs within it, using the same set of processes and the same SGA (System Global Area).\n\n\nKey Concepts of Oracle Multitenant Architecture\nContainer Database (CDB) – The main database that contains multiple Pluggable Databases (PDBs).\nPluggable Database (PDB) – A self-contained database that can be plugged into or unplugged from a CDB.\nRoot Container (CDB$ROOT) – The central container that holds common metadata, users, and shared components.\nSeed PDB (PDB$SEED) – A template used for creating new PDBs.\nApplication Containers – Used for managing multiple PDBs as a single unit.\n\n\nAdvantages of Oracle Multitenant\nEfficient Consolidation – Multiple PDBs share the same database instance, reducing resource overhead.\nSimplified Management – DBA tasks like patching, backup, and recovery are performed at the CDB level.\nRapid Provisioning – New databases can be created quickly by cloning PDBs.\nResource Management – CPU, memory, and storage can be allocated to individual PDBs.\nHigh Availability – Works with Oracle Data Guard and RAC for disaster recovery and performance.\n\n\nThe Multitenant architecture facilitates the following:\nHigh consolidation density: Many databases can share memory and background processes.\nProvisioning: A database can be unplugged from one environment and plugged into another or cloned with SQL commands in just a few seconds. They can even be plugged across operating systems and chipsets.\nPatching and upgrades: You can patch a database simply by unplugging from one unpatched container and plugging it into another patched container.\nManage many databases concurrently: You can do tasks such as backing up and patching on the primary container database instead of the individual pluggable databases.\nResource management: The Oracle Resource Manager feature can work at the pluggable database level for you to manage resource competition among the databases in your environment.\n\n\nThis Oracle Multitenant Architecture and Database Administration course by Uplatz will help you learn the multitenant architecture and the different types of pluggable databases (PDBs) in multitenant container databases (CDBs). You will understand the process of installing Oracle Database 19c followed by the creation of CDB and non-CDB databases. Oracle Database 19c Multitenant Architecture course explores the multitenant architecture and the different types of pluggable databases (PDBs) in multitenant container databases (CDBs). In this Oracle Multitenant Database Administration course, you will be creating a PDB through different methods, managing users, understanding the back-up and recovery processes in CDB and PDBs. You will also gain knowledge of the various utilities used for e.g. resource manager, data pump utility, and so on. Overall, you'll become a professional Oracle Multitenant DBA with end-to-end skills on managing applications and application containers.\n\n\nOracle Multitenant Architecture and Database Administration - Course Curriculum\n\n\nOverview of Oracle Multitenant DBA\nInstalling Oracle Linux 7.8 in Oracle Virtual Box\nInstalling Oracle Database 19c Software\nCreating CDB and non-CDB databases\nCreating PDBs from the Seed\nPerforming Basic CDB Administration Tasks\nCreating a PDB by Cloning from Local and Remote PDBs\nCreating PDB by Plugging in an Unplugged PDB\nCreating a PDB from non-CDB\nCreating a PDB by Relocating a PDB\nManaging Common and Local Users\nBackup and Recovery in CDB and PDBs\nFlashback and Point-in-time Recovery\nUsing Resource Manager with CDB and PDBs\nUsing Data Pump Utility with PDBs\nManaging Applications and Application Containers\nInstallation Of Oracle Linux 8 on Oracle VM\nIntroduction to Oracle 21c DBA\nOracle 21c Architecture\nPractice 1 - Creating a CDB\nPractice 2 - Creating PDBs from the Seed\nPractice 3 - Performing Basic CDB Administration Tasks\nPractice 4 - Managing Common and Local Users\nPractice 5 - Backup and Recovery in CDB and PDBs\nPractice 6 - Flashback and Point-in-time Recovery",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Oracle APEX Administration course by Uplatz.\n\n\nOracle Application Express (APEX) is an important tool provided by Oracle for Database and web application development. APEX helps to build web based applications using SQL and PL/SQL.\nOracle APEX has been adopted by the businesses across the world and is recognized for the value of keeping costs down and simplifying technical solutions to deliver business requirements. In other words, by using APEX you can develop complex systems at up to 1/4 of the time it takes for an equivalent Java deployment – with no loss of functionality. It’s stable, it scales, and it’s secure while exploiting all the features of the Oracle Database.\nAPEX is a great solution to consolidate spreadsheets, improve data quality and security, reduce duplication and administration and enhance functionality. Oracle Application Express is fantastic for creating beautiful rich user interfaces with support for all major browsers rendering well on a range of devices.\n\n\nWhat is Oracle APEX Administration?\nOracle Application Express administration involves managing an entire Oracle Application Express instance. So, an Oracle APEX administrator is a superuser who manages the entire hosted instance using the Oracle Application Express Administration Services application. Oracle Application Express administrators use the Manage Service page to configure service for an Oracle APEX environment.\n\n\nOracle Application Express Admin Features\nAPEX has an administrative interface to perform many of the system functions and remove the tedium from entering the corresponding PL/SQL procedure calls.

ANSI created the standard for SQL. Many database vendors, like Oracle, expand on this standard to create their version of the language. Oracle SQL is compliant with ANSI SQL standards, with features designed specifically for the Oracle database management system. This RDBMS was released as the first commercially available relational database management system in 1977 and holds the top market share worldwide for relational database management systems. Oracle SQL extends the SQL standard with a procedural language PL/SQL and adds the ability to use the Java programming language.\nWhat careers use Oracle SQL?\nHaving Oracle SQL skills can add value to many careers. The most obvious is being a database administrator in enterprises that use the Oracle database management system. But SQL dialects are pretty similar, and knowledge of Oracle SQL can apply to many types of relational databases and doesn't limit you to Oracle. Database developers also use Oracle SQL all day long to create new databases and table structures. Most applications require a database to function, so software engineers and web developers also use Oracle SQL frequently. Data scientists must access data to create machine learning models and find trends, and a lot of this data will get stored in databases that require a knowledge of SQL to retrieve and transform. Business analysts also use Oracle SQL to generate reports that help businesses get to their next stage.\nWhat skills should I have before learning Oracle SQL?\nThere are no prerequisites to learning Oracle SQL. Oracle SQL has a simpler syntax than many standard programming languages and reads almost like English. Most people can understand what a SQL query is trying to do before they even know the language. All you need is an interest in the language and a commitment to learning. That said, some things could help with your Oracle SQL education if you are already familiar with them. If you are familiar with Excel spreadsheets and understand how columns and rows work, you can apply that knowledge to Oracle database tables. It also helps to know at least the concepts of how a relational database management system works. Also, if you already know a programming language, that will help learn Oracle's extended features like PL/SQL.\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise.\nThis course will take you from a beginner to a more experienced level.\nIf you are a DBA or familiar with the Oracle Database / Oracle SQL or if you want to become an Oracle DBA at an international company or\nyou are a DBA that manages other RDBMS and want to immigrate to Oracle or you are already in the field and active RAC user but you just need a refresher, you are also in the right place. You will learn step by step with hands-on examples.\nFresh Content\nOracle RAC is a unique technology that provides high availability and scalability for all application types. It prevents the server from being a single point of failure. But DBAs also should be aware of the recent development and it’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New tools are released every day, Oracle updates its system, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge. With this course, you will always have a chance to follow the latest trends.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our content is created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you with the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nOracle 12C R2 RAC Administration and Data Guard for 12C R2 course\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",

Well, the answer is: Yes.\nSQL & PL/SQL has established itself as the de-facto data access language used across many different industries, that's available in the database.\nThis means that SQL & PL/SQL is no longer just used by developers, but folks from many different parallel technical fields that need to store, manipulate,  and access large volumes of data - analyse it with slice and dice concept to derive meaningful business information so as to have the business in competitive edge.\nFor this reason, SQL and PL/SQL isn’t going anywhere. Its stable in popularity and still dwarfs NoSQL databases on a side by side comparison.\nThe advantage of PLSQL is\nPL/SQL allows sending an entire block of statements to the database at one time. This reduces network traffic and provides high performance for the applications.\nPL/SQL gives high productivity to programmers as it can query, transform, and update data in a database.\nApplications written in PL/SQL are fully portable.\nWith this course, you can learn how to provision the latest Oracle Cloud Autonomous Database 19c which is provided on\nOracle cloud infrastructure as always free tier , utilize it to learn SQL (not covered in detail in this course ) and PL/SQL, which is covered in details.\n\n\nThe PL/SQL topics covered in this course are :\n\n\nDifferent Oracle DB environment to Learn & Practice.\nHow to get access to Oracle Cloud Free tier.\nAn Overview about all new Oracle Autonomous Cloud Database.\nProvisioning Oracle Autonomous Database on OCI\nAccessing the Oracle Cloud Autonomous DB for SQL - web and client version – SQL Developer.\nWhat is PLSQL?\nOracle PLSQL programming approach\nNaming conventions and formatting.\nScope of variable declaration &  nested block\nUsing PLSQL to interact with Oracle DB\nCursors in PLSQL.\nControl Statement in PLSQL\nHandling Exceptions in PLSQL\nSubprograms  & Composite data type\nDatabase triggers.\nCase study in SQL & PLSQL\nBusiness case & problem statement provided in document format for the learner to work upon & provided solution.\nSolutions presentation in detail to validate your solution.\n\n\nHappy Learning!!",

Profile Management’s presentation of the person profile and talent ratings provide a more engaging and responsive interface design. The user experience enables features that can be presented on both mobile and web pages. The interfaces are simpler, intuitive, and consistent across Oracle Cloud Oracle Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM).The Person Profile Type maintains the definition of the person talent profile necessary for tracking employee’s skills, qualities, and qualifications. The Model Profile Types maintain the definition of the workforce structures necessary for tracking targeted and required skills, qualities, and qualifications.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Oracle DBA course by Uplatz.\n\n\nOracle Database Administration is defined as the installation, configuration, management, administration, and performance tuning of Oracle database to achieve high performance from an Oracle database with complete access control and data integrity, storage, safety, backup, and recovery mechanisms.\nAn Oracle Database Administrator (DBA) is primarily responsible and accountable for performing database administration. With massive cloud-based database computing, database services, high performance and reliability requirements, data integration, transformation, storage, etc., as well as with complex and huge applications both in-premise and cloud-based, the role of Oracle DBAs has assumed significant importance in today's industry scenario and hence a DBA gets highly paid and are always in demand.\n\n\nUplatz provides in-depth training on Oracle Database Administration with focus on teaching DBA concepts in depth starting from Oracle database architecture and installation/configuration/management of database storage structure to user management, concepts such as locking and auditing, and deep dive into backup and recovery mechanisms.\nThis Oracle DBA course also covers the steps involved in Oracle database migration to cloud-based infrastructure.\nIn this Oracle DBA training, you will concentrate on the skills and best practices required for day-to-day database administration tasks such as security, creating and managing users, space management, administering undo and redo, running utilities, configuring Oracle networking, and all backup and recovery techniques.  An in-depth discussion of Oracle 12c database architecture is also provided.\n\n\nThe students will learn how to install and maintain Oracle Database 11g and gain a conceptual understanding of the Oracle database architecture and how its components work and interact with one another. You will also understand how to create an operational database and properly manage the various structures in an effective and efficient manner including performance monitoring, database security, user management, and backup/recovery techniques.\nBroad in scope, this course covers all of the Oracle Database Administration topics including SGA instance management, file & tablespace management, user administration & security and table & index management. Exercises are used to demonstrate each feature and the students will gain first-hand experience in the key Oracle DBA concepts required to pass the Oracle OCP exam.\nThe student will learn how to successfully install and configure a working Oracle database, create tablespaces and files, manage security and user access, and create tables, index-organized tables, cluster tables, indexes, bitmap indexes, function-based indexes and bitmap join indexes.\n\n\nOracle DBA course curriculum\n\n\nArchitecture\nDBCA\nInstance\nUsers\nTablespace and Storage\nTemporaray Tablespace\nUndo\nFlashback Technology\nOracle Networking Environment\nOracle Locking\nOracle Auditing\nEM and Data Pump\nUser Managed Backup\nUser Managed Recovery\nRMAN - Backup\nRMAN - Recovery\nOracle Database Migration to Cloud\n\n\nBasic terminologies involved in Oracle Database Administration are:\nInstance - It is defined as the background processes and memory structure used to retrieve data from a database.\nProcess - Also termed as task or job, is a running instance. There are two types of processes in Oracle database system namely, Oracle processes and User processes. There is no need to use an operating system command to interact with the database.\nBuffer Cache - It is an SGA component that acts as a buffer to store the data being customized or queried. It stores the most recently or frequently used data in memory which improves the performance. All the user processes that are connected to the database share access to it.\nShared pool - It captures information to be shared with users. For example, stored procedures, SQL statements, etc can be cached for reusability and fast access.\nRedo Log Buffer - It maintains a log of changes that are made in the database. The redo log files run in a circular motion and get overwritten. So, to maintain the recoverability of the database for a longer duration, they are archived into archive logs. Therefore, the redo log helps to recover an instance when there is a system failure. This improves the performance and functioning of the database system.\nLarge pool - It is the optional area that offers memory allocations for large processes, like recovery operations and Oracle backup.\nLocks - For controlling the simultaneous access to data resources, locks are used.\nThe database consists of logical and physical structures. Because these structures are separate, the management of the physical storage of data does not affect the access to logical structures.",

Oracle DB was designed to be a flexible way to handle large applications and massive amounts of structured data.\nWhat you will learn?\nWhat is Dataguard\nInstalling Oracle Virtualbox\nSetting Up Oracle Enterprise Linux\nInstalling Oracle Software\nCreating Virtual Machines\nCloning Virtual Machines\nInstalling Database Software and Creating Database\nCreating Physical Standby Database\nManaging Physical Standby Database\nBasic usage of Data Guard Broker Utility\nCreating and managing snapshot databases\nSwitchover and failover operations on physical standby database via both SQLPlus and Data Guard Broker\nCreating Far Sync Instance\nConfiguring primary and standby databases for far sync instance\nCreating a Logical Standby database\nManaging Logical Standby database\nSwitchover and failover operations on logical standby database via both SQLPlus and Data Guard Broker\nOracle data guard\nOracle DBA\nOracle database administration\noracle 12c database administration\n\n\nStep-by-Step Way, Simple and Easy With Exercises\nThis course is expertly designed to teach everyone from complete beginners, right through to professionals ( as a refresher).\nWhat is Oracle SQL?\nSQL stands for Structured Query Language—the language developers use to interact with databases to create, read, update, and delete database records and manage other aspects of those databases. ANSI created the standard for SQL. Many database vendors, like Oracle, expand on this standard to create their version of the language. Oracle SQL is compliant with ANSI SQL standards, with features designed specifically for the Oracle database management system. This RDBMS was released as the first commercially available relational database management system in 1977 and holds the top market share worldwide for relational database management systems. Oracle SQL extends the SQL standard with a procedural language PL/SQL and adds the ability to use the Java programming language.\nWhat careers use Oracle SQL?\nHaving Oracle SQL skills can add value to many careers. The most obvious is being a database administrator in enterprises that use the Oracle database management system. But SQL dialects are pretty similar, and knowledge of Oracle SQL can apply to many types of relational databases and doesn't limit you to Oracle. Database developers also use Oracle SQL all day long to create new databases and table structures. Most applications require a database to function, so software engineers and web developers also use Oracle SQL frequently. Data scientists must access data to create machine learning models and find trends, and a lot of this data will get stored in databases that require a knowledge of SQL to retrieve and transform. Business analysts also use Oracle SQL to generate reports that help businesses get to their next stage.\nWhat skills should I have before learning Oracle SQL?\nThere are no prerequisites to learning Oracle SQL. Oracle SQL has a simpler syntax than many standard programming languages and reads almost like English. Most people can understand what a SQL query is trying to do before they even know the language. All you need is an interest in the language and a commitment to learning. That said, some things could help with your Oracle SQL education if you are already familiar with them. If you are familiar with Excel spreadsheets and understand how columns and rows work, you can apply that knowledge to Oracle database tables. It also helps to know at least the concepts of how a relational database management system works. Also, if you already know a programming language, that will help learn Oracle's extended features like PL/SQL.\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s instructors expert.\nFresh Content\nOracle RAC is a unique technology that provides high availability and scalability for all application types. It prevents the server from being a single point of failure. But DBAs also should aware of the recent development and it’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New tools are released every day, Oracle updates its system, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge. With this course, you will always have a chance to follow the latest trends.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our content are created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\n· Seeing clearly\n· Hearing clearly\n· Moving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Cours\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",

      "description": "Oracle SQL Developer is currently the most popular tool among database developers and Oracle SQL learners, however, since it makes it so easy to start firing commands and querying a database, many people don't feel the need to investigate its features, and end up using only what is obvious, visible, and enabled by default.\nIf you are one of them, this course will help you get out of that group and start using Oracle SQL Developer more smartly.\nEven if you have some time using the tool and are currently using some of its features, there's most likely something in this course that you don't know and can be helpful to you.\nLearn the features that can help you work with your Oracle database better and faster:\n\nInstall and customize SQL Developer in a way that works and feels best for you.\nTake full advantage of the most useful features of the tool.\nCreate and share beautiful and interactive reports.\nTake advantage of features that will make you more effective and efficient at work.\nLearn a lot of tricks and enjoy being seen as an SQL Developer expert.\n\n\nAll Oracle SQL Developer features are free. Take advantage of them:\nThis course was created because there appears to be a pattern among Oracle SQL courses and the database community in general: “If you are able to install it and connect to a database, you are good to go\".\nWhat's more: Experience shows that even developers who are already working with Oracle databases as part of their job, tend to not look for ways to work faster in SQL Developer, and usually only investigate features they don't currently use when it is strictly necessary for their jobs.\nThe goal of this course is to fill the gap most SQL courses leave about this great tool so that it can serve as a foundation if you are planning to learn Oracle SQL, and also to help you take advantage of the tool's features if you are already working with Oracle databases as part of your job, so that you can be more efficient and productive, and thus, stand out.\n\n\nContent and Overview:\nThe course includes more than 3 hours of content and covers many of the most useful features of SQL Developer.\nThere is usually one lecture per feature, so, if for any reason you are not interested in any of the included tips, you can simply skip it, and go directly to the one you want to learn about.\nThe course content will continue to be updated over time, to make sure you always know about the most important features available to you, as new versions of Oracle SQL Developer are released.\nLearn these tips and apply them to your work, and you will not only be well prepared to work more smartly and efficiently, but will also enjoy being seen as an experienced and knowledgeable developer by your friends and peers.",

You can use those for hands-on practice, using the Database software that you would have installed (as explained in this course) in your PC/Laptop.\nI would like to thank you sincerely for reading this and wishing you all the best..!\nSam Dhanasekaran\np.s: This started as YouTube video series. I experimented having my own background music initially. Later I removed the music, based on user feedback. So pardon the background music please :-(",

      "description": "O Curso OBIEE Passo a Passo Parte 2/2 - Criando Painéis/Dashboards é a segunda parte do treinamento do Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition, OBIEE 11G.\nNessa Parte 2/2, vamos abordar na PRÁTICA a criação e exploração do recurso que mais chama atenção dos usuários de solução de BI, os Dashboards ou Painéis. Este curso prático fornece aos usuários finais, executivos e analistas uma compreensão clara de como usar e maximizar o valor dos painéis do Oracle Business Intelligence (OBIEE).\nAlém disso você também será apresentado ao Gerenciador de Catalogo, recurso semelhando ao windows explorer, que organiza todos os arquivos do OBIEE permitindo a interação e inserção de análises de assuntos distintos nos painéis.\nNosso treinamento será todo na PRÁTICA permitindo assim uma melhor assimilação do conhecimento. Além disso iremos disponibilizar alguns EXERCÍCIOS como DESAFIOS para o ALUNO.\nAprenda nesse curso:\nCriar e Editar os painéis;\nMontagem e configuração do Painel;\nVisualizar e Exportar os Painéis para XLS ou PDF\nUtilizar Prompts (Recurso para aplicar filtros nos painéis);\nConfigurações dos Prompts;\nAplicar os Prompts as Análises;\nVisualizar os Painéis;\nExplorar o Gerenciador de Catalogo.\nO OBIEE ou OBIEE Answer é a ferramenta de BI da ORACLE, para consumo de dados de BI, que fornece recursos ad hoc de verdadeiros usuários finais em uma arquitetura Web pura. Os usuários interagem com uma visão lógica das informações - completamente escondidos da complexidade da estrutura de dados e, ao mesmo tempo, impedem consultas descontroladas - e podem criar facilmente gráficos, tabelas dinâmicas, relatórios e painéis visualmente atraentes, todos totalmente interativos e exploráveis e podem ser salvos , compartilhados, modificados, formatados ou incorporados nos painéis personalizados do Oracle BI Intelligence do usuário. Os resultados são novos níveis de auto-suficiência do usuário empresarial em um ambiente totalmente seguro e controlado pela TI.\nIMPORTANTE 1:\nNesta parte, vamos considerar que você já deve ter um conhecimento dos recursos do OBIEE, de como criar uma Análise, aplicar Filtros, criar visões, enfim toda a parte que foi trabalhada no curso OBIEE Passo a Passo Parte 1/2 - Do Zero às Análises. Se você ainda não conhece ou não tem essa base, sugiro primeiro a entrar no nosso curso OBIEE Passo a Passo Parte 1/2 - Do Zero às Análises. Entre no meu perfil aqui na Udemy e lá terá acesso ao curso.\nSerão utilizados no treinamento, exemplos de análises criadas no Curso OBIEE Passo a Passo Parte 1/2 - Do Zero às Análises\nIMPORTANTE 2:\nNeste curso iremos utilizar os seguintes recursos: Maquina Virtal Oracle Virtual BOX. Iremos te entregar uma maquina virtual com todo o ambiente do OBIEE completo. Caso você tenha feito o curso OBIEE Passo a Passo Parte 1/2 - Do Zero às Análises, não será necessário criar novamente o ambiente pois será o mesmo.\nDentro desta maquina estará disponível todo ambiente para o treinamento, incluindo o Banco de dados Oracle Express 11G e a suíte do OBIEE 11G.A maquina virtual esta configurada para utilizar 3GB de memória e ocupar pelo menos 20GB de disco. Assim, recomenda se executá-la numa maquina com 8GB de memória e pelo menos 50GB de disco livre.",
