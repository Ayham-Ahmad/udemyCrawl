For wild yeast leaven/sourdough, please look out for our forthcoming course, The Artisan Sourdough Workshop.\nBake yourself happy! Learn a life-skill to love and share.\nA gorgeous, crusty, hand-made loaf can make even the simplest meal heart-warmingly memorable. It is also far better for your health.\nHome-baking skips the mega-dose of chemicals found in much store-bought bread, while slow fermentation lowers GI and makes nutrients more accessible to your body.  It's good news for every body!\nContent and Overview\nOur hands-on  course walks you step-by-step through five different projects, each designed to highlight different aspects of artisan baking.\nWe'll take you through the uninterrupted 'straight run' from mixing to baking on each project, and we'll also show you how to use your fridge if you want to slow down the process.  This creates flexibility so you can easily fit the baking around your life, not fit your life around the baking!\nThese will give you a practical grasp of such concepts as kneading and gluten development, fast or slow fermentation, the relationship between rising time and dough temperature, hydration, leavens, proving, shaping and baking.\nMastering basic artisan breads will give you the confidence to impress your friends and family and to create recipes of your own. We hope it will also inspire you to progress into the magical world of sourdough with our forthcoming course on Udemy, Artisan Sourdough Made Simple.\n\n\n\nHere are a few of our favourite 5 star testimonials from our other courses:\nI gave five stars because the genuine enthusiasm of Penny and Dragan is so infectious, and all the various aspects are explained and demonstrated in such an easy to follow manner. I felt drawn in and couldn't wait to get a starter going. I'm looking forward to the time when I have rocked & rolled & chafed and, hopefully, ended up with a lovely smooth ball of dough - like the one that Dragan cradled in his hands so affectionately. Looks a little like play dough for grown-ups. George.E. Morley\nPenny and Dragan removed the mystique surrounding sourdough and made it very \"do-able.\" Really love the FAB recipe! Bobby Ollar\n…The bonus too is they show the stages of dough development clearly and this was something I struggled to understand before this course. They keep it simple as bread baking should be. I'm really looking forward to more courses. Julia Bilecki\nDragan and Penny! Thank you for putting together such an awesome course. Incredible support, you know what you are talking about. Very insightful course. I really learned a lot, all of the additional advice/tips very helpful and useful. All the best for you.

I’m not following a specific diet, myself.\nBut as a chef consultant, I’ve got many job offers to create gluten-free recipes so I have tried baking with gluten-free flour. From that experience, I’ve learned so many tips for gluten-free baking so I’d like to share them with you in this course.\nI will introduce to you two sponge cake recipes that I converted to be gluten-free, and several delicious dessert recipes using those sponge cakes.\nFor those who are not gluten-free, this course includes many useful techniques for making cakes so I recommend it to anyone who likes baking. You can just use normal flour instead of gluten free flour and add to your repertoire some delicious desserts.\n\n\nI’m going to show you every single step even some small tips, so you will get the hang of it.\nFor this lesson, I will use the professional recipe but you can make it at home.\nAre you ready to jump in and learn new styles of delectable japanese cakes?\nLet's get started!\n\n\nAsami",

Please try to grasp the key points of information quickly.\nIn the cooking lesson sections (SECTION 5 to 9), I have explained the processes step-by-step, using both graphics and videos.\nSECTION 1: Introduction. Here, I will introduce my background as a Tofu Meister and an International Chinese Medical Dietitian. I will discuss why I focus on Tofu and the three benefits of learning Japanese Tofu Dishes.\nSECTION 2: Draining Tofu. While tofu can be cooked immediately after unpacking, draining it can expand your recipe options. I will explain the advantages of draining tofu and how to do it effectively.\nSECTION 3: Types of Tofu. The primary focus will be on explaining the differences between Silken Tofu and Firm Tofu, particularly in terms of their production processes. This information will help you choose the right type of tofu for your cooking needs. I will also discuss other varieties, including Usuage.\nSECTION 4: Unique Seasonings. In this course, I will use distinctive Japanese seasonings to enhance the flavor of tofu. The characteristics of these seasonings will be explained.\nSECTION 5: Tofu Olive Skewers (Pinchos). To demonstrate the effect of draining tofu, we’ll make Tofu Olive Skewers. The tofu will resemble cheese after being thoroughly drained.\nSECTION 6: Tofu Hamburger Steak. A light, healthy hamburger steak can be created by thoroughly draining and mashing tofu with meat. This is an essential recipe to try.\nSECTION 7: Agedashi - Fried Tofu. This is a traditional dish offering an authentic Japanese flavor. You'll again learn the significance of draining tofu properly.\nSECTION 8: Cabbage Usuage Miso Soup. Usuage is a thinly fried tofu available commercially. Enjoy the flavors of miso (a fermented soybean seasoning), dashi (made with Dashi soup stock powder), cabbage, and usuage.\nSECTION 9: Tofu Pancake. Combine store-bought pancake mix with tofu to create pancakes with a unique flavor. The cooking process differs slightly from regular pancakes. Due to tofu's characteristics, the pancakes remain moist even when cooled, resulting in a soft and tasty dish.",

      "description": "This program is taken by Master chef Shawn who have worked out 12 different selected recipes making a great menu.Each recipes is depicting a different technique and skill and combined together gives a great learning to students who wish to know more about Japanese cuisine\nJapanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have developed through centuries of political, economic, and social changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan is based on rice with miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or in sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as tempura. Apart from rice, a staple includes noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also has many simmered dishes such as fish products in broth called oden,\nHot and Cold Soba - The buckwheat nuttiness of soba noodles is a refreshing change from the mildness and softness of white flour pasta. Buckwheat noodles, or soba, are a staple in Japanese cuisine. Chewy with a grainy texture, they're eaten hot, cold, or at room temperature. Because these cold soba noodles have such a grainy taste and texture, they're perfect when paired with simple, clean flavors like soy sauce, sesame oil, and dashi.\nMiso soup is a traditional Japanese soup consisting of a dashi stock into which softened miso paste is mixed. In addition, there are many optional ingredients that may be added depending on regional and seasonal recipes, and personal preference.\nAgedashi Tofu (揚げ出し豆腐) is soft tofu coated with potato starch and deep-fried so that the outer shell is crispy. It is typically served with grated daikon, katsuobushi (bonito flakes), scallion, and grated ginger on top.\nDashi (だし, 出汁) is Japanese soup stock that builds the bases for many of your favorite Japanese dishes like miso soup, chawanmushi, ramen, and shabu shabu. It is the essence of authentic Japanese flavor, and it tells the dishes apart if other substitutions are being used in place of the soup stock.\nGyoza (餃子), or Japanese pan-fried dumplings, are as ubiquitous as ramen in Japan.\nJapanese Curry Udon is a Japanese noodle soup. It was conceived as a mashup of traditional udon noodle soup with Japanese-style curry, but it’s since become one of the most popular udon dishes.\nJapanese salad with Wafu Dressing (和風ドレッシング) refers to a salad dressing that consists of vegetable oil, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. Every household has a slightly different recipe for it and this is my version with grated onion to make it extra flavorful.\nJapanese Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is \"sushi rice\", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.\nTamagoyaki is a type of Japanese omelette, which is made by rolling together several layers of fried egg. These are often prepared in a rectangular omelette pan called a makiyakinabe or tamagoyakiki.\nJapanese Mixed Tempura is a typical Japanese dish usually consisting of seafood, meat, and vegetables that have been battered and deep fried.\nSalmon Teriyaki is an easy Japanese recipe and takes only 4 key ingredients. Serve the salmon with steamed rice and teriyaki sauce for a delicious salmon teriyaki bowl.\nJapanese Beef steak with melted butter together with the low sodium soy sauce",

      "description": "Okinawa is the southernmost region of Japan known for its unique culture, warm climate, beaches and the people with the longest life expectancy in the country. Experts have found four main reasons why the Okinawans live longer than other Japanese and it is interesting to note that one of it is the food they eat.\nIn this course, we will take a look into what the one of the longest living people in the world eats. We will take a peek into what they usually put on their table. We will also learn the ingredients they commonly use and how their food are prepared. It would be a surprise to students to know that Okinawan food are simple and easy to prepare. Though some of the ingredients they use may be hard to find outside Okinawa, you can find substitutes which are more readily available in most places and are also mentioned in this course.\nThis course is divided into several sections and in each section you will learn several recipes for a specific main ingredient commonly used in Okinawa cuisines. It was surprising for me to learn that pork is a vital part of Okinawa cuisines and you will learn several ways to cook pork the Okinawa way. In addition to pork, you will also learn how to prepare Okinawa ingredients such as Okinawa soba, mimigar or pork ears, bitter melon or goya and shima rakkyo or island shallots among others. You will also learn common cooking methods and techniques used in preparing Okinawa food.\nThis course is filled with so much fun, information and deliciousness from every Okinawa dish you will learn to cook. Start with the first lecture now and enjoy every food you will prepare. Have fun in the kitchen.",

      "description": "Course updated 5/10/2021\nI decided to make this course after being asked many questions behind the \"why\" of bread baking. I am always exploring the \"why\" of baking so I thought I would share with you the fun I've had experimenting. This course would be a good one to follow my Sourdough Bread Baking 101 course and it is aimed at beginning and intermediate sourdough bakers.\nIf you don't have a sourdough starter, don't worry, I will show you step by step (with videos) how to make your own starter. You'll also get a free downloadable e-book on how to make your own sourdough starter that you can print out.\nThe course covers:\nExploring protein quality in flour. This shows an easy test to see if your flour is suitable for bread baking. After the test we will use our test doughs to bake up a loaf of bread, so depending upon the flour your testing everyone's loaf will turn out different.\nGluten washing - see how to extract gluten from flour. See how it looks and performs, also see how the starch looks.\nRecovering from a mistake. I made a huge mistake when I was doing one of the experiments, so instead of ditching the experiments, we explore how to recover from a mistake and we make beautiful Ciabatta bread.\nAll purpose flour VS bread flour. In this experiment we explore the differences between all purpose flour and bread flour. We'll use three experiments and do a higher hydration each time. You might be surprised at the outcome.\nWith the last iteration of the comparison loaves, we will use a high quality bread flour and a double hydration to bake up an 88% hydration loaf.\nThe last thing we will look at is the life cycle of a sourdough starter from feeding to it's death. We'll also make pancakes from the discard!\n\n\nWe'll talk about freezing dough and what happens as well as how to protect gluten in a weak dough and how to slow down fermentation (see the links in the bonus section).\n\nWe are going to have a lot of fun! So join me in this exploration of sourdough baking!\nTeresa",

      "description": "This course is a mixture of informative and cooking videos focused on the ketogenic diet. Cristina Ioniță, a ketogenic diet specialist, talks about the basics and the metabolic mechanisms of the diet. Viorel Copolovici, a chef, prepares keto dishes that everyone can cook at home or even order in a keto friendly restaurant.\nBoth instructors have gone through the ketogenic experience before deciding to create this course. Cristina has lost more than 60 pounds (about 28 kg) with the keto diet before going on to study it professionally and to become a certified ketogenic specialist. Viorel, who has already published two basic cooking techniques courses on Udemy, started to live keto in May 2018 and lost about 30 pounds (14 kg) in the first 4-5 months of diet. He is now working on his second milestone of another 20-25 pounds and you can already see the difference from his previous courses.\nThe course is a very dynamic and easy to digest formula of applied knowledge. You will discover how the diet works, what are its fundamental rules and processes and learn very effective ways to achieve great results by knowing what to eat, while spending a minimum amount of time in your kitchen. After you understand the principles and you decide to give it a try, you will probably discover one of the best and the wisest ways to lose weight.\nHowever, keto works on fully customized meal plans and it requires medical supervision. Even if it has been proven that ketogenic principles have a positive impact on several important medical conditions, we do recommend two things to all the students that decide to try it:\n1. Take a general blood test and get the interpretation of the results from your doctor.\n2. Find a trustful and recommended ketogenic dietitian for your personalized meal plans. If you would like to work directly with Cristina, don't hesitate to contact her through Udemy and ask for advice.",

Ever wonder what will happen when “all hell breaks loose\" as seen in many a weather-catastrophe, or an economic melt-down via a stock-market crash? We're only 9 meals away from hunger ...\n\nBe prepared NOW - rather than LATER.\nCreate a stockpile of food before hurricanes, tornadoes, or earthquakes hit. What if a rampant virus hits your home state - and you are quarantined at home? How are you gonna eat? Don't rely on help from the Government. They can only do so much. If we are faced with war, or an electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) solar flare - be it weather-related or man-made by a maniac, YOU will be able to feed YOUR family.\nLook, it doesn't have to be an EMP that makes you take action; you or your spouse may lose their job - now you're faced with half the income - but the bills are still there. Lessen the stress by knowing you have more than enough food on-hand to get through the tough times.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nDon't forget: Udemy provides a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not totally delighted.\n\n5-Star Reviews (thank you!):\nSee what Charity Cason has to say about this course:\n\nEasy, Quick & Informative!\nI know nothing about food dehydrating, but I've always wanted to learn, so this was a great, quick course for doing just that! If you don't want to have to spend hours learning the proper techniques, this is a great investment of your time. The videos are produced well and are extremely easy to follow. Recommend!\nC Eliot adds:\nNot a topic a lot of people consider, but three majors cities in the world are currently experiencing drought. Who's next? What's next? Better to be prepared than to wish you would have. The instructor does a great job of addressing the key points in food and preemptive planning. Will be coming back to this for reference.\nand Michelle Cohn22 says:\nThis was a great course in food dehydration. It was very informative and everyone should take this course.",

      "description": "Sourdough bread is within the reach of every gluten-free baker.  This  course shows that all you need is a naturally gluten free sourdough starter to leaven your dough, and a knowledge of the range of flours and binders.\nThis course is built around three different starters, which you will make from scratch, and use to make 6 different sourdough recipes, including rustic boule, rolls, a sandwich loaf and even sourdough pizza.   Once you have grasped the basics of  sourdough fermentation, you'll be off on one of baking's greatest adventures, inventing sourdough recipes of your own!\nRecipes are either vegan or suggest vegan substitutions.\n\n\nHere are a few of our favourite 5 star testimonials from our other courses:\nI gave five stars because the genuine enthusiasm of Penny and Dragan is so infectious, and all the various aspects are explained and demonstrated in such an easy to follow manner. I felt drawn in and couldn't wait to get a starter going. I'm looking forward to the time when I have rocked & rolled & chafed and, hopefully, ended up with a lovely smooth ball of dough - like the one that Dragan cradled in his hands so affectionately. Looks a little like play dough for grown-ups. George.E. Morley\nPenny and Dragan removed the mystique surrounding sourdough and made it very \"do-able.\" Really love the FAB recipe! Bobby Ollar\n…The bonus too is they show the stages of dough development clearly and this was something I struggled to understand before this course. They keep it simple as bread baking should be. I'm really looking forward to more courses. Julia Bilecki\nDragan and Penny! Thank you for putting together such an awesome course. Incredible support, you know what you are talking about. Very insightful course. I really learned a lot, all of the additional advice/tips very helpful and useful. All the best for you.

      "description": "The course is built around seven key recipes that illustrate different basic techniques in gluten free baking. We start by discussing the principles of GF baking, and examining the key ingredients - in particular, a surprisingly wide range of naturally gluten free flours with which to add appeal to your hand-baked breads. As we go along, we show you how to blend your own flours, and how to store them in portion-sized bags for ultimate convenience in your weekly bake. From classic white sandwich bread, to more artisanal hand-shaped loaves, baguettes, pizzas and rolls, we cover enough ground to keep even the most demanding satisfied, whether you've just arrived on planet GF, or you've been diagnosed for 20 years.  Welcome to a more gorgeously gluten free world!\nPlease note: all recipes are vegan or have vegan subsitutions.  If you are allergic to baker's yeast please look out  for our course, Naturally Gluten Free Sourdough Breads.\nHere are a few of our favourite 5 star testimonials from our other courses:\nI gave five stars because the genuine enthusiasm of Penny and Dragan is so infectious, and all the various aspects are explained and demonstrated in such an easy to follow manner. I felt drawn in and couldn't wait to get a starter going. I'm looking forward to the time when I have rocked & rolled & chafed and, hopefully, ended up with a lovely smooth ball of dough - like the one that Dragan cradled in his hands so affectionately. Looks a little like play dough for grown-ups. George.E. Morley\nPenny and Dragan removed the mystique surrounding sourdough and made it very \"do-able.\" Really love the FAB recipe! Bobby Ollar\n…The bonus too is they show the stages of dough development clearly and this was something I struggled to understand before this course. They keep it simple as bread baking should be. I'm really looking forward to more courses. Julia Bilecki\nDragan and Penny! Thank you for putting together such an awesome course. Incredible support, you know what you are talking about. Very insightful course. I really learned a lot, all of the additional advice/tips very helpful and useful. All the best for you. Marcelo Ariatti\nThe videos are priceless!  Aden\nWhy not check out the promo video and the free lectures for yourself?",

      "description": "Italian cuisine consists of traditional meals and ingredients that people consume in Italy. While pasta, sauces, and cheeses are staples across the country, every region has its own unique ingredients and dishes that have contributed to the influence of Italian cuisine\nThis topic consist of 15 classic Italian recipes making a complete menu\nCaprese Salad - The traditional Italian caprese salad (pronounced “cah-preh-zseh”) is typically made with just tomatoes, basil, mozzarella and olive oil but I love the addition of a balsamic reduction.\nLasagna - Lasagne are a type of wide, flat pasta, possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. Lasagne, or the singular lasagna, is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of thin flat pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù and other vegetables, cheese, and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil.\nFungi Risotto - This risotto is simply made with sauteed mushrooms, shallots, a touch of white wine, and arborio rice with some fresh parmesan cheese. But, the real magic comes from using mushroom stock, although vegetable stock can be substituted.\nPenne Amatriciana - Pasta with Amatriciana sauce is a traditional, zesty Italian pasta sauce, based on guanciale, (salt-cured pork jowl), pecorino cheese and tomato. Originating from the town of Amatrice (in the mountainous Province of Rieti of Lazio region), the Amatriciana is one of the most well-known pasta sauces in Roman and Italian cuisine.\nPizza Calzone - A calzone is an Italian oven-baked folded pizza, often described as a turnover, made with leavened dough. It originated in Naples in the 18th century.\nOssobuco or osso buco - is a specialty of Lombard cuisine of cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth. It is often garnished with gremolata and traditionally served with either risotto alla milanese or polenta, depending on the regional variation.\nFettuccine Alfredo or fettuccine al burro - is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese. As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich sauce coating the pasta.\nRisotto al Pesto - Italian rice with basil sauce, prawns and green beans\nChicken parmigiana, or chicken parmesan - is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added. The dish originated from 20th-century Italian diaspora.\nBeef and bresaala meatball in Pomadoro - These Italian beef braciole are deliciously fork tender and packed with a heavenly medley of flavors that will make your taste buds sing!\nLinguini with seafood - Transfer the pasta and sauce to a large warmed bowl, sprinkle with crushed red pepper and serve.\nGnocchi with Truffle - Gnocchi macaroni and cheese is bathed in an easy white cheddar and truffle infused sauce to add an elegant touch to everyone's favorite comfort food.\nBeef saltimbocca with mushroom - Beef Saltimbocca with Mushrooms\nBroccoli and Anchovy Orecchiette - Delicious Broccoli and Anchovy Orecchiette is a midweek saviour.\nSquid salad - A light refreshing seafood salad made with squid, fresh lemon, celery, red onion, roasted peppers, garlic and parsley.",

Each section is between 4 and 7 min long with a short quiz at the end of the lecture modules and an online test, provided at the end.\nStudents who successfully complete the online exam and send in a very brief demonstration of calibrating an espresso grind as well as a 2 min video of them building a latte and cappuccino correctly will receive a certificate of completion from Umbria Coffee Roasters.\nUmbria Coffee Roasting Company integrates 3 generations of acquired coffee roasting secrets with the Italian traditions of coffee roasting.  Their award winning and critically acclaimed espresso roasts are a must for coffee enthusiast to try.\nWhile this course focuses on the Italian philosophy of making exceptional coffee, it is designed for whatever premium coffee you or your establishment are serving.",

The cuisine of the Caucasus includes the traditional cooking methods of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.\nThe Danish chef René Redzepi has described Georgia as home to “one of the last great undiscovered food cultures of Europe.” Travelers who have enjoyed the traditional cooking of the Mediterranean or Persian influence will find some familiarities present in the Caucasus: a bounty of fresh produce, the harmony of savory and sweet within the meat and grain-based dishes, and a deep, spiritual love of bread – ubiquitous, fragrant and essential. It should be noted that vegetarians, too, will do very well eating throughout the region as a plethora of dishes relies solely on this garden of a land and its variously grilled, stuffed, and pickled vegetables, along with hearty bread, rice preparations, and all manner of dairy stemming from rich, open-aired alpine pastures.\nWhether you are a student of history, a lover of nature, or are propelled around the globe by your appetite, the Caucasus – much like the traditional tables of their respective countries – have everything on offer.\nYou will not only learn the Caucasian cooking methods but its culture too!\nCaucasian way of cooking is one of the most ancient culinary in the world. The Caucasus culinary is unique as it takes experience from both European and Asian gastronomy.",

      "description": "Pad Thai is a long-time Thai favourite dish. It is popular Thai Food and easy to find anywhere in Thailand: at food courts, on street food stalls, local markets, local restaurants and high-end restaurants.\nThe variety of Pad Thai dishes is wide and there is an endless way of enjoying this dish. Different parts of the country have different ways of cooking the dish to make it unique and delicious. The traditional way is very simple and the original Pad Thai recipe. Just cook noodles at high heat with egg, Chinese chives, bean sprouts, chopped sweet preserved daikon radish, Tofu, dried shrimps and ground peanuts. Season the stir-fried noodles with fish sauce, sugar and ground chilli.\nNot only is the taste tempting but the texture of Pad Thai noodles is moist and gooey.\nThe noodles for Pad Thai in Thailand are usually fresh noodles from markets which are locally produced in every province in Thailand and dried noodles, particularly from Chantaburi (a province in eastern Thailand). It calls “Sen Chan” or Chantaburi noodles. Chantaburi dried noodles are famous because of their quality, and once cooked are particularly soft and gooey.\nWith this reputation, Pad Thai Sen Chan noodles are one of the popular variations with a specific type of the main ingredient and are well-known throughout the country.\n\n\nI recall when I was a child. I lived in a shophouse nearby the city’s market and I lived nearby one of the shophouses which sold Pad Thai. I liked to go nearby to that place to watch them cooking Pad Thai. It was always busy with people eating Pad Thai or waiting to take it home.\n\n\nIf you love Thai food and you have ever cooked Pad Thai but didn’t get the result as you eat at a restaurant or while eating during your trip in Thailand.\n- You never get the taste right, not even close.\n- Your stir-fry noodles are soggy and the noodles are cut into small pieces.\n- When you finish cooking your noodles stir fry is chewy, sticky catching in roll together, and difficult to eat.\n\n\nI had the same problems. I never like cooking Pad Thai at home. But you know what, my problems are solved after I tried to practice and discovered small techniques cooking at home and I love cooking Pad Thai even more and am passionate about it.\nThese cooking classes will help you to enjoy Pad Thai the same as you eat the dish in Thailand.\n\n\nThis course gives you easy-to-follow recipes that you can make at home bringing the authentic local Thai Street food to your kitchen and eating like a Thai.\nSee you in the kitchen.",

You’ll discover how these teas are made—fully fermented black tea, semi-fermented oolong, and post-fermented dark tea—and what makes them special. We'll also teach you how to choose the right teaware and even how to brew great tea at home using everyday tools.\nTo bring it all together, we’ve filmed real tea ceremony performances, so you can experience the elegance and beauty of Chinese tea in an immersive way.\nWhether you’re curious about tea and just starting out, passionate about learning how to brew and taste it better, or someone who wants to use tea for wellness and balance—this course is for you.

Do you know much about chocolate?\nFor many of us chocolate is something we grew up with and as an adult, a sweet treat you buy from the supermarket with not much thought.\nYet there is a rich and fascinating history behind chocolate. In this course, I use my chocolate expert knowledge to:\nTake you all the way back to Olmec and Aztec times where the human love of cocoa was well known - long before it reached Europe.\nI'll then talk about how it was a secret of the Spanish before it fuelled the height's of London debauchery in the 1650's.\nMore than just history you'll become your very own chocolate expert, with all the information you need to find the world's best chocolate.\nI will then teach you to how to truly experience chocolate when you eat it - in same way a wine connoisseur appreciates wine (just not spitting it out!).\nWhat you need\nHave some milk and dark chocolate on-hand for the final chapters of your course where you will taste with me.\nIn an ideal world you want to have some great quality chocolate. I have included the brands I will be tasting in the chapter notes.\nIf you're in Australia you can buy these from my online store, Fiamma Chocolate and we will deliver to your door.\nIf you're not in Australia, you can source these or similar from where you live (Google is your friend).\nWarning: supermarket chocolate is easy to access but never great quality, and it won't have much flavour profile. If you can, do buy some better quality chocolate - but if that's not possible don't worry. Just use what you can get - this is meant to be fun and indulgent after all!\nOur Chocolate Tasting Wheel. We will provide this as a resource of the How to Taste chapter and you can print it, or just use online.",

This course is designed for experienced pizza makers who are eager to understand the “why” behind every step of the process.\nI won’t give you a “perfect recipe”, I will not tell you “which is the best flour to make pizza dough”. Instead, I will explore the micro-level details: the chemistry of dough development, the biology of fermentation, and how ingredients and techniques interact to produce specific results. By understanding these principles, you’ll learn how to take control of your baking, troubleshoot common issues, and fine-tune your process to achieve the outcomes you’re after.\nThroughout the course, I’ll cover key concepts, including gluten formation, hydration levels, enzymatic activity, and the impact of temperature and time on dough. This is a theory-driven course with no hands-on videos, making it ideal for pizza enthusiasts who love to learn and experiment.\nWhether you’re a passionate home baker or a professional looking to refine your craft, The Pizza Geek will equip you with the knowledge and confidence to approach pizza-making with precision and purpose.\nEnroll now and geek out about pizza like never before!\n\n\nAbout the Instructor\nFabio, a professional pizzaiolo, has left the pizzeria, but pizza still puts food on his table (pun intended). He is now a technical consultant for a well known Mill in London (UK) and teaches pizza making at various levels, both remotely and in person.\nHis book, Fabioulous Pizza, became an Amazon best-seller on the day of its launch.

      "description": "Course Updated May 2022\nThis is my tenth sourdough baking course and many of you have been asking me to do more with whole grains. As the baking courses have gotten more advanced with newer and more advanced techniques, I have tried to incorporate more whole grains. With this course there are even more formulas and flour blends using whole grains. Ten new formulas are featured in this course. Most of the whole grain flour is freshly ground. They are all made with sourdough, no commercial yeast is used.\nThe loaves featured are:\nKhorasan Boules\nJuly Loaf\nSpring Fling Seeded Sourdough\nCranNut Sourdough\nKhorasan Batards\nOrganic Red Spring Wheat Rustic\nOne Day Miche\nRanch Sourdough\nStegosaurus Bread\nBeetroot Sourdough Bread\nYou will also learn how to figure out the Desired Dough Temperature or DDT, how to grind and use fresh grains, utilize leftover bran from sifting flour, incorporate low hydration Motherdough, shape 100% hydration dough and also how to make and use dough binders, they are so much fun!\nIf you need to learn basic sourdough baking skills, please begin with the first few courses, beginning skills are not covered in this course. The formulas in this course are intended for intermediate to advanced bakers.\nSome student reviews from my other baking courses:\n\"What can I say? Teresa is a teacher who knows how to communicate her passion for sourdough bread. She doesn't just give us recipes. She teaches techniques, shares her knowledge, gives support and tips. This is perfect!\" Julie Fiset\n\n\"I like to watch the whole process before I start, but it looks like it will be really easy to follow once I dive in. I love Teresa's hands on method. Being able to see it as it happens is so helpful!\" Karen Yancey\n\n\"Super easy to follow with combination of written and video instruction.\" Meri Issel\n\n\"I love all of Teresa's courses, including this one.

      "description": "Hi there, my name is Tipyapar Pla Traisombat. Welcome to my course and my kitchen.\n\nAre you a fan of Thai Food ?\nI know you may like to cook Thai food at home sometimes. But what is Thai home cooking for everyday meals?\n\n\nHere are some questions that might interest you or be in your mind:\n\n- Is Thai Food only curry ?\n- Do Thai people cook and eat curries every day ?\n- Have you ever struggled to find all ingredients in one place for one meal ?\n- Have you bought an ingredient only for cooking one dish and never used it again ?\n\n\nI sometimes struggle with my shopping list at my local supermarket and cannot complete my cooking plan and almost run out of time for shopping. Our busy daily schedules running against the clock, I find it is so boring and exhausting when my meal plan is not going well. I still have to feed the family. So this is the idea of this course, the basic concept of core ingredients to have in kitchen cabinets and get fresh supply meat and simple vegetables from local supermarkets or what would have left in kitchen cabinets from weekly shopping.\n\n\nThis course will help you to make simple, easy to cook meals that are budget-conscious but delicious. They are the really tasty meals that will become regulars at your family table. Besides, these recipes are the meals that we eat at home every day in Thailand and some of the dishes are famous street food that the locals eat every day such as Stir-Fried Pork Garlic Pepper, Stir-Fried Minced Pork with Holy Basil Leaves and Thai style Omelet.\nIn addition, popular dishes like Tom Yum, Pad Thai, Noodles, Tom Kha Gai, Pad See Ew and Thai Curry are also included in the course.\n\n\nThe course is based on a simple concept for creating a good meal plan, easy recipes, and will help you to extend the variety of your weekly meal plan with home cooking recipes of Thai Food.\n\n\nI also added some recipes in this course that you can try to cook when you have more time at the weekend. It is nice to cook something different and delicious sometimes although it will consume a bit more time but is not too tricky.\n\n\nEach recipe in my course is provided with step by step clear instructions with subtitles. In addition, there is a downloadable bonus provided at the end of the course which will be a very helpful guide for your cooking.\n\n\nThis cooking class gives you easy to make recipes with basic ingredients for Thai cuisine that you can cook at home bringing the authentic local Thai food to your kitchen.\n\n\nSee you in the kitchen.",

      "description": "Running a highly successful wood fired micro-pizzeria inspired the founders of The Artisan Bakery School, Penny and Dragan, to add two day-courses in pizza-making to their curriculum; one wood fired and one not.\nIn this comprehensive online course, you get the benefit of BOTH those courses:  how to use your wood fired oven to best effect, and how to make your ordinary oven produce extraordinary pizza.\nBuilding up to this, you will learn how to:\nread your dough, and master all its stages\nmake and shape a extensive range of different doughs\n\nconcoct delectable sauces\n\ndesign a balanced flavour profile for topping ingredients\n\ncreate finishing touches that will really elevate your pizza\n\n\nContents and Overview\nOur welcome lecture introduces you to our document, How to Use this Course.  In it, you will find suggestions for how to proceed, according to whether you're a complete beginner, an improver, a passionately adventurous cook, an aspiring professional or an entrepreneur considering a micropizzeria business.  You can follow the suggestions, or just work your way through every recipe as it comes up.\nFollowing a run-down of the essential pizza-making equipment, we move on to Dough-ology, Saucery and Top-ology,  introducing a discussion about the basic ingredients, and the importance of sourcing local, organic produce wherever possible.  This is because authentic pizza, like all really good food, has a story to it.  It's  just wonderful to be able to tell your guests what's special about the tomatoes in the sauce, or the particular olives, or the artisan cheese that's on the pizza.  It adds depth to everyone's appreciation of the food.\n\nMoving into our tried and tested Seven Steps Method, you'll have a range of different dough formulas to choose from, each with its own unique flavour and texture.  From pure Napoletana dough, through sourdough and heritage dough, right through to gluten free, you'll get to understand all the different characters and of course, how each dough has its affinities with different kinds of topping.   Simply pick yourself a formula and start at Step 1.\nLearning to read your dough is as important as being able to read the recipe for making it!  That means understanding the dough in all its moods and modes, as well as how to shape it into balls, then into pizza. You'll get plenty of practice at reading your dough, and lots of exercises in shaping it too.\nIn Step 3, you'll move on to making sauces, covering everything from the classic tomato sauces, through white bases to home-made pesto and even onion marmalade.   You'll also learn how to make infused garlic and chilli oils and other little finishing touches to add in Step 7, once your pizza is baked.\nYou'll see how we run our Start and Finish Lines, to keep our toppings organised and our garnishes in order, and how important this is if you're making multiple pizzas!\nThroughout the course, you'll find videos packed with tips and insights gleaned from years of professional pizza-making experience.\nThe course finishes with 15 inspiring pizza recipes from The Artisan Bakery School,  each designed to showcase a balanced profile of salty, sweet, sour, bitter, smokey or umami flavours, and in a way that makes your dough a star of the show.\nSo - if you're hungry to learn, you're in the right place!\n\n\nHere are a few of our favourite 5 star testimonials from our other courses:\nI gave five stars because the genuine enthusiasm of Penny and Dragan is so infectious, and all the various aspects are explained and demonstrated in such an easy to follow manner.

Many of the ingredients are easy to source from any supermarket. For ingredients such as beans flour and yam, you will need to visit an African food shop or look into ordering online from African food retailers.\nEach recipe has its own dedicated video, so you can choose to cook the snacks in any order. I highly recommend that you watch each video all the way through for the first time, making a not of the ingredients and the equipment you will need to make the snack. Afterwards, you can cook along in real time, pausing and playing the video where required.\nThe snacks featured in this course include: Akara, Chin Chin, Kuli-Kuli, Puff Puff, and Yamarita. They are all crowd-pleasers, often served at parties and special occasions, but also made and sold as on-the-go street food snacks. Learning to make them for yourself at home is a game-changer. For fellow Nigerians, the snacks will no doubt be nostalgic. For those new to Nigerian cuisines or these recipes in particular, this is a great way to learn a bit about our snack traditions.\nHappy cooking!\nTomi (a.k.a. The Vegan Nigerian)",

A freshly baked artisan sourdough on the table is guaranteed to warm anyone’s heart - and the good news is that you can easily do this every day.\nContent and overview\nOur practical course is designed to give you crystal clear instructions on how to build beautiful, sourdough bread-baking into your everyday life. No stress, no fuss. Just a simple, 5-minute routine.\nWe start by explaining what a natural, wild yeast starter (leaven) is, and exactly how to make and look after your own.  Creating the starter takes about 1 minute a day for 5 days, but after that you can keep it going for the rest of your life.\nOnce your starter is established, you’re ready to begin the first of our six authentic sourdough projects. Each one gives you an insight into a different technique, a different flour, or ways to incorporate other ingredients.  Together, they build your knowledge and experience of key sourdough principles such as leaven use, hydration, fermentation and retardation.\nWhether it’s a crackling baguette, a fragrant thyme and olive bread  or a rich walnut rye, we aim to give you enough knowledge and confidence to regularly bake all your own sourdough breads for yourself with virtually no effort at all.\nHere are a few of our favourite 5 star testimonials from our other courses:\nI gave five stars because the genuine enthusiasm of Penny and Dragan is so infectious, and all the various aspects are explained and demonstrated in such an easy to follow manner. I felt drawn in and couldn't wait to get a starter going. I'm looking forward to the time when I have rocked & rolled & chafed and, hopefully, ended up with a lovely smooth ball of dough - like the one that Dragan cradled in his hands so affectionately. Looks a little like play dough for grown-ups. George.E. Morley\nPenny and Dragan removed the mystique surrounding sourdough and made it very \"do-able.\" Really love the FAB recipe! Bobby Ollar\n…The bonus too is they show the stages of dough development clearly and this was something I struggled to understand before this course. They keep it simple as bread baking should be. I'm really looking forward to more courses. Julia Bilecki\nDragan and Penny! Thank you for putting together such an awesome course. Incredible support, you know what you are talking about. Very insightful course. I really learned a lot, all of the additional advice/tips very helpful and useful. All the best for you.

For each technique I’ll show you ways to add finishing touches like borders or piped details or a sparkly finish or metallic gold accents.

Pursuing a coffee career can be costly in term of time and money. Therefore, my purpose for this course is to provide a well-organized and affordable course for anyone who has limited resources.\nThis module provides an overview of the coffee value chain, includes:\n- Coffee History and popular Coffee Species\n- The new wave of coffee and Specialty Coffee Standards\n- Coffee growing conditions/regions and origin characteristics\n- Processing methods and storing green coffee beans\n- Specialty coffee roasting and cupping\n- Coffee brewing and the differences between popular drinks (Espresso drinks vs. Non-espresso drinks)\n- Fun facts about our morning cups\nWithin a short period of time, I won't be able to deep dive into each topic. However, I'm quite confident that I have provided you a clear picture about the whole process. So you can decide what you want to do next.\nThank you so much for checking my course!

Let’s get started learning about the roots of coffee.\nDo you really need a course?\nCan you learn about coffee without taking a course? Sure. There’s plenty of free stuff available online.\nBut the reality is that wading through everything on the internet takes time.

I have years of experience taking a complicated subject and making it easy and fun.\nThat's why people call me The Coffee Lady (seriously, you can Google it).\nTry the course out to see why most of my students give me a 5-star rating! I'm always here to support you and to answer all of your coffee questions.\nWhat if you don't like coffee?\nMany of my students don't actually like coffee! But they recognize that learning about coffee is an essential business and life skill...and along the way, some of them learn to love the brew.\nWhat if your English isn't perfect?\nMy students live around the world and have learned English as a second language. So don't worry if your English isn't perfect - my students tell me the information I teach is easy to understand (and the videos have captions that I personally edited!).

      "description": "Bolo Rei (Portuguese King's Cake) is Portugal's most famous Christmas sweet. This fluffy cake with brioche type of dough is enriched with raisins, nuts and candied fruits.\nThis is Portugal's version of French Gâteau des Rois, similar to Roscón de Reyes from Spain and Rosca de Reyes from Latin America. Bolo Rei also shares similarities with New Orleans King Cake, associated with celebrations of Mardi Gras/Carnival in Louisiana. It's also somehow similar to Italian Panettone, in the way that it is a cake typically eaten around Christmas time, featuring soft dough with dried and candied fruits.\nFollowing this course, you will be able to make genuine Bolo Rei at home, as well as the variation without candied fruits: Bolo Rainha. The recipe shared here is my family business award-winning recipe, which won BEST BOLO REI IN LISBON.\nWe will do everything in an easy to follow way, yet achieve professional results, just like if you bought Bolo Rei at a Portuguese bakery.\nDon't worry about finding specific ingredients such as candied fruits, as we will also look into how to make these colorful fruits at home in a simple and accessible way for home-cooks of all levels.\nThis course will help you celebrate Christmas Portuguese style! Wether you are Portuguese, of Portuguese descent and you live abroad, or a foodie with curiosity to expand taste and home recipes beyond borders, we look forward to sharing these authentic Portuguese recipes with you.\nObrigado!",

Once you've learned some simple methods for preparing dough and buying the right ingredients you'll never have to order out for pizza again.\nI grew up working in pizzerias as a pizza chef. Desperate to reproduce professional restaurant results, I have been working for over 20 years to perfect the art of baking pizza at home. Now I want to pass that knowledge on to you! You can avoid the bad burns and mistakes that I made along the way by watching as I share pro pizza recipes, tips and tricks.\nContent and Overview:\nThis course is directed at those who want to take their home pizza skills to the next level. With over 15 lectures and hours of content, you'll learn fundamental concepts, oven selection, essential ingredients and many specific recipes.\nThe first section of the curse, Before You Bake, covers the things you will need to know before you start cooking. You'll gain pro knowledge like how to work with a home oven to get the best pizza crust, what ingredients make the most difference in taste, and what pizza equipment is worth your money.\nThe second section, Dough Preparation, covers everything you need to know about making your own pizza dough. From preparing the dough to stretching it into a pizza, you'll gain the skills required to get to the oven.\nThe Pizza Recipe sections are filled with lessons which show you step by step how to build time-tested pizza recipes that you and your guests will love to eat. Each recipe lesson includes a video lecture as well as a recipe card so you can follow along in your own kitchen.

      "description": "Hello, dear friends, and welcome to my second course of the «Coffee Basics» series – «The BOTANY of COFFEE.»\nIt is intended for Coffee Lovers and Baristas who want to know more about their favorite drink and understand all its diversity and versatility.\nI will introduce myself to those who are not yet familiar with my first course – «The HISTORY of COFFEE.» By the way, I strongly recommend that you take it, because, together with the «COFFEE BOTANY», it will help you form a COMPLETE picture of basic coffee knowledge.\nMy name is Sergio Reminny, I am a coffee expert with 25 years of experience in the coffee industry, a businessman, a writer, and the first Coordinator of the European Speciality Coffee Association (SCAE) in Ukraine (2003-2008).\nAfter thousands of articles on my Coffee Blog, hundreds of videos on my YouTube channel, and a series of coffee books, I created this online course.\nThe main task that I set for myself in the course was to translate the complex coffee world knowledge into SIMPLE and INTERESTING lessons for both ordinary coffee lovers and baristas. And also to teach you to UNDERSTAND the relationship between different coffee categories and, to help you use this knowledge in your life.\nIn general, my coffee botany course consists of 5 main blocks, including:\nThe LIFE CYCLES section, where we will figure out how the coffee beans are made up and what happens to coffee in its early days, youth, and old age.\nWe will find out who are «Soldiers» and «Butterflies», how many chromosomes coffee has, and how global warming threatens this plant.\nIn the CLASSIFICATION block, we will study the main groups and botanical species of coffee in the global trade.\nWe will figure out what is «Coffee Grown in the Shade» and how the coffee tree conquered our planet.\nIn the VARIETIES block, we will discuss the relationship between Arabica and Robusta, will study Liberica and coffee hybrids, and familiarize ourselves with such varieties as Polysperma and Arabusta.\nThe PROCESSES section - here we will understand the complex, but incredibly important details of moisture and drying of coffee, the secrets of fermentation, and will also talk about «Honey coffee» and «Monsooned» (or, «Aged») coffee.\nIn the BEAN section, we will talk about all the nuances of the density and sizes of the coffee beans and will understand such important aspects as the caffeine content.\nWe will review the defects of the coffee beans in detail and will understand the specifics of the «Coffee Caviar» – peaberry, and we will try to understand why «Coffee Rust» is a tragedy of the world of coffee.\nIn the last block, entitled CERTIFICATIONS, you will learn what different certification programs can tell the consumer about the taste of coffee. In this section, we will speak about Fair Trade, birds, and the «Cup of Excellence.»\nAnd for dessert, we will figure out what the real Speciality coffee is.\nDespite the scientific-sounding of the term «Botany», the course, in my opinion, turned out to be simple, interesting, and entertaining – it contains a lot of illustrations and videos.\nThe materials presented here are unique, and you will not find them on the Internet. All the lessons of the course are based on my many years of experience studying coffee and my personal system of compiling this knowledge.\nBelieve me, it took me decades of work and thousands of hours of detailed study of a huge amount of data.\nI assure you that after completing this course, your level of coffee knowledge will rise to new heights.\nAnd I promise that it will be interesting.\nWell, my friends, we have a lot of work to do, so let's get down to business right away!",

The neutrality, or lack of flavor allows Vodka to be easily flavored with other ingredients and has helped to make Vodka as popular as it is today.\nWith so many styles and flavor profiles, there are plentiful samples of Vodka to choose from.

With so many brands to select from it is often difficult to make a selection at that bar or restaurant, or to know what to mix it with.\nThis course is aimed at fixing all that!\nWARNING: THIS COURSE GETS TECHNICAL AT TIMES!

      "description": "Mexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture, social structure and popular traditions of Mexico. The most important example of this connection is the use of mole (traditional sauce) for special occasions and holidays, particularly in the South and Central regions of the country.\nMexican cuisine is a complex and ancient cuisine, with techniques and skills developed over thousands of years of history. It is created mostly with ingredients native to Mexico, as well as those brought over by the Spanish conquistadors, with some new influences since then. Mexican cuisine has been influenced by its proximity to the US-Mexican border. For example, burritos were thought to have been invented for easier transportation of beans by wrapping them in tortillas for field labor.\nThis program is developed by chef Gabriel Bonin for APCA chef online. 13 world class recipes are developed in a form of menu from salad, soups, starter, Main course, and desserts. The entire program is from start to finish which is very easy to follow. You can remake these recipes in your kitchen or Home.\nMenu for Mexican Cuisine –\n\n\nCorn Salad\nBurrito Egg Roll\nChicken Enchiladas Sliders\nShrimp Tostada\nRancheros Eggs\nChicken Pozole\nTortilla Soup\nChilly Cheese Crunchy wrap\nChicken Fazitas\nSweet Bbq Lime Chicken Tacos\nShredded Beef Enchiladas\nBeef Empanadas\nTamale Pie\nBeef cheese quesadillas\nChocolate Churro Ravioli\nChocolate Ravioli\nAll the recipes are tried and tested and ensure that you get a perfect result. Some of the recipes allow you to change the vegetables or meat but you must do trial and error method and totally as per to your choice.\nWe hope you will like this program as much we like to create this program for the students",

There is also a variety of cooking techniques paired with these sauce's. All of the cooking derives from classical French recipe's. In this course you will learn how to make a variety of different sauce's in under one hour. I suggest taking the lesson's in order because there is information in the beginning of the course that will better prepare you for the later lesson's. I not only show all of the cooking step by step and provide recipe's, I also explain some of the properties of the ingredient's used. This will help you better understand the ingredient's and will allow for more success in the kitchen. It will also spark more ideas to utilize these ingredient's in different application's. A better understanding of food makes for a much more efficient and interesting cooking experience. I believe ditching recipes and working from the mind is a liberating part of cooking.",

      "description": "This is my ninth online pastry course, and this is all about Chocolate desserts. Yes, chocolate. I have a love affair with chocolate.\nSo I'm so happy to share this course with you!  I will introduce you to five of my favorite chocolate desserts.\nFirst, we’re gonna make Japanese Nama-Chocolate which are small squares of silky, smooth chocolate ganache powdered with cocoa. It has always been very popular in Japan, especially as a gift. We have a tradition of giving chocolates on Valentine's Day, and this Nama chocolate is one of the most popular gifts.\nThe second one is Terrine au chocolat which is a new trendy dessert gaining popularity over the last 5 years here in Japan. This rich and smooth chocolate cake is made without flour, using only a small amount of cocoa and cornstarch. You can eat it cold or warm it up, both are so good. When eaten cold, it's a decadent chocolate cake, and when warmed, the inside melts and is gooey, it’s delicious.\nThe third one is Japanese chocolate souffle roll cake. It’s made of soft and fluffy Japanese souffle sponge cake with Chantilly au chocolat which is chocolate whipped cream. This cake is perfect for a party, and would likely be one of the most popular menu items in your shop.\nThe fourth one is fondant au chocolat or chocolate fondant lava cake, and the last one is brown butter chocolate chip cookies. I have shared two of these recipes on YouTube, but through this online course not only do you have direct access to ask me questions, but it also includes 3 additional chocolate based recipes that are favorites of mine.\nAll are perfect for a party, and would likely be one of the most popular menu items in your shop. In addition, all of the desserts can be modified into gluten-free versions and that taste great, so this course can also be enjoyed by those who are gluten-free.\nEach recipe offers a different way to impress your family and friends; from chilled to warm, light to decadent, enjoyed right off a napkin or displayed on your finest dessert plates.\n\n\nAre you ready to make my favorite Japanese style desserts that showcase why there’s nothing like chocolate.\nLet’s get started!",

      "description": "Are you suffering from bubble trouble?\nHelp is at hand!\nHave you ever made a starter of your own?\nAre you a bit scared of what’s going on in that pot?\nFrustrated by its inconsistent / unpredictable behaviour?\nDo you know what a healthy starter looks like?\nDo you know how much starter to seed your leaven with?\nCan you judge peak fitness for a leaven?\nDo you know how young, mature and old starters affect different leavens?\nCan you handle the time and temperature ‘levers’?\nDo hordes of bacteria and wild yeast freak you out?\nDo you know how to choose the best flour for feeding your happy colonies?\n\n\nThis course answers all those questions.\nIt is a highly-focused, practical guide to the do’s, don’ts and desirables of making, managing and baking with sourdough cultures.\n\n\nIn Part One, we start at the heart of what sourdough is and why it is important, for personal and environmental health as well as cultural concerns. We explain the principles of “leavenology”, or fermentation.\n\n\nPart Two covers how to build different starters from scratch, plus how to feed and maintain them.\n\n\nPart Three shows you how to use a starter to seed a leaven, and how to control the character of the leaven through the ratio of starter to leaven, the ambient temperature and the length of fermentation. The Great Leaven Race shows exactly what a difference time makes!\n\n\nAnd in Part Four we give you our masterclasses, using formulas that demonstrate the range of effects you can achieve by varying the maturity, quantity, nature and vigour of your leaven.\n· White sourdough with mature leaven\n· 100% rye sourdough\n· Brown sourdough\n· Sourdough lavash\n· Sourdough pancakes\n\n\nHow we teach:\nOur approach is always friendly, practical and hands-on and, wherever possible, more showing than telling. This is not the place to overwhelm you with the (considerable) science, but to give you the benefit of all the know-how we’ve acquired after 12 years teaching and decades more of baking. We spare you the fails, and share the secrets of all our successes.\nWe also provide useful practice exercises and quizzes to test your knowledge.\n\n\nAt The Artisan Bakery School, we believe that baking your own sourdough bread is fundamental to improving your personal health and happiness. Making great starters and leavens is the base of all that.\n\n\nThis courses empowers you to:\nunderstand your starter\nleverage your leaven\nbake with true confidence\ntroubleshoot problems\nmeasure your progress from average to amazing\nWhat people say about this course\n*****\nI've been experimenting with sourdough for about 6 months, after a brief introduction on a yeast baking course. Great taste but random textures, and even after collecting half a dozen books I've been confused about looking after and using my starter. There is no substitute for actually seeing someone doing it and video is actually better than a live demonstration as it brings together all the parts that would be hours apart in real life. I've had immediate success with making a hugely active starter and there are a couple of simple but transformative tips - like the rubber band! I now understand how to maintain and use my starter, and will explore the great information (which isn't in any of my books) about adjusting different factors to achieve different results. This course has shown me how to correct a lot that I've been doing sub optimally or plain wrong. Very good value, thank you!\nJennifer Zarek\n\n\n\n\nI live in Outback Australia and recently downloaded your sour dough courses.\nI was so excited to wake up this morning and see that my starter had exploded out of the jar!\nI've already baked sourdough pancakes, crumpets and have my first loaves in the fridge waiting to be baked tomorrow.\nI just wanted to say Thankyou to you both for the courses. You are a pleasure to watch and your lectures are very easy to follow.\nI've already recommended your courses to family and friends.\nThanks again and wishing you both much happiness and health...\nLil from Oz xx\n\n\nI have four of your courses. They are great. You and Penny are my favorite Udemy instructors. It doesn't get much better than the presentation skills and clear instructions from you both.\nYou've revolutionized my sourdough bread making! Thanks to this email exchange I finally produced a nice soft bread from 100% freshly milled flour. Lance Pawlikowski\nHere are a few of our favourite 5 star testimonials from our other courses:\nThis is a fantastic course. The photography, detail, and explanations are superb. All the important information comes together that will help anyone become a better bread baker. Many thanks to Dragan and Penny for sharing their knowledge to provide such outstanding instruction. I really loved the Masterclasses section and the video showing how to read finished bread and dough. Lance Pawlikowski\nI gave five stars because the genuine enthusiasm of Penny and Dragan is so infectious, and all the various aspects are explained and demonstrated in such an easy to follow manner. I felt drawn in and couldn't wait to get a starter going. I'm looking forward to the time when I have rocked & rolled & chafed and, hopefully, ended up with a lovely smooth ball of dough - like the one that Dragan cradled in his hands so affectionately. Looks a little like play dough for grown-ups. George.E. Morley\nPenny and Dragan removed the mystique surrounding sourdough and made it very \"do-able.\" Really love the FAB recipe! Bobby Ollar\n…The bonus too is they show the stages of dough development clearly and this was something I struggled to understand before this course. They keep it simple as bread baking should be. I'm really looking forward to more courses. Julia Bilecki\nDragan and Penny! Thank you for putting together such an awesome course. Incredible support, you know what you are talking about. Very insightful course. I really learned a lot, all of the additional advice/tips very helpful and useful. All the best for you. Marcelo Ariatti\n\n\nWhy not check out the promo video and the free lectures for yourself?\nRemember, if all you need are recipes, there are plenty out there to choose from.\nIf you want to make a real advance in your baking, from mystery to sourdough mastery, the best place to start is right here!",

The course is divided up into sections for easy referral during production. We also cover the requirements for cold smoking, drying conditions as well as the chemistry behind the curing process.\nCharcuterie is the art of of curing and cooking meats. It was invented to preserve meat before the advent of refrigeration and dates back to roman times. Today it is practiced to provide the flavours that come about from the preserving process.

This is not free from gluten but the gluten is modified to the point where many with digestive issues can eat real bread again.\nWith this course, I believe I have achieved all of my objectives. You will learn not only how to do an extreme ferment of the dough, but how to make it either \"sour\" or mild and how to have dough handy to bake with only a few hour notice.\nAlthough this course is aimed at the more advanced sourdough baker, it is easy enough to follow if you've taken some of the beginning and intermediate courses. Sourdough baking basics are not covered in this course.\nThis course will make it easy for the working person to have world class bread throughout the week with very little work and short notice. It will also be helpful for those who wish to modify gluten to make it more digestible.\nWelcome to \"Bake Modified Gluten Sourdough Bread\" and enjoy the experimentation!\nTeresa",

      "description": "Student Testimonial: \"I love your course so far. I wish I discovered it 22 years ago when I first got married! But it's never too late to improve yourself, I am very happy with your suggestions.\"\n\"Every item that Jenna recommended is one that I've been using often since I've watched the course\"\n**Course updated October 25th, 2016\nMy goal is for you to feel equipped to make savvy, resourceful choices with building your kitchen. That each time you cook, you think \"I'm so glad I have this.\"\n**April 2016 update: I'm proud to announce that 85% of the proceeds from this course has been donated to the medical care of rescued cocker spaniels in the NYC area via Abandoned Angels Cocker Spaniel Rescue.\nIn less than an hour:\n\nthis course will walk you through the best recommendations for which cookware equipment to invest in, so you spend your money wisely;\nthen we get into what basic ingredients to keep stocked in your kitchen so you can always put together a flavorful, simple, nutritious meal without relying on a recipe every time you want to cook;\nand finally, we talk about what to do if you don't get around to using your fresh food or to eating your cooked food.\nThe course does not get into specific food preparation nor does it provide recipes or cooking techniques. It does, however, show HOW to use the recommended cookware.\nThe information in the course is based on equipment and ingredients typical to the US, however, I've tried to keep it basic enough that it can translate to any country/culture.\n\nThe course will be updated with new information, so you'll always be up-to-date on the latest experiments and findings.\nThis course is set up to watch it once and have a better grasp of your options and how to make strategic decisions. You will feel equipped to buy what you need and avoid being distracted by what you don't really need (no matter how nifty is looks/sounds!). As I update the course with new information, you'll be notified to take part in the updates.\nIf you're starting a new diet, this course is extremely important to helping you stay ON TRACK with the best equipment to make cooking easier, quicker, and tastier. Your health will increase due to eating fresher foods, especially increasing your vegetable intake. This course is even beneficial to vegetarians, where cooking vegetables is a huge component to staying energized and healthy.\nEntrepreneurs, freelancers, web designers, coders, work from home-ers - this course was made for you. You sit at a desk all day, most likely at home, and your creativity is paramount. Be efficient with your time in the kitchen and invest in yourself with cooking.\nAt the end of the day, eating is a necessity of life and it heavily affects health and happiness. The only way to control what you eat is to fix it yourself. With food being so important to life, make the effort to enjoy the process. Start your lifelong relationship with food and cooking with this course.\nThis course is unique because of my personal background. As a certified Health Coach and former Associate Dean of Entrepreneurship and Coaching Skills for a major online nutrition school, I've spent years breaking down \"assumed\" or \"second-nature\" information so it can be absorbed and put into action, whether for personal health goals or business-oriented dreams. I get that the simplest things aren't the easiest things and when it comes to cooking and eating, we may have forgotten how natural it is. And we may need to be taught that intuitive nature again. I take that approach in this course with the goal of getting you into the kitchen.",
      "target_audience": [
        "This course is for the individual wanting to cook more at home but feels overwhelmed at which cookware pieces to buy. You appreciate high quality ingredients and will go the extra step for an amazing meal. You want to learn how to cook more often and WELL, and you know that equipment is extremely important to the process. You also want to know how to cook without recipes and therefore, what food to always keep around to make easy, flavorful meals without thinking too hard.",
        "This course is NOT for someone looking for diet advice, although most of the recommendations in this course can support any new diet endeavor. For instance, if you want to go Paleo, you'll still need equipment, condiments, and basic materials to prepare your diet-specific meals.",
        "This course is for the avid cook, who wants to upgrade the home cooking experience.",
        "If you've fumbled through enough recipes to know you like cooking but want to add finesse, use this course to get the best equipment."

More than that, do you often wish you didn't have to go to that dining event at all?\nDo you worry that you won’t know what to do with the maze of cutlery in front of you?\nMaybe you kind of know what’s going but you’re pretty sure you’re doing more than a couple of things wrong? (Remember, don’t maintain eye contact when you’re taking a sip from your glass- it's creepy)\nDo you ever get sweaty palms when you think about throwing a dinner party maybe for friends, new friends, work colleagues, your partner’s work colleagues, or your boss?\nHow about using chopsticks? Have you ever been faced with the humiliation of trying to use chopsticks especially when that piece of slippery food drops into your soya sauce and splatters all over your shirt?\nOr maybe you just want to feel like the most elegant and in control person around the table because believe it or not, it’s possible.\nIf you share similar concerns to those above, then you’re definitely ready to take our Entertainment & Dining Course.\n\n\nWhat you’ll learn\nDining Manners\nWhat not to do at the table\nWorld-class dining manners for continental and American dining\nUnderstanding & using the correct cutlery\nSetting the table for multiple courses\nReading your place setting as a map for the meal\nManaging yourself confidently over a multiple-course meal\nWine tasting, pairing & ordering\nEntertaining clients in a restaurant\nRestaurant choice and location\nTable location and seating\nHandling orders\nOrdering wine\nIndicating hospitality limits\nHost Duties\nGuest Duties\nHome Entertaining\nItems to prepare before your guests arrive\nHow to set the home up to receive guests\nThings to do once guests have arrived\nClosing the evening off politely\nFine dining manners\nDifferent dining styles\nAmerican vs Continental\nDifferent Styles of Service\nFrench, British, Russian & Buffet Service\nDining tutorial\nFoods you can eat with your hands\nKnow the difference between Continental, American and Asian dining\nHow to manage yourself over a six-course meal\nSelecting appropriate wines and tasting them\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s super cool about this course is that you will learn all of the following things:\nThings that make you look like an animal at the table\nThings that make you look pretty sensational at the table (I need all the help I can get)\nThe simple soup spoon vs the slurp\nWho's eaten my bread roll and where’s my wine glass gone?\nWhat is this piece of cutlery even used for?\nWhere do I start with this maze of cutlery?\nCan I go caveman-style and eat this meal with my hands? (There’s a lot more caveman style meals than you think)\nHow do I behave around my boss, client, and the dining table?\nHow do I (even) entertain clients at a restaurant?\nHow do I use these thin sticks they call chopsticks?\nMmmmmm, this wine tastes good but why is everyone doing a ritual with it?\nIn other words, you’ll be super cool and confident at every table you find yourself around- you will have all the dining knowledge to work a casual meal, hotshot formal dinner, Asian dining and entertaining people in your very own castle- your home. Now you can focus on being the star of the show or the quietly confident person in the corner. It works for everyone!\nYou’re bound to learn a lot more than you think.\nYou eat every day of your life, and eating with people is one of your favorite things to do right? (or maybe just mine?)

(Outside in, right?)\nUsing a finger bowl correctly and not drinking the enticing hot lemon water)\nYou’ll learn swanky words like ‘Amuse Bouche’\nHow to host fabulous House Parties (and by house parties we mean ‘Dinner Parties’)\nEntertaining your clients or other serious business people\nThings like where do you seat them- away from the toilets should be your first guess\nHow do you choose the right restaurant- steakhouses for vegetarians may not work out\nHow to indicate that the Lobster Thermidor is way out of your budget range without looking like a pauper\nAvoid the awkward moment when the bill arrives, better yet, just don’t let the bill come to the table\nChopsticks! No more looking like you’re trying to tame a praying mantis\nDining in an Asian restaurant- did you know that flipping your fish over to retrieve the underside of the fish fillet means that you wish the boat that caught the fish will flip over? That might be the end of that new friendship\nHow the Course Works\nThe course is broken down into 5 chapters.\nChapter 1: Identifying Cutlery & Setting the Table\nDining 2: Dining Do’s and Dining Don’t Ever Do That Again\nDining 3: Asian Dining & Chopsticks\nDining 4: Dinner Parties and Home Entertaining\nDining 5: Business Entertaining\n\n\nEach chapter consists of:\nYour Video Lesson\nScript\nSlides",

      "description": "Edited: Course Updated November 2021\nTired of baking bricks when everyone else is baking super gorgeous sourdough bread with a holey crumb and crispy crust? Change all of that by enrolling in \"Sourdough Bread Baking 101.\"\nThis is the sourdough baking course you need if you are just starting out in sourdough bread baking. In my other courses, I teach how to bake all sorts of sourdough breads, but in this course, I won't load you down with lots of information, just enough so it is easy and fun to bake your first loaf of sourdough.\nYou will first learn how to make your own sourdough starter at home, day by day with detailed instructions, videos and a free pdf downloadable booklet.\nNext, you'll move onto baking waffles to test your new sourdough starter and then onto your first sourdough test loaf. Once you've taken a basic white sourdough loaf, steaming hot, out of your own oven, you will be ready to move on to more complex formulas.\nThere are two basic sourdough bread formulas in this course. I call them \"First Loaf\" and \"Second Loaf.\" We will follow the easy step by step directions of the process together. The first loaf is easy. It is a one day round boule with a lower hydration dough, which means it is not too wet or sticky. The second loaf is a two day high hydration dough and is a batard or French style loaf.  Working together, I will show you how to handle a wet, sticky dough and how to do an autolyse. This bread results in a lovely tasting bread with large holes and a wonderful crispy crust.\nThis course is for BEGINNERS who have no idea of how to bake with sourdough or those who have tried and stumbled.

There's no technical jargon and no assumption that the student knows this or that before setting out. The texts are clear, the videos are clear. This is without doubt the best sourdough bread making course I've ever seen. Thank you Teresa\nby Jeni H  Absolutely fantastic!",

Being a fan of infographics and system-based approach I made this course as easy as possible. Structured, short and sweet. Extremely cool for beginners.\nThis course is about wine basics, grape varieties and countries.\nGrape varieties\n80% of all wines in the world are made from 20 major grape varieties. It is enough to know the main ones to choose good wine. We study 6 main whites, 5 main reds, and 5 sparkling wines.\n⁠You will have a profile for each variety: color, aromas, characteristics, regions and producers, food paring, similar varieties.\nCountries\nWe will briefly discuss France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, USA, Argentina, and Chile.⁠\n⁠You will learn how to read the wine labels of these countries, get essential and structured information about regions and wines that you should definitely try. A list of producers is attached, of course. ⁠\nYou will finally understand what is so particular in expensive French and Italian wines. And if there is any difference between Old and New Worlds.\nWelcome on board and let's begin. Cheers!",

      "description": "This is a course created by a single dad, for single dads. It quickly became the point of reference for not only single dads, but also single moms and students that need to cook for themselves or their kids. It's a compilation of simple, clear, and good recipees.\nThe idea is to provide a survival kit for all those that have to cook but don't have much time, or don't particularly like it. The purpose is not to turn you into a 5 star chef, but rather to give you a turn-key solution that guides you from coming up with ideas for your meals (full weeks already designed for you), to planning the trip to the grocery store, to actually making the dishes.\nI will regularly add new videos, ideas and tips, so stay tuned!\nIf I were interested in making Savory souffles accompanied by a choice of Coq au vin, Chicken with truffles Joannes Nandron, and Sausage and Tomato Paella, I'm pretty sure I could find at least ten YouTube videos telling me exactly what to do. All I'd need is a kitchen the size of a football field, an assistant, and a few extras hours per day in prep time. But what if I don't have that? What if I'm just a single, working parent that needs to make a decent meal for my kids after work?\nSo, here's what's great about this course. No dishes with names we can't pronounce, requiring time we don't have. Just simple stuff and most of all, good ideas. After a long day at work, or school, coming up with ideas is a daunting task. The question: \"what can I make?\" is sometimes harder than: \"how do I make it?\"\nMy goal is to keep developing groups of recipes covering a full week at a time. You'll learn both the \"what\" and the \"how\", so you can rest assured you'll always have a plan.",

      "description": "Welcome to the first segment of Mastering the Art of Vegan French Cooking! This series is going to teach you how to create plant-based reinterpretations of the most classic French recipes. Gluten-free variations are offered for each dish and downloadable recipe pdfs are available in the Resources tab for each section.\nI am a plant-based blogger and cookbook author living in France. I wrote 'Vegan French Favorites', a cookbook of classic French recipes made vegan- which was recommended as one of the best vegan cookbooks on the 'Vegan' website and featured in the Vegan Food and Living Magazine, a French newspaper, and several blogs and podcasts. My passion is combining the French and plant-based lifestyles, to share my love of French culture and promote sustainability.\nWe'll kick this series off by learning vegan Quiche, Crepes, and Cream Tarts. These are three classic French culinary concepts that once mastered, will allow you to make endless variations of the dishes.\n\n\nFirst, you will learn how make an easy olive oil crust that's flaky, 'buttery', and the perfect substitute for the traditional shortbread crust used in Quiches and Tarts. You can also use it any pie!\nThen, you'll learn two different methods you can use to make vegan quiches, no eggs involved. You'll see that the two different methods produce very different but equally hearty, delicious, and French-tasting results.\nNext, you will learn vegan recipes for two of the most famous French cream tarts: Lemon Tart and Strawberry Tart. You'll master a cream base for these tarts, using simple vegan ingredients, that will allow you to make an endless variety of fruit tarts! You'll also learn how to decorate the tarts like a professional pastry chef.\nFinally, you will learn how to make perfect vegan crepes, both sweet and savory. You'll be introduced to the most classic French toppings for crepes and learn how to substitute bacon, eggs, sour cream, cheese, sweet cream and whipped cream with delicious and easy plant-based alternatives.\n\n\nThe course is paced so that you can cook along with me but feel free to pause, rewind, or fast forward as you need to. To get the most out of the course, I highly suggest reading the pdfs in each section before jumping into the videos. There is no music in the background of the cooking videos to keep them distraction-free and so that you can play your own favorite cooking music.\n\n\nStay tuned for my future courses in this series and I hope you will enjoy jumping in to the exciting new world of vegan French cooking with me!",

      "description": "Have you ever struggled to make beautiful delicious pies? I once did. That is why I dedicated years developing recipes to make consistent wholesome artisan pies! Using quality ingredients and following these recipes, you too can make great pie.\nMy name is Marie. I owned and operated a pie shop, Passionate For Pies, outside of Seattle. There, I developed a step-by-step system that is easy to follow. It is the same techniques that my employees used at the shop, and many of them had no experience with pie.\nYou will learn:\na delicious and simple 100% butter crust\nan array of fruit pie fillings\nhow to make nutritious homemade puddings for Cream Pies\nseveral sweet & savory tarts to share with your family or friends\nchicken pot pie made from your own chicken stock!\nand much more...\nAre you wanting more? Then come on and join me! I believe that if you want to Master Pie Making, it can be done. I will start to show you the way.\nStep-by-Step HD 720p Video recipe tutorials will show you how easy it is to make delicious flaky buttery pastry dough.\nMultiple Camera Angles give you a closeup, entertaining, & mouth watering view into the learning process.\nQuality Audio. Narrated by me, Marie\n***************************************************************************************************\nWhy does Pie Making seem so challenging?\n\nThe biggest challenge to pie making is not having a consistent recipe for dough. Classic pie recipes are a struggle for most beginners because they all lack precision. Ever wondered why the amount of water is never exact in classic pie dough recipes? The answer is simple, and so is the solution.\nCutting the butter into flour by hand has so many variables. One being how it affects the amount of water needed. This requires advanced knowledge from the baker of the exact feel and texture. It can be frustrating and not fun. And has scared many away from making their own delicious pies from scratch.\nI want to change that and show you a super easy way! Fool-proof almost. Why? Because I love pie so much and want every one to feel confident to make it at home themselves.\nHow you ask? By following carefully composed recipes. The video recipes in this course will show you through all the action! They are consistent and precise every time!!!! That's why I know you can succeed. I have done the challenging work of getting the recipes right. So you can just enjoy the process. And take all the credit from your loved ones!\nSince I am a visual learner, that is how I teach. Step-by-step, follow me in your own kitchen. And by the time we are done, your pies will be beautiful and scrumptious. That I guarantee.\n*****************************************************************************************************\n\nI begin by showing you the first pies I mastered: Crumb pies - Peach, Spiced Rhubarb, and Jumbleberry.\nThen will be how to make classic Double-crusted pies - Apple, Strawberry Rhubarb, Wild Blueberry, Blackberry, and Bumbleberry.\nFor some of my favorite Specialty pies - Pecan Brownie, Dark Sweet Cherry, and Fresh Butternut Pumpkin Pie.\nCream pies are better than icing on a cake! My favorites are - Lemon Cream, Chocolate Cream, and Coconut Cream all with fresh whipped cream of course!\nAnd lastly you will make a delectable Chicken pot pie, the way it should be! (full-flavored chicken stock with amazing health benefits turned into your own homemade gravy).\nOh and let's not forget...Tarts are even easier than pie. Spinach Mushroom and Gruyere Tart, Smoked Salmon & Leek Tart, Caramelized Onion Tomato & Goat Cheese Tart, Fresh Raspberry Tart, and Cheese Apple Tart. Perfect for any casual meal or picnic.\n****************************************************************************\nA few pie reviews from customers at Passionate For Pies:\n\"Wow. Just. Wow...The crust is flaky and buttery, melt in your mouth amazing. The chicken pot pie was delectable in every way. The fruit pies were also amazing....\" - Camille V. - Tacoma, WA\n\"Been looking forward...since I read about it in The Wall Street Journal, and it lived up to our expectations. Delicious.\" - Renay Portland, OR\n“If heaven could exist in a pie, you would find it here. We shared the spiced rhubarb pie and the dark chocolate coconut cream pie. The fresh organic cream on the coconut was amazing. It was all the best pie I have ever had... \" -Rob S. Austin, TX\n\"Unbelievable...I am a pie maven, but I bow to \"Passionate for Pies\". The best crust ever, not too sweet, really fantastic. We will go back tomorrow to take some home on the plane! \" - Kathleen R. Fayetteville, NY",

      "description": "What could possibly be more intriguing than art, unless it's edible?\nWhen cake decorating became a fad, the original medium of choice was buttercream.  A lot has changed since then with the introduction of fondant, gum paste, marzipan, and modelling chocolate.  While they are all lovely ways to decorate a stunning cake, buttercream still holds the spotlight. Why?\nSimply because it is the crowd favorite as far as taste and it also renders the least expensive cakes.  For many years, buttercream cakes were adorned with elaborate displays of piping skills...piped flowers, borders, dots, stars, etc.  And as social media blew up, the trends became more modern with spatula techniques, watercolors, edible gold, and organic flowers.  Still, buttercream has remained steadfast despite all of the changes.\nIn this course, you will learn how to use buttercream in a new medium...painting.  This course walks you through how to paint with diluted gel food colors and how to use colored buttercream as a \"paint\".  There are two intricate projects for you to follow along and then try your newly learned skills at home.\nThis course also includes reference materials:\nSwiss Meringue Buttercream Recipe\nSupply List\nCake Production Worksheet\nThey are available as PDF for ease in downloading and printing.  Should you have any questions or need support during the course, I'm here to guide you.  Not only will you learn how to create the projects in the course, but I also teach you how to take care of your cakes.  Storage questions? Check!  Planning? Check!\nEverything you need to know to begin painting on buttercream cakes is inside this course.  I hope to see you there!",

      "description": "Get trained by Chartered Environmental Health Officer, Natalie Stanton (Malupa).\nDo you work in a catering setting where food is cooked, prepared or handled?\nLearn food safety from an expert so you feel confident and are ready to get your 5* food hygiene rating.\nBy law, all food handlers must have an understanding of the basic principles of food safety and know how to prepare food safely… and not just in theory. You always need to be ready for food hygiene inspections by EHOs.\nEHOs aren’t just looking for food hygiene certificates. They want to know that you can work safely in practice. And they will ask you (and your staff) questions about food safety. This course helps you to be ready to answer those questions with confidence.\n\n\n- Endorsed by the Institute of Hospitality\n- Assured by Peterborough City Council\n- Delivered through short pre-recorded videos without the need to read lots of text\n- Approximate duration of video content: 2 hours\n\n\nHere's what a few of my lovely customers have to say about the course:\n\n\n“At GRAPE & Fig we can’t recommend the course enough - our team refreshed their Level 2 Food Hygiene courses and found the content engaging, easy and enjoyable to digest and of a very high quality. We’d 100% recommend to our peers in the catering industry and hope Natalie adds Level 3 soon\"\n\n\n“I did another course and I still didn't completely understand everything. I sat there falling asleep. But then I did your course and I understood. You trained me to actually understand, not just to do well.”\n\n\n“Compared to previous courses I have done, this course was great, it covers what you need to know, without too much jargon and the point getting lost in details and legislation/laws. It will be perfect for our team.”\n\n\n\"Really interactive course! Love the questions and answers! Easy to understand and I feel super prepared for my inspection - but also confident enough to handle food in the right way. The knowledge I have gained has allowed me to take control of my small business! Absolutely loved it. Thank you so much!\"",

A definite recommendation for wine newbies, but also for folks who know wine well and want to know more about the vineyard.\"\n\nThis course has 5,295 students in 120 countries (WOW, thank you, students!) and it's growing daily! (Updated 2/5/2024)\nThis is a comprehensive, easy-to-understand course on all aspects of wine.

He acquired a lot of knowledge, as he created more and more incredible and unusual desserts that would soon shape the very top of the pâtisserie world. Apart from being skillful with the whisk and great at making desserts, he is now also actively involved in educating people on the topics of desserts and pâtisserie. One could say he is nothing short of a pâtisserie trailblazer.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the online course on macarons?\n\nMacarons are considered to be every pâtissier's worst nightmare.

      "description": "Dashi is a staple ingredient in cooking Japanese food. It is the basic broth or stock in cooking many traditional and household Japanese food and it gives flavor to many soups, meat, vegetables and stews. The umami taste of food usually comes from dashi. Dashi along with sake, soy sauce, and mirin gives a backbone to Japanese cuisine.\nMost Japanese food are simple and contains a few ingredients so it is important that each ingredient used is of the highest quality. Making a good dashi is one secret for making a successful Japanese dish.\nNowadays, we can conveniently make dashi using instant dashi in powdered or concentrated liquid form that we can buy at grocery stores. You can even find dashi bags or packets which you can prepare as if you are preparing tea were you need to drop the dashi bag in hot water. This type of instant dashi is the closest you can get to an authentic dashi and contains much lesser flavor enhancers such as salt and MSG like the other forms of instant dashi.\nOne thing some of you might not know is that making dashi from scratch is really easy. The only thing you need is the time to prepare it. Also, once you learn how to make dashi by yourself, I’m afraid you can not go back to using the instant dashi because there is a huge difference in taste. My Japanese husband described the food I prepared in which I've used homemade dashi this way: \"the deliciousness of the food is so deep\".",

      "description": "Hello, dear friends, and welcome to my first course of the «Coffee Basics» series – «The HISTORY of COFFEE».\nIt is intended for Coffee Lovers and Baristas who want to know more about their favorite drink and understand all its diversity and versatility.\nI will introduce myself to those who are not yet familiar with my other course – «The BOTANY of COFFEE.» By the way, I strongly recommend that you take it, because, together with the «HISTORY», it will help you form a COMPLETE picture of basic coffee knowledge.\nMy name is Sergio Reminny, I am a coffee expert with 25 years of experience in the coffee industry, a businessman, a writer, and the first Coordinator of the European Speciality Coffee Association (SCAE) in Ukraine (2003-2008).\nAfter thousands of articles on my Coffee Blog, hundreds of videos on my YouTube channel, and a series of coffee books, I created this online course.\nThe main task that I set for myself in the course was to translate the complex coffee world knowledge into SIMPLE and INTERESTING lessons for both ordinary coffee lovers and baristas. And also to teach you to UNDERSTAND the relationship between different coffee categories and, to help you use this knowledge in your life.\n«The HISTORY of COFFEE» will give you a complete chronological understanding of how coffee won peoples’ hearts and became a favorite drink of mankind.\nYou will not find on the Internet the materials presented in my lessons. Because they are all derived from my many years of experience and are based on my personal view of the history of coffee after studying it for a quarter of a century.\nHere I am not going to teach you what is right and what is not. My goal is to teach you to UNDERSTAND the world of coffee and to use your knowledge.\nAs one of the greatest coffee lovers of our time, the great French writer Honoré de Balzac, said: «Study the past, and it will teach you the future...»\nYou know, instead of offering my arguments in favor of your taking this course, I want to give a perfect example of how the understanding of the history of coffee can help you in your life. For this, please, watch the free intro of my course. An interesting example of a clear understanding of the difference between Latte and Cappuccino is waiting for you.\nThe purpose of this short story, pals, was to draw your attention to the fact that knowledge of history is not just erudition.\nKnowing the PAST is important for understanding what you are doing TODAY and who you will become TOMORROW.\nThis is exactly what my course is about.\nTake it and I assure you will not regret it. And I promise that it will be interesting ...))\nWell, we have a lot of work today, so let's get down to business right away.",

      "description": "What are they and what are they used for? What's the difference anyway?\nCordials & Liqueurs are an essential part of every bartender’s repertoire of knowledge. Without these “secondary” flavoring agents many, if not all popular cocktails couldn’t be prepared. Often the terms are used interchangeably, but there is a marked difference.\nHere we’ll explain what they are and how these important ingredients are integral to proper beverage service. Interestingly, many of these beverages have a history going back a hundreds of years or more, yet no one spends the time to know and understand their value & necessity in constructing a well-balanced cocktail.\nThis course is aimed at fixing all that!\nWARNING: THIS COURSE GETS TECHNICAL AT TIMES! I have tried to be as detailed as possible. Some reviews have stated my courses are too technical at times, but I think better to give too much info than not enough.\n\nThis course reviews:\nAn in-depth understanding of all types of Cordials & Liqueurs\nTypes & Classifications\nCream vs Crème\nApéritifs & Digestifs\nVermouth\nAmari\nPastis vs Absinthe\nBitters & Tinctures\nHow to Make Bitters & Tinctures\nCocktails and a little history of them\n65 Popular Brands and Flavors\nFlavor & Aroma Characteristics\nHow to serve Absinthe\nHow to serve Pastis\nHow to make 35 popular shots\nThe Ouzo Effect\nProduction Methods\nOrigins\nLegal Standards in the U.S. & EU\nCordial & Liqueur Terminology\n* Bonus lecture - Wine, Spirits, Cocktails & Beer Glassware Recommendations\n\n\nWith knowledge on the many different types and flavors of Cordials & Liqueurs, one can be confident in making a selection, recommending for others to enjoy or blend with other ingredients to make wonderful cocktails.\nHere we explain, clearly & concisely, all that’s needed to fully understand these types of alcohol and how to serve them properly.\nFor those not in the bar or restaurant field, we’ll give you a solid understanding to make the best selection of an after dinner drink or making cocktails at home. We’ll help you make better choices and be able to differentiate options, without having to personally try everything out there.\nClass is in session. Drink Up!",

You can bake a great pizza without them.\n\n\nAbout the Instructor\nFabio, a professional pizzaiolo, has left the pizzeria, but pizza still puts food on his table (pun intended). He is now a technical consultant for a well known Mill in London (UK) and teaches pizza making at various levels, both remotely and in person.\nHis book, Fabioulous Pizza, became an Amazon best-seller on the day of its launch.

      "description": "In every aspect of life you learn the basics of skills one step at a time, starting at the bottom. You learn to crawl before you walk, and walk before you run. Yet with cooking, many recipes assume you know how to cook before you know how to cook. This leads frustration and disappointment when food doesn't turn out like the pretty picture in the book. This course is designed to take a step back and show you the basics that recipes fail to get across.\nThe methods I’ve chosen to teach are, I believe, the most useful and important ones to any home cook. After researching cookbooks and recipes, these are the ones that are most commonly used, so a basic understanding of these will give you confidence in most recipes and get you making delicious food that you and your loved ones can enjoy tucking into!\n\n\nWhat you'll learn:\n\n\nVegetables:\nNo more mushy boiled veg or burnt onions!\nBoiling\nPan Steaming\nMicrowaving\nRoasting\nFrying Onion\nSweating onion\n\n\nMeat, fish and other proteins:\nIncluding how to tell when meat such as chicken is actually cooked and safe to eat (hint: it's nothing to do with the colour of the juices or meat).\nPoaching\nMicrowaving\nRoasting\nFrying\n\n\nPasta and noodles:\nCooking them without wasting tonnes of water and energy!\nBoiling\nMicrowaving\n\n\nRice:\nTraditional and more convenient ways to cook rice.\nBoiling\nMicrowaving - absorption method\nBoiling - absorption method\n\n\nThese are all taught by a practical demonstration for each method. By the end of the course you should be much more confident in your abilities to cook delicious food at home.",

Once you purchase, you will always have access to new content.\n\n\nEggs may be a basic grocery item, but don't let that fool you from treating them with the utmost of culinary respect. With a few condiments, vegetables, or leftovers, you can have a nutrient-packed meal. This class will give you the foundation you need to be creative in the kitchen without complex ingredients or skills.\n\n\nYou’ll find the written recipes and ingredient lists in a printable PDF in the Project video. This document will be updated as recipes are added to the course (if applicable). While this isn’t a diet or health-focused class, eggs are an integral part of a healthy diet.\n\n\nIn this course, you'll be guided through video demonstrations of the most common methods to cook eggs & how to cook them exactly how you like them. You'll also be educated on egg myths. The suggested methods aren't anything hokey, but are, instead, based on science - how the egg proteins react to different types & levels of heat.",

      "description": "Edited: Updated June 2020\nSourdough Bread baking for breakfast is back! Are your breakfast and brunch menus predictable and boring? Are you looking to add some healthy pizzazz to your meals to impress and please your family?\nHow about a stack of butter slathered sourdough pancakes hot off the griddle or a thick slice of freshly baked tender cornbread? Would the smell of baking spicy warm cinnamon rolls be a welcome surprise for a lazy weekend breakfast? What will your family think when you bring out a plate filled with thick soft sourdough tortillas?\nThis sourdough bread baking course is the fourth course in a series of sourdough bread baking courses aimed at learning to bake using a sourdough starter. In this course you will learn to bake old fashioned sourdough quick style breads using not only a sourdough starter (it's easy to make your own starter!) but also baking soda and baking powder. These quick breads, often baked for breakfast and brunch, are like the breakfast breads grandma used to bake up including:\nSourdough Pancakes\nOvernight Flapjacks\nButtery Fluffy Biscuits\nOld Fashioned Bundt Corn Bread,\nCornbread pan loaf with butter crumbs\nHoney Butter Spread\nSkillet Puff Pancakes\nPan Scones\nSkillet Soft White Sourdough Bread - Incredibly Soft!\nWarm Spicy Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls - So Mouthwatering!\nDelicious Home Made Sourdough Tortillas!\nIt's a lot of fun to bake up these quick types of breads and they are great for breakfast and brunch or for a quick healthy snack. You will learn how to make your own sourdough starter with easy day by day instructions, using not only videos but an e-book as well.\n\nThe free downloadable e-book in the course will help you easily make your own sourdough starter besides tips on how to care for your starter, how to make motherdough and other pre-ferments while explaining hydration and what hydration means in baker's terms. (You can find it now as a free preview for this course and start making your own sourdough starter today).\nSome of the student reviews:\nby Rachael  Great recipes, great instructor!Teresa has excellent courses, and she makes everything easy to do in our home kitchen!

Thanks so much for this beautiful course!!!\nby Anneke Mouthwatering course!It is such a pleasure to be able to follow step by step what Teresa does. It is the small things that make the course Top of the Pops. The experience, the showing of how thick dough should be, that \"if the dough works against you\", you should let it rest 20 more minutes, things like that, make the course golden.\nby Jean Such a comprehensive course on sourdough baking Teresa really knows her subject. There are so many different recipes in this course with different types of breads, flapjacks or pancakes, cinnamon rolls etc. Everything looked to scrumptious that I wanted to start baking right away. I love sourdough and this is one of the most comprehensive courses on the subject. Teresa is very generous with the number of different recipes she included.

In this course, I want you to understand why this or that happens and not just to apply theory. Therefore, notes are made available in a PDF format for you to read or to ask further questions so that we can talk even more in depth as regards to a particular topic.\n\nThe purpose of this course is for you to build strong wine basis which will allow you to make sense to what is happening when tasting or pairing wine. This course starts at the very beginning of the grape growth cycle, talk in-depth about different wine making methods and tackles some very technical topics such as “Terroir”, wine grape varieties, vintage, climate and much more. The main reason why I decided to make that course this complete is that I do not believe it is possible to pair or taste wine if you do not understand why or what happen before the wine is bottled.",

You will make three kinds of chocolate truffles that include:\nWhite chocolate strawberry lemon truffles\nMilk chocolate lavender honey truffles\nDark chocolate mocha truffles\nYou will learn the secrets behind making fantastic truffles that you can serve to friends and family at parties and special events. We will start by teaching you how to make and prepare ganache. Then the techniques for dipping and decorating your truffles. Finally you will learn how to decorate each truffle to create a sumptuous chocolate experience.\nKingsbury Chocolates opened for business in November, 2001. Self-trained chocolatier Rob Kingsbury embraced his Vermont maple sugar roots and inherited his love of confection making from his grandparents. Starting with his family's recipes, Rob tweaked them with finer imported chocolate and novel ingredients. Today his maple popcorn crunch drizzled in chocolate is a daily thank you to his grandparents love of family and sweets — who sold their original maple popcorn at a roadside stand. Today's chocolates and confections showcase Kingsbury's sophisticated whimsy.\nThis course will share with you some of Robert's chocolate heritage and will be sure to impress your friends and family with these amazing chocolate truffles.",

      "description": "Ever wish you knew what was REALLY going on with your bread?\nAre you unsure WHEN to move to the next step in rising/proving/baking?\nDo you know WHY kneading, folding & shaping are so important, or HOW to apply these techniques to best effect?\nDo you want to LEARN how to build and maintain better structure in your dough?\nAre you frustrated when your bread doesn’t turn out like the photo in the recipe?\nOr would you simply like to move on from baking BRICKS?!\n\n\nLook no further.\nKnow Your Dough is designed to remove those mysteries, leaving you with the clarity you need to happily pursue your baking goals.\nIf you’ve already got the baking bug, you’ll know that dough is a living thing that sometimes seems to have a mind of its own. Whilst not claiming to be able to read the ‘minds’ of a squillion yeasts, we have produced this course to give you the equivalent of x-ray 'dough goggles' – i.e. penetrating insights into the structure, the texture, the temperament and the behaviour of your dough.\nBecause, once you understand your dough, making outstanding bread will be easier than you ever thought possible!\n\n\nLike baking itself, this course is:\na blend of art and science\na careful balance of theory and practice\nThe emphasis is on video demonstration and not too much reading.\n\n\nPART ONE – BECOMING A BETTER JUDGE\nIn the first part, we show you how to ask and answer the questions that mark each of the Four Stages of the Dough, from first mix to baked item. Your ability to answer these questions is what defines your progress as a baker. As your judgement of each stage improves, so will your baking results.\nYou will learn how to handle the different modes of the dough; what it means when the dough is tightened, or when it is relaxed, or what difference it makes whether the dough is warm or cold, old or young, drier or wetter.\nAs the course unfolds, you will learn more about fermentation, including how to make, manage and troubleshoot a sourdough culture. You’ll discover how to use the relationship between temperature and time to build a baking schedule that's super convenient for you.\nIn our Bakers Toolbox, you’ll find a whole reference section on the use and impacts of various baking techniques. This is where you can build your repertoire of skills, and your grasp of baking theory, with the how’s, why’s and when’s for every technique. You can digest this in one sitting, or refer back to it as you need.\nPART TWO – THE MASTERCLASSES\nTo accelerate your development as a baker, we use the middle section of the course to deliver 10 different recipe-masterclasses, each carefully selected to highlight a specific technique and a particular aspect of dough and gluten development.\n• The Daily Bread - white, yeasted or sourdough\n• Brown – yeasted or sourdough\n• Heritage Brown – autolysed sourdough\n• Heritage Seeded - yeasted & sourdough\n• Sourdough Rye\n• Cheese, Chilli & Garlic (yeasted & sourdough)\n• Brioche Burger Buns - yeasted\n• Ciabatta – sourdough\n• Focaccia - yeasted\n• Pizza – yeasted and sourdough\n\n\nPART THREE - DOUGHOLOGY\nWith all that masterclass experience behind you (or before you, if you prefer to do this section first), you will be ready to delve into 'Doughology' – further insights into fermentation, time, temperature and retardation. This section will help you push forward in your experiments.\nFinally, you’ll learn how to read your baked bread - which tells you more than you might imagine about your progress. We’ll show you how to record your observations and get the most from your analysis.\n\n\nAt The Artisan Bakery School, we (Dragan & Penny) have been demystifying dough for over a decade. We want you to love baking bread, so instead of just teaching you recipes, or baffling you with bakers voodoo, we teach you essential baking principles and techniques. That way, you can troubleshoot problems, be creative with more confidence, and measure your own independent progress from amateur to amazing.\n5-Star Reviews for Know Your Dough:\nWhat an amazing course. I'm a professional baker/pastry chef and this made me understand in depth what is happening with our dough, all the things forming and growing. Thank you!\nLara Melo\nHere are a few of our favourite 5 star testimonials from our other courses:\nThis is a fantastic course. The photography, detail, and explanations are superb. All the important information comes together that will help anyone become a better bread baker. Many thanks to Dragan and Penny for sharing their knowledge to provide such outstanding instruction. I really loved the Masterclasses section and the video showing how to read finished bread and dough. Lance Pawlikowski\n\nI gave five stars because the genuine enthusiasm of Penny and Dragan is so infectious, and all the various aspects are explained and demonstrated in such an easy to follow manner. I felt drawn in and couldn't wait to get a starter going. I'm looking forward to the time when I have rocked & rolled & chafed and, hopefully, ended up with a lovely smooth ball of dough - like the one that Dragan cradled in his hands so affectionately. Looks a little like play dough for grown-ups. George.E. Morley\nPenny and Dragan removed the mystique surrounding sourdough and made it very \"do-able.\" Really love the FAB recipe! Bobby Ollar\n…The bonus too is they show the stages of dough development clearly and this was something I struggled to understand before this course. They keep it simple as bread baking should be. I'm really looking forward to more courses. Julia Bilecki\nDragan and Penny! Thank you for putting together such an awesome course. Incredible support, you know what you are talking about. Very insightful course. I really learned a lot, all of the additional advice/tips very helpful and useful. All the best for you. Marcelo Ariatti\nThe videos are priceless!  Aden\nWhy not check out the promo video and the free lectures for yourself?\nRemember, if all you need are recipes, there are plenty out there to choose from.\nIf you want to REALLY know what you're doing with your dough - start here!",

      "description": "Course Updated January 2022\nHello fellow baker!\nSourdough Bread Baking Experiments is a fun course for advanced bakers. In this course we will be playing around and experimenting with a very high hydration dough called Cristal Bread. It's all the rage right now!\nWe will also boil bread, try out low inoculation rates, bake a motherdough only loaf, use double hydration and mix different flour together as we explore some heritage grains.\nThere are nine formulas altogether, which include techniques for high hydration, double hydration, low inoculation, heritage grains, boiled bread, motherdough only loaf and more!\nAlso included is an experiment with extreme double hydration.\nThis main purpose of this course is to have fun and open your mind to exploring and experimenting with sourdough baking.\nPlease be advised that this is an advanced class and it will not cover sourdough basics. Intermediate students will benefit from this course if they've taken some of the earlier sourdough baking courses.\nSee some of the reviews from my other popular sourdough baking courses:\nThis course for me was a success!! Bravo!\nAnother great course, Teresa! My family is enjoying your cornbread frequently and your cinnamon rolls are fabulous! Thank you!\ngreat detail, I find Teresa's explanation and demonstration incredibly helpful.\nTeresa is an excellent instructor; is informative and makes sourdough baking enjoyable.\nVideos are such a great help when learning how to mix your dough. If you want to learn the proper way to make sourdough, enroll in this class. It is fun to do and you get fabulous results!\nEverything is easy to understand, step by step and we can go back and review information. Both ways of learning, reading the material and then watching by video is provided (to be followed eventually by our own hands-on learning) It is at a nice comfortable pace, not rushed. I am very impressed and happy with this course.\nClear instructions, easy to follow. Teresa is a great teacher.\nI haven't seen anything this thorough. She covers a recipe from A to Z videos included. You have to take this course and her other courses. Your bread baking skills will no doubt be boosted with Teresa's courses. Her videos are fantastic and honestly, you get more than what you paid.\nVery well done, I learn by watching then doing. Teresa is very good at show and tell...Thanx Teresa\nThis course has been so helpful, as I think I would have struggled without it. The instructions and videos are very clear. I would definitely recommend it!\nSo come on and join in the fun! Teresa",

      "description": "Cupcake is an American version of muffin and this legendary dessert is also known as fairy cake. So, what is a cupcake? It’s a small cake baked in tiny cupcake wrapper paper or in a cupcake pan. Very often cupcakes are frosted differently in order to make a beautiful dessert.\n\n\nThe earliest recipes of cupcakes appeared in cookbooks in 1796 and 1828. Main ingredients of this dessert are butter, sugar, eggs and flour, however there are several alternative recipes.\n\n\nThe course presents 4 different recipes with differenct frostings:\n\n\n1- Vanilla cupcakes with pink cream cheese frosting\n2- Red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting\n3- Chocolate-coffee cupcakes with Cacao cream cheese frosting\n4- Poppy-seed cupcakes with Butter cream frosting\n\n\nIn conclusion, our cupcake course has been a delectable journey filled with learning, creativity, and indulgence. From mastering the basics of cupcake baking to exploring advanced decorating techniques, each lesson has brought us closer to becoming true cupcake connoisseurs. As we wrap up our time together, I encourage you to continue experimenting in the kitchen, pushing the boundaries of flavor and design, and sharing your sweet creations with loved ones.\nRemember, the joy of baking extends far beyond the final product – it's about the process, the memories made, and the smiles shared.\n\n\nThank you for joining us on this delightful adventure, and may your future baking endeavors be filled with endless sweetness and satisfaction.",

I am so thrilled with the clarity and completeness of the content, as well as the ready presence and engaged feedback from the instructor Teresa L. Greenway. I highly recommend this course, and will be eagerly investigating any other offerings from this instructor. I am still working through the materials at my own pace, which is another benefit of using this teaching/learning platform.\"\nAnd:\n\"I am very excited to be taking these baking classes, there is nothing like sinking your teeth into a crusty loaf of Sourdough. Teresa is very knowledgeable, and has a passion for baking with sourdough. It is slow enough for a beginner, contains enough information to make a person a competent baker.\"\n\n\nHave you ever wondered how anyone can bake authentic sourdough bread? You know the kind of bread I'm talking about, with its crispy, crunchy crust, sour chewy crumb and amazing flavor. How do they do that? Well you can bake real sourdough bread in your own home oven, just like the pros do. I will show you how, step by step, it's easy and fun. You will amaze your family and friends. No one will be able to bake a loaf like you can!\nBy taking this baking course you will have a better understanding of\nHow to mix and shape dough\nHow to handle sticky, wet dough\nLearn ways to get a crispy, blistered crust\nWhat one thing is absolutely necessary for a great crust\nHow to get large holey crumb\nHow to develop dough without kneading it\nWhy measurements are important\nHow to make your own sourdough starter\nWhat pre-ferments and motherdough are and how to use them.\nLearn to slash/score the dough\nHow to follow a formula.\nWhat baking equipment you might need for baking hearth loaves\nAnd lots more!\nYou will get answers to questions like: How can I get those large holes in the crumb? How do I take care of a sourdough starter? Can I make the crust shiny? How can I get those blisters on the crust? Can I really bake professional sourdough in my own oven?\nWhen you are finished with this baking course you will be able to mix, fold, proof, score, steam and bake a loaf of authentic sourdough bread.\nYou will have a better understanding of dough hydration, fermentation, gluten development, baker's percent and where to find resources to join other home bakers who are passionate about home baking real sourdough too.\nBest of all you will be able to astound your family and friends with an amazing loaf of real sourdough that you baked yourself, in your own home oven.\nIt will take two weeks to make your own stable sourdough starter or  you can purchase one online. While getting your starter going, you will learn a short history of sourdough and go over some of the basic techniques including hydration and measuring. Once your starter is stable, we will begin with an Alaskan sourdough and then branch out to wetter high hydration dough like Ciabatta and Tyra Loaf (which includes motherdough). After that we go on to Blistered Crust Sourdough and a mixed whole grain and white loaf called March Madness Sourdough.  We'll even tackle a challenging 100% whole wheat loaf at 100% hydration and Chubby baguettes, which are featured on the course landing page.\nThere are also some sourdough dessert formulas including Forbidden Sourdough Chocolate Cake and Ginger Cake. Several additional formulas and other resources for baking real artisan sourdough are included and I will be adding additional lectures and formulas in the future.\nThis is a self paced course with no pressure and instructor support when you have any questions. Come on and join us!",

      "description": "Hello, my name is Simon and I'm a home cook with a real passion for cooking. I have gathered through the years a lot of traditional Lebanese and Mediterranean recipes for savory dishes and desserts, that I would like to share with you through this class.\nI'm not a professional chef; I learned how to cook from my mother and by trial and error, so I know very well that cooking can seem difficult and challenging. Too often, the recipes, especially for exotic cuisines, can seem too complicated to even try. That's why my aim in these lessons is to try and simplify things as much as possible so that even the most inexperienced cooks can achieve great results.\nAs for the Lebanese food itself, it is becoming more and more famous all over the world with entrees and dips like the hummus or the baba ghannouj, savory dishes like the Moghrabieh, the Mulukhiyah and desserts like the Kunafa.\nLebanese cuisine uses a lot of whole grains, beans, vegetables and fruits. The most frequently used protein is poultry, but we also use red meats like lamb meat and beef as well as fish and seafood. Lebanese cuisine also includes copious amounts of garlic, onions, lemon juice and olive oil. You’ll rarely find a recipe without some lemon juice and olive oil involved somehow.\nAs you’ll see, Lebanese cuisine is heartwarming and, if done properly, can be the best comfort food that you'll ever find.\nSo here we go. Our class will be divided into 2 sections: 1 for savory recipes and another for desserts.\nIf you have any questions or need any assistance or clarifications please do not hesitate to send me a message, I will be more than happy to help.",

It is through countless hours of personal research and exploration that I created a guide to becoming your own herbal practitioner, by encouraging exploration and creativity in conjunction with wise and time-tested knowledge. Herbalism, as a transformative art, is a way to get back to our roots and the source of potent medicine that our ancestors have used for millennia before us. Herbalism can help us be self-sufficient instead of relying on store-bought products that are filled with toxins. You will get to understand your herbs via a thorough introduction to the various spheres of herbalism, the history and cultural contexts, and how the practice can improve your life, highlighting all the purposes from the sacred to the mundane.\nThis course will take you through the science of herbalism and how the constituents interact with your body to produce herbal actions. Then it will lay down the context for growing, harvesting, and finally, creating your own herbal apothecary. Lastly and certainly not least, it will go over all the ways that you can have a sustainable and earth-friendly practice through the principles of wildcrafting, permaculture, and biodynamics.\n\n\nAbout the Expert:\nHeather got her Masters in Public Health, majoring in Epidemiology and Global Health in 2017. She has been interested in plant medicine her whole life, which only intensified the more she traveled the globe. She is a self-taught herbalist who never stops learning about new herbal usages. She creates all her own beauty and skin products. At any time of the day, a “Wild Heather” can been seen in her natural habitat, foraging for herbs. She believes the human potential can sky-rocket with the infinite benefits of working with herbs. Heather uses herbalism to aid in holistic health and treat acute illnesses. She is an avid yogi and travel adventurer. She believes herbs aided her endurance to run marathons, play volleyball, and run Division 1 cross country, all while going to University. Her all-time favorite herbs to work with is yarrow, chamomile, mint, and lavender.",

      "description": "Whether you have been vegan for sometime, just made the switch or are just curious about what vegans eat, you'll know or soon find out that desserts can be the trickiest foods to \"veganize.\" Besides ice cream, they are also the foods that you're least likely to be able to purchase at a grocery store and definitely at a local restaurant. This leaves those of us with a sweet tooth in an unsatisfying situation. Deciding to remove animal products from your diet shouldn't mean that you have to go without the foods you crave and love.\nThis course will give you tested and omnivore-approved recipes for some of our favorite desserts. These recipes will fool any meat-lover and I strongly encourage you to avoid mentioning the \"v\" word when you serve them :) Just let them happily eat and enjoy them, then casually mention later that they happen to be vegan.\nI've divided the course into sections for different categories of desserts. Note that I will be adding to the course over time, so when you enroll, be on the lookout for notices that I've added new recipes.\nIf you've ever wanted to make vegan desserts for your family and friends that they will rave about, this course is for you! Check out the free preview videos and downloadable recipes and if you like what you see, join our class. There's a 30 day money back gurantee, so if you're not pleased you can get a refund.",

Recipes range from pan-seared and poaching to Insta-worthy presentations of whole roasted birds or something super French, like Chicken Cordon Bleu.\nWe'll also cover best practices for handling raw chicken - how long it can keep in the refrigerator or freezer and how to minimize contamination.\nBecause there are SO many chicken recipes out there, this course focuses on (1) basic techniques that give good chicken regardless of the ingredients and (2) the most well-known dishes out there, with some expansion for cultural exploration. Over time, I hope to expand more on global chicken recipes but the criteria for this expansion will always be that the ingredients have to be easily accessible.\nI've researched multiple cookbooks and blogs to find recipes that aren't too fussy and only use easily accessible ingredients. You should be able to find most everything in your local grocery store. If there's a special ingredient, I'll include other recipes you can use it in as an outside resource link.\nRecipes come from a variety of sources and this video course is just a demonstration of how each recipe can look. If you've never made it before, how do you know you're doing it right? Occasionally, I make a mistake - and I show you anyway to prove that your cooking will not be perfect and it's still wonderful!\nRecipes will include gluten, dairy, and soy. Also note that raw poultry is not telegenic (meaning, it does not look pretty on camera).",

Actually I didn’t know that the cotton cheesecake is a specialty of the Japanese.\nI thought it was just one of many kinds of cheesecake.\n\n\nJapanese cotton cheesecake is very different from the regular cheesecake.\nIt offers the same iconic sweet and tangy flavor of cheesecake with a soft, light and airy, melt-in-your-mouth texture.\nThe big difference between a regular cheesecake and Japanese cotton cheese cake is the addition of the meringue, so the cake becomes airy and fluffy.\nIt looks simple but I realized it is not after I tried baking it a couple times and failed many times. For this course, I’m going to show you not only the recipe, but also the reasons why we fail, the solutions, and helpful tips. When you have questions, you can ask me anytime from my Q&A page in the course.\n\n\nAlso I’m going to introduce a new trendy Japanese cheese cake, which is Japanese cheese tart.\nJapanese cheese tarts have been getting popular here over the last 5 years. Cheese tart shops have been increasing everywhere not only in Japan, but also in other parts of Asia.\nIt’s crispy sweet crust filled with fluffy rich cheese cream.\nThis is originally made from Japanese cheese but after re-doing the recipe over 10 times to find an original blend, I succeeded in a version which you can make with ingredients outside of Japan.\nI will explain every single step and give you all the tips, so let’s enjoy baking together!\nSo if you are interested in Japanese cuisine, want to add a new and delicious dessert to your collection or just want to impress your guests are the next dinner party…. this class is for you.\n\n\nAre you ready for exploring the world of Japanese sweets and desserts?\nLet’s get started!\n\n\nAsami",

I’ll start with the basics of how to colour frosting and store it and how to check the consistency and also show you everything you need to know about using piping bags before diving into the seven techniques of this class. You can do six of these seven techniques with any frosting, such as buttercream, whipped cream, or meringue based frostings. I include the recipe for my 4 Minute Buttercream in the course documents and that's my favourite frosting to use because it's easy to make, it's stable, it's delicious, you can create bright and bold colours with just a few drops of gel, and it stores well. I'll break every technique down into manageable steps, showing you how to prepare your cake before starting piping and demonstrating each stage of the process so that even if you're a beginning to decorating cakes, you'll be able to follow the videos and replicate the techniques yourself to create stunning designs! You can use these techniques and copy my cake designs exactly or use them as inspiration for your own masterpieces!",

There are a few salads that have greens as the base, but many of the recipes feature the beans, grains and pasta that make a heartier salad.\nYou may be thinking, \"Aren't all salads vegan?\" Actually, no they aren't--especially when they are made with traditional ingredients. Salads like caesar salad, potato salad, and macaroni salad fall in this category. I've created vegan versions of these salads in this course. I've also created a dressing/dip that is a great ranch dressing substitute.\nIf you're curious, don't hesitate to enroll in this course and learn how to make these delicious, satisfying salads!",

I couldn't concentrate very well.  Always tired.  I would have random fevers.  I actually thought I had a really bad flu at one point and went to an urgent care.  They pushed on my belly and ouch I cried.  They had me rush to the Emergency room.  My appendix had burst they said.  I was put in surgery and actually my intestines had enlarged and were covering up my appendix that was already leaking and gangrene.  They said it must have been doing that for a period of months.  The surgeon said it literally disintegrated in his hand.  Along with my appendix they had to remove 15 pounds of intestinal mush and she my good intestine parts back together.  Most intestines only weigh about 11 pounds.  Anyway I spent 9 days in a hospital room on antibiotics, almost put on oxygen permanently, at one point I was getting worse.\nThe unit I was in was the telemetry unit for patients that need constant monitoring.  Every four hours a new iv, shots, blood taken every morning and night.  When I was there like 10 patients in the 20 room until had died.  I had to walk the hallways with my Iv to get my intestines to work again, watching code reds randomly happen and people not coming back from it.\nI was told many times I am lucky to be alive and I am.  I'll take the giant scar on my stomach that they used to cut me open any day.\nSo I recovered over several weeks when I got home, sleeping in a recliner, taking all the pills, pain killers, etc... But I even after I still wasn't feeling right.  I went to my Surgeon, Went to my primary Doctor and this is what happened....\nWithout knowing it I had been poisoning myself.  I am allergic to legumes (soy, peanut butter, beans, etc, tree nuts, and nuts.  Things I ate on a regular basis.\nSo why did I tell you this story....?\nWell ONE In case this is you and like me you had no idea.....\nAnd Two To encourage you to read the back of labels for yourself and your families health\nFor example The word spices, artificial and natural flavor, can mean anything like soy, nuts, gluten egg, coloring agents, you don't know.\n\nMore and more kids are developing allergies.  So please pay attention to how your children react to food as well as yourself.\nEven if you don't buy this course thats ok....check out the FREE preview for Blackened Seasoning.\nGive it a try and enjoy...\nAll the Best and with love,\n\n\n\nJohn Thomas Mattison.",

Enroll now!\n(Facebook group Cookin's love - Group of cooking lovers)\n\n\n-BONUS-\nHere are extra history Infos for baking Pastry desserts in this course if you’re interested in it!\n\n\nBaking is a method of preparing food and dessert that uses dry heat, normally in an oven, but can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked. Heat is gradually transferred \"from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their center. As heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center\". Baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other. Baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit.\nBecause of historical social and familial roles, baking has traditionally been performed at home by women for day-to-day meals and by men in bakeries and restaurants for local consumption. When production was industrialized, baking was automated by machines in large factories. The art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for nutrition, as baked goods, especially breads, are a common and important food, both from an economic and cultural point of view. A person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a baker.\n\n\nHistory of Baking Pastry Desserts:\n\n\nPain au chocolat literally chocolate bread; also known as chocolatine in the south-west part of France and in Canada, is a type of viennoiserie or pastry dessert roll consisting of a cuboid-shaped piece of yeast-leavened laminated dough, similar in texture to a puff pastry, with one or two pieces of dark chocolate in the center.\nPain au chocolat is a pastry dessert made of the same layered doughs as a croissant. Often sold still hot or warm from the oven, they are commonly sold alongside croissants in French bakeries and supermarkets.\nIn France, the name of the pains au chocolat pastry varies by regions :\n· In the Hauts-de-France and in Alsace, the words \"petit pain au chocolat\" or \"petit pain\" are used.\n· In central France and in Paris, the words \"pain au chocolat” are used.\n· In South-West France (Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie) and in Canada, the word \"chocolatine\" is used.\nIn Belgium, the words \"couque au chocolat\" are also used.\nChocolatine desserts are often sold in packages at supermarkets and convenience stores or made fresh in pastry shops.\n· In Lebanon, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Ireland, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, they are sold in most bakeries, supermarkets, and cafés as the most popular Pastry dessert for breakfast.\n· In Germany, they are sold less frequently than chocolate croissants pastry, but both are referred to as \"Schokoladencroissant\".\n· In the United States and often Canada, Chocolatine desserts are commonly known as \"chocolate croissants\".\n· In Belgium's Flanders region, they are sold in most bakeries, and referred to as \"chocoladekoek\" or \"chocoladebroodje\".\n· In Portugal and Spain, these pastry desserts are sold in bakeries and supermarkets, as napolitanas (i.e., from Naples).\n· In Mexico, they are also most commonly found in bakeries and supermarkets and are known as chocolatines.\n· In El Salvador and Brazil, they are referred to as \"croissant de chocolate\".\n· In Australia and New Zealand, they are commonly referred to as \"chocolate croissants\", and are sold freshly baked in most bakeries and supermarkets.\n\n\nCroissant is a buttery, flaky, Baking viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other pastry desserts are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.\nCrescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance and crescent-shaped pastry cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian and French bakeries and pâtisseries. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough pastry made them into a fast food which can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was explicitly a French response to American-style pastry fast food, and as of 2008 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.\nSchneck or escargot is a spiral pastry dessert often eaten for breakfast in France. Its names translate as raisin bread and snail, respectively. It is a member of the baking pâtisserie viennoise (Pastry of bakeries) family of baked foods.\nIn France, it is typically a variant of the croissant or pain au chocolat, made with a leavened butter pastry with raisins added and shaped in a spiral with a crème pâtissière filling. However, in many areas of Northern Europe and North America, it is generally made with sweetened bread dough or brioche dough, rather than pastry. It is often consumed for breakfast as part of a Continental breakfast.",

Join this special revolution and revival of the ancient art of tea.\n\n\nOnce you completed 4 of our online courses, we have prepared world-class Milestone Level - ITA Certified Tea Sommelier Certification for you!

Not many know how to obtain a natural sour in a sourdough bread.\nA technique for a long fermentation. There's something you MUST do for a long fermentation.\nHow to obtain the real San Francisco sourdough flavor.\nOne small change to increase oven spring.\nWhat type of flour to use.\nTips for increasing dough strength.\nFor years the holy grail of sourdough baking, here in the USA, has been an authentically \"SOUR\" sourdough bread, like they used to bake in San Francisco. It is so sought after that bakeries will add a substitute sour like vinegar or \"sour salt\" (which is citric acid). The added \"fake\" sour flavor tastes fake and it isn't authentic. There's something quite wonderful about baking a real sourdough loaf that you can make as sour as you like, or for that matter, as mild as you like.\nI've experimented for about 15 years to get a consistent \"sour\" in my sourdough bread. It's easy to get a sour bread by adding whole grains or even using all whole grains. However, to obtain a white flour San Francisco style sour loaf has been just beyond my grasp. I've baked plenty of sour loaves, but the consistency just wasn't there, my bread was sour sometimes and not other times. Part of the reason is because the literature insists that you need to use low hydration, cold bulk ferment to obtain the \"sour.\" I never thought that was true but it held me back because I felt they must know what they're talking about. After all, it's in print right? ;)\nSo I finally went off the deep end and started experimenting with my own ideas and pre-conceived notions. And guess what? I figured it out. I can now bake a real authentic \"SOUR\" sourdough loaf with no more than white flour, sourdough culture, salt and water.  I do have some variations from the all white loaf as well.\nThis course is not to teach you how to bake with sourdough, I already have ten courses that show you how to do that. So please don't join this course and get upset that it doesn't show you the basics (although there will be a lecture on how to make your own sourdough starter). This course is exclusively intended to show you how to bake a loaf of San Francisco Style bread that is \"SOUR\" like the authentic loaves of our past, that we here in the USA love so much.\nThis type of bread flavor is not usually sought after by other countries, indeed, they probably think we are crazy to love our deeply sour loaves, but there you have it!  Come on and join me and discover (Finally) how to obtain the SOUR in sourdough.\nGluten Free consumers are now coming full circle as science discovers that long fermented dough is usually well tolerated by those with intolerance to gluten and other grains. It isn't for everyone and you should always ask your doctor, but perhaps you are one of the lucky ones who can indulge in real, chewy, thick and delicious sourdough bread. If so, welcome back to real bread!\nTeresa",

      "description": "This course will teach you the essentials of cooking aromatic Middle Eastern, Arabic, and Mediterranean food. You can approach this course as a beginner or even as an advanced chef trying to learn about a new cooking style. While the course will start out with basics such as cooking rice and steak, it will get more advanced by the end. You are in for a flavorful adventure to learn about an exotic cuisine.\n\nFirst, we will cover making Tikka and Okra Tomato Soup, two important dishes originating from Iraq and famous across the Middle East. You will learn the basic skills that you will apply in the rest of the lectures and on your own, as you experiment with other dishes, later on.\n\nNext, you will be happy to see a world famous and vegan prized dish in Falafel from Palestine. This lecture will be longer than the previous two, and will include more about the ingredients used in Middle Eastern food. It will teach you the best way to cook Falafel, step by step.\n\nThen, we will cover Yellow Lentil Soup, a dish loved by Egyptians and adored across the Mediterranean. You will be introduced to unique ways of adding ingredients you are familiar with to create a new dish. At this point, you will fully realize what makes Mediterranean food so aromatic and exotic.\n\nFinally, the biggest secret in this course is a dish you won't find anywhere else on the internet -- Mandaean Chicken. Mandaeans are a group of people from the southern parts of Mesopotamia. The spices in this dish are heavily inspired by the Mediterranean cooking style but have their own unique touch. This is a prime example of how you can take these original flavors from common spices and ingredients and make your own unique Mediterranean inspired dish.\n\nYou are in for a flavorful adventure. Enjoy!",

      "description": "What's a Good Wine? That's the Million Dollar Question and There Has Never Been a Straight-Forward Answer...Until Now!\n\nWhy Take This Course?\nIf you've ever tried a great bottle of wine and thought to yourself, \"Wow!!!! I wish I knew how to pick out more great wines like this,\" then this is the class for you!\nThe average person doesn't want to know how wine is made, or what the soil is in the different wine regions around the world. All they want to know is how to pick out a good wine.\nThat's why I'm going to teach you HOW to determine what a wine will taste like BEFORE you open the bottle so you can stop wasting money on bad wines and start picking out great wines with confidence!\nI've also complied a list of the 626 main wine regions in the world that don't put the name of the grape on the label to help you identify what you're buying. The words:\nCrozes-Hermitage,\nRomanee-Conti\nBatard-Montrachet\nPouilly Fume\n\n\ndon't tell you anything about what grape is used to make these wines, but the words:\nCrozes-Hermitage = 100% Syrah\nRomanee-Conti = 100% Pinot Noir\nPuligny-Montrachet = 100% Chardonnay\nPouilly Fume = 100% Sauvignon Blanc\n\n\ngive you product knowledge and that equals an educated consumer.\nSo what are you waiting for, sign up for this class today and start buying great wines with confidence, tonight!\n\nRead What They're Saying About the Course Content:\n\"The great thing about this book (which is supplied free with every class!) is that it will get you through 95% of wine lists out there - even in NYC. Unless you're at a place that employs someone especially for their wine list, this book will get you through it, and you may even know more after taking it than the manager or owner who probably chose those wines - or even worse, the rep who just unloaded what they needed to sell. That being said, this book doesn't de-mystify, it explains, in very good format, the keys to understanding what you're going to get when you order a glass or bottle at your neighborhood restaurant. Wine isn't a mystery, it's a process, and this book walks you through it with ease. This is as clear and concise as can be, yet is super-informative. You want something refreshing and light? Probably not a California wine, my friend. All you need to do is keep this book handy, or better yet, know and understand it, and you'll be able to order and buy with confidence and ease. Too many wine books out there make it difficult - this one doesn't. Do yourself a favor and get it so you don't order the same old stuff and get frustrated with it being wrong for what you want.\"\n\"This is a fantastic book! Whenever I was picking out a wine, I never knew what to look for. I always seemed to wander through the wine aisle at the grocery store picking out a few bottles on sale and hoping that I would end up liking them. This book totally solved my problem because it breaks down WHY a wine tastes the way it does which is exactly what I was looking for. A great book for anyone wanting to navigate their way though wine!\"\n\"Great tips written without any pretense, which I often find to be the most difficult thing when dining out and trying to order wine, I'm always afraid I'm going to say the wrong thing and get a wine I'm too afraid to send back. I can't wait to use the tips I just read to help me on my next date night with the hubby. I hope there is more to come. I would love to delve further into the mysterious world of wine. Thanks for making me understand the wine world in a manner that wasn't too overwhelming.\"\n\"Finally I can walk into the wine section and choose a bottle of wine based on an educated guess vs staring at the labels and wondering if it tastes as good as the label looks!! I love that the author (who is a wine sommelier) swallows her pride and puts it in layman's terms so even a wine novice like myself can figure it out! I had no idea grapes had so many different fruit flavors depending on what climate they're grown in - so cool!! This is a must have for anyone trying to figure out what a bottle of wine will taste like before it's open. I can't wait to show up to my next dinner party with a perfect pairing!!\"\n\"Fantastic. I'm a restaurant professional with experience helping diners select wine in some of New York's most prominent restaurants. This dynamic little book was like a light going on for me. It's easy for the wine conversation at a diners' table to veer off in an ultimately unhelpful and time consuming direction, but this approach will help me organize the necessary information in my own mind to quickly and thoroughly help all levels of wine lovers and diners. I like it from a consumer standpoint, but I wanted to emphasize its value as a tool for those of us in the industry, too. It's a wealth of practical information delivered in a lively tempo. Well done.\"\nWhat Are the Features:\nMy Best Selling Wine Book \"7 Wine Secrets You Wish You Knew\" is Included FREE (A $14.95 Value) When You Enroll in the Course as it is the Foundation of this Class.\nAll Class Information is Available for Download in PDF Format\nCertificate of Completion When You Finish the Course\nYou Also Get Lifetime Access to the Class and a 30-Day Money Back Guarantee, So What Are You Waiting For?
