Flow Designer lets process owners use natural language to automate approvals, tasks, notifications, and record operations without coding.\nYou can expand Flow Designer to communicate with external instances and third-party systems by requesting a separate subscription to Integration Hub.\n\n\nFor developer training, see Using Flow Designer on the ServiceNow® Developer Site.\nFlow Designer benefits\nFlow Designer provides process owners and developers these benefits:\nAutomates repetitive work to improve efficiency and experience.\nDescribes a workflow in natural language to help non-technical users understand what it does.\nEnables creating and testing a workflow from a single interface to ensure it works as expected.\nPromotes process automation by enabling subject matter experts to develop and share reusable actions with flow designers.\nReduces upgrade costs, with upgrade-safe Now Platform logic replacing complex custom script.\nReduces development costs by providing a library of reusable actions.\nEnables extending Flow Designer content by subscribing to ServiceNow Integration Hub or installing spokes.\n\n\nFlow Designer components\nFlow Designer consists of the following components:\nFlows\nA flow is an automated process consisting of a trigger and a sequence of actions. Flows automate business logic for a particular application or process. For example, the VTB Sample Flow creates and assigns a VTB card whenever a priority 1 incident is created. Building and managing flows requires that you have some familiarity with the Now Platform tables and fields that the application or process uses. Process analysts can create flows using available actions or copy an existing flow to use it as a template.\n\n\nSubflows\nA subflow is an automated process consisting of a sequence of reusable actions, data inputs, and outputs. In contrast to flows, subflows do not have a trigger but instead run within a flow, another subflow, or a script. Building and managing subflows requires that you have some familiarity with the Now Platform tables and fields that the application or process uses. Process analysts can create subflows using available actions or use an existing subflow as a template.\n\n\nActions\nAn action is a reusable operation that enables process analysts to automate Now Platform features without having to write code. For example, the Create Record action allows process analysts to generate records in a particular table with particular values when certain conditions occur. ServiceNow core actions like Create Record require some familiarity with Now Platform tables and fields. Action designers can create application-specific actions to pre-set configuration details. For example, creating a Create Incident Task action ensures that the process analyst uses the correct table and field configuration each time the action is used. You can add application-specific actions by activating the associated spoke.\n\n\nSpokes\nA spoke is a scoped application containing Flow Designer actions and subflows for managing specific tables. For example, the ITSM Spoke contains actions for managing Incident and Problem records. For a list of available spokes, see Spokes. You can activate additional spokes on your instance by installing the appropriate app from the ServiceNow Store or activating the appropriate plugin. Building your own spoke requires familiarity with application development on the Now Platform.\n\n\nAction steps\nAn action step or step is a single reusable operation within an action. For example, the Create Record step allows action designers to specify the table and field values to use during record creation. Action steps require subject matter expertise with application tables, fields, and business logic. Application developers or IT generalists add action steps to actions from the Action Designer design environment. Flow Designer provides a set of ServiceNow core action steps to automate Now Platform processes. You can add application-specific action steps by activating the associated spoke.",

Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.\nRunning Docker on AWS provides developers and admins a highly reliable, low-cost way to build, ship, and run distributed applications at any scale. AWS supports both Docker licensing models: open source Docker Community Edition (CE) and subscription-based Docker Enterprise Edition (EE).\nIn this course, you will learn exactly how to leverage containerization on AWS cloud platform, and that includes understanding all core concepts, including that of AWS and Docker. Following are the topics we shall cover in detail:\n\n\nDocker & ECS Basics: Getting familiar with Docker and ECS terminologies\nECS Task Definitions: Understand how Task Definitions act as a blueprint for you to deploy tasks\nECS Services: Make use of ECS Service to maintain desired number of healthy containers across your ECS Cluster\nService Auto Scaling: Understand how to make use of some scaling policies to scale out and scale in the number of containers automatically based on some CloudWatch metrics\nScheduling Tasks and ECS Task Placement: Learn how to schedule deployment of your ECS containers and implement different task placement strategies.\nUsing EFS File Systems with Amazon ECS: Learn how your ECS containers can be associated to an elastic NFS file system like EFS\nListening for Amazon ECS CloudWatch Events: Set up a simple Lambda function that listens for Amazon ECS task events and writes them out to a CloudWatch Logs log stream\nECS and SNS: Configure Events event rule that only captures task events where the task has stopped running\nECS and Secrets Manager: Learn how to inject sensitive data into your containers by storing sensitive data in AWS Secrets Manager secrets and referencing them in your container definition\nOverall, this course helps you become an expert on deployment and management of Docker containers on AWS platform.\n\n\nQueries some students may have before enrolling to this course:\nShould I have expertise on Docker? No, you don't need any Docker certification or knowledge to start this course, as it already contains necessary basic Docker concepts for you to get started, and that should be sufficient for you to learn how to deploy and manage Docker containers on AWS.\nWhat prior knowledge should I have? There are two main requirements for you to get started:\nBasic knowledge of AWS services like EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling, EFS and CloudWatch etc.\nComfortable using command line interface (CLI) as we will be running some Linux-based commands",

Designed for system administrators, DevOps engineers, software developers, and IT professionals seeking to validate their containerization expertise, this course includes six full-length mock exams that closely mirror the format, difficulty level, and topic distribution of the official DCA certification exam.\nEach mock exam is meticulously crafted to cover the core domains assessed by the DCA exam, including orchestration, image creation and management, installation and configuration, networking, security, and persistent storage. The questions are scenario-based and designed to test both theoretical knowledge and practical understanding of Docker in real-world environments.\nEvery question is supplemented with a comprehensive explanation of the correct answer. These detailed rationales not only reinforce the correct choice but also clarify the underlying concepts, helping you deepen your technical understanding and correct any misconceptions.\nWhether you are taking the exam for the first time or brushing up on your Docker skills, this course offers an essential resource for effective exam preparation. By completing all six mock exams and reviewing the explanations thoroughly, you will build the confidence, competence, and critical thinking skills necessary to pass the DCA certification and succeed in containerized application environments.\n\n\nStreamline, Simplify, Dockerize: IT's Best Friend!\nDocker is a popular platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. A container packages an application and its required files, libraries, and dependencies, ensuring that the application runs the same regardless of where it's deployed. Docker makes it easier to manage containers and is widely used for tasks like automating the deployment of applications, scaling them as necessary, and managing system resources, all within isolated environments. By simplifying these processes, Docker allows developers and IT teams to focus more on developing software and less on system administration, making it a valuable tool in DevOps and cloud computing environments.\n\n\nCan I retake the practice tests?\nYes, you can attempt each practice test as many times as you like. After completing a test, you'll see your final score. Each time you retake the test, the questions and answer choices will be shuffled for a fresh experience.\nIs there a time limit for the practice tests?\nYes, each test includes a time limit of 120 seconds per question.\nWhat score do I need to pass?\nYou need to score at least 70% on each practice test to pass.\nAre explanations provided for the questions?\nYes, every question comes with a detailed explanation.\nCan I review my answers after the test?\nAbsolutely. You’ll be able to review all your submitted answers and see which ones were correct or incorrect.\nAre the questions updated frequently?\nYes, the questions are regularly updated to provide the best and most relevant learning experience.\n\n\nAdditional Note: It’s highly recommended that you take the practice exams multiple times until you're consistently scoring 90% or higher. Don’t hesitate—start your preparation today. Good luck!",

I am an Okta Certified Consultant and I have carefully designed this course for you to get to know the aspects of Okta in a simple and pleasant manner.\nCourse is intended for anyone out there working with Okta or simply interested in this field. More specifically, it is intended for those who are trying to get a helping hand into their journey of trying to get to be an Okta Certified Developer.\n\n\n*ATTENTION*\n1. Please understand this is not an official Okta course, everything you are going to see is designed by myself so my own point of view, but nonetheless a point of view based on the official Okta Developer Certification Exam Study Guide / public KB articles. In any case, it will NOT grant you the Okta Developer Certificate, the same as it will NOT provide you with the entire knowledge / answers needed for passing the actual Okta Certified Developer exam. You are the only one who knows if you are truly ready to take on such an official exam and when.\n2. Those questions you are going to see in the course, questions to which you have to find the correct answer(s), might have just one single correct answer or multiple correct answers, while Okta's official Certification exams have a DOMC (Discrete Option Multiple Choice) structure (not supported by Udemy at the moment).\n3. Each question in the course has at least 3 choices from which you can pick. There isn't a single question providing only two potential answers.\n4. This course is based not only on the direct links' content Okta provides in the Okta Developer Certification Exam Study Guide, but also on their nested links (with an infinite depth), as that's the only way in which someone can truly grasp the knowledge, by trying to check the extensions as well, which is where fine details reside at times.\n5. Pay attention that these questions might even be harder then the actual ones you'll find in the official Okta Developer Certification Exam, the same of some of them might feel much easier then what you'll meet in the official examination provided by Okta. This is simply a matter of perspective and level of knowledge. I added a timer of 120 mins and a threshold of 70% for passing this one, as mere guidance.\n\nYou'll get to see:\nA total of 95 questions with related answers (single / multiple choice as correct answer(s)), out of which:\n80 - are uniquely designed for this course\n5 - are shared between this course and the 'Okta Certified Professional Knowledge Base Test' course on Udemy\n5 - are shared between this course and the 'Okta Certified Administrator Knowledge Base Test' course on Udemy\n5 - are shared between this course and the 'Okta Certified Consultant Knowledge Base Test' course on Udemy\n\n\n! Once again, the present course is designed to greatly help you towards achieving the goal of passing the Okta Developer Certification Exam, but cannot guarantee that, as this course is NOT provided by Okta officials, hence it does not represent a standard in passing the Okta Developer Certification Exam or gathering the entirety of the knowledge needed for passing it with success.\n\nHaving said the above, wish you good luck!\n\n\n\n\nWith respect,\nSilviu Muraru",

CAN was developed by Bosch in the 1980s and has since become a standard in the automotive industry due to its reliability, robustness, and low cost.\nCAN is used for communication between different automotive systems, such as the engine management system, transmission control system, chassis control system, and body control system. By using a single communication bus, CAN eliminates the need for multiple wiring harnesses and connectors, reducing weight and cost while improving reliability.\nCAN protocol has two types of messages: standard and extended. The standard CAN message has an 11-bit identifier, while the extended CAN message has a 29-bit identifier. This allows for a greater number of messages to be transmitted on the CAN bus. CAN also uses a priority-based message arbitration system, which ensures that higher priority messages are transmitted first.\nIn addition to the standard CAN protocol, there are also several application-specific protocols used in the automotive industry. For example, the J1939 protocol is commonly used for heavy-duty vehicles, while the CANopen protocol is used in industrial automation and control systems. The OBD-II protocol is used for onboard diagnostics and emissions monitoring in vehicles.\nOne of the key advantages of CAN protocol in the automotive industry is its ability to diagnose faults and malfunctions in the vehicle's systems. Diagnostic tools can be used to access the CAN bus and retrieve information about the vehicle's systems and components, including diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and real-time data.\nOverall, CAN protocol has become an essential part of modern automotive technology, enabling efficient and reliable communication between different systems in vehicles.",

At $319 per attempt, that’s almost $1000 (not including the cost of your textbooks or video training).\nIt’s no surprise when you see what’s involved in the exam. You have only 90 minutes to answer 60-90 tough configuration and troubleshooting questions about security, scripting, system logging, file permissions, troubleshooting and more.\nWhere most students fall flat isn’t failing to study enough, it’s lack of exam question preparation. Exam preparation involves applying your knowledge to challenge questions where you have to fill-in-the-blank or pick the correct answer from single and multiple answers. This is where you actually learn to apply your theory to solve problems. You simply can’t pass your exam until you master this skill. Most IT students never realize this and are doomed to failure.\nYou are NOT ready to take the actual exam until you are getting 95% or more in your practice exams. This is where our Linux Exam-Style Questions will make all the difference. We use three of the most popular Linux exams as a base to test you on every possible syllabus subject you could face in the exam. We strongly recommend you take both the CompTIA Linux+ AND the LPIC-1 Linux Administrator (and beginners LPI Linux Essentials) exams giving your three certifications for the same amount of work.\nThese questions will help you pass the following exams and have been updated for 2020\nLPIC1 - Linux Administrator (101-500, 102-500)\nLPI Linux Essentials (010-160)\nCompTIA Linux+ (XK0-004)\nIn these 200 exam questions you will really help drill down your knowledge so you master all the subjects long before you walk into the exam room. You pick apart every major exam topic until you are more than ready come exam day. Most of the questions come with explanations and more details so you can use it as a valuable study too along with your study guide.\nLet our Linux experts help to prepare you for your Linux exams. We’ve been working in and teaching Linux for many years and we know what works. Drop us a question in the student area and we’ll be happy to help you.\nWe will update the questions whenever CompTIA and LPI updates their syllabus.",

The exam tests your knowledge and skills related to network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security fundamentals, and automation and programmability. Once you earn your CCNA, you can use it to get a job in the information technology (IT) or networking fields. For example, you could work as a Cloud Engineer, Network Administrator, Systems Administrator, or IT Manager. You can also take additional specialized exams to land a more specialized role. If you complete the CCNA Routing and Switching Certification, for example, you are eligible for positions like a Network Analyst or Network Engineer.\n\n\nHow can I pass the CCNA with self study?\nMany people pass the CCNA exam through self-study using the latest learning materials supplemented with practical instruction. The exam covers a broad range of basic and modern networking concepts along with real-world Cisco network configuration scenarios. It's important to both understand the concepts and practice applying them. Simulated configuration exercises, practice labs, and sample test questions are especially helpful in preparing for the CCNA exam. Udemy courses can help you master the networking concepts and skills needed. You can also gain hands-on Cisco CCNA configuration and troubleshooting experience through practice labs.\n\n\nWhat are the topics covered in the Cisco CCNA exam?\nThe CCNA exam tests your knowledge and skills in networking fundamentals such as routing and switching, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security basics, and automation and programmability. Among the topics covered are how to build simple LANs, how to use a patch panel, troubleshooting routers and switches, IP addressing and subnetting, IPv6 routing, address allocation using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), access control lists (ACLs), basic WAN technologies such as VPN and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), external authentication methods, quality of service (QoS), IP services such as Network Address Translation (NAT). For many years, the CCNA certification involved multiple exams for individual tracks like CCNA Voice and CCNA Data Center. In 2020, Cisco combined all the tracks into one comprehensive CCNA exam based on the latest networking technologies, software development skills, and IT job roles, including network administrator and network engineer.\n\n\nWhat are the recommended prerequisites for the CCNA exam?\nAlthough there are no formal prerequisites for CCNA certification, most professionals in the field would recommend a thorough understanding of the CCNA topics before taking the exam. A lot of CCNA candidates have one or more years of experience implementing Cisco solutions along with a grasp of basic IP addressing and network concepts.\n\n\nIs CCNA required for a CCNP?\nNo, the CCNA is no longer required before you can attain a CCNP or higher-level Cisco certification. However, you need a certain level of competency and knowledge that builds upon skills attained at the CCNA level before you should attempt the CCNP certification. To achieve any of the Cisco professional-level certifications, you must pass two exams. You can earn a CCNP certification in one or more of the following specialties: enterprise (including routing, switching, and wireless networking), collaboration, security, data center, and service provider. Cisco also offers professional-level certifications in Cisco Certified DevNet Professional, which proves your skills in developing and maintaining applications built on Cisco networks, and Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional, which proves your skills in incident response, cloud security, and other active defense security roles.\n\n\nWhat are the other Cisco certificaitions and what do they cover?\nCisco has associate (CCNA), professional (CCNP), and expert (CCIE) certifications. These include the CCNA, Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate (entry security analyst skills), and Cisco Certified DevNet Associate (developing apps on Cisco platforms). CCNP certifications in enterprise (routing, switching, and wireless), collaboration (Cisco apps and services), data center (Cisco infrastructure), security (Cisco security solutions), and service provider (implementing and operating Cisco solutions), along with Cisco Certified CyberOps Professional and Cisco Certified DevNet Professional; CCIE certifications in enterprise infrastructure (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), enterprise wireless (operating Cisco solutions for complex setups), data center (building and operating Cisco data center solutions), security (implementing Cisco security solutions), service provider (implementing Cisco service provider solutions); and design expert to prepare you for designing large networks.\n\n\nWhat should I learn before Cisco CCNA?\nBefore the Cisco Certified Network Associate examination, you should know basic networking, security, automation, programming, and IP addressing. The CCNA examination intends to certify that you know to perform basic Network Associate tasks. These include managing, monitoring, and maintaining an organization's network infrastructure. A CCNA will not need to architect, design, or develop an advanced network, but they will need to understand it, modify it, and configure it. CCNAs generally have some entry-level, hands-on experience in information technology. Many CCNAs will have an Associate's or Bachelors in an IT-related field. Alternatively, those seeking Cisco certification can take Udemy courses to learn the basics of networking and information technology.\n\n\nHow do I know if CCNA is right for me?\nA CCNA is generally ideal for those who are pursuing a career in networking or security. Cisco certifications are particularly prized for their rigor and valued by employers across the globe. Entry-level IT professionals who want to expand their career and improve their marketability (or their paygrade) may want to get a Network Associate certification to show their dedication to the field. Alternatively, those who seek to learn more about networking or discover whether networking might be the best path for them may consider taking Cisco certification courses. While alternative certification paths (such as CompTIA's Network+) exist, Cisco generally represents the gold standard in networking and security. Further, Cisco's entry-level certifications lead down a more advanced certification path.\n\n\nWhy should you enroll in this course?\nOne reason: Muharrem Aydın.

The company has strict requirements for workload mobility, disaster recovery, and seamless cloud-to-cloud migration. Which of the following features of VMware Cloud Foundation should you prioritize to meet these requirements?\nA) VMware vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS)\nB) VMware HCX\nC) VMware vSAN\nD) VMware vRealize Automation\nExplanation:\nCorrect Answer: B) Use VMware HCX for automated workload migration.\n\n\nExplanation:\nVMware HCX (Hybrid Cloud Extension) is the best solution for achieving workload mobility, disaster recovery, and cloud-to-cloud migration in a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) environment. HCX provides a seamless, hybrid cloud migration service that allows for the movement of workloads from on-premises vSphere environments to VMware Cloud environments, or between different VMware Cloud environments. HCX automates and simplifies the migration process, providing a high level of mobility and flexibility for workloads, which aligns perfectly with the requirements of the enterprise described in the question.\nA) VMware vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS): While vDS is crucial for networking in VMware environments, it primarily addresses network management and virtual machine networking within a single data center or across multiple ESXi hosts. It does not directly address workload mobility, disaster recovery, or cloud-to-cloud migration.\nC) VMware vSAN: vSAN is VMware's software-defined storage solution that integrates with vSphere to provide storage capabilities for virtual machines. It helps optimize storage but is not directly designed for workload mobility or cloud migration.\nD) VMware vRealize Automation: vRealize Automation is an automation tool for managing and provisioning IT resources in VMware environments, which supports self-service provisioning, infrastructure-as-code, and policy-based management. While it is a valuable tool in a VMware Cloud Foundation environment, it doesn't specifically address the requirements of workload mobility and disaster recovery as directly as HCX.\nTAKE A LOOK AT THESE REVIEWS\n5 STARS\nI passed my exam with a score of 76, highly recommended for those preparing for the exam.\n5 STARS\nGreat course for exam practice! The questions were well-structured and helped me feel confident on test day. Highly recommend for anyone preparing. I passed!",

      "description": "**Course Updated - September 2022**\n>> COURSE REGULARLY UPDATED: NEW TIPS, MORE LESSONS <<\n\nPHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.\nPHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[9] and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.\nThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.\nThe PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.\nW3Techs reports that, as of January 2022, \"PHP is used by 78.1% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know.\" PHP version 7.4 is the most used version. Support for version 7.3 was dropped on 6 December 2021.\n\n\nAbout Course\n\n\nThe course includes 2 Practice Test that builds your programming knowledge while making real-world PHP projects.\nIn this course, you’ll be exposed to fundamental programming concepts using PHP to help you practice and test your knowledge using quizzes.\n\n\nHere's a detailed look at what you'll get:\n\nmethods\nvariables\nFunction\nloop\nstatements\nClasses and Objects\nOOP\nand much much more!\n\n\nWhat will you need to succeed in this Exam?\n\nNO Android, Java, Swift, or C knowledge is required!\nPHP  advanced knowledge is required though - you don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set (though there are refresher sections in this course!)\nWhat does this course offer you?\n\nThis course consists of 2 practice tests.\nThe practice test consists of 20 questions, timed at 30 minutes\nThe questions are multiple-choice.\nEvery question is associated with a knowledge area.\nThe answers are randomized every time you take a test.\nOnce the test was taken, you will get an instant result report with categories of strength to weakness.\nYou can retake the tests over and over again as and when it suits you.\n\n\nI'd be very happy to welcome you to the course!",

      "description": "Course Description\nThis course provides students with the advanced knowledge and skills to create production-quality scripts by using Windows PowerShell. It teaches students how to automate administrative tasks by using Windows PowerShell.\nStudents learn core scripting skills, such as creating advanced functions, writing controller scripts, and handling script errors. Students learn how to work with Windows PowerShell workflows, the REST API, XML-formatted data files, and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-formatted data files. Students also learn how to use new administration tools, such as Desired State Configuration (DSC) and Just Enough Administration (JEA), to configure and help secure servers.\n\n\nThe course outline is as follows\nModule 1, “Creating advanced functions”\nLearn how to parameter a command and create an advanced function, convert a script and function into a script module, define parameter attributes and input validation for a function, enumerate objects by using scripting constructs, modify a function to accept pipeline input, produce complex pipeline output in a function, document a function by using comment-based Help, and create functions that support -WhatIf and -Confirm to parameter a command into an advanced function.\n\n\nModule 2, “Using Microsoft .NET Framework and REST API in Windows PowerShell”\nThis module explains how to use Microsoft .NET Framework and REST API to supplement functionality that Windows PowerShell commands provide.\n\n\nModule 3, “Writing controller scripts”\nLearn how to describe the difference between tools and controller scripts, write controller scripts that present a user interface, and write controller scripts that automate a business process.\n\n\nModule 4, “Handling script errors”\nLearn how to perform basic error handling in scripts. The module focuses on adding error handling to existing tools, primarily as a time-saving mechanism (as opposed to having students write new tools). A side benefit of this approach is that it helps build the skills needed to analyze and reuse existing code written by someone else. Topics include describing the shell’s default error response\nmechanisms and adding error handling code to existing tools.\n\n\nModule 5, “Using XML, JSON, and custom-formatted data”\nLearn how to read, manipulate, and write data in the XML and JSON formats.\n\n\nModule 6, “Enhancing server management with Desired State Configuration and Just Enough Administration”\nExplains how to write Desired State Configuration (DSC) configuration files, deploy those files to servers, and monitor servers’ configurations. This module also explains how to restrict administrative access by using Just Enough Administration (JEA).\n\n\nModule 7, “Analyzing and debugging scripts”\nLearn how to use native Windows PowerShell features to analyse and debug existing scripts. Additionally, students analyse and debug an existing script.\n\n\nModule 8, \"Understanding Windows PowerShell Workflow”\nLearn about the features of the Windows PowerShell Workflow technology.",

I’ve taught over 246,945 students how to pass their Scrum Certification exams with my Bestselling Certification Prep Course.\n\n\nWho should take is course?\nWhether you are a product owner, scrum master, team member, business stakeholder or simply someone who wants to understand what makes scrum tick, if you are preparing for a scrum product owner certification or other scrum certification, this class is for you.\n\nWhy should I get Product Owner Certification?\n\n\nCredibility – you will be recognised by employers and customers as someone with a seal of approval. In short, they are more likely to believe that you know what you are talking about and employ your services.\nConfidence – you will feel more certainty in your ability to carry out scrum  as a Product Owner “the right way” and add value to any product or project.\nSalary / Revenue increase – if you already have a Product Owner role, you can mention your certification as a reason for pay increase. If you don’t yet have the role, you can use it as a valid reason to be given a better offer for your Product Owner or Product Manager salary\nCertificate – you will be able to place the certificate on your linked in profile, website and any other digital or physical profile as a record of achievement, making it more likely to close deals, get jobs and boost your own self esteem (with good reason)\n\n\n\n\nWhat do my students say?\nI am fortunate enough to have helped thousands of students to obtain and pass their Scrum  Certifications using my courses.

      "description": "Greetings, everyone!\nToday, I’m excited to introduce you to the Professional Scrum Product Owner II (PSPO II) certification from Scrum Org—a credential that takes your Product Owner skills to the next level. If PSPO I laid the foundation for understanding Scrum and the Product Owner role, PSPO II is where you refine your expertise, tackle complex challenges, and prove you’re among the elite in product management. Recognized globally by industry leaders, this certification isn’t just a badge—it’s a testament to your ability to drive strategic product success in real-world, high-stakes environments. Unlike PSPO I, which focuses on fundamentals, PSPO II demands a deeper mastery of Scrum principles, advanced techniques, and practical application, assessed through a rigorous online exam.\nImagine yourself confidently navigating ambiguous product landscapes, making tough prioritization calls, and leading teams to deliver exceptional value under pressure. That’s the power of PSPO II. This certification isn’t about starting from scratch—it’s about building on your experience and transforming you into a strategic Product Owner who can influence organizations and shape successful products. Whether you’re aiming to stand out in your current role or take your career to new heights, PSPO II is your gateway to advanced proficiency and professional recognition.\nWho Should Pursue This Certification?\nPSPO II is designed for those ready to step up their game:\nExperienced Product Owners: If you’ve earned PSPO I (or equivalent experience) and want to deepen your skills and tackle more sophisticated product challenges, this is for you.\nSenior Product Managers: Looking to sharpen your strategic edge and demonstrate advanced competency in Agile product development? PSPO II is your next milestone.\nScrum Practitioners Seeking Growth: Whether you’re a Business Analyst, Scrum Master, or Developer with solid Scrum experience, this certification equips you to excel in a Product Owner role.\nAmbitious Professionals: If you’re passionate about mastering product ownership and influencing business outcomes, PSPO II will set you apart as a leader in the field.\nThis isn’t a beginner’s course—PSPO II assumes you’re familiar with Scrum basics and have hands-on experience. It’s a challenge for those who are ready to push their limits and achieve excellence.\n\nLearning Objectives – What You’ll Achieve\nWith PSPO II, you’ll gain advanced skills to excel in complex product environments:\nAdvanced Scrum Application: Deepen your understanding of Scrum’s principles and practices, applying them flexibly to solve intricate product development problems.\nStrategic Product Vision and Value Delivery: Learn to craft compelling product visions, align them with organizational goals, and maximize value through sophisticated prioritization and forecasting techniques.\nMastering Stakeholder Dynamics: Develop advanced strategies to manage diverse stakeholders, resolve conflicts, and influence decisions in high-pressure scenarios.\nOptimizing Product Outcomes: Master evidence-based decision-making, metrics-driven backlog management, and techniques to balance short-term wins with long-term product success.\nThese objectives go beyond theory—they’re about equipping you with the tools to handle ambiguity, lead with authority, and deliver results that matter. PSPO II prepares you to thrive where others falter.\nExam Format and Passing Score\nThe PSPO II assessment is a step up in rigor:\nFormat: An online, 60-minute exam with 40 multiple-choice questions. These aren’t straightforward—they’re scenario-based, testing your ability to apply advanced Scrum knowledge to complex, real-world situations.\nPassing Score: You need 85% (at least 34 out of 40 questions correct). The bar is high, reflecting the certification’s focus on advanced competency.\nCost: $250 per attempt. There’s no limit on retakes, but with proper preparation, you’ll be poised to succeed on your first go.\nThe questions are tougher and more nuanced than PSPO I, requiring critical thinking and practical judgment. But with my support, you’ll face the exam with confidence and clarity.\nWhy Choose My Practice Questions?\nMy practice questions aren’t just a study aid—they’re your competitive edge. Here’s why they’re the best choice for PSPO II success:\nCutting-Edge and Aligned with 2025 Standards: My materials are fully updated to the Scrum Guide 2020 and reflect the PSPO II exam’s latest trends as of March, 2025. You’ll prepare with content that mirrors the current test, ensuring no surprises on exam day.\nChallenging, Real-World Scenarios: I’ve crafted questions that replicate the exam’s complexity—think tricky stakeholder conflicts, strategic backlog trade-offs, and value-optimization dilemmas. You’ll sharpen your decision-making skills under conditions that match the real test and real life.\nIn-Depth Guidance for Mastery: Beyond questions, you’ll get detailed explanations, expert tips, and supplemental resources to solidify your understanding. I’m not just helping you pass—I’m preparing you to excel as a world-class Product Owner.\nMy track record speaks for itself: students using my materials have consistently passed PSPO II with flying colors, often exceeding the 85% threshold by a wide margin. They’ve gone on to lead transformative product initiatives and earn promotions—proof that my approach delivers results. With my practice questions, you’re not just studying—you’re investing in a future of leadership and impact.\n\n\nThe PSPO II isn’t just a certification—it’s your ticket to becoming an elite Product Owner, capable of shaping products and organizations at the highest level. With my expert-crafted practice questions and dedicated support, you’ll conquer the exam and unlock a world of career possibilities. Don’t settle for good enough—aim for greatness.

      "description": "*** Part of the best selling course: CCNA Cyber Ops Tools: Sec Onion, Wireshark, and Kali Linux ***\n*** The Only standalone course about ELSA (Enterprise Log Search and Archive) on Udemy***\nIt is estimated that there will be about 1.5 million unfilled jobs in cyber security by the year 2020. A more recent statistic increased this number for cyber security unfilled jobs to be 3.5 million by the year 2021. In addition, recent article highlights Cisco Systems intention to become a cyber security force. For these reasons, Cisco created the CCNA Cyber Ops certification, which can become one of the most certifications in demand in the near future. Furthermore, Cisco created a scholarship program for this certification, which emphasis its importance.\nIn this course you will learn about the tools that you can use for your study of the CCNA Cyber Ops certification. Learning the theory side is important, but the hands on side is more important, since  the main purpose of your study is to apply your knowledge in production, and since your hands on will enforce your theory knowledge. You can not teach someone how to drive a car by showing him or her how to do it, but you have to let him try and practice how to do that. Furthermore, showing you hands on labs and how to use tools without teaching you how to create these labs and install these tools, might not give you the ultimate benefit from your study . For this reason, I have created this course to teach you how to create your own home labs, and to understand the core usage and important features of the tools used in them. I believe in the saying: \"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime\". If you have access to online labs, such as that offered by Cisco through their scholarship, you still need to know how to create your own home labs to continue practicing and experimenting, which is what this course will help you to achieve. On the other hand, this course will prepare you to go through these online labs quickly, and with confidence, since you will be familiar with the tools used in them.  And not just online labs, but any other hands on Cyber Ops courses, like what I intend to publish in the near future.\nIn this course you will learn about how to use the tcpreplay command, and where to download PCAP files that can be used with this command to recreate network packets in order to practice with malware analysis using ELSA. You will go through the steps of log normalization,log summarization, and log aggregation.\nBecause you will need to install and learn security onion before start working with ELSA, I have a section for that.\nI hope that you will join me in this course and start your Cyber security journey. Happy learning!",

But before going through this i have few recommendations for you which you should follow before attempting the questions.\n1. There is a very good YouTube channel (\"BA Bootcamp) which summarizes BABOK. Go through its videos first & then you would find yourself little comfortable with the concepts. After that pickup BABOK guide & try to go through the topic which you just saw in BA bootcamp's videos. This would be enough for you to prepare for the exam. But practice is important before any exam so come here & attempt as many times you want. Understand the statements do not try to memorize them. You will find many questions can be answered by just looking at the options. Try to build your understanding & you will do great in the exam.\n\nThe weight of each chapter is as follows:\nBusiness analysis planning and monitoring - 5%\nElicitation and collaboration - 20%\nRequirements life cycle management - 20%\nRequirements analysis and design definition - 25%\n\nOther things carry small weightage & you would be able to answer them as well if you understand the above question set well.

This has allowed great versatility when it comes to choosing an integration platform.\nWith this growth that Mulesoft has had, the developer certifications have also changed, where before we only had MuleSoft Certified Developer - Level 1, now we have MuleSoft Certified Developer - Level 2. This set of questions will allow you to practice and prepare for this certification and the explanations for each question will allow you to advance in your professional development and obtain the certification of developer level 2. Each question has been a compilation of the topics that are taught for the Certification such as Anypoint Platform Delopement: Production-Ready Development course oriented to use the best practices of Mule applications for production and how to be used in a DevOps environment and Anypoint Platform Delopement: Production-Ready Integrations, course more oriented to apply essential integration patterns to meet the challenges of production of distributed communication.\nI recommend that you sign up for this set of questions that will enable you to obtain this certification.",

The exam tests your foundational knowledge, focusing on \"What\" the platform does, not \"How\" it's done. It took 3 months to prepare these 6 practice tests with 600 questions.\n\n\nWhy it is Not Timed as a real exam scenario of 60 minutes - The tests aren't timed like the real exam because that's not the goal. If you truly know the content, you don’t need to manage time - you’ll spot the answer and move on, no stress.\nThe actual exam gives 40-60 questions. I got 45. Friends got 34 and 55. These practice tests are 120 minutes long so you can cover 100 questions calmly and thoroughly. This course will prepare you to walk in confidently, knowing you’ve seen 600 solid questions and nothing will surprise you.\n\n\nWhy I included thorough topic coverage: I ensured thorough topic coverage after initially missing areas like Dataverse, MS Dynamics 365, Business Process flows,  and the Admin Center. Every key concept and keyword is included to avoid gaps.\n\n\nWhy did I choose 600 questions: I designed this course to offer maximum value with 600+ unique questions covering all key topics. With detailed explanations and a mix of easy to hard questions, it's ideal for all skill levels and aimed at helping you pass the PL-900 on your first try.\n\n\nWhy A variety of questions: During my exam, I got a significant portion of the questions mostly scenario-based. I tried different types of questions to mirror the actual PL-900 exam to cater to both audiences.\nDefinitions- Knowledge Check Questions\nMultiple Choice Questions / Multiple Selection Questions\nTrue or False Questions / Fill in the blanks Questions\nScenario-based Questions / Matching Questions\n\n\nWhy every application: To provide you with comprehensive preparation, I strategically designed this test to maintain a consistent question distribution so that anyone can benefit from a well-rounded understanding of each application.\nDescribe the business value of Microsoft Power Platform (15–20%)\nManage the Microsoft Power Platform environment (15–20%)\nDemonstrate the capabilities of Power Apps (25–30%)\nDemonstrate the capabilities of Power Automate (15–20%)\nDemonstrate the capabilities of Power Pages (10–15%)\n\n\nWhy detailed answer explanations: I don't just provide answers; I ensure you understand them. Each answer comes with an explanation of why it's correct and why others are wrong. You can also find\nStudy Links: Direct Links from Pl-900 Learning Path to help go through again.\nClear comparisons in table format wherever applicable for ease of understanding\nScreenshots and Images (Visuals) to save you from the hassle of searching\nExam Tips - To help you know the secret sauce to pass and aid in your preparation",

Starting with an introduction to risk and compliance concepts in ServiceNow, learners will gain an understanding of the platform’s dedicated applications, their purpose, and the key roles and responsibilities involved in managing them.\nThe course then builds upon ServiceNow platform fundamentals, exploring how core capabilities such as tables, forms, navigation, and relationships between policy, risk, and compliance modules create the backbone for effective governance and oversight.\nA major focus is placed on Policy and Compliance Management, where learners will gain hands-on knowledge in defining and managing policies, standards, and controls. Emphasis is given to real-world practices such as gathering compliance evidence, performing attestations, conducting continuous monitoring, and executing control testing to ensure adherence to regulatory and organizational requirements.\nThe Risk Management component explores how risks are identified, assessed, scored, and prioritized using different methodologies, while also covering risk response strategies, mitigation planning, and ongoing monitoring throughout the risk lifecycle.\nThe course further expands into Audit Management, offering learners insights into planning, scoping, and executing audit engagements, as well as managing findings, issues, and remediation efforts. It highlights how ServiceNow helps organizations streamline audit processes while maintaining transparency and accountability.\nIn addition, learners will explore how ServiceNow integrates risk and compliance efforts with operational activities, vendor risk management, and other business objectives. The use of indicators, metrics, and dashboards is also covered to help participants track performance and generate meaningful insights for stakeholders.\nAdvanced capabilities are introduced to showcase the power of automation, performance analytics, and GRC Workbench for more effective implementation and management. Learners will gain practical skills in automating workflows, leveraging reporting tools, and applying best practices to maintain a robust risk and compliance environment within ServiceNow.\nBy the end of this course, participants will have the skills to design, implement, and sustain ServiceNow-based risk and compliance programs that align with organizational goals, regulatory standards, and industry best practices.\nThank you",

It was made with the right amount of questions for you to study, practice and feel comfortable to give the official on your first and only try.\n\n\nIn this exam pack you will practice how to pass the Scaled Professional Scrum official certification exam. I think the questions were written in the same fashion Scrum-org does and with the same difficulty level (Advanced).\n\n\nI recommend doing over and over these exams until you feel comfortable passing them with over 90%. That´s the moment you should be able to use you official attempt and pass that exam once and for all! Keep in mind this level fully addresses the complete understanding of the Nexus Scrum Guide.\n\n\nPlease don´t hesitate to reach out and ask as many questions as you need. I´m here to make sure you are in the best position to give the official exam a try.  The way to pass the SPS exam is by carefully reading and understanding the Nexus Scrum Guide and by doing practice exams, one after the previous one.\n\n\nThank you very much for coming in. You won´t be dissatisfied. This set of exams have been created by me personally. No AI, no robots. Its a Professional Scrum Master experienced from PSM I to PSM II to SPS and growing, passing it on to you. That´s all.\n\n\nTAMBIÉN HABLO ESPAÑOL!\n\n\n- DESCARGO DE RESPONSABILIDAD -\n\n\nESTO NO ES OFICIAL\n\n\nEste no es un paquete de examen de 1.000 preguntas. Se hizo con la cantidad adecuada de preguntas para que estudies, practiques y te sientas cómodo/a para dar el oficial en tu primer y único intento.\n\n\nEn este paquete de exámenes practicarás cómo aprobar el examen oficial de certificación SPS. Creo que las preguntas fueron escritas de la misma manera que Scrum-org y con el mismo nivel de dificultad (Avanzado).\n\n\nRecomiendo hacer estos exámenes una y otra vez hasta que te sientas cómodo/a aprobándolos con más del 90%. ¡Ese es el momento en el que deberías poder usar tu intento oficial y aprobar ese examen de una vez por todas! Ten en cuenta que éste nivel de dificultad aborda el completo entendimiento de la Guia Nexus de Scrum.\n\n\nPor favor, no dudes en comunicarse y hacer todas las preguntas que necesites. Estoy aquí para asegurarme de que estés en la mejor posición para probar el examen oficial. La forma de aprobar el examen SPS es leyendo detenidamente y comprendiendo la Guia Nexus y realizando exámenes de práctica, uno después del anterior.\n\n\nMuchas gracias por estas aquí. No quedarás insatisfecho/a. Este conjunto de exámenes ha sido creado por mí personalmente. Sin IA, sin robots.

One of the OSPF complex topics or puzzles for CCNA students is the LSA (or Link State Advertisements) Types. So what are those types? And how does each one of them differ from the other ? How are they generated? Which ones are restricted into the area and which ones pass through the area order? How does the OSPF cost be calculated based on the LSA types? How can we understand all of these things using show commands? How can you redistribute from OSPF to EIGRP and vice versa? What is the default metric when redistributing into OSPF and how to change it? What are the two types of OSPF redistribution metric and what is the difference between them? When should each type used? How does EIGRP Auto summarization work and how to disable it? Will classless networks be redistributed into OSPF by default? Why is the subnet keyword used when redistributing into OSPF?\nIn this course I will answer all these questions about LSA (or Link State Advertisements) Types. In addition, we will see how to set the OSPF redistribution metric & type, and how to understand the EIGRP Auto summarization and the subnet keyword.

CompTIA CySA+ applies behavioral analytics to networks to improve the overall state of security through identifying and combating malware and advanced persistent threats (APTs), resulting in an enhanced threat visibility across a broad attack surface. It will validate an IT professional’s ability to proactively defend and continuously improve the security of an organization. CySA+ will verify the successful candidate has the knowledge and skills required to:\nLeverage intelligence and threat detection techniques\nAnalyze and interpret data\nIdentify and address vulnerabilities\nSuggest preventative measures\nEffectively respond to and recover from incidents\nCompTIA CySA+ meets the ISO 17024 standard and is approved by U.S. Department of Defense to fulfill Directive 8570.01-M requirements. It is compliant with government regulations under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). Regulators and government rely on ANSI accreditation because it provides confidence and trust in the outputs of an accredited program. Over 2.3 million CompTIA ISO/ANSI-accredited exams have been delivered since January 1, 2011.\nCompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) is an IT workforce certification that applies behavioral analytics to networks and devices to prevent, detect and combat cybersecurity threats through continuous security monitoring.\n\n\nDomain 1: Threat and Vulnerability Management\nUtilize and apply proactive threat intelligence to support organizational security and perform vulnerability management activities.\nDomain 2: Software and Systems Security\nApply security solutions for infrastructure management and explain software & hardware assurance best practices.\nDomain 3: Security Operations and Monitoring\nAnalyze data as part of continuous security monitoring activities and implement configuration changes to existing controls to improve security.\nDomain 4: Incident Response\nApply the appropriate incident response procedure, analyze potential indicators of compromise, and utilize basic digital forensics techniques\nDomain 5: Compliance and Assessment\nApply security concepts in support of organizational risk mitigation and understand the importance of frameworks, policies, procedures, and controls",

This course accentuates this often-overlooked aspect, empowering you to optimize software performance from multiple dimensions.\nWhat Are Non-Functional Requirements?\nNFRs are the system's backbone, defining attributes like security, scalability, performance, and usability. They serve as design constraints, guiding system architects and business analysts in molding a product that doesn't just function, but excels.\nFor instance, consider a system displaying the number of database records - that's a functional requirement. But how up-to-date that number is? That's a non-functional requirement. Such nuances can significantly impact user experience and overall system efficiency.\nClearing Common Misconceptions:\nIt's a prevalent notion to label NFRs as merely the \"quality attributes\" of a system. However, it's essential to distinguish between the two. While quality attributes are vital for a system's performance, NFRs are the criteria to evaluate this performance. One dictates the standard, the other ensures it's met.\nCourse Highlights:\nFresh off the press, this course addresses the nuances of Non-Functional Requirements in Business Analysis—a domain often overshadowed but undeniably vital.\nEquip yourself with knowledge that's technology agnostic, making you an invaluable asset irrespective of specific software tools, frameworks, or cloud solutions.\nDive in and ensure you never miss out on these critical components while building systems. Elevate your projects, products, and professional standing with this comprehensive guide.",

More specifically, it is intended for those who are trying to get a helping hand into their journey of trying to get to be an Okta Certified Consultant.\n\n\n*ATTENTION*\n1. Please understand this is not an official Okta course, everything you are going to see is designed by myself so my own point of view, but nonetheless a point of view based on the official Okta Consultant Certification Exam Study Guide / public KB articles. In any case, it will NOT grant you the Okta Consultant Certificate, the same as it will NOT provide you with the entire knowledge / answers needed for passing the actual Okta Certified Consultant exam. You are the only one who knows if you are truly ready to take on such an official exam and when.\n2. Those questions you are going to see in the course, questions to which you have to find the correct answer(s), might have just one single correct answer or multiple correct answers, while Okta's official Certification exams have a DOMC (Discrete Option Multiple Choice) structure (not supported by Udemy at the moment).\n3. Each question in the course has at least 3 choices from which you can pick. There isn't a single question providing only two potential answers.\n4. This course is based not only on the direct links' content Okta provides in the Okta Consultant Certification Exam Study Guide, but also on their nested links (with an infinite depth), as that's the only way in which someone can truly grasp the knowledge, by trying to check the extensions as well, which is where fine details reside at times.\n5. Pay attention that these questions might even be harder then the actual ones you'll find in the official Okta Consultant Certification Exam, the same of some of them might feel much easier then what you'll meet in the official examination provided by Okta. This is simply a matter of perspective and level of knowledge. I added a timer of 120 mins and a threshold of 70% for passing this one, as mere guidance.\n\n\nYou'll get to see:\nA total of 105 questions with related answers (single / multiple choice as correct answer(s)), out of which:\n100 - are uniquely designed for this course\n5 - are shared between this course and the 'Okta Certified Developer Knowledge Base Test' course on Udemy\n\n\n! Once again, the present course is designed to greatly help you towards achieving the goal of passing the Okta Consultant Certification Exam, but cannot guarantee that, as this course is NOT provided by Okta officials, hence it does not represent a standard in passing the Okta Consultant Certification Exam or gathering the entirety of the knowledge needed for passing it with success.\n\nHaving said the above, wish you good luck!\n\n\n\n\nWith respect,\nSilviu Muraru",

Each candidate gets a unique set of questions, with 10-25% variation across exams, so it’s important to focus on understanding concepts, not just memorizing answers.\nUnderstand the Concepts, Don’t Memorize: The exam tests your understanding of SAP System Administration principles, not your ability to memorize facts. By focusing on concepts, you’ll be able to tackle any question, even if it’s unfamiliar.\nPractice Multiple-Choice Questions: Since SAP certification exams are mostly multiple-choice, it’s crucial to practice this type of question. Our practice exams will help you get comfortable with this format.\nCarefully Read the Answer Choices: Some options can be tricky, so read all the answer choices thoroughly before selecting your response.\nWatch Out for Three-Answer Questions: These are often the most challenging. Missing one answer can cost you the entire question. Answer these carefully, and leave them for last if necessary.\nUtilize SAP Learning Hub: Take advantage of assessment tests available in SAP Learning Hub to solidify your understanding and highlight areas that need more focus.\nBe Prepared for Trick Questions: Some questions are designed to test deep understanding, especially multiple-choice questions. Make sure you have a solid grasp of SAP’s system administration modules.\nPrioritize One-Answer Questions First: These are easier to score on. Answer them before tackling the more complex multi-answer questions.\nTrue/False Questions Are Rare: Most questions will require more than a simple true/false response, so prepare accordingly.\nRely on the Right Study Materials: Use the official SAP materials and course books as your primary study resource. These will guide you in the right direction.\nStay Calm During the Exam: The exam process is straightforward. Don’t let the proctor make you nervous. Once the exam starts, you’ll only hear from them at the beginning and end.\nUse Multi-Select Clues: Multi-select questions often indicate how many correct answers there are. Use this information to exclude incorrect options and narrow down your choices.\nRetake Practice Tests Regularly: Keep practicing until you consistently score 90% or higher. This is a strong indicator that you’re ready for the actual exam.\nLearn from Feedback: Whether you pass or fail, review the areas you did well in and those that need improvement. If you fail, use this feedback to prepare for the next attempt.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not affiliated with SAP. Our practice exams are designed to aid in your preparation and understanding, but they do not guarantee specific questions on your exam.\nWhen you follow these tips and leverage the comprehensive resources, you significantly increase your chances of passing the certification exam. I'm confident in our content and support your journey to certification success. With well-structured SAP C_C4H47_2503 - Certified SAP Sales Cloud Version 2 practice exams and expert tips, you’ll be prepared to tackle the exam confidently and efficiently. Good luck with your certification journey!",

As someone who achieved a 100% score in January, I created this course to help you follow the same success path.\nMy questions are the highest quality - no typos, grammar mistakes, every answer is correct, and incorrect is explained! I make regular quality checks!\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWhat You'll Get:\n6 Full-Length Practice Exams — Mimic the real exam structure\nTotal 310 Comprehensive Questions +  new questions coming over!\nIn-Depth Explanations for Every Answer — Learn as you practice\nPerformance Insights — Identify and target weak areas\n30-DAY MONEY-REFUND in case you don't like the class\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEXAM REVIEWS:\n\n5/5 stars - Santiago\nVery useful practice tests that not only resemble the exam, but also day-to-day commands and concepts. This is an excellent preparation for the real exam.\nAdam - 5/5 stars\nThe question set is really useful—no pointless stuff, just solid prep for the certification. If you want to go in confident, this is definitely worth going through.\n\nPawel - 5/5 stars\nGreat content, I passed my exam today!! These practice exams have helped me a lot, especially the explanations for the answers!\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEXAMPLE QUESTION + SOLUTION:\n\n\nYou work as a DevOps engineer, and you need to monitor the memory usage on your server using the free command.\nWhat would you do to check the memory usage every 5 seconds?\nA)  watch -n 5 free\nB)  watch -n 5 ps aux\nC) watch free -n 5\nD)  free -n 5\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation: The watch command allows you to repeat a command at regular intervals, and the -n option specifies the interval in seconds. The correct syntax is watch -n 5 free, which runs the free command every 5 seconds to show memory usage.\nB is incorrect because  the command \"watch -n 5 ps aux\" will continuously run the \"ps aux\" command every 5 seconds, which displays a snapshot of the current processes running on the system, not the memory usage. This choice does not provide the correct information for monitoring memory usage.\n\nC is incorrect  because the command \"watch free -n 5\" is not the correct syntax for using the \"watch\" command to monitor memory usage. The correct order should be \"watch -n 5 \", where \"\" is the command to be executed at the specified interval.\n\n\nD is incorrect because  the command \"free -n 5\" is not the correct syntax for continuously monitoring memory usage at regular intervals. The \"free\" command alone displays memory usage information once, and it does not have an option to run continuously every 5 seconds.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nWhy LPIC-1?\nThe LPIC-1 certification is the beginner-level Linux certification in the full certification path of the Linux Professional Certification program.

I am a CI / CD / CT DevOps Engineer working daily in the Gitlab platform and I have carefully designed this course for you to get to know the aspects of Gitlab in a simple and pleasant manner.\nCourse is intended for anyone out there working with Gitlab or simply interested in this field. More specifically, it is intended for those who are trying to get a helping hand into their journey of aiming to be a Gitlab Certified Associate.\n\n\n*ATTENTION*\n1. I made this course directly with Gitlab's allowance for me to create it. I talked to them directly about creating this one.\n2. Please understand this is not an official Gitlab course, as they don't have one yet on this Udemy platform.\n3. Completing this course will NOT grant you the Gitlab Certified Associate Certificate, the same as it will NOT provide you 100% with the entire knowledge / answers needed for passing the actual exam out of a very simple reason: Gitlab specifically stated the official questions / answers are under copyright. You are the only one who knows if you are truly ready to take on such an official exam and when.\n4. Those questions you are going to see in the course, questions to which you have to find the correct answer(s), might have just one single correct answer or multiple correct answers.\n5. Each question in the course has a multi-choice / multi-select schema (radio buttons / checkboxes).\n6. Pay attention that these questions might even be harder then the actual ones you'll find in the official Gitlab Certified Associate Exam, the same of some of them might feel much easier than what you'll meet in the official examination provided by Gitlab. This is simply a matter of perspective and level of knowledge. I added a timer of 120 mins and a threshold of 70% for passing this one, as mere guidance.\n7. THIS IS NOT A COURSE / QUIZ / PRACTICE EXAMINATION THAT CAN BE SEEN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GITLAB'S OFFICIAL PRACTICE EXAMS. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT A STEP TOWARDS GAINING / PROVING KNOWLEDGE ON THE GITLAB TOPIC.\n\nYou'll get to see:\n- A total of 110 questions with related answers (provided at the end)\n\nHaving said the above, wish you good luck!\n\n\nWith respect,\nSilviu Muraru",

Let’s embark on this journey together!\n\n\nSample Question and detailed Explanation for each option with reference links.\n\n\nQuestion: You need to create a custom VPC with a single subnet. The subnet’s range must be as large as possible. Which range should you use?\n\nOption 1: 0.0.0.0/0\nOption 2: 10.0.0.0/8\nOption 3: 172.16.0.0/12\nOption 4: 192.168.0.0/16\n\nWhen creating a custom VPC with a single subnet and you need the subnet's range to be as large as possible, you should use the range that provides the most IP addresses.\n\n\n**Correct Option:**\n10.0.0.0/8\n\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe 10.0.0.0/8 IP address range is a Class A address space which allows for 16,777,216 IP addresses (2^24 - 2, accounting for the network and broadcast addresses). This is the largest private IP address range available and is typically used for large networks within organizations.\n\n\nFor further reading on VPCs and IP ranges, you can refer to the official documentation: **Weblink is not shared here due to Udemy Guidelines but it's available in questions explanations. **\n\n\n**Incorrect Options:**\n0.0.0.0/0\n\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis range is not valid for a private network. It represents all IP addresses in the IPv4 address space and is generally used as a default route to match any IP address.\n\n\n172.16.0.0/12\n\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis range allows for 1,048,576 IP addresses (2^20 - 2). While this is a large range, it is not as large as the 10.0.0.0/8 range.\n\n\n192.168.0.0/16\n\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis range allows for 65,536 IP addresses (2^16 - 2). It is commonly used for smaller networks, such as home networks, and is significantly smaller than the 10.0.0.0/8 range.\n\n\nIn summary, to create a custom VPC with a subnet range that is as large as possible, you should use the 10.0.0.0/8 range. This provides the largest number of private IP addresses.",

This course features over 140 high-quality and diverse questions, with new questions being added regularly, ensuring your preparation evolves with the exam's updates.\nReflecting the exam's five domains and culminating in a comprehensive final test that simulates the real-world exam experience, this course offers an unmatched preparation advantage. Every answer comes with an in-depth explanation that not only highlights the correct choices but also deepens your grasp of the material for thorough mastery.\nThis course is the first to introduce the new question styles, including Ordering, Matching, and Case Study, ensuring you're fully prepared for the updated exam format. Constructed to align with the official exam guide and AWS's sample questions, the practice exams provide relevant and current preparation.\nLearners will explore detailed explanations for each option, comprehending the correct answers and the reasons why other options fall short. This method, bolstered by direct AWS documentation references, provides a profound and durable understanding of the subject matter.\nDesigned to close the gap between knowledge and application, this course empowers you to approach the certification with confidence and secure a credential that opens new professional doors.\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION\nAn AI Engineer is working in the Bedrock Chat Playground to fine-tune a model's responses to ensure high coherence and focus in customer support interactions.\nWhich inference parameter should they primarily adjust to effectively limit the diversity of potential responses, ensuring a more focused and predictable output?\nA) Top K\nB) Length\nC) Temperature\nD) Top P\n\n\nNow take a guess. The correct answer is... [SCROLL DOWN]\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nA) Top K (Correct)\n--> Top K specifically limits the model to considering only the k most probable next words for generating responses. This sharply restricts the pool from which the model can draw, ensuring responses are not only predictable but also closely aligned with the most likely and relevant outputs.\nThis precision is particularly useful in customer support, where clarity and directness are key.\n\n\nB) Length (Incorrect)\n--> Adjusting the length parameter primarily controls the maximum output size of the model's responses but does not directly influence the diversity or specificity of the words used, making it less effective for ensuring coherence in individual responses.\n\n\nC) Temperature (Incorrect)\n--> Temperature affects the randomness of the model’s responses. Lowering it might reduce variability but does not specifically constrain the model to a narrow set of probable words as effectively as top K for ensuring focused responses.\n\n\nD) Top P (Incorrect)\n--> Top P adjusts the cumulative probability threshold for choosing words, which allows for a broader selection of responses based on their cumulative probability.\nWhile it can also control diversity, Top P generally permits a wider range of responses than Top K, making it less ideal for situations where extremely focused and limited responses are necessary.\n\n\nReference:\nAmazon Bedrock Inference Parameters\nNote: There will be links in the actual practice exams in the reference section.",

      "description": "Are you Getting ready for CLF-C01, the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification Exam?  Then you have come to the right place. These practice tests are designed to help you Ace the certification exam.\nThese practice tests have been authored by Abhishek Kumar who has 11 years of experience in the Software Industry and is currently working as an AWS infrastructure consultant in a multinational company. He is AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate and AWS Certified Security Specialist.\nThe questions are of the same level and complexity as in the real AWS certification exam. All the questions have a detailed explanation of the correct and incorrect options. If an answer is correct, an exhaustive explanation is provided along with a diagram. If an option is incorrect, a detailed explanation is provided so that you have a clear understanding of the underlying subject.\nThis course is designed in such a way that you will not need any other further reading material or practice tests to clear the exam. This course extensively covers all the topics of the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification (CLF-C01) Exam.\n\nSample Question:\nA company is planning to run a global marketing application in the AWS Cloud. The application will feature videos that can be viewed by users. The company must ensure that all users can view these videos with low latency.\nWhich AWS service should the company use to meet this requirement?\n\nAWS Auto Scaling\nAmazon Kinesis Video Streams\nElastic Load Balancing\nAmazon CloudFront\n\n\nExplanation:\nOption A is Incorrect:\nAWS Auto Scaling is a service that helps automatically adjust the number of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in response to changing demand. While it can help ensure that the application is always running and can handle a varying number of users, it does not directly improve the delivery of videos.\n\nOption B is Incorrect:\nAmazon Kinesis Video Streams is a service for securely streaming video from connected devices to AWS for processing and storage. While it can help with the storage and processing of video data, it does not directly improve the delivery of videos to end users.\n\nOption C is Incorrect:\nElastic Load Balancing is a service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. While it can help distribute traffic and ensure the high availability of the application, it does not directly improve the delivery of videos.\n\nOption D is Correct:\nAmazon CloudFront would be the best AWS service for the company to use to meet its requirement of ensuring low-latency video viewing by users globally.\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of static and dynamic web content, including videos, to users. It operates at the edge of the AWS network, placing content closer to users, reducing latency, and improving the performance of applications. With CloudFront, users can access videos quickly and with minimal lag, even if they are located in different parts of the world.\n\nGood luck with your AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam and happy learning !!",

This will enable you to understand the contents of the body of knowledge much more quickly than if you simply start reading it on your own.\nIt is not an easy document to read, nor does it cover all of the items that should be presented in a study guide. Furthermore, there are relationships between the domains, and there are some somewhat ambiguous items that require clarification.\nThe CIPM Body of Knowledge consists of six domains, each with a series of competencies (subdomains), and each subdomain contains performance indicators.\nThe domains reflect what the privacy professional should know.\nThe competencies (subdomains) are clusters of connected tasks and abilities that constitute broad knowledge.\nThe performance indicators are discrete tasks and abilities.\nExam questions assess a privacy professional’s proficiency on the performance indicators.\nLet us prepare together for the IAPP CIPT exam and move forward confidently towards your certification.",

      "description": "DevOps is a revolutionary way to release software efficiently besides maintaining a high level of security. Source control (version control) is a critical part of DevOps.\nIn this course you'll learn the foundation of source control using Git, working with pull requests, branching strategies, and standard workflow with commit, push, pull, clone, and more.\nIrrespective of the software project size, using version control could be a proven best practice. Two kinds of version control are supported by Azure Repos: Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC). This course will teach you all aspects of working with Git and the foundations of source control and the differences between distributed and centralized source control.\n\n\nVersion control systems are software that help you track changes you make in your code over time. As you edit your code, you tell the version control system to take a snapshot of your files. The version control system saves that snapshot permanently so you can recall it later if you need it. Use version control to save your work and coordinate code changes across your team. Even if you are just a single developer, version control helps you stay organized as you fix bugs and develop new features. Version control keeps a history of your development so that you can review and even rollback to any version of your code with ease\nBenefits of Source Control\nCreate workflows\nWork with versions\nCollaboration between developers\nMaintains history of changes\nAutomate tasks\n\n\nWhat is Git\nGit is the most commonly used version control system, a tool to manage your source code history. It is quickly becoming the standard for version control.\nGit is a distributed version control system, meaning that your local copy of code is a complete version control repository. These fully functional local repositories make it is easy to work offline or remotely. You commit your work locally, and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on the server.\nYou can use the clients and tools of your choice, such as Git for Windows, Mac, partners' Git services, and tools such as Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code",

It's a free, open-source platform that allows users to create, customize, and manage their websites without needing to know how to code. With its user-friendly interface, extensive plugin library, and customizable themes, WordPress is a flexible and powerful tool for creating websites of all kinds, from personal blogs to e-commerce stores and corporate websites. It's also highly scalable and can be used by individuals, small businesses, and large organizations alike. Additionally, the WordPress community is vibrant and supportive, providing resources and support for users at all levels of expertise.\n\n\nWordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) that allows users to create and manage websites. However, there are two versions of WordPress: WordPress org and WordPress com. Here are the key differences between the two:\nHosting: WordPress org is a self-hosted platform, which means that you need to find and pay for your own hosting provider to host your website. WordPress dot com, on the other hand, is a hosted platform, which means that your website is hosted by WordPress dot com.\nCustomization: WordPress allows you to customize your website using plugins and themes. You have full control over your website's code and can customize it to your liking. WordPress dot com, on the other hand, has limited customization options, and you cannot install custom themes or plugins.\nCost: WordPress dot org is a free and open-source platform, but you need to pay for hosting and domain registration. WordPress dot com, on the other hand, offers both free and paid plans, depending on your needs.\nMaintenance: With WordPress dot org, you are responsible for maintaining your website, which includes updating the WordPress core, themes, and plugins. WordPress dot com takes care of the maintenance and updates for you.\nMonetization: WordPress dot org allows you to monetize your website in any way you like, including selling products, displaying ads, and accepting donations. WordPress dot com has restrictions on monetization, and you cannot display ads on your website unless you upgrade to a paid plan.\nIn summary, WordPress dot org is a self-hosted platform that offers full control and customization options, while WordPress dot com is a hosted platform that offers limited customization options but takes care of the maintenance and updates for you. The choice between the two depends on your needs and preferences.",

And since you have six certification attempts, why not invest one in a high-value credential that adds prestige to your profile?\nFeel free to share this course with your network so others can benefit from your referral.\n\n\nWishing you great success on your SAP certification journey!\n\n\nExam Topic Areas\nThe certification exam may cover the following key areas.

The exam consists of 100 questions and is 90 minutes long for the Standard English version and 110 minutes long for the ESL (English as a Second Language) version.\nDG Activities - 15\nDG Best practice - 11\nDG Definitions - 16\nDG Program - 4\nDG Ethics - 5\nDG Goals - 8\nDG Maturity Assessment - 8\nDG Organisation Roles and Responsibilities - 15\nDG Relationship with other Disciplines - 11\nDG Standards - 8\nIt is better to start with the Associate level questions, as many appeared in the Data Management Fundamentals exam.\nOn your first attempt, try to answer everything without looking at your notes or the textbook to identify the areas which need more focus.  In the exam, it is best to guess where you don't know, mark the question number and then go back to look up the answer on the second pass.  This is the best use of your time.  Make sure you have answered all the questions.\nWhen reading the questions, try to identify the concept being examined.  This helps to eliminate the wrong distractors and identify the right answer.",

      "description": "Updated: January 2022\nJune 2022 - New course image, same great practice test.\nThese practice tests have been available for over a year on another platform. They are very helpful to many, so I decided to bring them to Udemy to expand the audience in helping others with their certification journey.\nI won't describe my practice tests as complete due to the dynamic nature of exams. I have multiple certifications, including Palo Alto Networks PCNSE, ITIL, AWS, and multiple Cisco certifications, so I know that an exam will pull from a large pool of questions, so you need to be prepared. An abundant amount of practice questions improves preparation for the exam, in addition to real-world experience.\nThese practice test questions are based on the official video training, study guide, and real-world experience. There are multiple-choice, multiple-selection, and true/false questions. Many questions have custom graphics, screenshots, and links to supporting resources.\nThese questions are based on PAN-OS versions 9 and 10 (August 2021 Study Guide and training).\nThis practice test course is the first of two available. Both practice test courses contain similar but unique questions and complement each other. The second practice test course contains many scenarios and troubleshooting questions, more than this practice test course. I will add questions to both courses as Palo Alto Networks updates their material, feedback, and my real-world experience.\nThe Palo Alto Networks PCNSE (Palo Alto Networks Certified Network Security Engineer) certification validates the knowledge and skills required to design, deploy, operate, manage, and troubleshoot Palo Alto Networks Firewalls. PCNSE-certified individuals have demonstrated in-depth knowledge of the Palo Alto Networks product portfolio and can make full use of it in the vast majority of implementations.\nI could not find quality and reputable practice tests for the PCCSA or PCNSE. As an alternative to creating flat notes to read through and memorize during my PCCSA and eventually PCNSE study, I decided to make them in a testing format. They have proven more valuable than just highlighting study guide pages or typed flat notes in Word or Notepad.\nThese practice tests are not brain dumps, but my notes are organized into a test format. They are designed to supplement training as outlined on the Palo Alto Networks certification page.\nI hope they help you as they have many others as well as myself.\nGood luck with your studies and the exam.\nJeff",
