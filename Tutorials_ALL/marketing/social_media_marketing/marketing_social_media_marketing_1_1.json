It's getting a lot of hype, and with good reason. It is possible to start with zero followers on TikTok and, within a few days or even a few hours, generate thousands or even tens of thousands of views for your videos. That is why marketers are now flocking to TikTok and why you should too.\nTikTok is completely unlike any other social media platform. What works on YouTube, Facebook and LinkedIn does not work on TikTok. You must learn what is unique to the TikTok platform and how to engage audiences there.\nIf you are a large or small business, an author, an expert, or an entertainer, then you need to be posting regular content on TikTok and marketing your brand to this worldwide audience.\nTikTok now has more than 1.5 billion downloads of its app and more than half a billion regular monthly users. It is huge!\nYou may have heard that TikTok has a lot of teenagers and pre-teens. This is true, but with more than half a billion regular monthly users, TikTok now has members from every age group and every demographic. Many of your customers, clients, and prospects are already on TikTok.\nFacebook, Instagram, Linked and YouTube all have strengths that marketers can leverage. But these are mature platforms that are all increasingly expensive to market on, even to your followers. TikTok is the Wild West. Now is THE time for you and your brand to stake your claim by getting serious about TikTok marketing.\nThe instructors for this course are not academic theoreticians. They are practitioners who produce and post new videos daily on TikTok.

      "description": "Social media design is visual content used in digital marketing. Whether it's your Facebook profile, Twitter background, Google+ header or graphics for timeline posts and blogs, social media design is an important element to incorporate. Consumers respond best to a first impression that includes a visually appealing attention-grabbing graphic image. When graphics are used consistently across your different social media platforms it creates brand recognition. Also, many people are visual learners, so they are likely to remember your brand better when they see it visually, instead of hearing or reading about it.\nThe main goal of social media design is to promote and increase engagement. Good design will produce content that compels users to engage, whether by commenting, sharing, or otherwise. It’s also important that social media design be on-brand and make sense for the account — for instance, a meme of a puppy rolling down a hill might get a lot of engagement, but it would not be good social media design for a high-fashion company, because it isn’t on-brand.\nIf you are handling the social media for a large company or brand or multiple sub brands, or are trying to establish a small new brand, it’s probably smart to think about social media design. Social media design helps you think big-picture about social media goals and create a strategy and cohesive visual language moving forward to establish your brand identity and grow your following.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn to design social media creatives using Canva. You will learn to design\nFacebook posts\nInstagram posts\nBlog posts\nThis course will teach you how simple it is to design brand promotion post which will help brand to reach their target customer and attract them towards their business.",

Or maybe you’ve been stuck with instructors that TELL you what to do but have no idea what it takes to really accomplish what they’re teaching?\n\nIn this course, we don’t just TALK the TALK. We will actually DO what we are teaching.\n\n\nFollow along as we take an account from complete scratch to 47,000 followers.\n\n\nUPDATE: The account currently has 141,000 followers!\n\n\nWe start from the absolute beginning with conceptualizing the account, and we end with a well-defined content strategy, over 700 posts, and have even started to generate revenue with our account.\n\n\n@innovationstation < check it out\n\nNo fake followers, no boosted posts, & no cheating. 47,000 REAL followers with an average engagement rate over 7%. Our account is growing by over 300+ followers a day, using the strategies taught in this course.\n\n\n---\n\n\nBeware other Instagram courses are outdated, shallow, and taught by instructors who have never grown an account themselves.\n\n\nOutdated: Instagram changes its system, its features, and its algorithm at least 3 times a year. That means if your instructor filmed their course in 2015, they’ve missed at least 9 different cycles! Their advice is not only out-dated, but it’s also worthless.\n\n\nShallow: Instagram is a huge opportunity and a very complicated product. Anyone who tells you that you can “master Instagram” in 4 hours simply is not telling the truth. It’s not enough to just SHOW you how to add a hashtag. You have to understand how they work, how to track them, and how you can apply a comprehensive strategy to your posts to stay ahead of the game.\n\n\nYour Instructor:\nEvan Kimbrell is in the top 1% of Udemy instructors with over 30 courses on Entrepreneurship & Marketing.

      "description": "Other courses online just regurgitate information ABOUT marketing they saw in videos online. They are also super outdated! This is a course for 2020 and beyond.\nNone of the creators are even artists like us who have tried the marketing themselves. This is the ONLY SoundCloud Marketing course with documented proof of how it was done step by step, day by day. It is also the only course that shows such quick results.\nI started a brand new Soundcloud from absolute scratch and show you how I grow it with only 1 song on the profile. As I show you with proof, these are REAL followers and you can watch the results I get everyday utilizing strategies and tools 99% of artists aren't using.\nYou want an edge? I give you the edge!\nI am the only music artist (just like you) who is taking what I learn, as I learn it to help upcoming artists.\nI study, I test, I try, I learn, then teach.\nOVER 10,000 MUSIC ARTISTS HAVE TAKEN MY COURSES.

I have the best tools and strategies that you will need to build your fan base and promote your music on SoundCloud.\n\nIf you are serious about getting your music heard through Soundcloud promotion then you need to leverage the tools, strategies and tricks of the music marketing power of Soundcloud.\nLots of music artists, bands and rappers are struggling because they can't figure out how to get people to listen to their music. Even if they get people to listen, they cant figure out why the listeners don't follow them.\nAs a successful music artist myself I have been in your shows and I felt your pain for over 5 years in my music marketing efforts before I finally started gaining a hardcore fan base.\nIn this course I walk you through a complete music marketing plan that will help you grow your fan base in 14 days. Then you can consistently keep repeating the same process.\n\n\nHere’s why I recommend Soundcloud to reach your audience:\nIt is stupid easy to learn and use for music artists\nYou can easily target, find and convert new fans of your music (when I show you how)\nSoundcloud listeners are known for being more open to consuming new music because of how the platform operates and the primary demographic of the music consuming daily active user base.\n\n\nA Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips\nThe fans you will get naturally are people who are interested into your music style. At the end of the course you will be able to grow your fan base and get new buyers from Soundcloud.\nSuitable for beginning music marketers and more advance users, the course will take between one and two hours to complete. The course is based on 20 lectures covering Soundcloud for music marketing.\nWith these basics mastered, the course will take you through fan collection to music promotion strategies.\nStudents completing the course will have the knowledge to grow their fan base with high targeted fans and promote music online via Soundcloud.\nComplete with working files and swipe files, you’ll be able to work alongside the author and ask any questions you may have.\n\n\n+++No bots needed for this course - I have more advanced courses for that+++\nMONEY BACK GUARANTEE\nIf you follow the exact things you can watch me do day by day in this course, I would be absolutely baffled and confused as to how you don't see similar results. In the first 7 days alone I would expect you to make an enormous return on your investment in taking this course today. With tat being said, if for any reason whatsoever you are unsatisfied with the material in this course I will give you 100% of your money back, no questions asked.\n\n\n- Your friend and music industry mentor, Rob Level",

Let's break it down for you:\n\n\nFIRST 4 SECTIONS: The first 4 sections of your training are dedicated to teaching you the Social Media Marketing Coaching 4 session interactive online Group Program. You are given step-by-step instruction designed to improve your proficiency using the latest technology as well as the how-to insight for delivering the professional Social Media Marketing Coaching Program. You receive coach-the-business-coach guidance that mentors and supports you on your journey. Plus, you walk away with done-for-you PDF documents as well as links to interactive online resources that you use during the session saving you time and money.\n\n\nNEXT 3 SECTIONS: After you finish learning about the group coaching, the next 3 sections of your training focus on the essentials of Social Media Marketing Coaching psychology and understanding people. I created frameworks for you to use that increase your competency during a coaching session. You learn about the first FEARLESS session called the discovery session and receive a priceless business assessment. By the time you finish these sections, you will understand at a deeper level exactly what people struggle with and how this specifically stops them from achieving Social Media Marketing success. You watch a prospective client re-enactment to assess your own approach and with what you discover, adjust as needed before connecting with and coaching real clients.\n\n\nNEXT 8 SECTIONS: Now you are ready to coach people individually! The next 8 sections of your Social Media Marketing Coaching Training focus on the remaining individual coaching sessions. The sessions are mapped-out, timed-out, done-for-you FEARLESS ENTREPRENEUR sessions complete with coaching questions, resources, activities, exercises, and insight. You have time to practice and implement what you learn.\n\n\nFINAL SECTIONS: The final sections are dedicated to your Social Media Marketing Coaching Career, Practice or Business. You receive insight on the 2 Levels of Certification. As a bonus, you receive ongoing personal and professional development.\n\n\n2 LEVELS OF CERTIFICATION: Students and Graduates of Fearless Entrepreneur Academy on Udemy benefit from our 2 Levels of Certification at no extra cost.

This is what differentiates this program and the Fearless Entrepreneur Academy Business Coaching Graduates above the rest.

      "description": "You will learn basics of CAL programming from basics to some advanced Topics. CAPL is a specialized scripting language created by Vector Informatik for developing, testing, and analyzing communication within Controller Area Network (CAN) systems. Widely used in the automotive industry, CAPL is an essential tool for simulating electronic control units (ECUs), validating CAN-based communication protocols, and testing real-world scenarios in vehicle networks. Its syntax and structure are similar to C, making it intuitive for programmers already familiar with traditional languages. CAPL scripts revolve around predefined event procedures that execute specific tasks when triggered by events such as message transmissions, timer expirations, or hardware states.\nCAPL is also instrumental in analyzing live CAN traffic. Scripts can filter, log, and process messages in real-time, providing insights into network performance and identifying potential issues. By interacting with other Vector tools, CAPL enhances the overall testing and simulation ecosystem, making it indispensable for modern automotive development. CAPL’s application is limited to CAN-based systems and the Vector toolchain, making it less useful in non-automotive domains or projects requiring standalone applications.\nCAPL is a powerful, event-driven programming language tailored for CAN communication. Its ability to simulate, test, and analyze vehicle networks makes it a cornerstone of modern automotive development, streamlining the design and validation of increasingly complex electronic systems.",

You can now send broadcasts to all of the people whom have messaged you before. This more or less turns Facebook messenger into a very powerful marketing tool you can use to engage with your audience and fans.\nSome additional features of these software tools might include:\nSetup sequences of messages\nResponses based on specific words \"yes\" or \"no\"\nEmbedded live chat on your website\nAuto-schedule broadcast messages\nAudience insights and open rates\nInclude call to actions with images, text, buttons or links.\nSetting up a Facebook messenger bot is an absolute awesome way to start building your following in 2017.",

I have been on Twitter since 2008. I used to waste hours on Twitter trying to grow a loyal following. Almost everything I tried just did not work. It felt like I was getting nowhere fast. There was too much noise. How could my message and tweets stand out? How did people seem to easily get 1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000 followers on Twitter?\nIt wasn't until I finally stumbled onto a few simple tools that a light bulb went off.

For a five dollar course that I learned more from than any marketing technique I have ever tried or paid for! I have now have 5.4k followers on the Pinterest account I created with your course. I have also started two other accounts over the last month or two and each of those have 1.5k+ and growing.\nDo all that John's says and it's not so hard to build i all up. Do all that John says and you can't miss out. I just logged back in today seeing this bookmarked in my book marks and thought, \"Hey, Iet me go see if there's any more gold here that I didn't get,\" and then I saw the reviews section and thought I am living proof that this works. I do make sales, mostly t-shirts I'm not making full time income - YET - but I am still learning and growing. So five stars and thanks for everything!\" - Tina\n\"Good information and tactics to get you moving faster with Pinterest for your business if it is online or a shop front. Need to watch things twice sometimes to absorb the information properly so that I can use the tactics more effectively. Well worth taking this course as a stepping stone for creating more business online for myself.\" - Karla\n\"I really enjoyed this course very much. I liked how the instructor was able to give live real life examples on his own website. Before I took this course on Udemy I took one where the instructor made claims about how he used his methods to make $33,000 in one year but he gave no proof in his course and his course was terrible. It was really bad. John Shea delivers the goods with solid proof.\nI even went to his sites and saw it live for myself. There is no denying it. John's methods work. He was also fun to watch and listen to. I don't share his taste in clothing but that's okay. I wish I was good at writing reviews so I could say something really great. I just wanted to let everyone know that this is a good course that actually teaches you real stuff that you can see works with your own eyes and it was fun to watch. John is a very likable guy and this is a very good course.\" - Allen",

I don't want to over-promise or mislead you. I want to be completely transparent. In the beginning, as with anything else you might try, there might be a learning curve and some frustration along the way.\nThis isn't bad. This is good. It means that you are trying and learning something new, and if you stick to it, you'll soon become more natural with it, and get better results.\nExpect great results long-term, but some struggle early. That is the most common scenario in the  Instagram marketing world.\n\n\nEASY ENTRY INTO INSTAGRAM MARKETING\n\n\nDon't like social media or being on live videos or randomly posting? But you know you have to do it for your brand or business?\nIf that's you, this is the course for you.\nIn this course, I break down different parts of Instagram to prioritize and explain what you can do to avoid constant posting and what parts of Instagram marketing you can automate to still have a wide audience without spending all day focusing on it or thinking about it.\n\n\nFIRST, LEARN BASICS OF POSTING\n\n\nYou will learn pros and cons of different types of posts, when to use each, and which to focus on. Once your content strategy foundation is set, you will learn how to amplify the reach of your posts to give them a chance to go viral.\n\n\nLEARN WHAT INSTAGRAM LOOKS FOR IN POSTS THAT GO VIRAL\n\n\nI'll show you exactly what signals Instagram looks for in posts. If your posts show the right signals to Instagram, Instagram's algorithm will give your posts better placement so new people can discover your account.\n\n\nAMPLIFY YOUR REACH AND SIGNALS WITH ADS\n\n\nInstead of posting all the time (which you could do, but most people don't want to) you can amplify your reach by running ads, generating more positive engagement signals in Instagram, and giving your posts a bigger chance of going viral. All this can be done with relatively few posts and not much manual labor or posting.\nIn the course, I walk you through all that so you can run your Instagram like a pro on just a few minutes a day and have it grow your business or brand.\n\n\nInvest in your education.

Depending on the nature of your brand, this can be an important way to reflect on your business, and to stand out from the crowd.\nRead on to learn some of the most powerful methods you can use to get more from your Stories. We will split this report into two sections: image and video.\nThat said, it’s worth reading both as a lot of the same concepts will cross over!

      "description": "Run Facebook ads that actually work! Cold traffic ads (that most people run) are not effective because most people who don't know about your business won't buy after seeing your initial ads.\nIn this course, you will learn how to set up custom audiences based on people who have used your site before and have bought from you. Based on that, you will be able to create lookalike audiences and retarget website visitors, which are more effective Facebook ads strategies.\nWHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO RUN FACEBOOK ADS?\nIf you've launched a product or service, it might be tempting to run Facebook ads. And everywhere you look around the web, people tell you to run Facebook ads. But there are a few things you must do before you run Facebook ads. If you are selling something, and you take leads to your site, make sure the site sells well and has a high sales conversion rate. If it doesn't, you will lose many leads and your Facebook ads may not be profitable.\nFACEBOOK ADS VS. GOOGLE SEARCH ADS\nGoogle knows what people want right now because they are searching for it. Facebook does not know that. So your Facebook ads must grab people's attention and make them want what you are promoting. This can be done with videos, interesting copyrighting, or vivid images.\nIn the Facebook Business Manager, you will be able to set up different campaigns and ad groups to manage different ads so you can experiment with creating Facebook ads that attract your potential clients.\nWILL PEOPLE BUY AFTER THEY SEE MY FACEBOOK ADS?\nPeople don't usually engage with a brand after the first time they see it. You must re-engage potential clients and have your Facebook ad show up for them many times. You should run a special kind of Facebook ads called retargeting ads which are only shown to people who have already visited your website which means they are aware of your brand and have shown some level of interest.\nCREATE AND TARGET CUSTOM AUDIENCES WHO BUY\nIn the Facebook Business Manager, you can create Facebook ads that target custom audiences which are the types of people who you know would buy from you because similar people have already bought from you. I'll be showing you how to set that up.\nFACEBOOK PIXEL AND FACEBOOK RETARGETING ADS\nYou will learn to use the Facebook Business Manager to set up your Facebook Pixel which is necessary to run Facebook retargeting ads. Facebook retargeting ads are effective and profitable because they only target warm leads who have already engaged with your business. The way to create Facebook retargeting ads is to first set up the Facebook Pixel. Many people get confused by the Facebook Pixel so in this course, I'll walk you click by click how to first create your Facebook Pixel and then run Facebook retargeting ads.\nINSTRUCTOR BACKGROUND\nI've been an entrepreneur for 15+ years, have coached 1,000+ entrepreneurs in person, taught 750,000+ students, impacted millions of entrepreneurs worldwide creating 6 and 7-figure businesses in the process, and I would love to help you.\nI am an expert growth marketer.

      "description": "BLOGGING IS NOT DEAD—IT’S STILL A POWERFUL TOOL TO MAKE MONEY, BUILD A PERSONAL BRAND, AND GROW ANY BUSINESS\nLearn to create blog and website content that drives results by being:\n\n\nSEO-friendly to attract consistent traffic.\nAttention-grabbing with compelling sales copywriting.\nEngaging with interesting, high-quality writing.\nDesigned to upsell your products or services seamlessly.\n\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN SALES COPYWRITING AND BLOG CONTENT WRITING (AND WHY YOU SHOULD MASTER BOTH)\n\n\nSales copywriting and blog content writing serve different but equally important purposes, and understanding this difference is key to your success.\nSales copywriting focuses on grabbing attention, getting clicks, and converting readers into buyers. It’s a powerful marketing tool to drive traffic, and we’ll cover exactly how to use it effectively in this course.\nBut great marketing doesn’t stop there. Once people land on your blog, the content needs to deliver value.\nYour blog posts must be engaging, informative, and build trust with your audience. In this course, you’ll learn how to combine attention-grabbing sales copy with high-quality blog content that keeps visitors coming back, subscribing, and buying.\nYou’ll have the tools to create both traffic and loyal followers—so you will get the clicks and build lasting relationships!\n\n\nBOOST BLOG TRAFFIC WITH SEO CONTENT WRITING\n\n\nFor most successful blogs, SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the largest source of traffic.\nIt works by making your content show up when people search for topics related to your blog.\nYou need great content but you also need to research the right keywords and optimize your posts to rank high in search results.\nIn this course, you’ll learn how to integrate SEO strategies into your blogging, so your posts attract readers and consistently drive traffic from search engines.\nWith the right approach, your content will work harder for you, bringing in visitors day after day.\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO AFTER YOU COMPLETE THE COURSE\n\n\nYou will be able to write solid blog posts, each of which is optimized for SEO while grabbing and holding the reader's interest. Each post will also be a part of your bigger content strategy, which you will also learn to create in this course.\n\n\nFOCUS ON CONTENT, NOT TECHNICAL SETUP\n\n\nThis course isn’t about building a website or setting up WordPress—it’s designed for those who already have a blog or plan to have one set up by themselves or a freelancer. This course does not teach technical website development and Wordpress development.\nThe focus here is entirely on creating compelling, high-quality content that grabs readers’ attention, keeps them engaged, and drives results.\n\n\nCONTENT CREATION THAT'S COMPELLING AND INTERESTS READERS\n\n\nMany bloggers write boring content in hopes of having it rank in Google search. But that approach by itself is limited and it fails because you need high-quality content creation that perks the reader's interests, and keeps their attention. The longer your content keeps the reader's attention, the more likely they will read other pages of yours, buy your products, subscribe to your newsletter, or do anything else you want them to do.\nThere’s a certain formula you can follow to write that type of content, and I will share it with you.\n\n\nMAKE MONEY BLOGGING\n\n\nAfter you learn how to attract readers, get them to come back regularly, and engage with your content, I'll show you how to make money blogging. You can make money blogging by publishing ads, selling product, selling services, and more.\nThere are so many different ways you can approach this and the sky is the limit. There are blogs making 6 and 7 figures every year using these exact methods.\n\n\nLEVERAGE AI TO WRITE, RANK, AND EARN\n\n\nYou don’t need to be a writing wizard to create amazing content. With AI tools, crafting compelling blog posts has never been easier.\nPlus, this course will show you how to optimize your content for SEO, ensuring it ranks well and reaches the right audience.\nWant to take it a step further? You’ll even learn how to use blogs in different languages to expand your reach globally. And if you’re looking for a way to earn, these skills are perfect for freelancing—offering content writing and SEO services that clients will pay for.\n\n\nLEARN THE MOST AFFORDABLE WAYS TO CREATE A BLOG\n\n\nSee how to create a blog in the most affordable ways. I'll show you options for free blog websites that will enable you to start a blog for zero cost. I'll also explain why paying just a little extra money for a domain and blog hosting is a much better option. I'll then walk you through different blogging options like Wix, WordPress, Squarespace, and even Shopify so you can understand which blogging platform fits your needs best.\n\n\nEXPLORE STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT BLOG NICHES\n\n\nA recent addition to the course are examples of popular kinds of blogs people start. The examples in the course include afashion blog, nutrition or food blog, news blog, and travel blog.\n\n\nInvest in your future and freedom. Enroll today.",

Not getting the reach and engagement you think your content deserves?  You will also Want to see more engagement from your fans but you are unsure where to start? These are common complaints from businesses that are trying to harness the power of Facebook, but finding it difficult to locate that elusive power.\nYou might know that Facebook does not show your post in the news feed to all those people who are connected with your page, but It show it to a very small percentage of it\nWay back in 2012, organic reach on Facebook was at an all-time high of 16%, this was down to 6.5% in 2014, and since changes to Facebook’s algorithm this year, brands are seeing organic reach even more lower.\nAnd at this point marketers start saying that Facebook organic reach is dead, which is wrong, Facebook organic reach is not dead but the marketers are going against the rules of Facebook that is why their organic reach is going lower and lower\nFacebook says that The goal of News Feed is to deliver the right content to the right people at the right time so they don’t miss the stories that are important to them. And Facebook says that Ideally, we want News Feed to show all the posts that people want to see in the order they want to read them.\nAnd for this purpose Facebook have designed an algorithm to filter posts for showing in the news feed of each individual because Facebook cares about each individual and their experience on Facebook.  Every single person sees an aggregation of all the posts from personal connections like friends, people they are following, pages they have liked and groups they are a member of.  On average each person can receive over 3000 pieces of news each daily. It is impossible for all these news stories to be seen in the news feed so Facebook news feed algorithm helps out by filtering.\nNow if you follow the Facebook news feed algorithm rules so your post will rank higher in those 3 thousand pieces of news each daily and hence Facebook will show your post to your audience in their news feed\nFacebook’s news feed algorithm filters posts based on many factors, and beside Facebook news feed algorithm there are some more important things that effect the visibility of your post in the news feed of your audience\nSo in this course we will discuss step by step that how the Facebook news feed algorithm works, and how to adjust to the algorithm, how to create post that get more organic reach and all the important things that effect the organic reach of your post on Facebook.\nOrganic Facebook Marketing trick\nTo increase your organic reach on Facebook you will need to get engagement on your page posts and you will get engagement then when your audience are interested in your business, and getting interested audience on your Facebook business page is only possible when your page is search engine optimized because a search engine optimized page appear in the search results when someone search for it, now if some one is searching for your business on Facebook and Facebook show them your page in the search results so that way you will get interested audience on your page, and interested audience on page mean more engagement and more engagement lead to more reach, so in the first section of this course you will learn how to make your Facebook business page fully search engine optimized, once your page is optimized you will see daily hundreds of organic likes on your page, and at the end of the day your Facebook marketing will be effective.",

      "description": "\"Information of this calibre is hard to find; Helen is an expert and a very generous one too! Mailing lists, lead magnets this is like a mini degree in Facebook marketing.\" Claire G\nTired of spending precious time on your Facebook page when only a handful of people ever get to see what you've posted?\n(Course updated November 2017)\nOver the last few years it's become a huge challenge for a small business to get their Facebook page posts seen by the people who have liked their page.\nOne solution is to pay for Facebook advertising, but many small business owners don't...\n- Have the skills to do that effectively, or\n- The time to learn how to do it right, or\n- The budget to outsource it to a consultant.\nAnd even if they can do one of those things, they want to keep their ad budget as low as they possibly can. And who can blame them?\nIf you're nodding your head in agreement, you'll want to seriously consider using Facebook groups for marketing. Here's why:\n- Posts in Facebook group posts are far more likely to appear in member's feeds compared to posts on a Facebook page.\n- If you do it right, you can use a Facebook group to build trust, grow relationships and position yourself as the go-to expert.\n- You're not just promoting a product, you're building a community of fans who will tell each other how great your product or service is and invite their friends too.\nBut it's not as easy as it sounds. As an administrator of several Facebook groups for small business owners, I know first-hand how many of them go about their marketing in precisely the wrong way.\nFar from bringing in new clients and sales from Facebook groups, they annoy people, risk having their Facebook account closed for engaging in commercial activity where it isn't allowed or simply waste their marketing efforts on techniques that don't work.\nTake this course and I'll show you how to use Facebook groups for marketing the right way, including:\n- What to post and how to interact in other people's Facebook groups to benefit your business\n- How to design and set up your own Facebook group so that it leads to new clients and sales\n- How to quickly and easily create content for your own group so that you delight your existing members and attract new ones\n- How to be the group member and the group administrator that everyone loves\n- How to set up your Facebook group, profile and pages so that you can build a mailing list from your activity in groups\nTaught by social media marketing trainer Helen Lindop, this is a practical course with action steps throughout. If you follow the steps you'll have your own Facebook group set up and running by the end of the course.\nJoin this course now and your business won't be invisible on Facebook any more!\n#facebook #facebookmarketing #facebookgroups #facebookforbusiness",

      "description": "About This Course: The foundational idea of this marketing strategy is simple. People love a good contest. When you enter for a chance to win an exciting prize, it activates your mind in an interesting - hope filled - way. Instead of worrying about whether you can afford something, you dream of owning it.\nThis course is designed to give you a good solid introduction to the idea of running social contests in support of your online selling efforts.\nWhy Consider Running Contests As A Marketing Strategy? One of the biggest expenses an online marketer has to manage is - the cost of customer acquisition. It can be very challenging, even for veteran marketers, and for newbies, it's a steep learning curve. You can spend all your money trying to find prospects - and fail.\nContests are fun. They are not a hard sell. They are not smarmy, slick, or used-car-salesman-esque. They make people happy. Contests are entertaining. They are simple. And most importantly, they are effective if done correctly.\n\nBetter Than Wasting Money On Facebook Advertising? Many gurus will push you to try Facebook Ads, why? Because they (can) work if you have a (large) marketing budget. Do you? Don't worry, if you don't, you're not alone. Even though I personally spend between $20,000 and $30,000 a month in online advertising, that's not what I'd recommend for someone just starting out. I'd encourage you to find ultra-inexpensive acquisition strategies. Contests fall into that category! So, run a few and see if they provide a lower-cost customer acquisition method than online ads.\nWhat You Get In This Course: We've designed this course to provide specific \"Blueprints\" for various types of contests. And in the coming months and years, we plan to add more content to this couse to show you more examples. Our current lectures include a detailed overview of 5 types of contests. They are:\nThe Weekly Prospector Social Contest Blueprint\nThe Product Launch Social Contest Blueprint\nThe Pre-Selling Via Voting Social Contest Blueprint\nThe Big Ticket Social Contest Blueprint\nThe Video Based Contest Blueprint\nCampanion Booklet & PDF Template: We also provide a 12 page companion booklet with a full overview of the Social Contest Blueprint strategy as well as a single-page planning template you can use to organize your social contests.",

Named by Forbes Magazine as a global Top 50 Social Media Influencer, I have been teaching social media at the University of Sydney for the last 10 years. This is a thorough, framework for online community engagement and Facebook Page Admin management for the serious social media profeessional. I look forward to answering your questions!\nFOR PROFESSIONAL FACEBOOK PAGE ADMIN or MANAGERS This course is for those that want more likes and engagement on their Facebook Page, who feel there is more to discover or who want to set up their Facebook properly as the first 30 days are crucial. Also those who want to use analytics to increase engagement (comments and shares) of their status updates. Do you need to understand Facebook Optimisation (FBO) such as Last Actor 50 and how to leverage it? We also cover Facebook Advertising and 3rd party platforms, adding Instagram and YouTube to your Facebook Page and so on.\nCreate your Facebook Page (tips of what to avoid)\nUnderstand and leverage Facebook Optimisation (get in the Newsfeed!)\nGet more Likes and Engagement (shares and comments)\nUse Facebook Analytics and write a report.\nCreate Facebook Ads and Understand the marketing intelligence\nLearn about Facebook Pixels connecting to your website and Facebook Pixel Ads\nTIME POOR? You don't need to do this course if you are happy flitting around the 'net, watching random videos, and reading blogs etc. But short on time? Then that's what this course is about.\nLOW PRICE I priced it low currently - you can pay more for my real life classes if you like :P - to make it accessible to everyone, in every country, in every job and for every reason. The price will go up a little in December 2015 once I've added more videos lectures and an updated workbook to the course. Of course if you join now, you'll get all that later on too ;) but I will keep this course at a reasonable price. Still, it's cheaper right now.\nMENTORING If you think you could be doing better with your Facebook Page, have any questions, need some help, come right on in. The Q&A forum has some good questions from students in it - please add your's - and I'm adding videos based on their priorities (adding Instagram for Business seems to be popular!). Please join in and don't forget to post your Facebook Page in the Discussion area for feedback.\n****\nIf you download the Udemy app on iPhone or Android, don't forget to select High Def HD in the settings and play in full screen (double tap) to see the demonstrations clearly.\nI've managed the strategy, campaigns and Facebook Pages and forums and blogs of TV shows such as JUNIOR MASTERCHEF, IDOL and BIG BROTHER. I specifically adapted these quick courses to bring social media managers like you up to speed efficiently and cost effectively. Look out for my other courses!\nSHORT COURSE: This is a mini-course that is part of a much larger Social Media Campaign course - you will find some videos duplicated from the Campaign course on my corporate account. Some students just want a quick and easy course on one aspect of campaigns - that is the purpose of this course. So if you are just looking for measurement and analytics tools and strategies as part of social media campaigns, this is the course for you!\nKey Information on Udemy and this Course (first lecture in last section).",

However, these are just parts of a larger picture.\nThis course offers a holistic approach to brand and marketing integration, addressing both external and internal stakeholders and touchpoints. Alongside traditional external marketing methods, we delve into three additional integration types: vertical, horizontal, and internal. By examining common obstacles, we guide participants in implementing integration strategies within their organizations.\nThis course is designed to offer a comprehensive understanding of brand and marketing integration, encompassing not only external engagements but also internal stakeholders and touchpoints. In addition to exploring conventional external marketing strategies, we delve deep into three other crucial types of integration: vertical, horizontal, and internal.\nBy dissecting prevalent challenges and offering practical insights, we equip participants with the tools to seamlessly incorporate integration strategies throughout their organizations, fostering coherence and effectiveness across all facets of marketing initiatives.\nThroughout this course, our discussions will certainly encompass external customer marketing. However, we'll also delve into three equally critical types of integration. Firstly, vertical integration entails harmonizing your brand with your company's overarching vision, mission, purpose, and values. Secondly, horizontal integration involves aligning your marketing strategy, capabilities, and organizational structure for optimal coherence. Lastly, internal integration focuses on equipping employees with the tools and knowledge to effectively serve as brand ambassadors.\nBy the end, you'll think about integration in a whole new way that encompasses all internal and external stakeholders and touch points.",

And since then has grown to the largest leading  network with over 2.6 billion downloads in 2014. Libsyn hosts over 25,000 shows with 44 million monthly audience members.\nJOIN OVER 32,702+ SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN THIS COURSE AND ARE LEARNING DIRECTLY FROM THE ONE AND ONLY DEAN OF BLOGONOMICS AND PODOLOGY, SCOTT PATON!\nDiscover how to make a Podcast - Fast, Easy and FUN! Join over 32,000 students using Power Podcasting to position themselves as THE Expert, build relationships, grow their influence, increase sales, and change the world.\nWhat is a Podcast? It is audio or video shows, that when you subscribe to them, are automatically updated on your Computer, Smartphones, iPads, Tablets, and/or iPods. Think of them as free radio or TV shows which you deliver Spam-Free! directly to your audience every time you produce one.\nPodcasting is bigger than you think. When we survey people who listen to free, commercial-free audio Podcasts at least once a month: we discover an interesting fact: Online Radio beats AM/FM Radio, streaming audio, CD's, TV Music channels, & Sirius!\n\"Power Podcasting Rocks!\"\n\"Scott is friendly and easy to follow. He clearly knows his stuff. All the tools are here, and laid out in easy way. I think it is a great course! I was shocked at how popular this is. Great marketing tool that I overlooked. Great education.\" ~ Dan Kobelt\nIf you look at the number of people listening to these free shows monthly, they are as popular as Twitter with 39 mIllion listeners, even if it doesn't get the same 'Love'.\nBut instead of communicating in impersonal 150 character Tweets, with Power Podcasting, you get right into the head of your target market for as long as they let  you.\nThey are portable — and because of this, they are more personal.\nImagine whispering into the ears of your ideal customers every week... building strong relationships, trust and connections. But instead of One-to-One, Power Podcasting is One-to-Many! Our students know that Podcasting is relationship building in the sales process, and not the time to go for the hard close.\nThese listeners are higher income earners. They listen daily to an hour and forty minutes more audio than the average American consumer. They are dedicated to continual learning, so just imagine what happens when your show is available on new cars all over the world...\nPower Podcasting \"allows you to convey your personality in a much stronger way than is possible through the written word. That clarity in your message is seen and felt through your actions (on video) and the tone of your voice...\" according to Chris Ducker, Author of #1 Bestseller 'Virtual Freedom'.\nWhen you claim your seat in this course, you'll have permanent online access to watch the course 24/7, and there's a Q&A discussion section in each lecture, where you can post questions - and I'll answer them personally!\nBy following the short, simple, easy-to-follow lectures, you will be able to work through the process of setting up your show and publishing your first episode quickly.\nThe course was designed to accomplish one goal: Start a  Podcast as fast as possible. I recommend watching the first 6 sections in their entirety. There are PDF workbooks included for you to use to clarify your topic, title, descriptions, intro and extros.\nFor 'Type A' personalities, there is a \"Fast Track\" Lecture (Section One, Lecture #6), in which if you already have a finished MP3 or MP4 file, reveals which lectures to watch so that after following only 33 minutes of video, you will have your show live and into iTunes. In other words, you can be up and running in under an hour.\nThe technical processes of  are only one aspect of successful Podcasting. Walk through real life examples of producing a live show, discover how to use your voice effectively to move your audience, uncover how to repurpose content for your podcast that you may already be doing, and how to do it FAST!\nPower Podcasting \"will grow your email list, your audience, your influence and your bank account.\" Amy Porterfield of \"Tweet This\" and former Social Media Maven for social media for the likes of Harley Davidson & Tony Robbins.\nPodcasts are growing rapidly, and thanks to CarPlay, Google Play and Apps, continue strong growth for years to come. It is just past the 'Early Adopter' stage and has huge potential moving forward. Don't miss out on the low-competition, high-demand opportunities that your fellow Power Podcasters are enjoying.\n\"Great content that kept my attention\"\n\"Scott is obviously very knowledgeable, experienced and shares great content. I am a beginner and he has inspired me to believe that even I can do this. Also, I find some of the other courses very boring and they lose me. This one doesn't.

      "description": "Social Media is powerful and has the capacity to help transform your cause. Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn are still growing at an incredible pace. The people you serve, those who support your mission, are there. Unfortunately, I see so many nonprofits missing out on the amazing opportunity that social media presents for enhancing their mission. How can they take part in this opportunity? It all comes down to their mission.\n\n\nIf your organization posts online “just to be out there,” this training will help give you the very clarity that you need to be successful. Going \"viral\" isn't the goal... building a sustainable, mission-driven presence, is. Maybe you feel like there is too much other work to do and growth is too slow like it's not worth the energy because you're having a difficult time converting followers to donors. If any of that resonates, hold my hand and let this training guide you to developing your foundation. There very well be some mission pieces to your social media vision you are missing!\n\n\nSocial media is all about sharing your mission and impact with your community that’s also visually appealing. Your visual appeal may begin with your graphics, but true social media success goes way beyond pretty pictures. True mission-driven social media success is about knowing who your ideal follower is, who is philanthropically aligned with your mission, who believes in your cause, who needs you, and what they need to hear from you.\n\n\nTrue mission-driven social media success speaks to the soul. It makes people proud to know you and to support you. It makes them feel brave enough to seek your services and excited to take part in your programs. To get the maximum benefit out of this training, feel free to print out the workbook that is included or follow along with the PDF version in a separate journal.\n\n\nAt the end of the course, you will have a small piece of homework that will help you kick-start your content creation for your social media accounts. You'll receive a PDF filled with \"Mission-Centered Social Media Prompts\" to help you engage your community and build inspiring content for your accounts.\n\n\nOn your own, go somewhere where it’s quiet and you can focus - a local coffee shop perhaps, or a cozy nook in your living room. Center yourself and reflect on why you believe in your mission. Why do you feel called to do the good work you're doing? And get to work! We’re about to unlock your social media's mission-driven impact potential, inspiring more donors to invest in the good work that you do.\n---\nOver the years, I’ve helped nonprofits raise millions of dollars through online giving, engage their communities virtually and in person, and grow their missions as a result.\nNow? I am excited to share my expertise with you. It's my mission to give you the skills, tools, and mindset tools you need to thrive and raise more for your mission.",

There are many trainings that focus on developing the skills of the coach, but ultimately, you need to find clients to turn this dream into a reality. Unfortunately, just simply being open for business does not mean business will come in. I’ve worked with many financial coaches that spent their time working on tasks that did not help their business grow. By the time some financial coaches realize that they need to step up their marketing efforts, it’s too late. I’ve seen many financial coaches close up shop after months and years of waiting. I want to change that.\n\n\nFinancial coaching can be an enticing home-based business. Some people are looking for work flexibility or higher potential income. Many things with a financial coaching business can be addressed as you grow. You can take specialized training as you discover what your clients need. You can build fancier websites and implement helpful technologies as you grow. But without clients, you’ll waste a lot of time and money.\n\n\nIs a business without clients truly a business? It’s time to go from notrepreneur to entrepreneur. I put together the shortest, most densely packed training on how to really start marketing your financial coaching business in today’s environment. All of these tools are free. You just have to start using them - the sooner you start, the sooner you’ll bring in clients. Don’t let yourself be the financial coach that regrets how they spent their time.\n\n\nIn this training, I’ll help you spend time on the things that will make a difference for your business, give you the highest chance of success, break through your own doubts, and change lives – including your own.",

(Influencer Marketing)\nHow can you get PROVEN results from every advertising dollar you spend, rather than flushing money down the drain with social media ads that don't convert? (Influencer Marketing)\nHow can you learn one easy system of social media marketing that transcends any one platform? (something you can use on Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Snapchat, and even blogs?)  (Influencer Marketing)\nInfluencer Marketing is a really powerful form of advertising that you can learn to use quickly and easily. It's not complicated. It takes no high-tech talent, or math degree to figure out. You just work with nice people - and they promote your products.\nThe truth is - Getting Facebook Ads to actually convert at a level that is worth the money you spend on them is really hard. Most Facebook Advertisers waste all their money - and don't have anything to show for it. It's not your fault. It's a system that has a very low probability of success. Stop the madness.\nEveryone can learn Influencer marketing. It's much easier than complicated paid ad platforms. In fact, here are a few things I love about Influencer Marketing:\nThere is a high probability of success with each deal you do.\nYou can start with literally a ZERO dollar budget, (by working with influencers that will work for free products - I'll show you how to find them). And influencer marketing can work with $100 a month budget. $200 a month budget. $500 a month budget. And if you can spend more than $500 a month - you can see really exciting things happen.\nYou don't need to understand Instagram, Youtube, or Facebook. You just let the influencers do their job - and you focus on your product and sales.\nIf you do want to grow an Instagram, Youtube, or Facebook account in support of your brand - Influencers can help you do it really quickly.\nI could keep listing benefits like this all day!\nWe'd love to have you jump into this masterclass and learn how to solve your traffic problems with Influencer Marketing!\nGrateful,\nJason Miles & Kyle Hamar",

You want to:\nBoost your personal profile and share your passion with the world\nGenerate revenue for your business, or kick start your 1st business.\nYou are ready to make a career on TikTok\nGreat! I can’t wait to share my TikTok knowledge with you.\nYou might wonder why am I here?\nBefore working at ByteDance(TikTok), I had TikTok and a bunch of other social media accounts, I myself also watched countless courses of this kind while trying to grow them. I can tell you that after watching these courses, you may feel that everything they say is right, but when it comes to executing the strategies yourself, you will be clueless about what to do with TikTok.\nMost courses are either too basic that anyone with prior social media experience can figure it out or they are full of false content. Many courses are put together by scraping the internet for free information, piece it together what the instructors already know about other platforms. Many lack the successful experience of operating multiple TikTok accounts.\nI won’t regurgitate posting 3-5 times a day, using text overlays, following trends, and catching people’s attention early in the video. You will find a ton of videos with this type of information for free on Youtube. So, why spend money to learn what’s already out there for free.\nI will teach you how to grow and monetize on TikTok with a pair of future lenses because success leaves clues. Douyin left many clues for TikTok to follow.\nDouyin is the original version of TikTok that has been popular since 2017 in China. Both social media apps share similar functions, algorithms, and monetization methods. The difference is that Douyin is 2 years ahead of TikTok. Imagine knowing what Instagram is like today 5 years ago, wouldn’t you have doubled down on it? The current TikTok landscape is the same as Douyin two years ago. So if you want to know the future of TikTok, you should learn about Douyin as TikTok will follow its exact path to success.\nIn this course, not only you will learn how to properly set up your account for success, how to select popular topics, make and publish your videos. You will also learn about the TikTok algorithms based on what the company’s algorithm architect shares at tech conferences in China which are translated, interpreted into actionable steps for you to follow easily. This will give you a competitive edge and help you grow quicker and more successful on TikTok.\nOur promise:\nThis course is periodically updated with new information to help you stay relevant to the current algorithms and trends\nIf you're unsatisfied with the course in any way, you can get a full refund within 30 days of purchase.",

I show you the exact steps you need to take & how to approach everything as though you were looking over my shoulder. This program is so in-depth and easy to follow that even my grandmother could pull this off! Okay... maybe not. But you get my point...\n\n\n\"I've tried \"Facebook ads\" before but it didn't work...\"\nThere are two major components needed for Facebook ads to work. First, is the right ad, and second, is the right follow up system. Without a proper lead magnet within the ad that provides value to your ideal client, the ad wont convert and you won't get leads. And secondly, without the proper follow up system on the back end, too much time slips away and the lead falls off. We solve this by providing battle-tested ad templates that are already proven to work, along with robust yet automated drip campaigns that allow you to quickly and effortlessly follow up with tons of leads at scale using multiple touch points.\n\n\n\"How much do I need to budget for paid ads?\"\nUsing the campaigns that we teach, the average cost per lead is about $1-$3 depending on your local market. These ads are displayed cross platform on Facebook & Instagram and a budget of $10/day is recommended for this system to work.\n\n\n\"What is a lead?\"\nA lead is someone who has voluntarily opted into your ad campaign, and expressed interest in buying or selling a home in your area, by providing you their first & last name, phone number and email, in exchange for your free lead magnet. This information is then instantly sent to your CRM and nurtured until they are ready to move forward.\n\n\n\"I already pay Zillow, why do I need Facebook ads?\"\nThink of it this way: \"If you give a man a fish, he can eat for a day, but if you teach him how to fish, he can eat for a lifetime\". Simply put, you don't want to leave your business in the hands of Zillow or fight among other agents over shared leads. With this system we're not \"buying\" leads, we're \"generating\" exclusive leads while simultaneously building a personal brand. Also, you'll save money and earn more: Zillow leads cost on average $74 and convert at 4%. Facebook leads cost on average $2 and convert at 2%. Simply put, building a personal sales funnel via Facebook ads is 18.5x CHEAPER than Zillow.\n\n\n\"What if I don't have time?\"\nGood question... This program is designed for speed. I don't want you to be stuck behind your computer listening to my lectures all day. I want you to quickly put systems in place, generate business, and make money... Everything in this program is designed with the end goal in mind - nothing else.\nThe entire funnel, ad templates, lead magnets & systems are already 95% done-for-you, ready to plug-and-play. We just help you implement, and get the ball rolling. You'll see results quite fast, and the ongoing time investment to manage the system is very minimal. From then on, we'll be in the trenches with you, bringing up your business IQ to the next level.",

You wish more people retweeted your tweets and that you could gain hundreds of followers every day.\nYou have no problem putting in the work, but you just want better results. You want more blog traffic, a larger audience, and sales from Twitter. The mission of this course is to show you how to get those results.\nAfter being stuck at 1,667 Twitter followers for three months and putting in the same work, I asked myself if this was it. I am happy I continued learning. Now I have over 250,000 targeted Twitter followers, and in this course, I will show you how I achieved rapid growth.\nI understand many people are pressed with time. My belief is that a lack of time shouldn't stand in your way! That's why I discovered a process that lets you massively grow your Twitter audience in just 15 minutes per day. Once you master the system, you can even put your Twitter growth on autopilot.\nNow I gain hundreds of followers every day without putting in any work for my Twitter account.

This not only promotes your blog posts but it also drives traffic directly to your website. It has over 300 million monthly global users and boasts over 200 billion Pins. And it gets better. Research by ecommerce platform Shopify found that it was the #2 source of all referral traffic to their site, that 93 percent of users were using it to plan their purchases, and that the average resulting order value was $50 (higher than any other social media source).\nImpressive stats for a corkboard.\nPut simply, it is a huge marketing opportunity for ecommerce stores and businesses.\nPinterest is a great platform for companies that are able to create boards with content which utilize both visual appeal and provide audience value. If you're able to harness the power of Pinterest, you can use it as another powerful tool in your social media marketing arsenal.\nPinterest marketing seems difficult but it doesn't have to be.

        "If you want to follow along exactly with me in the practical projects where we put the science-backed principles into practice, you'll need Adobe Photoshop, preferably Creative Cloud, but recent versions should work as well. I also link to a few free image editing options in the course, which will be fine for most techniques but not the two animated ad exercises, which require Photoshop. If you only want to know the science-backed marketing principles and don't need to design the images or ads yourself (for example, if you hire someone else to design your images), then of course you won't need Photoshop."

      "description": "Would you like to get more clicks, shares, retweets, comments, likes, fans, followers, and purchases via social media marketing and/or digital marketing?\nThen this course is for you.\nPerhaps you're a YouTuber who wants to get more clicks on your video thumbnails. Or you use Facebook brand page to promote your brand or company and want to know the science-backed factors to get more fans, comments, likes, and shares. Or perhaps you run Twitter for a large corporation and want to get more retweets.\nLearn the Science-Based Methods of Effective Social Media and Digital Marketing:\nIn this course, you'll learn from three types of lectures:\nShort, helpful lessons covering the numerous scientific, quantitative studies that have found what factors lead to more engagement, followers, and purchases via social media marketing and online advertising. Some of these studies have looked at top 100 global brands' campaigns over a number of years to see what factors contribute to higher engagement.\nPractical, hands-on exercises to put these principles into practice by designing social media images and ads.\n\"Behind the scenes\" lectures where I upload the images we've designed together and then confirm the earlier large-scale studies with small-scale tests.\nCourse Structure and Progression:\nIn this course, you'll learn and apply the industry-standard design principles, and then you'll learn and apply the science of getting more clicks and engagement. You'll then be amazed by the power of writing appeals, color, and other marketing tips by learning from science-backed marketing secrets confirmed in academic journals. You'll design ads and images throughout the course in order to put these principles into practice.\nPractical Projects:\nIf you want to follow along with me exactly in the handful of practical exercises, then you'll need Adobe Photoshop, preferably Creative Cloud, although earlier versions work as well. I also include links to free image editing programs in the course, although for the animated ads lesson, you'll need Photoshop. Of course, if you're only interested in the science-backed marketing tips and you hire someone else to design your social media images, then you won't need the software.\n\nSee the promotional video for my qualifications to teach this course and let me know if you have any questions! Thanks!\nSome other courses feature anecdotal evidence or even inaccurate information NOT backed up by any study (for example, the mythical \"names of files affects your YouTube SEO\" lie, told by various Udemy instructors, which is not proven and which YouTube themselves debunked).\n\nThe information you learn in this course is the result of five months' studying all academic journal articles and other studies on social media marketing and digital marketing. I went through hundreds of articles so I could summarize them in helpful lessons which can then be applied.",

Imagine that all you have to do is show up, record, and all the drudgery of Podcasting is handled by a highly-skilled group of freelancers and outsourcers from around the world as you sleep!\nInstead of spending fruitless days picking away at your audio, never seeming to get it right, week after frustrating week, your professional sound engineer edits it and has it sounding as polished as you are in short hours. Then your transcriber turns your show into an article and blog post as your VA uploads the show onto your Podcast hosting server.\nYou get the highest quality at prices you can afford!\nPlus you are helping people all over the world get out of poverty.\nProducing Podcasts requires a wide range of skills: Audio editing, writing, uploading, finding guests and scheduling them then thanking them and a whole lot more. The problem is that each task may only take a couple hours, but:\nThey are hours you don't have\nEach week when you go to do them, you start all over as you don't do them enough to really remember them from week to week.\nBy outsourcing you'll be able to produce your Podcasts faster and spend only a fraction of what you would have otherwise expensed in time and money.\nOutsourcing your Podcast has endless possibilities - you just need to know how to apply it effectively and efficiently.\nScott Paton, the Dean of Blogonomics and Podology, has been using outsourcers for the past seven years to produce products, like his Podcasting platform, he could never have made himself, to save time and money on projects he could never have completed himself.\nHe shares with you the industry secrets to finding high-performing outsourcers and keeping them long term. When you finish this course, you'll be able to find quality freelancers to look after all aspects of Podcast production, so that you can focus on the most important things: Being the best Podcast host you can be!",

Every business uses Facebook and it's become the main medium for communication in many areas of the world.

And all of it happened in 7,200 minutes.\nThink about it:\nIf you added all of the people that my Ad Campaign touched you could fill in a small football field…\n… and every one out of eight people took action and became a fan…\n…so once every 4 minutes I gained a new Fan…\n…and spent the amount equivalent to a nice lunch to get that\nTruth be told, I probably would have gotten more if I ordered some nice wine to go with it!

You’re not alone; so many people feel this frustration.

Sure, showing you the theory is great. But it’s one thing to learn the theory and it’s a whole different thing to feel empowered to take confident action.\n\n\nThis course is different from the average Canva or design course because I include 224 templates that I designed myself to give you a running start. Like the look of the templates already? Simply drop in your business info to have a professionally designed graphic that’s ready to go. That will take you mere minutes.\n\n\nWant to go further with customizing the templates? No problem. Watch the included Canva tutorials to learn everything you need to know for designing your own social media marketing materials. You will develop all the skills you need to quickly and confidently design everything you need for your business both today and in the future.\n\n\nThe thing that many people overlook in branding is the importance of consistency. Using the free Canva templates is fine, but hundreds of thousands of people are already using them AND the free templates don’t come in sets.\n\n\nWhat do I mean by sets? You might find an Instagram template you like in Canva, but there won’t be a Pinterest template that matches that same look and feel. You would have to create one from scratch to match.\n\n\nThat’s why I included branded template sets that contain everything you need for marketing your business in 2022. Each of the seven template sets includes:\n\nPowerpoint Slide Templates\nInstagram Story Templates\nInstagram/Facebook Square Feed Templates\nPinterest Pin Templates\nFacebook Group Cover Templates\neBook Cover Templates\nEmail Header Templates\nLinkedIn Cover Templates\n\n\nUse these templates to...\n\nCreate branded webinars and online presentations...\nGrow your Instagram following with shareable branding…\nSend branded emails and stick out in your client’s inbox...\nStand out on LinkedIn with headers designed to send a clear message of how you help...\n\nBest of all, no previous design skill is required.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have developed a complete brand guide for your business plus multiple graphic assets for marketing your business across social media.\n\n\nIs there something missing that you would love to see added? Let me know! I’m always open to improving and expanding the course content and included templates.\n\n\nI can’t wait to see what you design. See you on the inside.",

For productivity, quality of execution, and ultimate success, one must get organized, plan, and create a systematic social media management strategy.\nCreating a social media marketing calendar will give you an editorial calendar. You will know exactly which content to create and post every day of the month, and what the theme of each day will be so you don't have to think about it or guess. That will immediately save you time.\nSOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING TEMPLATE IN THE COURSE\nIn the course, I give you a fresh social media marketing calendar template that you can fill out on your own while I walk you step-by-step on how I fill out every day of my own social media marketing calendar. You can follow how I create mine. I do it all by sharing my screen and showing you how to do it.\nAFTER YOU GET ORGANIZED, GO FASTER BY OUTSOURCING AND AUTOMATING\nMost people want to outsource and automate social media marketing right away. But first, you must become good at posting and gain a level of proficiency. Having a social media calendar will help you do that. Once you have things running smoothly, you can outsource and automate parts of content creation and posting.\nLEARN SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT TO BOOST YOUR BUSINESS OR CAREER\nSocial media management can be a few things:\n1) Social media management can be a job you can get working for a company.\n2) Social media management can be a freelancing service you can offer on a site like Fiverr or UpWork.\n3) Social media management is something your company needs if you run a small business and need to regularly post on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Pinterest, and others.\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SOCIAL MEDIA CALENDAR AND A CONTENT CALENDAR\nYour social media management is broad. It includes content beyond just your social media. Content that is outside your social media can be your blog posts or publicity you get for your business.\nRESPONSIVE AND CARING INSTRUCTOR: WORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT\nIf you have questions, know that I am here to help! I answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours.

Or your social media is going great guns but your website sits there unloved and not integrated? You aren't sure what to post on Facebook and Twitter and when - plus measuring seems pretty difficult, with either too much analytics (Facebook Insights) or not enough (Twitter, Instagram etc)? You'd like to know more about monitoring panels and 3rd party tools but where to start? Building a blog and writing on it seems time consuming and tricky?\n*** On April 1st This course will be closed to NEW students. I will of course continue to support current and past students. No new students will be accepted after April 1st****\n\nThis course takes you through step by step\nsetting up monitoring panels (check the community groups),\nbuilding a brand voice and content strategy (what to say),\ncreate discussion lists and hashtags and engagement strategies for Facebook Optimization (FBO) and Twitter Timelines.\nYou will create a blog or business social media newsroom, change the theme, header, write articles and include videos on it.\nThen integrate the whole lot (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Blog) into a Call To Action campaign complete with measuring tools.\n\nThis is a great little course to get started on social media in a meaningful way or as a way to upskill from a basic Facebook Page or Twitter that needs more subscribers, engagement and reach.\nI've been running Facebook Pages and other social media platforms for reality shows like Big Brother and Idol and Masterchef over many many years. This is what works and doesn't work for us.\nUNI: Please note, I've been teaching a version of this course at the University of Sydney for the last 10 years - if you are a past student, THIS course is the online version with uptodate tools, videos and tips.

I'm a Course Creator from Canada and am building a worldwide community for Working Equitation Simplified! I'm currently in Week 3 and I had 134 new members join my Group this week! Thanks Jono.\"\nTrish Hyatt (Canada)\n\n\n\"Shout out to Jono Petrohilos from the Course Creator Community! I changed the name of my FB group based on his recommendation and bingo! About 50 new members! Blown away!\"\nAndrea Riggans (New Zealand)\n\n\n\"Russ from Colombia! I'm currently building a community around Permaculture! I'm currently doing the Course Creator Community FB challenge and after week 1 I've grown my FB Group by 70 members!\"\nRuss Manning (Colombia)\n\nWhy Listen To Me\nI used to SUCK when it came to Facebook Groups! I created my first Facebook Group only because I was forced too. I was managing a local Fitness Bootcamp Franchise and it was a requirement that each 'location' had their own Facebook Group... And out of all 75 'locations' my Facebook Group was the smallest and most boring... but then I realised, the other locations who had bigger and more engaged Facebook Groups were the most successful... so I decided to go all in and focus heavily on my mine!\nI went all in on Facebook Groups... took all the courses... read all the blogs... watched all the videos... attended all the conventions... (some of them GREAT.. some of them not so great :p)... Long story short after spending a heap of money and time... I was able to come up with my own system... Within 12 months my Facebook Group went from being the smallest and least engaged to the largest and most engaged...\nSince then, i've used this exact system to build two new Facebook Groups (that I still own / manage) that both grow by approximately 100 members week... Every week... And I teach this exact system to my students who also achieve similar results in the growth of their Facebook Groups.\n\n\nPersonal Help Within The Course\nI really want you to succeed, I don't just create these courses for the money. I genuinely create these courses to help others, so if you have any questions or need any help, feel free to contact me personally inside the course. I will always be available for you.\n\n\nYou also get these helpful bonuses\n- How to grow your Instagram cheat sheet!\n- How to grow your LinkedIn cheat sheet!\n\n\nEnrol now and let me help you grow your Facebook Group",

Master B2B social media marketing!\nI've been advertising on LinkedIn since 2011, and I have an MBA from the #1-ranked business school for marketing in the USA.\nThe main benefit of this course is teaching you how to use LinkedIn to get new customers. For example,  I'll walk you through a case study on how one ad campaign generated a 500% return on investment. To get customers we’re going to use LinkedIn ads, but also account based marketing (ABM), LinkedIn Sales Navigator, your LinkedIn company page, and other tactics such as automating connection requests.\nAfter this course, you’ll be able to acquire new customers using LinkedIn efficiency by using the top, middle, and bottom of the marketing funnel. You’ll be able to put together a  LinkedIn customer-acquisition plan.\nI'll talk about LinkedIn ads of various types with different objectives. The key to cost-effectvie lead generation and customer acquisition is mapping out the entire funnel, not just short-term lead generation.\nThe major sections of this LinkedIn marketing course are:\n\nBOFU (Bottom of Funnel): generating short-term revenue\nMOFU (Middle of Funnel): tactics such as product education & nurturing that will enhance BOFU\nTOFU (Top of Funnel): generating broad awareness and problem education to provide the basis for subsequent revenue generation\nI'll talk about the details of LinkedIn campaigns I worked on and provide 3rd-party case studies. I'll give you tutorials, strategies, and tactics to pull everything together.\n\nThis is a more structured approach to LinkedIn marketing than my previous courses which focused on jumping straight into tutorials.\nThis course is for people in B2B marketing and potentially those in outbound sales and business development.\nLet’s get started!\n\n\nKey Marketing Topics:\n\n\nLinkedIn Marketing\nLinkedIn Lead Generation\nLinkedIn Advertising (LinkedIn Ads)\nSocial Media Marketing\nLinkedIn Advertising Course\nB2B Advertising\nB2B Marketing",

Once, I was so upset with my Pinterest results, that I closed all my Pinterest accounts, and tried to forget about this source of traffic all together. Two years passed before I opened new Pinterest accounts. This time, I started to analyze what I did wrong, and why my previous hard work took me nowhere. My new approach finally brought me the results that I was hoping for. In this course, I am going to share with you my system that helped me achieve success. I will walk you through it, step by step, quickly and easily!“\n\nImportant: Pinterest newbies are more than welcome to take this course, but please be aware that this course does not teach you how to open a Pinterest account nor how to create boards, etc. There are many wonderful courses on this topic on Udemy, including free information all over the internet.\nThere are 3 parts in my course:\nPart 1: How to Monetize Pinterest Traffic (the Basic)\nThis part is a refresher on the simple methods of Pinterest monetization.\n\nPart 2: The missing Link (Intermediate Level)\nIt reveals the missing link to the Pinterest moneymaking formula. Here you will find the practical advice on how to fix that missing link.\nPart 3: The missing Link (Advanced Level)\nThis information will be most helpful to those students who still have not gotten the results they were looking for even after following the advice from part 2.\nBy the time we are finished, you will have a solid understanding of my Pinterest monetization system that actually works.\nAre you excited?

I don't just buy every product out there, only if it seems to resonate with what I'm current doing and this one seemed like a good match so I jumped on it. Glad I did. I've only gotten through the 3rd video and wow, this is definitely a great system that works. Just the part about how to get 1000 connections in a week is pure gold and I've just completed it (you have to wait for the connections once you start the process, about a week, and I know from past experience in sending invites one at a time that most of them accept). That module alone was worth the price and much more.\n\nGreat product. I give it a solid two thumbs up!\nOriginally Posted by 4uonlinebiz\nMaksym, Man! This is an awesome, step-by-step packed guide to LinkedIn. Easy to understand, easy to implement! And at the crazy low price you're offering it at, this is a complete no brainer. I can tell you've been in social marketing for a while and I really respect your solid approach and dedication. Thanks man!\nOriginally Posted by duffmarketing\nHOLY COW!!\n\nWhen I made my last post I had just a few minutes previously completed doing the module 3 part... I just checked my account and have already got 60 new connections! I am shocked and amazed. Can't wait to start implementing the other modules. Dude, this is a winner!\n\n==================\n\nUPDATE!! 22 more new connections since I wrote the above just 10 minutes or so ago... unreal!\n\n==================\n\nNEW UPDATE... they keep coming! I'm up 115 new connections since I started this less than 2 hours ago. At this rate I think I'll have 1000 connections in just a very few days. Jumping into the \"next level\" now and it's looking real good. This could well be the best WSO I've bought.\n\n==================\n\nANOTHER UPDATE... approximate six hours into this and I've got over 300 new connections and it's not showing any sign of slowing down! And I've got a good start on the other parts. This is Awesome!\nOriginally Posted by Melody\nLove this! Anyone that doubts what LinkedIn can do for you - I can tell you first hand that it is the BEST place online to find real customers, and make some serious bank. My LI networking will ADD 6 figures to our bottom line this year - with virtually no expense - not many other resources can do that!\n\nThis is an awesome guide - a must have of you want to be successful with LI!\nMelody",

With the Meta rebranding, there has also been an update in Meta ads with some new concepts that were introduced. For example, we'll go over the Meta Business Suite, and all the different tools present in it including the Ads Manager.\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS COURSE\n\n\nAfter taking this Facebook marketing course, you will be able to comfortably determine what Facebook marketing strategies are viable for your business, and what strategies may be poor choices.

Do your Page Fans look inactive and never engage with your posts anymore?\nYou are not alone.\nFor the past years, Page Owners have been coming to me asking why their Facebook Page doesn't work anymore and fewer people seem to interact or even see the content they post.\nMost of them blame Facebook Algorithm. And although indeed the algorithm has almost killed the organic reach of a page, this doesn't mean you should continue doing what you do if you see no result. Quite the opposite, actually.\nYou want to take the maximum out of a Facebook Page, not only to better promote your brand but to connect with the people who matter to you most. And you can't do this if they don't see your content.\nOn almost every Facebook Page Audit I run, I notice some repeating patterns. Some mistakes every non-professional page owner makes. And this leads to less interaction and eventually zero engagement with the page's community.\nThis is the reason I created this course.\nTo show you in simple, easy, and practical ways some specific steps you can take immediately to start seeing better results.\nI have packed here the most usual mistakes I encounter every time I run a Page Audit. And every time my students implement what I suggest, they start seeing tangible results.\nThese instructions can now be found in this Course, which I am delighted to share with you.  And you can complete it in less than one hour.\nThis minimum investment can help you reactivate your Page with all the benefits you can have from this!",

I recommend it to anyone who wants to use at maximum capacity Facebook for marketing!\"\n\nAndrew Haywood\n___________________________________________________________________\nWhat if you would have the chance to expose your business everyday to almost 1,5 billion people from all around the world? How would that change your business? What impact would your products and service have in the world and how would your income report change?\nAll of the above are retorical questions obviously. We all want maximum exposure for our business and some of the most profitable businesses and companies in the world don;t even have exposure to up to 1,5 billion people but the truth is that now any entrepreneur on the planet can have access to that!\nWe all know that marketing is the core of the success in any business. Marketing translates first of all into geting as much exposure for your business as possible. It's business and it's a numbers game. If 100 people come into your store and out of them 5 people buy something than you know that for 20 buyers per day you need 400 people to get through your doors on a daily basis. You have to get those people there somehow!\nTill a couple of years ago, even with the help of the internet, which changed the world of marketing forever and gave acces to small business at audiences they didn't even dreamed about, you couldn't afford as a starting entrepreneur mass marketing campaigns like the the BIG players in the global marketplace. To reach a million people you needed hundreds of thousands of dollars spend on TV or Radio campaigns.\nBut now we have a solution, a solution that everyboday can access and get their business exposed in front of millions for people for just a few thousand dollars, a few hundreds or even for FREE. Yes, for FREE! It's called Social Media and by far Facebook is the most important platform of them all.\nNow, with the help of Facebook, thousands of business got to a whole new level forever. Marketing on social media properly can change the way you are doing business forever and can build you an automated sales funnel that works for your business non-stop!\nThe problem is that you need to do it properly so that you won'w waste any money on ads that don't convert and posts that don;t attract any new clients. This is exactly what you will learn in this course.\nEven more than that, the main difference between our course and many others is that we don't focus only on ads and page marketing but we also teach you how to bring in new valuable clients by using your Profile!\nSo, to go briefly through a couple of the things you will learn here they are:\nHow to setup your Profile properly for marketing success.\nWhat types of posts to use and when.\nHow to create stunning images that attract and convert.\nHow to send people from Facebook to your website through your posts.\nHow to setup a Facebook Page for your Business.\nHow to use different types of Ads to engage people, send them to your offers and convert them to buyers.\nHow to remarket using Facebook and increase your conversions through the roof!\nand more other benefits...\nLifetime Access to all other updates!\nSurprise Bonuses!\nNew Methods and Systems introduced in the course!\nFULL Support through the discussion area of the course!\n30 Day Money Back GUARANTEE if you feel this course didn't help you at all and you can't apply anything...that is how dedicated we are to your success!\nAll of this in less than 4 hours (out of your busy schedule) of simple to follow lectures that YOU CAN APPLY from TODAY in YOUR BUSINESS for BETTER RESULTS!\nTime to take action!\n\n\nTo Your Massive Online Success,\nSorin Constantin and Aaron Jonathan",

      "description": "Welcome to the YouTube Live Masterclass!\n\"You Can Now “Go Live” Using the Largest and Most Recognized Video Sharing Platform \" in the world!\nWould you like to learn how to do this? And would you like to know how you can earn thousands of dollars in sales from this Platform? If you answered “Yes”, then this course is for you!\nIn this Course, You’ll Find Out How To Use YouTube Live to Generate More Leads and earn an amazing income from your revenue streams. You will learn how to Increase Your Leads and Revenue with YouTube Live by Creating a Presence on the world's Most Active Video Sharing Platform.\nWhy should you take this masterclass?\nEvery day, people from around the world come to YouTube to experience the world’s biggest cultural moments. Whether hosting a live charity event, a town hall, or a press conference about breaking news, YouTube Live allows Creators to bring viewers together in real-time to learn, discuss, and to form new social communities.\nYouTube Live is an easy way for Creators to reach their community in real-time. Whether streaming an event, teaching a class, or hosting a workshop, YouTube has tools that will help manage live streams and interact with viewers in real-time.\nA YouTube broadcast video can be used for both personal and professional goals. When talking about the viewers, they usually find topics of interest and then use the app like a search engine. In fact, Google’s ownership of Youtube often influences how your searches on both these apps intermixes.\nOn the other hand, when you talk about content creators, there are massive advantages to such live streaming strategies. One famous example of this is the most popular gaming channel PewDiePie with more than 96 million subscribers.\n\n\nHere are just a few of the advantages:\n1. The monetization of live videos!\nWhile Facebook Live is popular out of all the social media platforms that provide live streaming services. YouTube holds the trump card that is easy monetization of the live videos.\n2. Cost-effective medium\nYou can become a user, a content creator, and later earn from your YouTube broadcast video without spending anything. Since the videos are live, there are no multiple-takes or post-production costs added to your budget. Most of the time, all the tools or features are available to you even at the beginner’s level, helping you save time and money.\n3. Establishing your brand\nIn a survey by HubSpot, it was found that 70% of all YouTube audiences make purchase decisions based on what they watch. That is why branded content and exposure to such videos benefit everyone in their personal and professional endeavors. It indicates that people want to find your videos online and suggested videos from\n4. Maximize your reach\nVideos on demand do not get as high a reach as live streaming on YouTube. It has been noted that the audiences on YouTube and Facebook prefer live videos far more than pre-recorded ones. This raises the chances of your live videos ranking higher in searches, ultimately reaching more people.\n5. Mobile live webcasting\nWhat makes YouTube the best live video streaming platform is that there is no need for an elaborate production or a lot of equipment. With just a smartphone and decent internet service, you can easily go live anywhere. Mobiles today certainly possess cameras of high quality that give good outputs videos as well.\n6. Collaborate with others\nAlthough Instagram live has launched the feature where other content generators can join in your live stream, it is certainly not as effective as making collaboration on youtube live stream events. In fact, this often underestimated feature has a positive impact on brand partnerships and mutual growth.\n7. Connecting with your audience\nAs you may have seen with many of the YouTubers, content creators online usually have a weekly schedule for posting videos or hosting live streaming sessions. These weekly youtube live stream events not only build a loyal audience base but also create the anticipation for your content. This is a great way to create a connection with the viewers, leading you to have a better-established brand.\nCreators can live stream on YouTube via webcam, mobile, and encoder streaming. Webcam and mobile are considered great options for beginners and allow Creators to go live quickly. Encoder streaming is ideal for more advanced live streams such as: sharing creator’s screen or broadcast your gameplay, connecting to external audio and video hardware, and managing an advanced live stream production (like multiple cameras and microphones).\nWith all of that said, this course will give you the foundation to begin experiencing all of these benefits of using YouTube Live.\nWhat exactly are you going to gain from this masterclass?\nOur masterclass starts out by teaching you the basics of YouTube Live. You will learn, through a series of over-the-shoulder video courses,\no Setting Up the Account\no Minimum Viable and Basic Equipment\no Going Live from the Desktop\no Going Live from Mobile\no Accessing Multiple Platforms\no Promotional Tools\no Branding Tools\no Video Tools\nNow, if you’re like most people, you’re going to be super excited about what you’re about to learn about real-life marketing strategies.\nBut, it’s possible that you also may be like most people in that the “techy” stuff slows you down\n\nIn fact, it makes some people give up altogether.\n\nBut don’t worry, I’ve got you covered\n\nI recorded a “hands-on”, over the shoulder, step by step video course showing you all of the technical tricks that you’ll need to know to bring the strategies out of the classroom and into your business.\nHere they are:\no Strategy Concept #1: Post Processing the Live Content\no Strategy Concept #2: Advanced Promotional Tools\no Strategy Concept #3: Advanced Marketing Tools\no Strategy Concept #4: Setting Up For Lead Generation\no Strategy Concept #5: Social Promotion Options\no Strategy Concept #6: Website Promotion\no And Even More Than This…\n\n\nAt the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge and understanding to begin selling your products and expertise worldwide through the YouTube platform.\nWhile other courses leave you confused and only give you a glimpse of how to set up YouTube Live, this is an A-Z guide - the complete course on YouTube Live!\n\n\nNow, I want my students to always feel comfortable when they make a purchase, that's why I have uploaded multiple free videos for you to view at any time. As well, for each lesson, I give you a PDF eBook, walking you through each of the screens we work within the video lessons. This will allow you to stop the video lesson, look at the pdf, and perform the step yourself, before moving on to the next step.\n\n\nYOU HAVE NOTHING TO RISK BUT EVERYTHING TO GAIN!\nYours sincerely,\nEd Rubuliak\nProfessor",

In one year, my blog traffic increased 15 times over primarily because of social media. Just like anyone else, I struggled with social media in the beginning, but after learning a few game-changing tactics to grow my social media audience, I started to get the results that I now have today.\nI currently have over 200,000 social media followers across all of my platforms and I interact with hundreds of people on them every day. It's fair to say I am living the advanced version of a teenage dream :)\nIn this course, I will share with you the methods I used to go from no audience to over 200,000 social media followers in a time effective manner. Since I go to school, write blog posts, and create products, I don't have much time to work on growing my social media platforms, but the time that I use on my social media platforms is spent very effectively. In fact, I gain hundreds of followers across these platforms every day.\nAll you have to do to get lifetime access to all of the lectures on my course and the lectures I add in the future is to click the \"Take This Course\" button.

      "description": "Hi! Are you having a hard time growing your YouTube Channel? Getting more views, more likes, and more subscribers?\nI spent years growing my account and had the hardest time getting people to watch my videos and subscribe to my channel.\nBut recently I was hired by YouTube as a content marketing Consultant.\nAfter learning the secrets from working with YouTube headquarters, I was able to rank my videos.\nOne of my videos was ranked number 4 in 22 hours with 1.2k views.\nAnother of my video was ranked number 3 in 8 Hours. With only 18 views.\nAnd another video was, get this, ranked number 1 on YouTube in 1 hour, with no views, which was totally insane!\nMy subscribers grew from 0 subscribers a day to 30 a day. And I was even able to make money using YouTube’s traffic without YouTube Monetization. Bypassing their 4000 public watch hour threshold.\nBut it wasn’t good enough that I got results for myself. I created a simple to follow system for people who just created their channel or for YouTubers struggling to grow and get their videos seen for years.\nIt shouldn’t be a secret to grow on YouTube.\nIt’s just 3 simple steps.\n1, Research what videos to make\n2, Make the video\nAnd 3, Publish and promote the video.\nSimple right? So why was it so hard for me and others to grow on YouTube?\nBecause if don’t research the right keywords to target and rank for, you are basically creating videos that people are not searching for and your video will never be found.\nIf you don’t know how to script your video in a way that makes people want to start watching and continue watching, the YouTube algorithm will see you have low audience retention and won’t recommend your videos to others.\nAnd if you just publish your video without the right SEO strategy, and without promoting it the right way. It’s like a movie premiere in the middle of nowhere. No one will know your video exist and your video will be lost forever.\nMy goal is to help you stop making these mistakes.\nLet me show you how to do keyword research the right way, using software that were designed for YouTube Growth.\nLet me show you how to script your videos so that people will not only watch your videos from start to finish but start binge watching them on your channel like how they binge watch Netflix shows.\nAnd let me show you how to publish your videos the right way, with the right SEO secrets so that you get a burst of views and traffic as soon as you post. Getting the YouTube Algorithm to wake up and start recommending your video in the related videos section.\nI already planned everything out for you. All you have to do is sit back, relax and follow along. Let me show you what is waiting for you in our YouTube growth adventure.\nI’ll see you in the next episode",
