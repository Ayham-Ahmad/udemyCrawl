      "description": "This Personal Finance course will give you all insights how to manage Personal Finance and move towards financial stability. I personally believe the power of finance and understand how exponentially it can impact your financial planning.\n\n\nThe core areas of managing personal finance include income, spending, savings, investments, and protection.\nSmart personal finance involves developing strategies that include budgeting, creating an emergency fund, paying off debt, using credit cards wisely, saving for retirement, and much more.\nBeing disciplined is important, but it’s also good to know when you shouldn't adhere to the guidelines.\nPersonal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, and retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment opportunities.\nIndividual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s essential to become financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions.\nAreas of Personal Finance\nThe five areas of personal finance are income, saving, spending, investing, and protection.\nIncome\nIncome is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow.\nSpending\nSpending is an outflow of cash and typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever an individual uses their income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.\nBeing able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. Individuals must ensure their spending is less than their income; otherwise, they won't have enough money to cover their expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high-interest rates credit cards charge.\nSaving\nSavings is the income left over after spending. Everyone should aim to have savings to cover large expenses or emergencies. However, this means not using all your income, which can be difficult. Regardless of the difficulty, everyone should strive to have at least a portion of savings to meet any fluctuations in income and spending—somewhere between three and 12 months of expenses.\nBeyond that, cash idling in a savings account becomes wasteful because it loses purchasing power to inflation over time. Instead, cash not tied up in an emergency or spending account should be placed in something that will help it maintain its value or grow, such as investments.\nInvesting\nInvesting involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested. Investing aims to increase an individual's wealth beyond the amount they invested. Investing does come with risks, as not all assets appreciate and can incur a loss.\nInvesting can be difficult for those unfamiliar with it—it helps to dedicate some time to gain an understanding through readings and studying. If you don't have time, you might benefit from hiring a professional to help you invest your money.\nProtection\nProtection refers to the methods people take to protect themselves from unexpected events, such as illnesses or accidents, and as a means to preserve wealth. Protection includes life and health insurance and estate and retirement planning.\nPersonal Finance Services\nSeveral financial planning services fall under one or more of the five areas. You're likely to find many businesses that provide these services to clients to help them plan and manage their finances. These services include:\nWealth Management\nLoans and Debt\nBudgeting\nRetirement\nTaxes\nRisk Management\nInvestments\nInsurance\nCredit Cards\nHome and Mortgage",

Learners will also understand why knowing personal finance concepts is important.\nYou will know how to set goals using a formal structure and process based on your personal life situations.\nWe will also cover time value of money concepts, including present value and future value calculations. Time value of money concepts will be important whenever we are making long term plans, such as retirement plans or a child’s college education funding plan.\nHuman beings are quite good at making the day-to-day decisions, often doing so by instinct and habit. However, we are not so good at making long-term, risk verses reword, decisions. Therefore, a more formal process is often needed for longer-term decisions which could have large impacts. Time value of money concepts will be a critical component of the long-term decision process.",

This will allow you to understand Tesla’s business very well.\nIt is a fascinating firm that has already made huge steps towards achieving its mission: accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. The entire auto industry is focused on electric vehicles, in large part because of how successful Tesla has been.\n\n\nTesla is a more expensive company than well-established traditional auto industry players like BMW and Daimler.\nAnd yet it sells far fewer cars compared to these companies.\n\n\nAccording to investment banking analysts “Tesla has a brand following that is second only to Apple’s”\n\n\nTesla has established itself as the main innovator in the EV field.\nBut its CEO, Elon Musk, decided to open-source all of the company’s patents.\n\n\nThis is but one reason why Mr Musk is seen as the most exciting entrepreneur of this generation.\nWhile many feel he can do no wrong, he also runs multiple multibillion-dollar businesses and it is unclear how much time he is able to spend on Tesla.\n\n\nOn our journey, we will encounter and analyse many contradictions surrounding Musk and Tesla. This is precisely what makes Tesla a perfect case study. Our goal with this course was to create a holistic, 360 degrees experience, that studies multiple facets of the company.\nWe will go beyond just analyzing financial statements. Our approach encompasses a comprehensive examination of the company from multiple perspectives, ensuring a deeper and more holistic understanding of its operations.\nStrategy:\nHow does Tesla intend to compete in the EV market?\nWhat are the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats?\nWhy is Tesla regarded as the ‘new Apple’?\nWhich are the competitive advantages and traits that make the two companies similar?\nHow is Tesla’s partnership with SpaceX going to help the company in the long-run?\nWhat is Tesla’s mission and vision?\nHow does Tesla’s business look from a strategic perspective after performing the 5-forces analysis?\nWhat was the rationale behind Tesla’s merger with Solar City, the renewable energy company?\nHow does renewable energy align with the electric vehicles business of the company?\nMarketing:\nWho is in Tesla’s target market?\nHow could we describe the firm’s ideal customer?\nWhat kind of segmentation problems could Tesla run into in the future?\nIs the company’s pricing coherent with the competitive strategy it has chosen?\nHow does Elon Musk leverage personal branding?\nWhy will this help Tesla in the long run?\nFinancial Statement Analysis:\nWhat do the company’s financial ratios show about historical performance?\nIs Tesla a growing business?\nHow profitable is Tesla?\nHow much working capital investment does the company need?\nHow likely is it that Tesla will have liquidity difficulties in the near future?\nAre there any issues from a solvency perspective?\nFinancial Modeling and Valuation:\nHow to forecast vehicle deliveries over the next 10 years.\nHow to forecast average selling price of the types of vehicles to be delivered over the next 10 years.\nWhat portion of revenues would expenses like Cogs and Opex account for?\nHow to forecast fixed asset investments and working capital needs.\nHow much is Tesla’s weighted average cost of capital?\nIs Tesla’s DCF valuation in line with its current market price?\nThis course is perfect for aspiring financial analysts, investment bankers, business analysts, consultants, or corporate executives. The skills you will acquire are the perfect blend of soft and technical skills that will give you an edge in interviews.\nThis course comes with Udemy's 30-day no questions asked money back guarantee.

Production Order Creation:\nA production order is created capturing the manufacturing details of the CO-products.\n8. Production Observations:\nObserve variances, production efficiencies, and other aspects during the manufacturing process.\n9-10. Production Completion and Accounting:\nThe completion of the order involves goods issue, activity confirmation, and goods receipt. The accounting entry captures the value of produced CO-products.\n11. Preliminary Settlement:\nInitial distribution of costs among CO-products based on equivalence numbers.\n12-13. Variance Calculation and Settlement:\nAny variance between planned and actual costs is calculated and settled among the CO-products.\nBy-Product Costing Process\nBy-products are secondary products that arise during the production of a main product. They have some value but are secondary to the main product.\n1-3. G/L Account Creation and Configuration:\nA dedicated account for capturing the value of by-products. This is configured in OKTZ and OBYC settings.\n4-6. Material and Production Design:\nCreate a main material and a by-product in the material master. Design the BOM and routing accordingly.\n7. Standard Cost Estimation (CK11N & CK24):\nDetermine the standard cost for the main product.\n8-10. Production and Accounting:\nExecute the production cycle, record the emergence of the by-product, and capture the corresponding accounting entry.\nSpecial Procurement Process\nThis process is used for transferring products from one plant (like manufacturing) to another (like sales or depot).\n1. New Plant Creation:\nA new plant (typically a sales or depot plant) is created by copying configurations from an existing plant.\n2. Special Procurement Key Configuration:\nFor the depot plant, define how the procurement will take place (typically from another plant).\n3. Standard Costing Estimation:\nDetermine the standard cost of the material in both the manufacturing and depot plants.\n4. Transfer Posting:\nMaterials are transferred from the manufacturing plant to the depot/sales plant. This reflects a change in stock and may or may not have financial implications based on the configuration.\nThese processes in SAP ensure that production scenarios, whether they involve co-products, by-products, or special procurement scenarios, are captured in detail, enabling accurate costing and financial reporting.",

For example:\nShould you buy or lease that car (and how much should you pay)?\nShould you rent an apartment or buy a house?\nCan you afford an extra vacation if you cut back on going to the movies?\nYou'll see instant improvements in your financial well being:\nReduce your \"waste\" spending\nLess worrying each month about forgetting bills, or not being able to pay them\nBe prepared for making investments, applying for loans and credit without digging through years worth of receipts\nHopefully this course will be like giving yourself a raise.

      "description": "In today’s volatile business environment, understanding how companies navigate financial distress is an essential skill for finance professionals. Corporate Debt Restructuring and Bankruptcy is a practical, scenario-based course that equips you with the tools to analyze distressed firms, implement restructuring strategies, and perform valuation in bankruptcy situations.\nYou will explore the complete restructuring lifecycle—from the strategic rationale behind mergers and demergers to modeling distressed cash flows and navigating bankruptcy laws. With rich case studies, GAAP vs. market-based balance sheet simulations, and advanced valuation models, this course mirrors the real-world challenges faced by equity analysts, investment bankers, and restructuring consultants.\n\n\nSection 1: Introduction\nThis section introduces the fundamentals of corporate restructuring, providing clarity on when and why companies pursue it. You’ll explore the lifecycle of restructuring decisions, understand strategic triggers, and assess how distressed scenarios lead to either value destruction or value transformation.\nSection 2: Types of Restructuring\nDive into the different forms of restructuring: mergers (horizontal, concentric), amalgamations, joint ventures, demergers, equity carve-outs, divestitures, and capital reduction. You'll learn the motivations behind each move and how these decisions reflect broader strategic and financial goals. This section also includes insights into sector-specific models like power sector restructuring.\nSection 3: Corporate Debt Restructuring Case Study\nThrough a comprehensive case study, you’ll apply theoretical concepts in practice. You’ll work with GAAP and market-based balance sheets, simulate various restructuring events (stock offering, acquisitions, credit term changes), and build DCF models pre- and post-restructuring. You’ll also explore out-of-court restructuring strategies and bankruptcy waterfall scenarios, incorporating priority rules and recovery estimates.\nSection 4: CDR Mechanism and Financial Restructuring Framework\nUnderstand how institutional mechanisms like Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) function in real life. You'll learn about creditor negotiations, equity conversions, viability assessments (ROCE, DSCR), breakeven analysis, and the ultimate impact on both lenders and company financials. This section shows how restructuring can create—or sometimes fail to create—value for stakeholders.\nSection 5: Valuation of Firms in Distress\nValuing distressed firms requires a modified approach. Here, you’ll examine techniques like the Adjusted Present Value (APV) model, simulate distressed scenarios, estimate the probability of default, and use multiple valuation methods. This section also covers the treatment of going concern assumptions, interest rates based on credit ratings, and levered firm valuation under uncertainty.\nSection 6: Accounting Issues in Restructuring\nGet hands-on with the accounting side of restructuring. You’ll tackle real-world complexities like recognizing bond exchanges, adjusting carrying values, constructing amortization tables, and projecting total future cash flows. This section ensures your valuation models stay consistent with accounting standards and reporting frameworks.\nSection 7: Dan’s Petroleum Case Study\nApply everything you’ve learned through a multi-scenario case study. Dan’s Petroleum undergoes different restructuring strategies—you'll model revenue growth, operating margins, working capital, cash flow statements, capital structure, and leverage. Analyze the financial outcomes of each strategy and assess which restructuring plan maximizes shareholder value.\nSection 8: Conclusion\nWrap up with a reflective overview of the key concepts covered in the course. You’ll revisit the restructuring journey, from strategic planning to execution, valuation, and post-restructuring recovery. Final lectures highlight practical lessons from 2018 and summarize how successful restructuring efforts restore solvency and create long-term value.",

Please keep in mind that this is a niche course: it does not attract massive audiences, which means that every single review carries a very strong weight. A single one-star review can disproportionately affect the overall rating and even remove the course from Udemy Business collections, despite the fact that many learners have found it extremely useful. If you come with extremely high expectations for a graduate-level, highly specialized program, this course may not be the right fit for you. In that case, I kindly suggest you explore alternatives such as Harvard or SDA Bocconi. And if you do decide to enroll but later feel the course is not what you expected, I respectfully ask that you simply use the 30-day refund policy instead of leaving a frustrated review. That way, other learners who truly benefit from this course will still be able to access it.\nThis course has been very well received by hundreds of professionals on Udemy Business, who have found it practical, insightful, and easy to apply. However, it is not for everyone. Many learners, from analysts to managers, have praised the clarity and real-world applications — but again, if you bring extremely high expectations for an academic-level program, this may not fully align with your goals.\nHere is what some of my students are saying:\n“Brilliant course, lots of detail and analysis. The guy is a genius.” – Paul F.\n“The case study made it more relatable and exciting at the same time. Worth it!!” – Mohammad N.\n“It gave me knowledge on PE & much more… great for beginners building their foundation.” – Priya S.\nWelcome Message\nWelcome to the Private Equity: Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs) course, where you will master the evaluation of leveraged buyout transactions. I'm Carlos Martínez, Ph.D., a finance expert with academic and professional experience. I earned my doctorate at the University of St. Gallen, one of Europe’s most prestigious institutions, and my research on entrepreneurial finance has been presented at international conferences (MIT, Politecnico di Milano, University of Tel Aviv, University of Halmstad). My work is also featured in the book New Frontiers in Entrepreneurial Finance Research, co-edited by leading scholars in the field.\nWhat makes this course unique?\nAlongside structured explanations and hands-on case studies, this course now incorporates interactive roleplays powered by Udemy’s latest AI-driven tool. These simulations recreate real-world business scenarios, allowing you not only to learn the concepts but to practice negotiation and decision-making in a safe, guided environment.\nWhat you will learn:\nThe fundamentals of private equity and the investment process.\nHow to evaluate a leveraged buyout transaction using the Adjusted Present Value method.\nA full case study on the LBO of DuPont’s Coatings Division, exploring value drivers such as EBITDA growth, multiple arbitrage, and financial leverage.\nHow to build and use an Excel model to simulate valuation scenarios.\nPractical decision-making through roleplays and interactive exercises.\nWho is this course for?\nAmbitious students and young professionals aiming for careers in investment banking, corporate finance, consulting, or private equity.\nProfessionals from diverse fields (finance, accounting, business, law) seeking to build a solid understanding of LBOs.\nLearners who value clarity, real-world applications, and interactive practice.\nLevel: Intermediate. A basic understanding of free cash flow and NPV is assumed.\nThis course is designed to demystify Private Equity and make LBOs accessible, practical, and relevant. If your goal is to strengthen your foundation, build confidence, and experience decision-making in a controlled environment, you’ll find tremendous value here.\nI look forward to welcoming you into the fascinating world of Private Equity.

      "description": "BANKING ON BANKING KNOWLEDGE\nIf you're considering a banking career path, you probably know it will be profitable, regardless of the specific function within it.\nBut if you want to understand how banks work, there is a lot of knowledge to be consumed.\nYou must understand about how banks make money, what risks they manage, what regulations they comply with, and much more.\nYou have to really master banking knowledge.\nYou will find that most courses don't cover all dimensions of banking. They focus on credit analysis only. Or on risks only.\nYou couldn't really find a course that included all different areas of banking in one unified place.\n... that is, until this course came along.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRACKING THE BANK OPEN\nUnlike other courses, focusing on specific components of a bank's business model (just digital banks, just investment banks), you'll find this course covers the banking industry as a whole, including all of its different components.\nAnd I mean ALL of them!\nYou'll find this comprehensive course divided into seven main modules:\nYou'll first know about the Fundamentals, where we cover what is banking, different types of banking (digital banking, retail banking, investment banking, central banking), as well as the essentials of lending, capital and reserves, and some key acts and regulations;\nThen you'll find the Banking Business Models module, where we will cover how banks make money, their types of income and expenses, types of capital, and accounting considerations;\nThe you'll find the Bank Products module, where we will cover the most frequent bank debt and deposit products that are offered, as well as some considerations on how bank product marketing is done;\nYou'll then get to know about the Loan Agreements module, where we will dissect credit agreements in terms of lending. We'll clarify covenants, representations, definitions such as what is \"debt\" or what is \"EBITDA\", and more;\nYou'll later come to the Banking Risk Management module, where we will cover the most relevant types of risks for banks, both extensively (from liquidity risk to cyber risk, conduct risk, counterparty risk and many others), as well as the two key ones: credit risk and interest-rate risk;\nFinally, you'll find the Banking Compliance module, where we will cover the most frequent types of regulations that banks must comply with - both regulatory and industrial;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU...

We'll also cover the most frequent types of maintenance covenants - coverage ratios, including the three most common ones: the Interest Coverage ratio, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), and the Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio (FCCR) - as well as other frequent covenants such as the leverage ratio or limits on leases and capital expenditures;\nFinancial Risk Management Course (integrated as a module):\nYou'll learn about the essentials of credit risk (both default risk and migration risk), as well as other risks related to credit risk itself, such as concentration risk, default correlation risk, and even contagion risk;\nYou'll learn about credit portfolio management, including the four pillars of robust credit risk management (efficient limits, robust lending processes, efficient quantitative analysis and efficient qualitative analysis), the four main techniques to mitigate credit risk (including loan sales, loan securitisation, loan syndication, and hedging with Credit Default Swaps), and the key terms in credit portfolio management (including PD or Probability of Default, LGD or Loss Given Default, EAD or Exposure at Default, and EL or Expected Loss);\nYou'll learn about the three layers of market risk (general market risk, secondary risk for specific portfolios/groups of positions, and idiosyncratic risk unique to positions), as well as the six key categories of market risk (price movements in equities, interest rates, credit, commodities, currencies, and real estate);\nYou'll learn about interest rate risk in specific, as well as the three main subtypes of it (basis risk, gap risk and option risk), what causes each, and how it's usually hedged against;\nYou'll learn about the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology to measure market risk, its limitations, variations such as Stressed VaR demanded by Basel III, and the Expected Shortfall (ES) methodology that replaces VaR under the Basel Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), as well as the key differences between VaR and ES;\nYou'll learn about other measures of risk that complement VaR, including simple statistical measures such as standard deviation and downside deviation, and other measures related to losses, such as the Months to Earn Back a Loss, the maximum drawdown or maximum drawdown's months, and percentage of months with losses, among others;\nYou'll learn about operational risk in general, as well as the five key types of operational risk under Basel II classification (internal process risk, people risk, legal and compliance risk, external risk, and systems or cyber risk);\nYou'll learn about the specific types of internal process risk (wrong information, missing information, lack of controls, circumvention of controls);\nYou'll learn about the specific types of systems risk (service interruptions, missing or corrupted information, model risk, and cyber risk in specific), as well as how cyber risk is usually leveraged through hacking (and the multiple approaches to it, including convenience fraud, identity theft, social engineering and phishing, or trojans and viruses);\nYou'll learn about the specific types of people and conduct risk, and usual manifestations (risky trading, product mispricing, interbank rate fixing, sanctioned person transactions, etc), as well as some key causes (employee rotation, misaligned incentive systems, and lack of control function integration/oversight);\nYou'll learn about legal and compliance risk, as well as the specific types of regulation that, when not complied with, can cause sanctions by the regulators, and how banks have a \"compliance appetite\" parallel to their risk appetite;\nYou'll learn about modeling risk, its two main types (bad models and good models with bad data), as well as measures to hedge against model risk, including the FRB's SR 11-7 recommendations (model documentation, model validation, and governance over all model policies and practices);\nYou'll learn about trading leverage and liquidity risk. We'll cover the two types of leverage (borrowing or explicit leverage vs notional or implicit leverage), the role of counterparty risk in embedded leverage for derivatives, and the types of liquidity risk (illiquid assets, large positions of assets, client concentration or position concentration);\nYou'll learn about the different areas of Basel regulation for banks, including how the Basel Accords have evolved to include credit risk, market risk and operational risk, the three main approaches to calculate these risks, and the changes to these approaches over time;\nYou'll learn about the approaches for credit risk regulatory capital calculation, including the Standardised Approach with weights for borrower ratings, as well as the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approaches, and the measures that must be calculated by banks in both the Foundation IRB approach and the Advanced IRB approach;\nYou'll learn about the approaches for market risk regulatory capital calculation, including the Standardised Approach with weights for different risks of each asset (and including additional charges depending on the Basel version, such as the IRC or Incremental Risk Charge for credit-sensitive assets and the CRM or Comprehensive Risk Measure for securitised products), as well as the Internal Models approach, historically using Value at Risk (VaR), but with possible changes depending on the Basel iteration (Stressed VaR since Basel III, and replacement of VaR with Expected Shortfall since the Basel FRTB), as well as the requirements to use each;\nYou'll learn about the changes that the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) brings to the calculation of market risk, both in terms of the Internal Models Approach (97.5% Expected Shortfall for 5 liquidity intervals and all trading desks), but also in terms of the Standardised Approach (including changing risk weights to a sensitivities approach, including a risk charge (delta + vega + curvature), a default risk charge and a residual add-on);\nYou'll learn about the approaches to calculate operational risk regulatory capital, including the Basic Indicator approach (a percentage of total gross revenue), the Standardised Approach (specific percentages of gross revenue for 8 distinct business lines) and the Advanced Measurement Approach (by using internal models), as well as the requirements to use each;\nFundamentals of Financial Institution Compliance (integrated as a module)\nYou'll learn about the essentials of compliance. The main goals of compliance (keeping the financial system stable, ensuring banks are safe and sound, protecting customers + investors), the distinction between regulation, supervision/monitoring and enforcement, as well as what each entails, the four key areas of bank regulation (micro-prudential, macro-prudential, consumer protection and anti-crime), the differences between rules-based and principles-based regulation, and the relationship between compliance and risk management;\nYou'll get to know the three main conflicts between profit and compliance: How regulatory capital cushions create capital that does not yield returns, how AML/CFT regulation sets constraints on possibly suspicious (but very lucrative) private banking activity, and how consumer protection, preventing predatory practices, also makes banks less competitive and turn less profit. Also, how banks perform regulatory arbitrage, finding the most dangerous way possible to comply with regulation;\nYou'll learn about the regulatory landscape in the US and EU. The three main bank regulators in the US (OCC, FDIC and FR), and how each bank has 1 to 3 of these as regulators, and under what conditions. Also, under what conditions the FDIC insures deposits, the moral hazard created by it (for both banks and consumers), and the 3 possible measures the FDIC takes upon conservatorship of a failing bank (paying out depositors, selling the bank, government bailout), as well as the Prompt Corrective Action or PCA program that supervises banks and enforces quality to preserve FDIC insurance.

      "description": "This course explains in detail the importance of Mergers and Acquisitions between two corporates. It also explains how it will impact the particular sector or industry and what are the pros and cons. Mergers and Acquisitions happen when two or more organizations merge their operations either partially or completely together\nAcquisition in a broad sense means the takeover of one company by another, when the businesses of both the companies are brought together as one. In a narrow sense, it is the coming together of two companies which are equal in size.\nThe two largest UK Pharmaceutical companies, viz. Glaxo Wellcome and Smith Kline Beecham planned to merge their business operations in January 1998. This deal was worth more than £100 billion, but was abandoned at a later stage. If it had succeeded, it would have created the biggest drug manufacturing company in the UK as well as the third biggest organization in the world.\nThe move followed a number of mergers in the industry over a period of 5 years before this happened, which were largely driven by opportunities for cutting costs by way of merging their individual research and development facilities.\nIn full acquisition, the entire share capital is purchased by the acquirer. In partial acquisition, only a part of the share capital, i.e., more than 10% but less than 50% is obtained by the acquirer. A joint venture is a type of partnership business where two or more organizations invest cash or assets in a particular project or business. The partners or the people who invest can form a separate company for this purpose according to their investment ratio.",

      "description": "Today, most customers have smartphones and other gadgets, giving them easy access to online services. Digital banking is the process of digitalization of banking activities and services that were previously available only in the branches.\nThe history of these banks dates to 1993 when Temenos AG banking software system provider was founded. In 1994, Microsoft Money made bank accounts accessible for regular households.\nDuring 1997 and 1998, digital-only banks were launched in Canada and the United States of America (USA).\nBetween 2001 and 2009, the number of online banking users reached 54 million only in the USA. This shift was greatly aided by the launch of the first iPhone in 2007.\nOver the years, the transition towards online banking was driven by millennials and Temenos acquiring various competitors and mobile application leaders.\nFintech refers to technology-enabled innovation in financial services. This technological sea change is transforming the financial sector and the wider economy, affecting all aspects of our work - from payments to monetary policy to financial regulation. Central banks have a responsibility to be at the vanguard of the intensifying debates about the nature of money in a digital world and how new players will reshape the financial services landscape and the financial system more broadly.\nRapid advances in digital technology are transforming the economic and financial landscapes.\nFinancial technology -- fintech -- is creating new opportunities and challenges for the financial sector – from consumers, to financial institutions and new entrants, to regulators.\nFintech offers many opportunities for governments, from making their financial systems more efficient and competitive to broadening access to financial services for the under-served populations. However, it can also pose potential risks to consumers and investors and, more broadly, to financial stability and integrity.",

Traditional banking models are making way for innovative approaches that align with the changing needs of society and the environment. The emergence of retail and digital banking, coupled with the growing focus on sustainability, has created a demand for professionals equipped with specialized knowledge. One such path to expertise is through the Master Course in Retail & Digital Banking, Green Banking, and Sustainable Banking.\nUnderstanding the Evolution of Banking\nBefore diving into the details of this master course, let's briefly explore the evolving banking landscape.\n1. Retail & Digital Banking: The rise of technology has revolutionized the way we bank. Traditional brick-and-mortar branches are being complemented, and in some cases, replaced, by digital banking platforms. Retail banking now involves a wide range of digital services, from mobile apps to online account management, transforming customer experiences and expectations.\n2. Green Banking: As environmental concerns take center stage, banks are increasingly incorporating sustainable practices into their operations. Green banking focuses on environmental responsibility, which includes reducing carbon footprints, investing in renewable energy, and supporting eco-friendly initiatives.\n3. Sustainable Banking: Going beyond just environmental concerns, sustainable banking encompasses a broader scope of responsibility. It involves considering social and ethical factors, such as financial inclusion, diversity and inclusion, and ethical investing. Sustainable banks aim to create a positive impact on society while maintaining financial stability.\nThe Master Course in Retail & Digital Banking, Green Banking, and Sustainable Banking is your pathway to mastering the future of banking. As the industry continues to evolve and adapt to changing global challenges, professionals with expertise in these areas will be at the forefront of innovation and positive change. Consider enrolling in this master course to gain the knowledge and skills needed to excel in the exciting world of retail and digital banking, green banking, and sustainable banking. Your future in banking awaits, and it's greener and more sustainable than ever before.\nRetail and Digital Banking have evolved significantly, giving rise to specialized roles that blend traditional customer service with advanced technological solutions. Positions such as Retail Banking Officers and Branch Managers focus on customer relationship management, product sales, and branch operations. Meanwhile, Digital Banking Product Managers and Transformation Analysts are tasked with driving the adoption of mobile apps, internet banking, and automated services to enhance customer experience. UX/UI Specialists further contribute by designing intuitive interfaces and improving the usability of digital platforms, ensuring that customer journeys are smooth and engaging.\nIn the realm of Green Banking, job roles are centered around promoting environmentally responsible financial services. Green Finance Specialists and Renewable Energy Loan Officers support sustainable initiatives by facilitating funding for eco-friendly projects such as solar power, green buildings, or electric transport. ESG Compliance Officers ensure that banking practices align with environmental standards and regulations, while Green Marketing Strategists develop campaigns that communicate the benefits of green banking products. These roles collectively aim to reduce the environmental footprint of banking operations and promote responsible lending.\nSustainable Banking expands on these efforts by integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles into all aspects of banking. Roles like Sustainable Investment Analysts and Responsible Lending Officers assess investment and loan opportunities for their long-term impact on people and the planet. Sustainability Reporting Managers oversee transparency through adherence to global sustainability frameworks, while CSR Managers lead community initiatives and social responsibility programs. Impact Risk Analysts play a critical role in embedding ESG risks into the broader risk management strategy, ensuring a more resilient and ethically aligned financial ecosystem.\nIn this master course, i would like to teach the major topics:\n1.

Now looking back, it seems so obvious.\nIf you google important questions like “what is a stock” or “what is a bond”, often what comes up are articles that are written in financial language for people already in the financial industry. I found simple explanations on how money worked, how to think about finances, how to think about assets or liabilities and how to invest to be so much harder to find than necessary.\nWe'll discuss some very important personal finance topics such as compound interest, the risk return tradeoff, what is a stock, bond, or fund, and go over some popular investment philosophies. By the end of the course, these concepts should be intuitively familiar to you. You will additionally be able to identify risks and previously unforeseen issues in investment opportunities that are presented to you.\nCome join me on this course and get a jump start on your personal finance journey!\n\n\nLegal Disclaimer: Performance, calculations, tax, and returns shown in the course are for representation & educational purposes only.

      "description": "WHY DISPUTE RESOLUTION?\nYou may agree that payment disputes are an important issue to solve, either as a merchant, cardholder or bank.\nYou'll find there are many reasons for disputes, and multiple methods for dispute resolution. And you may know all of these can affect the results of a dispute - for all parties involved.\nIn order to be effective at dispute resolution, you'll find it's important to understand not just the reasons for disputes, but also the mechanisms for their resolution, and the consequences of each.\nYou'll find this is the type of knowledge that can be easily acquired - if it's correctly taught.\nUnfortunately, you'll find most dispute management courses nowadays don't fit the minimum requirements.\nEither you'll find they focus only on specific components of the dispute resolution process, not illustrating how they work, or you'll recognise they miss technicalities unique to the banking industry, or miss other important information.\nOr you'll be just bored because they are just too academical and not easily put into practice.\nThis doesn't just hurt your future knowledge of dispute resolution, but also you personally.\nWhen you can't properly understand how disputes are resolved:\nYou'll become confused and frustrated with different dispute resolution types;\nYou won't know how a particular dispute can be successfully resolved;\nYou won't know the correct workflow for dispute resolution in banking;\nYou won't know why certain banks are better than others at the process - or even what matters to their clients;\nYou won't know what specific chargeback reason codes mean;\nSo what is my proposed solution for you to learn all of this content effectively?\nNaturally, it's this course!\n\n\n\n\nTHE UNDISPUTED BEST COURSE\nUnlike other dispute resolution courses out there, you'll find this course is comprehensive and updated.\nIn other words, you'll see that not only does this course cover the different types of dispute resolution (namely, ADR approaches), you'll find it will also cover the ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) framework and how it works, then diving into dispute resolution for banking in specific, and you'll also obtain a detailed rundown of all types of chargeback reason codes, and the way to address each of them.\nIn this course, we will cover topics such as:\nYou'll get to know what the different types of payment disputes are, represented by different reason codes for chargebacks;\nYou'll learn how both the issuing and acquiring bank interact in the case of a chargeback situation, as well as the dispute resolution process;\nYou'll get to know the different ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) methods  (usually grouped into negotiation, mediation and arbitration), as well as specific implementations of these;\nYou'll know more about the ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) standard, what it represents, its advantages, and how it's implemented;\nThis course is aimed at you if you're any professional that has to deal with dispute resolution in their everyday life, and especially related to payment systems. It's for you if:\nYou're a dispute resolution professional at an acquiring or issuing bank;\nYou're a merchant that deals with cardholder disputes;\nYou're a consumer that is interested in knowing how to deal with disputes with merchants;\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to effectively diagnose what causes specific payment disputes, as well as what the process is to deal with them, and the different dispute resolution procedures available to you.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PERFECT COURSE... FOR WHOM?\nThis course is targeted at different types of people. Naturally, if you're any current or future dispute management professional, you will find this course useful. But if you're any other professional that aims to know more about how disputes are resolved, you will also find it useful.\nMore specifically, you're the ideal student for this course if:\nYou will directly deal with dispute management or resolution;\nYou want to know more about the different types of dispute resolution (both litigation and ADR, offline or not);\nYou want to specifically know how to address disputes involving merchants and cardholders (as a bank or merchant);\nYou want to know more about the different types of reason codes for chargebacks (and how to prevent them);\nYou want to know how to perform dispute resolution using multiple methods (negotiation, mediation and/or arbitration);\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn about the essentials of disputes (contractual vs. non-contractual disputes, payment disputes, issuer and acquirer banks);\nYou'll learn about how ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) is and how it differs from litigation;\nYou'll learn what the different types of ADR are (negotiation, mediation and arbitration), as well as the differences between these, and specific implementations of them;\nYou'll learn about the ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) framework, as well as its context and six key principles (accountability, transparency, accessibility, credibility/accreditation, security and enforceability);\nYou'll learn about the three major steps in an ODR process;\nYou'll learn about the three major types of ODR tools (cyber courts, electronic ADR, internal ADR);\nYou'll learn about implementations of ODR (such as blind bidding, cyber mediation, cyber negotiation and cyber arbitration), as well as specific case studies, such as ICANN-WIPO;\nYou'll learn about general guidelines for more efficient dispute resolution as a merchant bank;\nYou'll learn about the steps in the lifecycle of a dispute between an issuer and an acquirer bank, including the retrieval request, chargeback, and second chargeback;\nYou'll learn about the conditions under which the payment scheme may become involved in a chargeback, as well as some measures by them (allocation vs. mediation, pre-arbitration vs. arbitration, liability shifts);\nYou'll learn about disputes by different payment systems: debit cards, credit cards, ACH, prepaid cards, ATM;\nYou'll learn about the four major categories of chargeback reason codes: fraud, authorization errors, processing errors,  customer disputes;\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to fraud (not authorised or recognised transactions, fraudulent processing, monitored merchant or monitored card, the EMV liability shift);\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to authorization issues (missing or declined authorisation, card in recovery/lost card/stolen card, invalid authorization information),\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to processing errors (late presentment, invalid transaction code or invalid transaction data, duplicated payment or paid by other means, currency mismatches);\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to consumer disputes (mismatches in terms of goods - counterfeit, misrepresented, not delivered, others - cancelled or incomplete transactions, credit not processed);\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit.

We will discuss convertible bonds, warrants, & derivative securities.\nWe will include many example problems, both in the format of presentations and Excel worksheet problems. The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.\nConvertible securities are securities that can be converted from one asset type into another asset type. Convertible bonds are one of the most common types of convertible securities. Convertible bonds have the option, but not the obligation, for a bondholder to convert the bond to some number of stocks.\nThe conversion feature in convertible securities makes them more difficult to value then other securities. For example, we can attempt to value a convertible bond by calculating the value of the related stock it could be converted into or by valuing bonds of a similar class which do not have a conversion option.\nWarrants are an option to buy a set number of shares of common stock at a specified price over a given time.\nDerivative securities are financial instruments whose value depends upon the value of another asset. Common examples of derivative securities are futures, forwards, options, and swaps.",

Here are the primary components:\nCost Classification:\nDirect Costs: These are costs that can be directly traced to a specific product, project, or department. Examples include materials and labor used to manufacture a product.\nIndirect Costs: Indirect costs cannot be directly traced to a specific cost object (product, project, etc.). Examples include rent, utilities, and administrative salaries.\nVariable Costs: Costs that change in direct proportion to changes in production or activity levels. For instance, raw materials costs increase as production volume rises.\nFixed Costs: Costs that remain constant regardless of changes in production or activity levels. Examples include rent for a production facility and management salaries.\nCost Behavior Analysis:\nUnderstanding how costs behave is crucial. Costs can be categorized as fixed, variable, semi-variable, or step costs. This analysis helps in cost prediction and decision-making.\nCosting Methods:\nJob Costing: Assigning costs to specific jobs or projects. Common in industries like construction and custom manufacturing.\nProcess Costing: Allocating costs to a continuous production process. Common in industries like food processing and chemicals.\nActivity-Based Costing (ABC): Allocating costs based on activities that consume resources. Useful for a more accurate understanding of costs in complex processes.\nBudgeting and Variance Analysis:\nCreating budgets to plan and control costs. Variance analysis involves comparing actual costs to budgeted costs to identify discrepancies and take corrective actions.\nCost Allocation:\nDistributing indirect costs to various cost centers or cost objects. Allocation methods may include the use of cost drivers or allocation bases.\nCost Control and Reduction:\nImplementing strategies and techniques to manage and reduce costs while maintaining or improving the quality of products or services.\nCost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis:\nEvaluating the relationship between costs, volume (production or sales), and profit to make pricing and production decisions.\nDecision-Making with Cost Data:\nUsing cost information to make informed decisions, such as pricing, product mix, make-or-buy decisions, and capital investment choices.\nPerformance Measurement and Metrics:\nEstablishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to evaluate the financial performance of an organization or specific cost centers. Balanced scorecards are often used for this purpose.\nEthical Considerations:\nAdhering to ethical standards and principles in cost management and accounting practices, including transparency, integrity, and fairness.\nCost Reporting and Analysis:\nPreparing financial reports and cost analysis to provide management with insights into cost structures and performance.\nCost Management Software:\nUtilizing specialized software and tools for cost tracking, analysis, and reporting. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems often include cost management modules.\nUnderstanding and effectively managing these components of cost management and accounting are essential for organizations to make informed decisions, optimize resources, and achieve financial goals.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nDuring many consulting projects, you will be asked to estimate the value of a firm or business units belonging to that firm. This will be especially true during strategic projects, due diligence projects, and M&A projects. That is why it is a good idea to master different valuation techniques and see how you can present the business model in Excel. In this course, I will teach you how to estimate the value of firms during consulting projects.\nIn the course you will learn the following things:\nEssential concepts used in valuation\nWhat techniques you can use to estimate the value of the firm\nHow to create a simple financial model in Excel\nHow to estimate the value of complex firms with many different business units\nHow to approach non-operating assets during the valuation\nWhat is Multiplier Arbitrage\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 200 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nValuation is a pretty difficult task that you have to perform during most strategic projects. You have to master different skills and tools that you will be using during such projects, especially financial modeling, identifying synergies, and potential improvements. Most firms don’t give you the full toolbox that you need during such projects. This may lead to huge frustration during consulting projects that require doing valuation and a lot of inefficiencies.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students understand or refresh the main skills and tools that they need to do the valuation of companies. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do when you will have to do company valuation. You will master how to analyze data and draw conclusions from the analyses.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of company valuation. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those that did not finish business school. The course will help you become an expert in valuation on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nEssential concepts used in valuation\nWhat techniques you can use to estimate the value of the firm\nHow to create a simple financial model in Excel\nHow to estimate the value of complex firms with many different business units\nHow to approach non-operating assets during the valuation\nWhat is Multiplier Arbitrage\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little introduction to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nEssential Concepts. Every good methodology requires solid foundations. That’s why we will first look at essential concepts that are heavily used in valuation.\nCash Flow. For some valuation methods extremely important is the Cash Flow. In this section, we will look at it in more detail.\nEssential Valuation Techniques. In valuation, we will usually use 2 groups of methods. We will discuss them in this section, using a ready-made financial model. Later, you will learn how to create such a model.\nFinancial Modeling. As you have noticed to do valuation in some cases, we will have to create a financial model. We will see how this can be done relatively easily.\nAlternative Valuation Techniques. It’s difficult to estimate the value of the firm if it has low profits and low cash flow. In this section, we will see what alternative methods you can use in such situations.\nValuation of Complex Firms. Many firms consist of many different businesses. Those businesses have different Cash Flows, Profits, and expected growth rates. In this section, we will see how we can approach the valuation of complex firms.\nMultiplier Arbitrage. Many firms use the so-called Multiplier Arbitrage to increase the value of a firm. In this section, we will look at the general concept and a case study devoted to this approach.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\n1. Useful frameworks and techniques\n2. Analyses shown in the course\n3. Additional resources\n4. Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies\n5. Links to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nUnderstand the main concepts used in company valuation\nEstimate the value of different firms\nCreate in Excel financial models used for valuation\nDo the valuation of complex firms (with many business units)\nEstimate the value of firms with significant non-core assets\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness Analysts\nManagers\nFinancial Analysts\nInvestment Analysts\nStartup Founders\nManagers responsible for Acquisitions and Mergers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics\nBasic or intermediate knowledge of finance & accounting",

      "description": "Financial statements appear complex and long, their reading requires judgment and practice, people do not know where to start reading and what to look for or people read financial statements in a linear/sequential way without being able to grasp the main elements even red flags related to the company. This course intends to teach you the main reading keys to read, understand & digest financial statements & financial reports.\nAs Warren Buffett stated, if you want to become a better investor you have to understand the language of business which is accounting : “You have to understand accounting and you have to understand the nuances of accounting. It’s the language of business and it’s an imperfect language, but unless you are willing to put in the effort to learn accounting – how to read and interpret financial statements – you really shouldn’t select stocks yourself”\nI took the approach writing this course by looking back myself on what I was missing from my teachers & professors in my accounting & corporate finance classes. This course uses a different approach in reading financial statements and being able to quickly grasp the essence of the company being analysed.\n\n\nAfter taking the course you will be able to :\nIdentify & understand accounting standard used IFRS, US GAAP or Local GAAP\nDifferentiate between 3 main types of financial statements (balance sheet, cash flow & income statement)\nUnderstand the fundamental accounting principles like going concern, fair valuation, principle of prudence, accrual vs cash accounting, etc.\nUnderstand & identify main corporate governance elements including corporate governance 1- or 2-tier models, role of shareholders & board of directors\nUnderstand role of statutory auditor, being able to identify if a report is audited or unaudited; if audited identify who the statutory auditor is, tenure of statutory auditor, comments about statutory auditor’s independence/conflict of interest / related fees and audit opinion\nUnderstand the scope of consolidation (& unconsolidation) of the reporting company and the 4 methods how subsidiaries can be (or not) consolidated into financial statements\nBe able to do a vertical analysis of the balance sheet and understand main profit generating assets and also the sourcers of capital in the balance sheet\nIdentify sources of capital including long-term debt and its related schedule, cost to service long-term debt including interest coverage ratio, equity capital source including potential retained earnings\nDeepen understanding of value creation for shareholders by understanding ROIC & WACC\nUnderstand profitability of company by analysing revenue segments (if available) & cash generating assets, understand operating cash flow & working capital vs financing & investing cash flows\nBe able to read earnings information including EPS, NOPAT, EBITDA, EBIT & net income\n\n\nThe course also contains many practical examples as in all of my courses. We will practice & discussion financials of companies like Kelloggs, Mercedes, Telefonica, 3M, Evergrande, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Unilever, Wells Fargo, Wirecard, CostCo and many more.\nAt the end of the training I will show you the complete process on how I read the financial statements for 3 companies (Vonovia, Qurate, Skywest Airlines) so that you can exactly see and hopefully replicate how I grasp the essence of companies that are not known to me at the beginning.\nLast but not least, adult education without practice, knowledge checks and assignments is only entertainment. For that specific reason the course contains 10+ assignments to practice yourself as homework and share after completion with me for review if you wish.\n\n\nWishing you a lot of success taking this training and hoping it will make you grow as an investor, analyst or corporate professional. Thanking you as well again for selecting my course\nWith thanks\nCandi",

      "target_audience": [
        "Professional Junior Analyst: Ideal for junior analysts in finance, particularly in roles related to capital markets, risk management, or derivatives trading, who have a basic understanding of the field and seek to deepen their knowledge.",
        "College with Major in Finance: Perfectly suited. The course content is directly relevant to finance majors, covering essential topics that would significantly enhance their understanding of interest rate derivatives, financial markets, and instruments. It's likely to complement and deepen the knowledge gained from their other finance courses, providing practical insights into complex financial instruments and market dynamics. This could serve as an advanced elective or part of a specialized track within the finance major.",
        "College with Minor in Finance: Also very well-suited, though the level of detail and the advanced nature of some topics might be challenging for students who have a more limited background in finance. However, for those minoring in finance with a keen interest in capital markets and derivatives, this course could offer a valuable deep dive into areas not fully explored in more general finance courses. It would provide a solid foundation for those considering a career in finance or related fields, even if their major is in another discipline.",
        "Engineering College: Potentially suitable for upper-level undergraduates or postgraduates specializing in financial engineering, but the focus is not primarily on engineering aspects.",

        "Graduate School: Well-suited for graduate students in finance, economics, or related fields, especially those focusing on financial markets, instruments, and derivatives.",
        "Executive: Suitable for executives who need a comprehensive understanding of interest rate derivatives for decision-making, strategy, or oversight, especially within financial institutions or investment firms.",
        "College General: Likely too advanced for general college courses, except possibly for upper-level elective courses in finance or economics majors.",
        "High School: Not suitable or only for gifted students in specialized course. The content is too advanced and specialized for high school curricula."

In this course you will learn everything you need to know about UK personal finance. I have avoided prescriptions that are normally seen on other materials since I understand every situation is different. In this course I will take you through the basics of personal finance and cover things in detail as they apply to the UK. This course is based on my wide UK financial services experience and my personal investing knowledge. I am sure once you have done the course you will be equipped to make your own financial decisions such as investing, pensions, retirement planning, estates planning, budgeting, managing borrowings and many more other things.\n\n\nI have used real life examples as they apply to the UK. I avoided making this course broad so that if you are in the UK you will derive the most value. I have also added some key things such as childcare schemes, home purchase schemes, a comprehensive overview of the UK tax system, how to protect yourself from fraud. I hope you will derive a lot of value from taking on this course.\n\n\nCourse Structure\nI will start by giving you an introduction to investing, and various types of investment products, before moving to pension products. In pensions, I will explain to you the various types of pensions such as workplace, private, government and public sector pension schemes. I will show you how to hold the investments and how to manage them. In the next sections I will talk about investment strategies, debt management & credit ratings. Will the give you an overview of the UK tax system and how to manage your taxes. Afterwards I will take you through the government schemes for home buying and childcare support. I have also included a section for Sharia Financing if it applies to you, or you would like to learn more about it. I have another section on protecting your wealth from fraud, then lastly I share with you some useful personal finance materials, books, magazines and podcasts.\n\n\nLEARN - INVEST - BUILD WEALTH",

      "description": "What is a custodian?\nA custodian in a financial market is an intermediary service firm that keeps securities for safekeeping and administers on behalf of third-party clients like mutual funds, AMCs, Hedge funds, and private equities firms. Custodial services are critical to the smooth operation of financial markets.\nCustody as an industry originated with investors needing to keep securities certificates in a secure location, typically a bank with large vaults. As the financial markets have become more complex, custody has evolved into a trillion-dollar industry providing a range of information, accounting, and fund administration services.\nWhy are custodians essential?\nIn a world where assets are rising in value and distribution, the need for a safe mechanism to handle them is becoming increasingly important. Particularly now that digital, more intangible assets like bitcoin are rising. Banks are beginning to provide custodial services to address these trends. Custodian banks have played a significant role in their expansion since the early colonies in the United States as holders of the money required to create and grow the country.\nAccording to the global custody services market analysis, the global elderly population is growing substantially and is likely to continue during the forecast period. By 2030, the population aged 65 and older in the United States is predicted to reach around 70 million, with similar trends noted in other regions of the world.

This course makes a serious effort to do exactly that.\n'zoom in': Getting the details is very important in corporate finance - a small typo, or a minor misunderstanding can cost a company big. This course gets the details right where they are important.\n'zoom out': Details are important, but not always. You probably don't care about the nitty gritty of accounting for contingent liabilities if you don't know what accounts payable are. This course knows when to switch to the big picture.\nWhat's Covered:\n\nCorporate Finance Introduced: partnerships, proprietorships and the corporation\nThe Agency Problem: How auditors, the board of directors and the capital markets regulator play a role\nFinancial Statements: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income and Cash Flow Statement at exactly the right level of detail\nRatios: Five important types of ratios: liquidity ratios, leverage ratios, turnover ratios, profitability ratios and valuation ratios\nDupont's Identity: Return-on-equity can be decomposed into 3 elements: profits, asset-leanness and leverage.\nExternal Financing Needed (EFN) and the Sustainable Rate of Growth: How fast can a company grow if it chooses to forgo external funding? Every startup should know this, really.\nCommon Accounting Shenanigans: The playbook of financial statement cheats has been studied by auditors and regulators - learn from history so you are not condemned to repeat it.\nCase Studies:\nUnderstanding a company entirely from its investor filings\nFacebook: Fast-growing and profitable, this is the dream stock right now.\nLinkedIn: Versatile, but struggling to break through - the jury seems out on LinkedIn\nTwitter: Bleeding red and slowing growth - Twitter seems to be in trouble.",

Right?\nAfter every five or six words, you stumble on one whose meaning is not clear so you go and search the same. Its explanation is written in a different paragraph. While you carefully read that paragraph you stumble again. This time on some other words or concepts. This loop continues until and eventually, you get a vague idea and exist from the process.\nIn today's world, all the contents are available for free. No one pays for the content, people pay for organized content. Because for bankers time is precious. So I have capsuled my understanding in a form and way so that your life becomes easy in understanding the concepts of IRAC norms.\nThis is not a line by line reading of the existing guidelines that you all have. This is attacking a moderately complicated topic from the right corner and winning it step by step eventually achieving victory. This is about learning why and how the knowledge of IRAC norms can save your life as a banker. This is about how to face the auditors when they are about to classify your account as NPA. Things that are not covered in any textbooks.\nCapital is the most precious thing in today's banking scenario. A bank with more capital has essentially more power towards lending which is our main income-generating activity. Capital need not be airdropped it can be generated by making a profit or by correct classification of assets as per extant norms. Also by avoiding unnecessary slippages to NPA. And the purpose of the tutorial is to show you the way. So the motive behind my content is not only to teach you NPA classification norms but to transform you into agents for capital generation and its preservation.",

      "description": "The first five lectures provide you, in just under an hour, a comprehensive and actionable understanding of the FRTB regulation, enabling you to confidently engage with finance professionals on this important and current topic. This course is a high-impact investment of your time, offering immediate and substantial benefits by distilling complex regulatory requirements into clear, expert-level insights.\nFollowing this, the next five lectures will offer deep insights into the specific features of the Internal Models Approach (IMA). These lectures will cover essential tests, modelable and non-modelable risk factors, stress testing of Expected Shortfall analytics, as well as liquidity risk management, and how FRTB addresses liquidity risk using liquidity horizons.\nThe final lecture dives even deeper, summarizing a study published in June 2024 by ISDA and E&Y. The study analyzes the adoption of IMA at 26 large banks, discussing the most challenging aspects for banks, and offering recommendations to regulators on how adoption could be improved. A 10 minute podcast, AI generated, is also included.\n\n\nSign up for this Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) masterclass to gain critical expertise in one of the most significant regulatory frameworks reshaping global finance. With regulators worldwide accelerating FRTB’s implementation, this course equips you with the knowledge and skills to navigate its complexities, optimize capital strategies, and ensure and discuss compliance. Whether you're a student, associate, seasoned professional or an aspiring finance leader, this course offers the practical insights and tools needed to stay ahead in today's rapidly evolving financial landscape. Don’t miss this opportunity to understand in detail the aspects surrounding the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book.\n\n\nThe urgency and importace of FRTB stems from the fact that global regulators, including the OCC in the U.S., have set firm deadlines for compliance, with the first phase of implementation slated for July 2025. This leaves financial institutions with little time to overhaul their risk management systems, adjust capital strategies, and ensure compliance with the new, more stringent requirements\n\n\nHere are the ten most important things students will learn from the course:\nFRTB Overview and Objectives: FRTB introduces a new market risk capital framework aiming to enhance the robustness of capital requirements, improve risk sensitivity, and reduce variability in market risk-weighted assets (RWA) across jurisdictions.\n\n\nTrading Book vs. Banking Book: FRTB enforces a stricter boundary between the trading and banking books, requiring correct classification of instruments, which impacts capital requirements. Instruments in the trading book are exposed to market risk, while banking book instruments are typically held to maturity.\n\n\nStandardized Approach (SA) and Internal Models Approach (IMA): FRTB provides two options for calculating capital requirements - SA, which uses predefined risk weights, and IMA, which allows banks to use their internal models but requires rigorous regulatory validation. Students will understand the operational trade-offs between these two approaches.\n\n\nCalculation Walkthrough for FRTB SA on USD/SOFR vs. Fixed Interest Rate Swap: This lecture provides a comprehensive descriptions and the steps to calculating FRTB SA capital requirements for a USD/SOFR vs. Fixed Interest Rate swap. It includes detailed steps for risk factor identification, sensitivity generation, and aggregation into risk charge components. Supporting materials include an Excel file with detailed calculations and a presentation that explains each step in the process, ensuring practical understanding and application.\n\n\nPython Implementation of FRTB SA Capital Charges: To bridge theory and practice, this lecture includes a complete Python program that replicates the SA calculation for GIRR (General Interest Rate Risk) for the previous Excel example. We step thorugh the source code which facilitates the complete understanding of the SA algorithm.\n\n\nNon-Modellable Risk Factors (NMRFs): NMRFs are risk factors that fail the Risk Factor Eligibility Test (RFET) due to insufficient real price data. These risk factors require additional capital through stress testing, increasing a bank's capital requirements.\n\n\nRisk Factor Eligibility Test (RFET): RFET is essential for determining whether a risk factor is modellable. If a risk factor fails RFET (e.g., lacks sufficient price observations), it is classified as an NMRF, leading to higher capital charges.\n\n\nProfit and Loss Attribution Test (PLAT): PLAT ensures that a bank's internal risk models accurately reflect the daily P&L movements. Passing PLAT is critical for continued eligibility to use the IMA. This test compares hypothetical P&L from the model with actual market P&L, using Spearman Correlation and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.\n\n\nLiquidity Risk and Liquidity Horizons: FRTB incorporates liquidity horizons to measure the time needed to hedge or exit a position under stressed conditions. Different asset classes have varying liquidity horizons, which directly impact capital requirements.\n\n\nChallenges of IMA Adoption: According to the ISDA and E&Y paper, many banks face challenges in adopting IMA, including regulatory uncertainty, high operational complexity, and capital volatility, particularly from NMRFs and the PLAT. This has led several banks to favor the Standardized Approach despite the theoretical capital benefits of IMA.\n\n\nComputational and Data Demands: FRTB’s implementation introduces significant computational demands, especially for banks using IMA, due to the need for high-quality data, daily backtesting, and stress testing. Managing these requirements efficiently is a key implementation challenge.\n\n\nCapital Impact of FRTB: FRTB’s rules are expected to increase capital requirements, particularly for illiquid assets and non-modellable risk factors. The ISDA and E&Y paper highlights the mitigation strategies banks can adopt to manage capital charges, including reforms to the PLAT and adjustments to NMRF capital add-ons.\n\n\nThe course agenda provides a comprehensive understanding of FRTB, equipping participants with practical tools and strategies to enhance their expertise, optimize regulatory compliance, and drive impactful contributions within their organizations' risk management and capital efficiency practices.\nReconciled SA examples in Excel and Python brings the theory close to the practical applications and deepens the understanding of the material.",

I've earned licenses in stocks, commodities, options principal, life insurance, real estate and securities supervisory. I've also been awarded two Emmys and published 5 personal finance books.\nI’ve literally spent my entire adult life offering advice on how to make more and spend less; first as a CPA, then a financial planner and finally as a journalist and the founder/CEO of Money Talks News, where I help more than half a million readers live their best financial lives every day.\nAnd these days, I’m approaching a different phase of my life. If you’re over 45, so are you. Retirement is no longer a vague, “someday” concept. It’s coming, and coming fast.\nWill you be ready?\nIf I have anything to say about it, you will.

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nNo matter how much you earn it’s not easy to build wealth. The money you earn somehow magically disappears although it seems to you that you have been quite frugal. On top of that, it’s difficult to make certain tradeoffs in life where you have to spend money: Should you cook on your own or buy prepared food? Is it better to rent an apartment or buy your own? Should you go for an MBA or not? We are not taught at school to make rational decisions and manage our money and wealth. Luckily, there are a lot of nice management consulting tools, techniques, and frameworks that will help you spend less, be more efficient, earn money, and generate additional income. You don’t have to go to a top consulting firm to learn them. You can master them by taking my course.\nThis course will help you drastically improve your skills in managing money and making more rational choices using management consulting tools, techniques, and frameworks. If you have a specific problem just let me know and I will give you tips on how to solve it using the tools presented in this course.\nThe course is designed for people who want to become more data-driven and less emotional in the way they manage money and make decisions related to money. Thanks to the course you will be making better decisions and you will learn techniques that will help you faster build your wealth.

I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use.

On top of that, you will learn a lot of advanced management consulting techniques, tools, and frameworks that will help you save money and time as well as earn more.\nManagement consulting techniques can help you immensely with the way you manage your money.

Relationship Managers are in the driving seat of Corporate Client Relationships: they set the pace of what happens between the Corporate Client and the Bank, and Banks depend on their capabilities, strategy and performance to achieve results. This course gives you an extensive overview of what is the day to day job of a Relationship Manager in Corporate Banking.\nManaging Corporate Client Relationships requires specific knowledge, high professional standards, several skills, and involves many responsibilities. The course will describe which they are and what it takes to master them all.\nCorporate Client Relationships are often based on large financing deals. Therefore, the course leads you through the process of properly pricing financing offers to the Client, and then through your role in the preparation of credit applications, and how to best prepare to convince approval bodies that the lending relationship you propose is one that the bank should pursue.\nThe course will teach you about crucial topics in Legal and Compliance that a Relationship Manager must dominate, and about your involvement in negotiating a Credit Agreement - one that the Client accepts but also protects the Bank from all the risks it is exposed to. You will learn about leading client meetings, negotiation skills, and corporate banking products. And why not only acquire but also maintain a Corporate Client Relationship that is sustainable and profitable is key for the bank. You will also learn about the rules for socializing with clients and how important they are. All this will be given to you from the perspective of an insider, as if you would be already in the Clients' Department of the Bank, feeling the emotion and challenge that will face you day by day.\nAfter this course, you will be ready to go out there, experience the job, and with time and dedication become a successful and excellent Corporate Banker.\n(if there is music included, credits go to: The Beginning - Factor Eight by Tune Core.)",

Unlike traditional corporate finance, project finance relies on the cash flows generated by the project itself, making the structure, risk allocation, and financial viability critically important.\nInside Project Finance is a concept-driven course that introduces learners to the essential building blocks of project finance. Whether you're a student, early-career professional, or simply curious about how complex infrastructure deals are structured and financed, this course offers clear, practical insights without requiring prior experience in the field.\nParticipants will explore the lifecycle of a project—from conceptualization and feasibility studies to financial structuring, execution, and operations. You’ll learn about Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), debt-equity structuring, concession agreements, key financial metrics like DSCR and IRR, and the importance of security mechanisms such as escrow accounts and debt reserve buffers.\nRisk identification and mitigation is another key focus, covering everything from construction and land acquisition to operational and market risks.\nDesigned in a clear, example-led format, this course builds your understanding step by step, using real-world illustrations to make each concept memorable. By the end, you'll have a solid grasp of how infrastructure projects are evaluated, financed, and made bankable.",

      "description": "A zoom-in, zoom-out, connect-the-dots tour of Equity valuation\nLet's parse that\n'connect the dots': Equity valuation is conceptually complex - that's why plenty of folks mechanically follow the procedures, but don't understand the valuation they end up with. This course makes sure that won't happen to you.\n'zoom in': Getting the details is very important in equity valuation - a small change in an assumption, and the value output by your model changes dramatically. This course gets the details right where they are important.\n'zoom out': Details are important, but not always.  This course knows when to switch to the big picture.\nWhat's Covered:\nEquity Valuation Introduced: intrinsic value, price, valuation and market capitalisation.\nAbsolute Valuation Techniques focus on getting a point estimate of a company's intrinsic value. This is invariably done by discounting a series of cash flows projected into the future.\nNet Present Value and Discounting Cash Flows: NPV is a crucial concept in finance - and in life. Understand what the present value of an asset is, how it relates to the rate of return on the asset, and how risky cash flow streams are handled.\nCAPM, Weighted Average Cost of Capital and Required Equity Return: These are key concepts required in valuing the risky stream of cash flows that represent a company's value.\nDividend Discount Models: A family of absolute value models that discount the dividends from a stock. Despite their seeming simplicity, there is some real wisdom embedded into these models. Understand them.\nFree Cash Flow Valuation: FCF valuation is a serious valuation tool. Understand how to use it right - and when not to use it.\nFCFF and FCFE: The fine print on calculating Free Cash Flows to the Firm, and to Equity holders.",

In case you couldn't tell, finance is incredibly exciting to me, and I hope the knowledge taught in this course will bring you all of the same success it's brought me, saving nearly $15,000 every year using the knowledge I'll be teaching you.\nAlthough many courses on here are taught via lecture slides and voice-overs, I personally hated learning that way and found it very hard to focus. I'm not going to just read off a slide while I sit in my underwear, I'm going to speak directly to you throughout the course in order to keep your attention and have some fun, in addition to walking you through various programs, easy PowerPoint slides, and processes through live screen recordings, with nearly 3 hours of engaging, extremely high-quality 1080p HD video content (filmed on a camera I spent way too much money on, just for this course).\nYou should enroll in my course not only because I've been creating highly in-depth budgets in order to live a very comfortable lifestyle for the past 5 years, but because I will provide you with all of the necessary tools and every ounce of knowledge for you to do the same. Everything from Excel templates to negotiation tools, I made learning the lessons taught in this course as efficient as possible. In addition to that, I will always be available as a mentor for my students to answer questions and guide you along the way.\n\nWhether you're a college student ready to break out into the real world, or an experienced working professional looking to save more money to ensure a more comfortable retirement, I can assure you anyone will find value in this course that will last a lifetime.\nI can assure you that the cost of the course alone will be saved within your first month of budgeting. If you're not completely happy with it, let me know and I will personally find a way to ensure I've helped you in one way or another. If there's really nothing I can do to help you financially, then you're always welcome to take advantage of Udemy's money-back guarantee.\n\nThank you, and I hope to be teaching you soon!",

      "description": "Introduction:\nIn today's rapidly evolving financial landscape, effective risk management is critical for the stability and profitability of banks. This course provides an in-depth understanding of the various types of risks that banks face, including credit, liquidity, interest rate, and foreign exchange risks. Students will explore how risk management frameworks, strategies, and tools are employed to mitigate these risks. Through detailed lectures and practical examples, participants will learn how to assess and manage risk in alignment with regulatory requirements and industry best practices.\nSection 1: Risk Management in Banks\nThis section serves as the foundation of risk management, introducing students to the core concepts and processes involved. The journey begins with understanding what risk is, followed by a detailed exploration of the risk management process, including step-by-step procedures that banks undertake to manage their risks. Students will examine the critical role of the board and senior management in overseeing risk, and how robust internal controls and Management Information Systems (MIS) are essential for effective monitoring. Various types of risks—credit, liquidity, interest rate, and foreign exchange—are analyzed in depth. For each risk type, students will learn about its unique challenges and the corresponding oversight responsibilities, policies, procedures, and measurement techniques employed by financial institutions.\nSection 2: Credit Risk in Banks and Its Management\nThis section focuses on credit risk—the risk of a borrower defaulting on a loan or financial obligation. It starts with an introduction to credit risk, explaining its causes, consequences, and the need for proper loan appraisal. The section highlights the importance of a bank's credit strategy, policies, and limits, while delving into tools and instruments used for credit risk management. It covers essential topics such as internal risk rating systems, managing problem credits, and the role of MIS and internal controls in monitoring credit risks. Additionally, the section explores credit risk management in investment banking and off-balance-sheet exposures, providing practical steps for risk evaluation and mitigation.\nSection 3: Credit Risk Modeling and its Application in Banks\nIn this section, students dive into the world of credit risk modeling, which is crucial for predicting and managing credit risk in modern banking. The section begins by defining credit risk and exploring key concepts like capital structure modeling and risk measures. Students will learn about loss-given-default (LGD) and exposure-at-default (EAD) estimations, which are vital for assessing a bank’s exposure to credit losses. Real-world challenges in credit risk modeling, along with illustrative examples of unexpected losses, are discussed to help students apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.\nSection 4: Different Types of Risks in Banks\nThe final section broadens the scope to include the various types of risks that banks encounter, such as liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risk. Students will explore the management strategies and controls required for each risk type, including liquidity risk management, market risk audits, and legal risk assessments. Special emphasis is placed on internal controls, compliance, and fraud prevention. Through real-world examples, students will gain insights into managing system failures, legal disputes, and operational inefficiencies in banks. The section also touches on credit risk in investment banking, highlighting off-balance-sheet exposures and the steps necessary for robust risk management.\nConclusion:\nThis comprehensive course equips students with a detailed understanding of risk management practices in banks and financial institutions. By the end of the course, participants will have gained valuable insights into the various risk types, management processes, and regulatory frameworks necessary to maintain financial stability and ensure operational resilience in banks.",

It breathes life into our economy.  In this course, you will learn how infrastructure deals are financed and what makes them so complicated.  The course covers project finance structures, risk mitigation and provides insights from subject matter experts.  It also includes insights from the top-rated Financial Modelling Podcast, as well as supporting material such as example contracts and loan agreements.\nMatthew Bernath, the trainer, has been intricately involved in the financing of large infrastructure deals, including renewable energy plants, toll roads, property and other infrastructure.  He was previously a specialist Project Finance Modeller and hosts the Financial Modelling Podcast.  Matthew has worked on or advised Infrastructure Deals throughout Africa.\nProject Finance focuses on the financing of long-term infrastructure.  Given the size of these projects, the structuring of these deals is complex and often governs how projects are constructed and operated over time periods of up to 20 or 30 years.  As infrastructure generally benefits the wider public, Project Finance can involve both Public (Government) and Private Parties.  When the government and the private sector come together to enable infrastructure to be constructed and operated, it is referred to as Public-Private Partnerships or PPPs.\nThe course covers a high-level overview of project finance modelling and does not contain any project finance modelling exercises; however, overviews of Project Finance models are provided via videos.",

      "description": "Throughput Accounting for CPAs, CxOs, CFAs,\nMBAs, Entrepreneurs and Engineers\n\n\n‘In the construct of Cost Accounting - and the use of its data at the operational level - the link between decisions, actions and results is delayed, non linear and without causality. This is totally the opposite of Throughput Accounting where cost allocation is forbidden and where focus on the Constraint allows for sharp decision-making that has immediate impact on the financial health of operations.’\nDaniel Doiron CPA\n\n\nThis Throughput Accounting course focuses on work that we see in the physical world where we deal with tangible assets and products that we can build, track, store and inspect visually. Your current decision-making process will always be optimal if you aim directly at the constraint of your systems – which dictate throughput – and leveraging the teachings of Throughput Accounting in your daily life. Hitting the constraint by happenstance or consistently is the difference between witnessing dismal results or never being a day late and a penny short in your projects.\nThroughput Accounting is the Financial Application and – first and foremost - the decision-making arm of the Theory of Constraints from Dr Eli Goldratt.\n\n\nThroughput Accounting belongs under the very inclusive umbrella of Management Accounting whose body of knowledge is necessary - but not sufficient - to reach optimal decisions.\nIs this course for you?\n\n\n· As a C-level executive, do you have multi-million dollar budgets without a penny to spare?\nDo you want to improve operational or financial performance at no extra cost? (You’ll learn this new paradigm of thinking that takes into account constraints which can have a much bigger impact on the bottom line than you thought, making you a hero as you unlock the new, more profitable alternative!)\n\n\n· As a CFO or Finance VP, are you tired having to say ‘no’ to so many stakeholders?\nUnderstanding the core guiding principles of Throughput Accounting will empower you to identify, exploit and subordinate the various systems constraints you encounter, usually with no additional cost outlays, so you can be more responsive to your many stakeholder requests and expectations.\n\n\n· As a CEO or HR Executive, are you dreaming of the day when employees will make better decisions more of the time?\nAdoption of a Throughput Accounting methodology leads to decentralized and autonomous decision making based on understanding causality with an inherent simplicity so when decisions are needed at the product, team, project or division level, those most knowledgeable about the issue(s) can make better decisions, saving valuable time and money. The result is a win-win outcome; higher profitability with enhanced employee engagement.\n\n\n· As an entrepreneur, are you considering succession, contemplating selling your business?\nIf you want to maximize your selling price, you need to apply Throughput Accounting principles to systemize and automate your operations. Buyers assess the future value of a revenue stream they can maintain and grow – with this scientific approach they can easily embrace, you will get a premium when you do decide to sell.\n\n\n· As a CIO, are your budgets exploding as you spend more and more money on continuous improvement initiatives with little to show for?\nLeveraging the theory of constraints will reveal where to get the most bang for your buck as you create operational and financial efficiencies seemingly out of thin air. You will be seen as a miracle-maker especially when you can continuously and strategically focus on each system constraint to remain within your budget without compromising on performance and timely deliverables.\n\n\nWhat will you learn?\n\n\nThe history of Financial/Cost/Management versus Throughput Accounting:\nHistory in the context of these numerous accounting systems is quite revealing and shows the source of our cognitive biases and flawed mental models regarding costing and decision making! As early as 1916, the pioneers of Financial and Cost Accounting warned that the data was unfit for internal consumption and decision making. In 1993, Charles T Horngren – authority in the field of management accounting - stressed that contribution margin analysis was useless if a scarce factor (read constraint) was present in a system. To this day, after thousands of pages containing the body of knowledge of GAAP, FASB and IFRS guidelines, not a single hint has been provided to the fact that these principles or tools be used for internal managerial purposes.\n\n\nHow do the great thinkers (Ford, Ohno and Goldratt) treat inventory, as a liability or an asset? Inventory is an asset in all traditional accounting models. Ford, Toyota and the Theory of Constraints think otherwise and view inventory as a liability. The 5 Focusing Steps are foundational to Throughput Accounting and will be dealt with step-by-step, to ensure you fully embrace its core philosophical principles.\n\n\nOvercoming flawed mental models and cognitive biases:\nFollowing a detailed comparative analysis of 20 separate characteristics of Cost Accounting and Throughput Accounting, you will appreciate the differences and be in a better position to rethink your managerial approach for better, reasoned decision-making and project planning. You need not worry about abandoning GAAP & Financial Accounting principles when adopting Throughput Accounting principles; old and new need to be combined to exponential returns.\n\n\nOne of the main topics will be capacity; one of the most destructive cognitive biases of modern management is to focus on productive capacity when protective and excess capacity (shunned in traditional cost accounting) are necessary to optimize flow through a constraint. Variable Costs, Inventory and Operating Expenses will all be addressed within this new framework.\n\n\nReporting and reconciliation across traditional accounting and Throughput Accounting models:\nThroughput Accounting requires no changes in the way you work. There are no additional capital expenditures to undertake a massive transformation process; only changes in the way you think. But in order to bridge and reconcile your traditional Income Statement every month to a Throughput Accounting basis, you need to learn the mechanics, the metrics and the analogies with EBITDA and Gross Profit which we will cover in detail.\n\n\nThroughput Accounting: Culture, Complexity, Decision Making and Focus:\nCulture is a reflection of a company’s system. And accounting systems are the most far-reaching of all. You will discover how Throughput Accounting brings a lot to culture: Unanimity-based decision making, alignment, unity of purpose, decentralized decision making. Complexity in the details or causality measured between the time a decision is made and its impact on performance. Decision Making and inherent simplicity go hand-in-hand with mastery of the 12 Throughput Accounting decision making principles that underpin this paradigm. Focus on cost cutting will be a thing of the past as a refreshing, expansionary outlook on economic activity and growth will emerge.",

      "description": "What is this course about?\nThis 8 lesson video series will cover the basics of financial literacy including topics such as earning income, spending money, and creating a personal budget.\nStudents will learn fundamental financial principles and how to apply them to their daily lives.\nWhy is this important?\nUnderstanding financial literacy and fundamental financial principles will help people build a strong foundation and healthy money habits. If you want to be rich, you must make financially intelligent decisions. This all starts with being financially literate.\nWhat is the course structure and how long does this course take?\nThis course is designed with you in mind. Understanding that everyone has a busy schedule and lifestyle, the course has been broken down into 8 lessons. The course is designed to be one lesson per week understanding that most students will be learning this as an extra curricular activity. If you would like to accelerate the course, it can be done in as little as one to two days.\nEach lesson consists of a 5 minute video where I will be teaching fundamental financial literacy principles. There is a downloadable PDF worksheet for each week based on the topic discussed that I will be asking you to fill out based on your own personal situations. I have also created a guide in case you get stuck but I highly encourage you to complete the worksheets on your own first.\nI will be doing an overview of the worksheet from the previous lesson before introducing new topics. By doing this, you will leave the course with a fully completed example of the process along with the worksheets you filled out with your own information.\nWhat is the recommended time to spend on this course?\nI recommend that you spend 30 to 45 minutes per lesson.\nWithin this time, you will have enough time to watch the video content provided, fill in the worksheets and review the provided reference guide. The majority of the time spent on each lesson will be to think about how the fundamental principles apply to your own financial situation.",

EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nYou'll learn about the major categories of chargeback reason codes: fraud, authorization errors, processing errors,  customer disputes;\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to fraud (not authorised or recognised transactions, fraudulent processing, monitored merchant or monitored card, the EMV liability shift);\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to authorization issues (missing or declined authorisation, card in recovery/lost card/stolen card, invalid authorization information),\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to processing errors (late presentment, invalid transaction code or invalid transaction data, duplicated payment or paid by other means, currency mismatches);\nYou'll learn about the usual types of chargeback reason codes due to consumer disputes (mismatches in terms of goods - counterfeit, misrepresented, not delivered, others - cancelled or incomplete transactions, credit not processed);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit.

      "description": "Take full control of your finances... Eliminate the need for bank loans... And build a $1 million pension system for yourself with just $250 month. Learn how with The Infinite Banking Concept: Become Your Own Bank\nIt's true - $250 per month is all you need to create a $1 million pension plan for yourself. And we aren't talking about high-risk moonshot investments... We are talking about a conservative financial vehicle that does not place your money at risk.\nI know that sounds crazy... But that's only because most people have never heard of this strategy before. Wall Street has tried to cover this strategy up for decades... Despite the fact that top executives use this strategy themselves.\nIn fact, the Infinite Banking Concept is one of the tools the rich use to build generational wealth that keeps themselves... their children... their grandchildren... and their grandchildren's children financially independent... No matter what happens with the economy or the stock market.\nWhat's more, the rich use this strategy to create their own family bank. Family members can borrow money for education... home purchases... investment deals... All without having a rigid repayment plan.\nThat's right. With this strategy, they can borrow money from their own bank and never pay it back.\nBut that would put a drag on their bank's growth. So, they always pay their loans back... at interest.\nWait, why in the world they would pay interest if they didn't have to?\nEasy. That interest doesn't get sucked away by a faceless mega-bank. It feeds into their family bank to make it grow. That's how they stay financially independent for generations.\nThink about that.\nNow think about the plight of the average person today.\nBoom-and-bust financial markets... under-performing 401(k) plans... underfunded public pensions... rising costs of living...\nIt's no longer easy for the average person to get ahead, despite working 40-50 hour weeks and doing everything the \"right\" way.\nAs a result, many people worry about saving enough money for retirement. In fact, the Insured Retirement Institute found that a whopping 73% of Baby Boomers do not think they have enough money to retire comfortably.\nThat's where the Infinite Banking Concept comes in.\nThis is a strategy so powerful that the political insiders and financial elite covered it up with advertising restrictions and regulations... But it is available to anyone.\nWith this strategy, you can take full control of your family's finances... privatize the banking function entirely... and make money problems go away forever.\nYou can use this strategy for yourself to finance a business, investments, or real estate purchases.\nYou can use this strategy to finance your child's college education.\nYou can use this strategy to finance travel or vacations.\nYou can use this strategy to create a million-dollar pension plan for yourself, your spouse, and your children.\nBut those are all short-term benefits. The true power of this concept can be unleashed if this strategy is implemented generationally.\nI am not kidding when I say that you can use the Infinite Banking Concept to create financial freedom for generations to come.\nIf you think long-term, you can eliminate the need to borrow money ever again. Your personal bank will warehouse all the capital your family ever needs to live the life of their choosing.\nThat's what this course is all about. The Infinite Banking Concept will show you everything you need to implement this secret strategy for yourself and your family.\nAnd remember, this strategy truly is for everybody. $250 per month can create a million-dollar pension system.\nAnd plans are flexible. The more your put towards this strategy, the bigger your bank will become. But there are no rigid minimums.\n\n\nHere is what the course delivers:\nHow to warehouse capital in a tax-advantaged way\nHow to privatize the banking function and create your own family bank\nHow to take full control over your finances so you never need a bank loan again\nHow to build a million-dollar personal pension plan with as little as $250 per month\nHow to eliminate money problems forever\nHow to ensure that your future generations remain financially independent\nUnderstand the ins and outs of the Infinite Banking Concept\nKnow how to put the Infinite Banking Concept into practice today\nThe course contains 7 individual sections and 42 minutes worth of video content\nWhat's more, the instructor will demonstrate how this strategy works using a personal example... With no information withheld. You will see exactly how $250 per month can build a $1 million pension. And you will see exactly how an Infinite Banking vehicle grows every single year.\n\n\nHere's what others are saying about the course:\n\"The instructor provided valuable information in a short period of time. I have received more value in financial education from this course, in less than 60 minutes, than in years of formal education. Excellent course that should be part of the standard educational curricula.\" -Stephen H.\n\"I believe everyone must have access to this knowledge - it's the best-kept secret!\" -Kishor P.\n\"I've heard of IBC before, but never explained like this. Joe explains it with such clarity. The concept of using funds twice blows my mind. I wish I had heard of these strategies sooner. Anyone looking to access capital and get paid to use your own capital will benefit from this.\" -Sean\nNow to be clear, this is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It is a long-term strategy that requires discipline and an out-of-the-box mindset.\nThose looking for an easy way to get-rich quick should not bother with this course. But if you are willing to think long-term and commit yourself to the most powerful financial strategy most have never heard of, please enroll in the Infinite Banking Concept today!",

And not in this course.\n\n\nAccounting is Pure Logical, just that it is not taught the logical way.  If you start to learn accounting from Debit & Credit entries or using Accounting Principles, you will be lost. Whereas, if you learn accounting using Business Transactions, you will see how easy it gets. So, let’s learn Accounting in a more practical and relatable way.\n\n\nIf you are new to accounting or face challenges learning accounting, this course is for you.\n\n\nIn this course, we will unravel Accounting concepts using Business Transactions.  Here, you won’t learn ever-confusing Debit & Credit entries because most of the time you won't need them unless you are a Financial Accountant. Rather, mostly you will be required to analyze the financial statements & make investing decision. That is the role of a Financial Analyst - the highest paid job in the financial world.\n\n\nThis Accounting Masterclass promises to take you on a roller coaster ride and make accounting fun to learn. Here you will learn:\n1) Concepts of Accrual Accounting\n2) Basics of P&L, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement\n3) Recording business transactions directly in P&L and Balance Sheet\n4) Forming Cash Flow Statement\n5) Financial Statement Analysis\n\n\nI promise you this course is worth taking.",

      "description": "We teach about how to drive in school, but not how to manage finances. ~ Andy Williams\nFinance. The backbone of every company. Finance is a glass door into the inner workings of a company. The flaws and successes of a company are exposed in a company's financial statements. Despite this, many do not know some of the fundamentals of finance such as how to read a balance sheet.\nI wasn't a financial pro, and I paid the price. ~ Ruth Handler\nIn this course you will learn how to become financially literate in a modern organization. From a high-level perspective, this course will illuminate what is important and what isn't so much when analyzing financial statements and ultimately researching companies. You will gain the ability to provide valuable insights that will impress even some of the most seasoned entrepreneurs.\nLanding a million-dollar investment for your startup is exhilarating. But as big as that number sounds, it doesn't go far. Many startups just getting off the ground won't have a CFO to monitor finances.

      "description": "Credit risk infers the possibility of a loss emerging from a borrower’s downfall to pay back a loan or meet contractual commitments. Conventionally, it pertains to the risk arising from lenders’ inability to return the owed interest and principal, impacting the cash flows and increasing assemblage costs.\nWhen any lender extends loans such as mortgages, credit cards, or other similar loans, there is an avoidable risk that the borrower will not repay the loan amounts. Furthermore, if a company offers such credit to the customer, there’s the same risk that the customer will not pay back. It also incorporates other related risks, such as that the bond issuer may not make payment at the time of maturity and the risk occurring out of the incapacity of the insurance company to compensate for the claim. A higher level of credit risk in a profitable market will correlate with the elevated borrowing cost. Because of this, it is evaluated technically to mitigate such risk to a certain level.\nWe will start with a brief introduction to measures of credit risk modeling. Understanding the credit risk and how it is being measured is important before we into the meat of the module. Then, we will talk about traditional credit models in length. And in the next section, we will give you practical examples of traditional credit models. In the same section, we will also talk about the structural model of credit risk. Since understanding the theory isn’t enough, we will also take an example of the structural model of credit risk. Next, we will teach you Altman Z-score. In this section, you will learn about Altman Z-score and how you can calculate the Z-score. Then, we will talk about the Z-score of the airline industry. And then, we will also take a practical example of the US airline industry and discuss the airline industry Z-score. Then, under the same section, we will talk about the credit rating description of the airlines. Now, we will directly go into credit analysis. Under credit analysis, you will learn credit modeling, the evaluation metric in credit modeling, and also the early warning checklist in credit modeling. Then, we will teach you UFCE and WC Credit Modeling. Next, we will look at the financial statement analysis (the income statement, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement) in detail. Finally, we will talk about ways out analysis and internal ratings. In the end, we will show you the reference files to end the module. You need to keep in mind that this training will work if you do the work.\nCurriculum\n1. Introduction\n2. Traditional Credit Models\n3. Example of Traditional Credit Model\n4.

      "description": "Introduction to Cross-Border Payments: A Beginner’s Guide to mastering the concepts of cross border payments.\nLearn the Fundamentals, Avoid the Frustrations, and Build Confidence in One of the Most Complex Areas of Payments\nMy Journey: From Confusion to Clarity\nWhen I started my career as a Business Analyst, I was fresh out of my MBA and assigned to a Payments project. I had no prior experience in the domain and found myself constantly relying on senior colleagues, hesitating to ask questions I feared were “too basic,” and spending hours compiling scattered information from the internet.\nThe first few months were a nightmare. I felt underprepared, lacked confidence in client meetings, and struggled to contribute meaningfully. Over time, I learned and grew—but the journey was far from easy.\nOne of the toughest areas I encountered was Cross-Border Payments. The complexity of dealing with multiple countries, currencies, interbank networks, and SWIFT standards was overwhelming. Most resources jumped straight into technical message formats like MT103 and MT202, without laying the groundwork.\nWhy I Created This Course\nAfter years of working in the Payments industry and overcoming those early challenges, I decided to create the course I wish I had back then.\nThis course is designed to simplify Cross-Border Payments by focusing on four key foundational concepts that will help you understand the domain clearly and confidently. Once you grasp these principles, you’ll be able to analyze real-world scenarios, ask the right questions, and contribute effectively to your projects.\nWhat You’ll Learn\nThe 4 key concepts that simplify Cross-Border Payments\nUnderstanding the SWIFT BIC Code\nOverview of SWIFT messages and standards\nDeep dive into MT103 message structure and usage\nSerial vs. Cover payments flow with real SWIFT message examples\nWho Is This Course For?\nThis course is ideal for:\nFreshers who’ve joined a Payments team as a Consultant, Business Analyst, Product Owner, or Project Manager\nProfessionals looking to understand the basics of Cross-Border Payments\nAnyone seeking to expand their domain knowledge\nThose aiming for better career opportunities\nAspiring experts wanting to gain professional credibility\nNo prior Payments knowledge required. This course is beginner-friendly and designed to build your confidence from the ground up.\nWhy This Course Stands Out\nSimplified approach to a complex topic\nReal-world examples and message walkthroughs\nStructured learning path with practical insights\nCreated by an industry expert who’s been in your shoes\nWhat You Get\nQuizzes and practical exercises\nCertificate of completion\nReady to demystify Cross-Border Payments?\nDon’t let complexity hold you back. This course is your gateway to mastering one of the most challenging yet rewarding areas in Payments.",

The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.\nThe general concept used to value financial assets is to take the present value of future cash flows from the financial asset. Therefore, we will need to use present value concepts and calculations.\nThe cash flow related to bonds will generally consist of a series of interest payments and a principal payment at maturity of the bond. We can use annuity calculations to determine the present value of the interest payments and present value of one calculation to determine the present value of principal at maturity.\nPreferred stock has characteristics similar to bonds in that the payments are often standardized. However, we do not have a maturity date as we do with bonds.\nCommon stock can be more complex as we consider the future cash flow of dividends in an attempt to value the securities. The common stock dividends are more likely to change over time and we do not have a maturity date as we do with bonds.",

At the same time, those desirous of working with international banks in this field would find this course a confidence-generating experience, as it will make you understand the background and foreground of the subject. The contents are created to demystify the subject and make it easy to comprehend for a novice. At the same time, it would reinforce the conceptual knowledge of the experts, too.\n\n\nAbout My Journey In Creating this Course: Redefining the International Trade Finance Knowledge\nWith already having more than 22 courses in the VJ Export Import Mastery Series of Courses on Udemy, all focusing on international trade education, I have always felt the need to go a little deeper into the subject of safer methods of receiving international payments for export transactions and methods of paying safely for import purchases from overseas suppliers. Little had I imagined while starting to create the contents of this course that one single course itself may not be enough to discuss this subject area in full.

      "description": "Did you know that only 52% of 7-17 year olds receive a meaningful financial education, according to FinCap? That means that the majority of young people are not learning the skills they need to manage their money effectively.\n\n\nAnd it's not just a problem for kids. The average worker has at least 10 different jobs by the time they're 40, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. That means that even if you did receive a financial education, it's likely that you're not using it in your current job.\n\n\nBut here's the real kicker: if you don't learn how to manage your money, you will always struggle financially. 69% of people have less than $1000 saved, according to GBR. That means that the majority of people are living paycheck to paycheck and are one unexpected expense away from financial disaster.\n\n\nDon't let this be your future. It's time to take control of your financial wellbeing and secure your financial future. Our course will teach you the tools and strategies you need to manage your money wisely and achieve financial freedom.\n\n\nBut what if I told you that it's not too late to turn things around and take control of your financial wellbeing? I know because I've been there. I was one of those people struggling to pay the bills and living in a cheap flat just to save on rent. But I decided to take matters into my own hands and invest in my financial education. And it paid off.\n\n\nI learned the tools and strategies to manage my money wisely and now I want to share what I learned with you. In this course, you'll learn how to create a budget that works for you, how to overcome common mistakes people make when managing their money, and how to increase your income. You'll discover the top 5 reasons why most people don't manage their money wisely and the benefits of managing it well.\n\n\nImagine a life where you're not constantly worried about your next paycheck. With the skills you'll learn in this course, you'll be able to cover unexpected costs and even create a roadmap to getting out of debt. And it's not just about your finances – managing your money wisely can improve your overall quality of life. You'll experience less stress, improved health, and the freedom to do the things you love.\n\n\nBut here's the thing: this course is not about get-rich-quick schemes or financial advice on stocks. It's about teaching you the fundamentals of personal finance so you can build a strong foundation for financial success. You'll learn how to avoid common mistakes and make smart decisions about your money.\n\n\nAnd the best part? You'll have lifetime access to the course material and to me as your instructor. If you have any questions before, during, or after the course, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help you succeed.\n\n\nEnroll in this course and start building the financial future you deserve. I look forward to seeing you inside.\n\n\nWealth & Wisdom,\nBart",

This change streamlines the allocation process, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Here’s a more comprehensive insight into Universal Allocation in SAP S/4HANA via Fiori apps:\n\n\n\n\nNEW TOPIC ADDED\n\n\n\n\nUniversal Parallel Accounting (UPA) in SAP S/4HANA\n1. Why UPA is Needed\n1.1 Traditional Challenges in SAP ERP\nIn earlier SAP ERP systems, companies used multiple ledgers in the General Ledger (GL) to comply with different accounting standards (IFRS, local GAAP, tax). However, this flexibility was not extended consistently across submodules such as Controlling (CO), Asset Accounting (AA), or the Material Ledger (ML).\n1.2 The SAP Breakthrough – Universal Parallel Accounting (UPA)\nUPA in SAP S/4HANA resolves these challenges by redesigning the system architecture to support multiple ledgers across all key modules.\nKey innovations include:\nNative Multi-Ledger Support in FI, CO, AA, ML, and COPA.\nReal-Time Posting – Every transaction updates all relevant ledgers simultaneously.\nHarmonized Architecture – A unified platform for legal, group, and management reporting.\n2. Core Capabilities of UPA\n2.1 Seamless Ledger-Specific Integration\nUPA ensures consistent processing across modules:\nGeneral Ledger – Multi-ledger postings for all transactions.\nAsset Accounting – Ledger-specific valuation and depreciation.\nControlling – Cost centers, allocations, and assessments by ledger.\nProduct Costing – Ledger-specific standard and actual costs.\nInventory Valuation – Multi-ledger material valuation.\nEvent-Based Production Costing – Real-time cost postings per ledger.\nMargin Analysis (COPA) – Ledger-specific profitability analysis.\n2.2 Flexible Costing per Accounting Principle\nOrganizations can:\nMaintain separate standard, planned, and actual costs per ledger.\nRun ledger-specific cost estimates aligned with GAAP or IFRS.\nConfigure distinct cost component structures, costing variants, and overhead rates.\n2.3 Ledger-Specific Asset Valuation\nMultiple depreciation areas tied to specific ledgers.\nDifferent methods and useful lives by standard.\nSeparate depreciation runs for IFRS, Local GAAP, and Group.\n2.4 Event-Driven Finance\nEvery business event—goods issue, production confirmation, or settlement—triggers real-time postings in all ledgers. This ensures:\nReal-time WIP, variances, and overhead.\nFaster insight into production and financial performance.\n3. UPA Architecture\n3.1 Ledgers and Valuation Views\nLeading Ledger (0L) – Typically used for IFRS.\nNon-Leading Ledgers – For Local GAAP, Group reporting, Profit center view.\nEach ledger is assigned a valuation view for legal, group, or internal reporting.\n3.2 Universal Journal (ACDOCA)\nUPA is built on the Universal Journal (ACDOCA), the single source of truth.\nAll modules post to one table.\nReal-time, valuation-specific reporting.\nFull auditability and transparency.\n4. Real-World Scenarios\n4.1 Multi-Ledger Asset Depreciation\nAsset purchased at ₹1,00,000.\nIFRS (0L) → Straight-line, 5 years.\nLocal GAAP (2L) → Declining balance, 3 years.\nSystem posts both sets of depreciation automatically, side by side.\n4.2 Ledger-Specific Production Orders\nIFRS values raw materials at standard cost.\nGroup ledger uses transfer prices.\nWIP and variances are calculated separately for each ledger.\n4.3 Event-Based Costing\nCosts from goods issue, production confirmation, and receipts are posted in real time per ledger, eliminating manual reconciliation.\n\n\n5. Configuration Highlights\nUniversal Journal (ACDOCA) ensures centralized posting.\nFINSC_LEDGER App allows creation and configuration of multiple ledgers with up to five currencies.\nEvent-Based Posting replaces batch jobs, posting WIP, variances, and overhead instantly.\nCosting Variants are set per ledger for legal, group, and profit center requirements.\n6. Material Ledger in UPA\nMulti-currency support (company code, group, hard, index, global).\nMulti-valuation reporting for Legal, Group, and Profit Center views.\nClosing runs (CKMLCP) executed per ledger (e.g., 0L for IFRS, 2L for GAAP).\n7. Manufacturing and Costing Scenarios\n\n\nMake-to-Stock (MTS) → Uses Product Cost Collectors with real-time WIP and variances.\nMake-to-Order (MTO) → Costs posted per ledger in real time.\nCo- and By-Products → Equivalence numbers and reduced values handled per ledger.\nSubcontracting → Component issue, service charges, and receipts posted instantly across ledgers.\n8. Transfer Pricing\nIntercompany → Arm’s length compliance, tracked via Material Ledger.\nIntracompany → Profit center reporting with internal profitability analysis.\n9. COPA and Profitability Analysis\nAccount-based COPA integrated with UPA.\nReal-time flows of revenue and cost.\nMulti-ledger profitability views for legal, group, and management reporting.\n10. Month-End Closing\nPeriod-end bottlenecks removed with event-based postings.\nClosing is now a review task rather than reconciliation-heavy.\nFaster close cycles improve accuracy and compliance.\n11. Key Benefits of UPA\nReal-time WIP and variance posting per ledger.\nCompliance with IFRS, Local GAAP, Group standards.\nLedger-specific asset accounting.\nIntegrated reporting across FI, CO, ML, and AA.\nAccurate COGM and COGS via ledger-specific CKMLCP.\nTransparent Universal Allocation.\nFaster, reliable financial closing.\n12. Conclusion\nUniversal Parallel Accounting (UPA) in SAP S/4HANA delivers true end-to-end parallel accounting across Finance and Controlling. Combined with event-based costing, it ensures real-time, reconciled, and compliant financial reporting. Businesses gain transparency, efficiency, and agility in managing costs, assets, allocations, and profitability across multiple accounting principles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversal Allocation in Fiori Apps for Cost Center Allocations:\nOverview: Universal Allocation provides a unified approach to manage various allocations like distribution and overhead allocation (assessment). With Fiori, the user experience is enhanced, eliminating the need to juggle multiple SAP GUI transactions as was the case in ECC. This promotes operational efficiency and better visualization.\nManage Allocations App (App ID: F3338):\nPurpose: To define and manage allocation cycles and segments.\nFeatures:\nSingle interface to create and modify allocation cycles.\nVisualization of existing cycles for all authorized contexts.\nMaintenance of multiple types of allocation rules at the segment level.\nIt allows the definition of sender and receiver criteria, allocation methods, and segment-specific parameters.\nRun Allocations App (App ID: F3548):\nPurpose: Execution of the defined allocation cycles.\nFeatures:\nCentralized platform to initiate allocation runs.\nUsers can set up run worklists that contain standalone cycles or a sequence of cycles.\nAllows the execution of test runs and real runs.\nProvides a log of executed runs for review.\nAllocation Results App (App ID: F4363):\nPurpose: Offers a detailed analysis of executed allocation runs.\nFeatures:\nMultiple views for a comprehensive analysis:\nBy Run: Displays a list of completed run jobs with their statuses and a drill-down capability to access detailed reports.\nBy Cycle: Shows the status of cycles run for selected fiscal periods.\nRun Report: Provides intricate details of sender-receiver journal entries, messages, and a Network Graph control for visual representation of allocations.\nAllocation Flow App (App ID: F4022):\nPurpose: Visualization of allocation results.\nFeatures:\nDisplays allocation results in a Network Graph format.\nGraphical representation assists users in understanding the flow of allocations between sender and receiver objects.\nProvides filtering options to view specific allocation interactions.\nIntegration with SAP GUI:\nPost the allocation process in Fiori, the results can be viewed in traditional SAP GUI reports such as S_ALR_87013611. This report will showcase detailed sender and receiver cost center data, bridging the gap between the new Fiori experience and traditional SAP GUI reporting.\nIn Conclusion:\nUniversal Allocation in SAP S/4HANA through Fiori apps provides businesses with a holistic and streamlined approach to manage cost allocations. It offers the agility to adapt to business needs while ensuring transparency and clarity in financial postings. Fiori apps, with their intuitive design, make the process more manageable, visual, and aligned with modern-day user experiences.

In this course, you will learn how an initial public offering (IPO) works as the award winning MBA Professor worked on IPOs at Goldman Sachs. You will also learn real life case studies on why Facebook bought Instagram and What'sApp!\nA free 130 page downloadable book of the ENTIRE course and much more is included!\nThis course is taught by an award winning MBA professor with significant real world experience working at Goldman Sachs as well as in the venture capital, hedge fund and consulting industries (he has founded several companies and sits on several boards). Many business concepts are simply common sense. This course will focus on business concepts that you need to know that might not be common sense. This course makes the general business, accounting and finance process very easy to understand! The professor of this course is also the author of \"101 Crucial Lessons They Don't Teach You in Business School,\" which Forbes magazine recently called \"1 of 6 books that all entrepreneurs need to read right now.\"\n\nThe contents of this course are all based on my work experience at several firms, including Goldman Sachs, the consulting industry at Accenture, a few companies I have started, the hedge fund industry where I worked at Citadel and most recently based on my experience at a prominent San Francisco based venture capital firm. I included helpful practical accounting concepts I learned while I did an MBA at Columbia University and a Bachelor of Commerce degree at McGill University. Think of this course as a great introduction to accounting based on my undergraduate business degree, work experience in consulting, equities, hedge funds, venture capital and starting my own companies.\nI have minimized “boring complicated concepts” in this course in order to keep it as close to reality and as simple as possible. The concepts of this course have been taught by me in many classes at several universities, where the student feedback has been universally and incredibly positive (please see my LinkedIn profile for student reviews / feedback on my teaching style/effectiveness - thank you. Also please see reviews of my books in Amazon and here in Udemy on my teaching - particularly in my Udemy course on \"101 Crucial Lessons They Don't Teach You in Business School,\").",

      "description": "Introduction:\nThis course is designed to thoroughly prepare candidates for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Level 1 exam. The curriculum is aligned with the core principles of technical analysis, equipping learners with the knowledge required to understand and interpret charts, price patterns, and market behavior. Whether you are a beginner looking to explore technical analysis or an experienced trader aiming to solidify your knowledge, this course will help you navigate through the critical concepts of market trends, charting, indicators, and volume analysis.\n\n\nSection 1: Understanding Key Technical Analysis Concepts\nThe first section delves deep into foundational concepts essential for the CMT Level 1 exam. Starting with the basics, it covers the use of various chart types such as line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts, along with their pitfalls. You'll explore Dow Theory, a cornerstone of trend analysis, followed by a detailed study of support and resistance levels, providing clarity on market dynamics. Lectures dedicated to candlestick patterns teach practical techniques to interpret short and long patterns, Doji formations, and shadows, which are crucial for recognizing price reversals. Additionally, this section introduces reversal patterns like Head and Shoulders, Double Tops and Bottoms, and Triple Tops, explaining their psychological underpinnings and volume signals, which offer a nuanced understanding of market trends. Hands-on exercises reinforce the theoretical concepts, enabling learners to identify and analyze these patterns effectively.\n\n\nSection 2: Chart Patterns and Trendlines\nIn the next phase, you will explore the structure and significance of trendlines and channels, including different trendline types such as linear and logarithmic scales. Understanding how to utilize these tools is vital for pinpointing market trends and making informed decisions. Further, we dive into patterns like the rising and falling wedges, ascending and descending triangles, and symmetrical triangles, explaining their importance in predicting market behavior. You will also learn how to recognize rectangle patterns and work with trend channels, adding valuable tools to your technical analysis toolkit.\n\n\nSection 3: Gaps and Oscillators\nThis section introduces gap analysis, one of the most important technical signals. You'll learn to distinguish between different gap types, including breakaway, runaway, and exhaustion gaps, and their implications for market trends. After mastering gap analysis, you will delve into momentum oscillators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), stochastic oscillators, and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), key indicators for identifying overbought or oversold market conditions. Practical chart exercises enhance understanding, giving learners the ability to apply these oscillators in real-time market scenarios.\n\n\nSection 4: Volume and Market Sentiment Indicators\nVolume plays a crucial role in confirming trends and identifying reversals. This section covers various volume-based indicators, such as On-Balance Volume (OBV) and the Accumulation/Distribution line, that help detect subtle shifts in market sentiment. Additionally, you will explore money flow indices and the Chaikin Money Flow, which provide deeper insights into institutional buying and selling pressures. Lectures also focus on analyzing volatility, with topics like implied volatility, open interest, and the VIX (Volatility Index). The importance of sentiment indicators and their influence on market movements is emphasized through practical chart exercises.\n\n\nSection 5: Advanced Elliott Wave and Fibonacci Analysis\nIn this advanced section, the course provides comprehensive coverage of Elliott Wave Theory, detailing key concepts like impulse waves, corrective waves, and extensions. You'll also learn how to apply Fibonacci retracement tools in combination with Elliott Waves to predict price targets and reversals. The lectures on wave psychology will improve your ability to interpret market cycles and trade breakouts more effectively.\n\n\nSection 6: Risk Management and Behavioral Finance\nThe final section tackles the critical aspect of risk management and behavioral finance. Topics like trading psychology, emotional biases, and effective risk control are discussed in depth to prepare traders for the mental challenges they may face in the market. Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and the Random Walk Theory are also covered, providing an academic perspective on market efficiency and price movements. The course rounds out with practical sessions on trading strategies that integrate chart patterns and technical indicators for improved decision-making.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe Mastering Technical Analysis for CMT Level 1 course offers a structured, in-depth exploration of the key technical analysis concepts needed to excel in the CMT Level 1 exam. Through a combination of theory, practical exercises, and real-world chart applications, this course equips you with the analytical skills and confidence to interpret market movements and develop robust trading strategies.\n\n\nThe CMT (Chartered Market Technician) Level 1 Exam is the first of three exams required to earn the CMT designation, which is focused on technical analysis and is administered by the CMT Association.

        "Hey there, Thank you very much for enrolling in my course. It means a lot to me and I look forward to helping you upgrade your mindset, habits, and knowledge around money. In this introduction I’m going to share a little bit about me & my journey, why I created this Master Class, why it's effective and why I believe it will empower you to take control of your life with money today. So, I am Nabeel Khan, I’m a ﬁnancial planner, stuntman, actor, businessman, founder of the ﬁnancial literacy channel Money Talks, husband to an incredible woman and father to my world class boys. I wholeheartedly believe that you can design your own life on your own terms from the things you will learn in this course. How do I know? Well because I’ve pretty much lived it so far and you may not know this but 6 years ago, I had nothing ﬁnancially. Here’s my story. I grew up in a traditional Indian Muslim household, I’m a triplet in a family of 6. We’re 4 boys that grew up with amazing parents who worked hard to put food on the table and educated us. That's 4x schools fees 4x everything , it wasn’t easy but I’m fortunate to say it felt easy you know. Now if you don’t know this, the standard with Indian households is to become a professional doctor lawyer or accountant and for the most part I was on that path until one day I found a sport called parkour, fell in love with it and made it my full time commitment before I entered the traditional working world which lead me to the career of becoming a stuntman. I travelled, saw the world, worked with incredibly inspiring people, and ﬁnancially, well, I was the standard - earned money but spent all of it and then life changed when I found love and with that I decided to get a steadier income with more traditional time to give value to my other half in my relationship but here’s the kick, I had no money. Now of course I was aware of this but I actively made the choice to change careers because what I knew I wanted was to create a family life through marriage on my own terms and so I committed to it before I even found a job. In 2013, jobs were hard to ﬁnd because no one was employing, so I found myself accepting a role in ﬁnancial services as many advisors do - the industry of insurance sales and investment sales for no salary and commission only, with no experience and this was just 6 years ago. I literally don't even know what Microsoft Outlook was, let alone seen an insurance policy document but, I knew myself and accepted that I can take away anything from this experience and learn from it. In my life of becoming a ﬁnancial advisor it would be that I learn to manage my own money because there must be more to living life from paycheck to paycheck. Anyway, after a year my practice was ranked in the top 100 countrywide and in two years from then I grew the business to rank in the Top 35 Achiever group of Financial Advisors countrywide with an independent ranking and honour of being one of the top 1% of Financial Advisors worldwide and am arguably the youngest person to do this ever in such a short time. I’ve helped hundreds of people and companies set up and maintain their ﬁnancial plans in way over 10 000 hours all in different places in their ﬁnancial journey’s and one day I realized that it's not enough and there has to be a way to help more people navigate this space and not only buy ﬁnancial products but understand how to get more involved with money and make better ﬁnancial decisions. Which is why my passion project Money Talks with Nabeel Khan was born leading to this whole journey, the creation of My Money Talks, the coaching school to train the perfect advisor, Africa’s 1st Free Money School and this very course, my Master-class that will teach you how to be your own ﬁnancial advisor... By teaching you how to think, what to unlearn, to understand the principles of money management, how to build your own map to success and everything else that I’ve learned in my professional journey being an award-winning ﬁnancial planner so you can set up your ﬁnancial plan, save money on insurance & make better investment decisions in your journey to reaching your ﬁnancial freedom and living life on your own terms. And hey, if I could do it and teach others to do it, as a stunt man who didn’t know anything just a few years ago then you can do this too, so, thanks for hearing my story, I hope you’re excited and I'll see you in the classroom.",

Neither your school nor college. We all will realise the need for personal financial management only when we face financial disaster. Only when we make serious financial mistakes.\nFinancial mistakes are like slow poisons. Neither you nor people around you will know that you are committing a financial mistake.\nThe reason is “we are not taught about it”\nWe all spend so much time learning something so that we can make money. But we never spend quality time learning how we should manage our own money. The main reason is that knowledge is not given anywhere - neither schools nor colleges.\nI did my part of research to understand how this financial ignorance is affecting people and I am stunned to note 9 out of 10 gets into financial troubles because of ignorance. They didn’t know, their actions will put them into financial trouble. Their actions are very simple - like buying a mobile phone, buying a car, two-wheeler, constructing a house, taking some insurance, making some investments.\nYou may ask, what’s wrong with all these actions. What’s wrong with buying all these?\nNothing wrong with buying all these items.\nWhat is important is,\n-when you buy\n-how do you buy\n-from which source you buy.\nWhen it comes to this part, I see uniformity in committing mistakes and it's because of these decisions, untimely decisions, using wrong funding decisions, many many individuals, thousands and thousands of individuals are getting into financial trouble.\nPity is - Nobody told them that it is not the right way to acquire things in life - rather everyone around them, appreciated & congratulated them!\nWhat a colossal damage!\nI see there is a big vacuum in knowledge in personal financial management - whether you are a Doctor, Engineer, Banker, CA, Software Professional, Businessman, there is no point in earning 7 figures every month, if you are going to run pillar to post at the end of the month to meet your needs.\nSo, I believe it’s my responsibility to educate my students on personal financial planning.\nEveryone, when they start earning, should get this knowledge so that they plan right from their career beginning.\nEven if you are in the mid-way, you should acquire knowledge on financial planning at least now and plan your remaining life to have financial stress free life.\nFinancial planning is a step-by-step approach to meet one’s life goals. A financial plan acts as a guide as you go through life’s journey. Essentially, it helps you be in control of your income, expenses, and investments such that you can manage your money and achieve your goals.\nIt is not just about increasing your savings and reducing your expenses. Financial planning is a lot more than that. This includes achieving your future goals.\nBy enrolling in this course, you will learn,\n1) Why this course on Financial Planning?\n2) Why Financial Planning is essential?\n3) 3 Financial Phases of every income-earning individual\n4) Basic Framework for Financial Planning\n5) How to Plan Insurance?\n6) Case Study: How to arrive at the Insurance required amount?\n7) Key points to take note of while taking Insurance\n8) Importance & need for Critical Illness Insurance\n9) Need for Emergency Fund\n10) Importance of Health Insurance\n11) Children Education Planning\n12) Home & Home Loan Planning\nThis course is structured in a self-paced learning style.\nRequesting you to use your headphones for a better learning experience. Also, keep a notepad & pen alongside to take keynotes.\nSee you inside the course!",

      "description": "\"Create a Budget that Works\" will help you finally create a personal / household budget that works for your unique situation. This program methodically and patiently guides you through a five-step process, using transformative tools and concepts, for finally developing a customized spending plan that incorporates all those various financial puzzle pieces that make up your personal financial world.\nThis \"Create a Budget that Works\" course will teach you how to create and maintain a budget by explaining and showing how all the different concepts and financial pieces work together. The relaxed, kitchen-table conversational style offers a slower pace, compared to the fast paced, \"drinking from the fire hose\" approach. This style is deliberate, recognizing the anxiety that many experience when dealing with finances. Appealing to both the mental and emotional sides of the learner allows for a solid anchoring of the material. Don't let this slow approach fool you. In the end, the learning is subtle, deeper and powerfully affecting you for a lifetime.\nBased on the best-selling workbook, The Budget Kit: Common Cents Money Management Workbook 6th Ed. (Kaplan Publishers), which has been selling nationally in bookstores for over thirty years and continually on Amazon's Best-seller lists, the concepts and tools are flexible and adaptable for a lifetime of financial changes. You can incorporate the concepts, as well as the tools, as a stand-alone budgeting system or apply them to other software, apps or online programs you’re currently using.\nEven though you may have used a variety of budgeting tools over the years, if you are like many others, you ultimately may have ended up feeling there was still something missing. This course will finally provide those missing pieces.\nAfter going through this \"Create a Budget that Works\" course, and learning how to create a comprehensive, overall personal budget, how to outline and work with a realistic monthly budget/spending plan, how to identify all those missing pieces that show up as surprise emergencies, and finally discovering all those spending leaks, you will finally understand why those other budgeting attempts just weren't working.\nYou will receive many valuable materials including \"The Budget Kit 6th Ed.\" eBook, PDFs of the dozens of worksheets found in the workbook, along with an Excel Package of primary worksheets.\nView these materials as a guideline for core concepts and basic spending categories. Spending categories always change over the years, but the core concepts remain timeless.\nWith over four hours of video by the author sharing her decades of experience with you, and specific homework using the course materials, rest assured, this time you will have a lifelong system and understanding that works. These concepts can be applied to any of your current financial tools and will bring you the mastery, confidence and financial peace of mind you have been seeking.\nHere’s what some satisfied customers/clients said about Judy’s style and body of work:\n“Just wanted to thank you for your time and assistance today. You were very helpful in resolving my problems. As we discussed, I have your budget software to be really great. I have tried several in the past. However, I found your software and book to be outstanding!!”  - Larry\n“I continue to study and love your Budget Kit. Thanks for holding my hand and getting me going.”  - Elfriede\n“Working with Judy, and her Budget  Kit book, has helped me bring order to my financial life on a monthly basis and to clarify my big-picture financial goals. Her supportive, practical coaching style guided me towards budgeting solutions and behaviors that fit my own core values and lifestyle, and has given me a greater sense of peace and personal success.”  - Jonathon",

If you want to use the course in this way, you can have a real report, ready to publish, by the time you have finished.\nAlthough we focus here on equity research, the course will be useful for other kinds of analyst as well.

Good writing means figuring out what you’re trying to say and why it matters to your clients.\nSo, you’ll learn how to formulate your investment ideas quickly and efficiently, and how to support those ideas with logical arguments and coherent explanations.\nYou’ll also be able to organize your ideas to fit the strategies we all use as readers to seek out what matters to us.\nAll of these tools and techniques will save you time as a writer - and save your audience time as readers.\nYou’ll also learn how to construct powerful paragraphs and stunning sentences, so that you can communicate your expertise without baffling your reader.

That’s why we’ve designed Writing an Equity Research Report as a project-based course.\nAll the assignments on the course contribute to producing a real report. All the exercises are opportunities to develop skills that you can transfer directly and immediately to the research report you are working on.\nYou’ll also be encouraged to reflect on your own report writing.

      "description": "The Sustainability concept is receiving increasing attention and importance given the acceleration of climate issues and the perceived negative impact that some financing activities have on the environment or in human wellbeing.\nWhile in the past investment and credit decisions were made to balance risks with expected return, a new dimension is now taking priority, based on the notion of 'investing with a purpose'. This means investing and financing activities and businesses that have a positive impact in the environment or the society. At the same time, divesting from businesses that contribute to deterioration is under evaluation. This will have drastic consequences for Banks and other financial institutions, leading to unprecedented changes as loan portfolios/assets under management are originated, re-evaluated, and/or winded up. Other opportunities related to the trading of carbon offsets and development of carbon markets must be considered.\nClimate change risks are drastic to the Financial Sector and of extremely importance. They are crucial to the point of engaging the Banks' decision making at all levels, from client acquisition and relationship management, through Top Management - and of course Risk Management and Compliance. Sustainability is now an obligatory integral part of the Banks' strategic planning and operations. New regulatory aspects are being introduced and new Governance and ways of disclosing information and rating institutions are applied.\nIn this course we will touch upon all the above and also on the controversial topic of why we need Financial Institutions to stop financing flows to fossil fuels. We discuss why Sustainability is as well creating business opportunities and new products and boosting new career functions within institutions. We touch upon the ways banks can navigate to more greener portfolios, analyse how clients may be affected by the increased price of carbon (pollution), the importance of being evaluated by rating agencies for Sustainability parameters, and what does this all mean for the Financial sector's reputation and future.\nCourse picture copyright credit to Sandra Bulla.",

It begins with a discussion of the term structure of interest rates and interest rate dynamics. The following reading addresses arbitrage-free valuation of fixed-income securities. The study session concludes with an introduction to the valuation and analysis of bonds with embedded options.\nThe second Study Session \"Topics in Fixed Income Analysis\" consists of a discussion of credit analysis and how credit standards affect liquidity.\nStudents taking CFA Level 2 exam must take this course for understanding this complex topic. I would also recommend those students enrolled in CFA Level 3 to take this course who struggled with the basic concepts of fixed income in Level 1 and 2 so that their foundation improves for Fixed Income portfolio management in Level 3.\nThis course is also recommended for anyone in the investment field wanting to transition into the fixed income domain.",

It explains the roles of key participants in syndication, such as the lead bank (arranger), co-arrangers, book runners, agent banks, and collateral administrators. Learners will explore how these parties work together to arrange, distribute, and manage loans across multiple financial institutions. Furthermore, this section discusses the flow of funds within a loan transaction and introduces different types of syndicated loan facilities, such as revolving credit lines and term loans. By the end of this section, students will understand the complexities of loan syndication, including how loans are structured, negotiated, and executed across large networks of lenders.\nSection 3: Loan Documentation\nIn this section, students focus on the legal and financial documents that are critical to the loan process. Understanding loan documentation is essential for ensuring that all terms and conditions of the loan are met by both lenders and borrowers. The section covers key documents like the term sheet, loan agreements, funding memos, and indications of interest. It also explains how these documents are used in the negotiation and structuring of loan deals. Additionally, students will learn about the types of loan trades (assignments and participations) and how they impact the lifecycle of the loan. By mastering these documents, students will be well-prepared to handle loan transactions in a professional setting.\nSection 4: Credit Facility\nThe fourth section explores the concept of a credit facility, which is a type of loan arrangement that allows businesses to borrow money when they need it, rather than taking out a lump sum upfront. This section provides a detailed explanation of various credit facility types, including revolving credit, term loans, and other financial arrangements that cater to the borrowing needs of large corporations. Students will also learn about credit activity transactions and how these are recorded and managed within banks. By the end of this section, learners will understand how credit facilities work, how they are structured, and their role in modern banking, especially for companies that require flexible borrowing arrangements.\nSection 5: Breaks in Loan Management\nBreaks, or discrepancies, are common in the loan management process and can occur for various reasons, such as interest miscalculations or incorrect settlements. This section provides an in-depth look into the different types of breaks that can arise during the loan lifecycle. Students will learn about interest breaks, how to identify them, and the impact they have on loan agreements. More importantly, the section covers break resolution strategies, which involve correcting these discrepancies to ensure the loan terms remain in compliance. Understanding how to manage and resolve breaks is crucial for maintaining the financial health of both borrowers and lenders, making this section an important part of the course.\nSection 6: Accounting for Bank Debt\nThe final section focuses on the accounting aspect of bank debt, a critical area for finance professionals who manage or report on loans. This section breaks down the accounting principles used to track, calculate, and report bank debt. Students will explore how interest expenses are recorded, how loans are calculated on financial statements, and how banks account for complex loan structures. Real-life examples and calculations are provided to help students apply these concepts in practice. By the end of this section, learners will have a comprehensive understanding of how bank debt is reflected in financial reports, equipping them with the skills needed to manage loans from an accounting perspective.\nCourse Conclusion:\nBy the end of this course, learners will have gained a solid understanding of bank debt, loan syndication, loan documentation, credit facilities, break resolution, and the accounting practices associated with bank loans. The course prepares finance professionals, bankers, and students to confidently navigate the complexities of bank lending and loan management, providing them with the skills and knowledge to excel in the banking industry.",

      "description": "The great thing about working at a Corporate Bank is that Banks actually build things; they make things possible in the economy. They make things happen. And the possibility of having a part in it, of actually contributing to building what the world needs - this is the most passionate thing about working for a Corporate Bank.\nBut to do this, many skills and knowledge need to be had. I want to teach those skills and that knowledge to all those that are interested in Banking, including those actively seeking a job in one.\nDuring the course I provide an overview of what goes on inside a Corporate Bank, how things work in order for Banks to be able to make things happen. I will give a summary of the crucial topics anyone needs to know when planning a career in a Corporate Bank. I will go through the major knowledge topics in relation to each department, so that after taking the course students can have a pretty solid conversation with an interviewer, or a banking manager in the areas of interest. To do this, we will go through the major banking products, reveal how client acquisition works, what are the criteria used to analyze and approve corporate loans, what are the major risks to take into account and how all of it is interconnected.\nThe course not only prepares candidates for interviews to the related job positions at a Corporate Bank, but also helps with real knowledge of the positions in case anyone aspires to a promotion within a Bank or to a career in other financial institutions that deals with corporate relationships or in corporates themselves - in a department that deals with their Banks for example.\nUnlike other courses aimed just at negotiation and preparation for job interviews, this course teaches you what Corporate Bankers in these positions actually need to know and what keeps them busy day by day. Many crucial risk considerations are analyzed too, from credit risk, to financial markets risks, and last but not least the impact of Climate Change and the ever evolving ESG and sustainability risks areas for Banks - including what new Jobs are being created in Banking to deal with these issues.\nI have worked and been engaged with hiring corporate bankers for these departments in a Corporate Bank for over two decades - and I will now share the real thing with you: what really goes on inside the Bank and what you must know to get in and be a solid banking performer.",

This course will change that.\nMost investors don't know how the waterfall will work in a liquidity event and what the liquidation preference really means to their overall return.\nSo, I created this course to teach the breadth of professionals involved in early stage capital how this all really works. It is exhaustive and touches on every key point I know that is economic to a deal. Learning how to plan and understand the ownership of your company is critical to keeping motivation and maximizing returns.\nThe course is taught through excel. It is hands on, get dirty, struggle to understand until the lightbulb goes off and you get it right. I teach it the exact way that i learn, which is by doing. It is step by step with commentary on the specifics.\nWhat it is not, however, is a course in excel. While their are not overly complicated functions involved, you should have a base knowledge or you will get frustrated.\nThe value of this course is what it will save you in attorney's fees, equity, and potentially greater returns on your investments.You can learn how to project and manage your growth and join a community of people going through the same struggles.",

      "description": "Introduction:\nBehavioral Finance offers a revolutionary perspective on how investors make decisions, contrasting sharply with the traditional view of rational, utility-maximizing individuals. This course dives deep into the psychological factors and cognitive biases that influence financial behavior, showing how real-world decision-making often deviates from theoretical models. Through a structured exploration of key concepts like utility theory, market efficiency, and investor biases, students will gain the tools to understand and apply Behavioral Finance principles in various financial contexts. The course also addresses practical applications in portfolio construction, investment analysis, and client relations, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\nSection 1: Introduction to Behavioral Finance\nThis section introduces the core concepts of Behavioral Finance, contrasting it with traditional financial theories. Students begin with a basic understanding of how behavioral finance explains deviations from the rational decision-making assumed in traditional finance. Utility Theory and its axioms are discussed, laying the foundation for understanding risk and decision-making in uncertain environments. The application of Bayes Theory and the idea of the Rational Economic Man provide students with the tools to evaluate traditional financial assumptions critically. This section sets the stage for the psychological nuances explored in later parts of the course.\nSection 2: Risk Aversion and Decision-Making in Behavioral Finance\nIn this section, the focus shifts to understanding investor behavior under risk and uncertainty. Topics such as Risk Aversion highlight how individuals vary in their tolerance for risk, often diverging from the purely rational decision-making models. Students explore the Prospect Theory, which explains how people evaluate potential gains and losses, and learn about the role of Bounded Rationality, where cognitive limitations affect decisions. Key psychological concepts like the Isolation Effect are covered with practical examples, showing how real-world decision-making contrasts with traditional financial theory.\nSection 3: Market Efficiency and Anomalies\nThis section delves into the idea of market efficiency, starting with the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and its various forms. Students learn about Market Anomalies, such as price overreactions and underreactions, which challenge the EMH. These anomalies are explored through the lens of Behavioral Finance, demonstrating how cognitive biases disrupt the assumption of fully efficient markets. The section also introduces the traditional perspective of Portfolio Construction, helping students understand how behavioral insights can reshape portfolio management practices.\nSection 4: Behavioral Theories and Models in Asset Pricing\nStudents explore different models of asset pricing, particularly those influenced by behavioral principles. Starting with the Consumption and Savings Model, this section examines how individuals make intertemporal choices regarding spending and investment. The Behavioral Asset Pricing Model and Behavioral Portfolio Theory are introduced as alternatives to traditional financial models, providing a more realistic view of investor behavior. The Adaptive Market Hypothesis is also covered, offering a dynamic approach to understanding how markets evolve in response to changing investor behavior and biases.\nSection 5: Cognitive and Emotional Biases in Finance\nOne of the most critical sections, this part of the course dives deep into Cognitive and Emotional Biases that influence financial decision-making. Students will explore common cognitive errors like Perseverance and Framing Bias, alongside emotional biases such as Loss Aversion and Overconfidence. Each bias is explained in terms of its impact on investment behavior, and methods for mitigating these biases are discussed. This section equips students with the awareness needed to identify and counteract the psychological tendencies that can undermine financial decision-making.\nSection 6: Mitigating Biases and Portfolio Construction\nBuilding on the previous section, students will now focus on strategies for mitigating biases in financial decisions, particularly in the context of Portfolio Construction. The concept of Goals-Based Investing is introduced, demonstrating how investors can align their portfolios with personal financial objectives while accounting for behavioral tendencies. Behaviorally Modified Asset Allocation is explored in depth, showing how portfolios can be tailored to reflect an investor's cognitive and emotional biases, leading to more personalized and effective investment strategies.\nSection 7: Behavioral Finance Models and Client Relations\nThis section addresses practical applications of behavioral finance in client-facing roles. Models like the Barnewall Two-Way Model and the BBK Five-Way Model are introduced, providing frameworks for categorizing investors based on their behavioral tendencies. The Pompian Model is covered in detail, offering advisors a structured approach to understanding and managing clients' biases. This section also discusses the challenges of dealing with Behavioral Investor Types (BITs) and emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong advisor-client relationships.\nSection 8: Behavioral Finance in Portfolio Construction and Analysis\nIn the final section, students will learn how behavioral insights apply to Portfolio Construction and Investment Analysis. Topics like Mental Accounting and the role of Analyst Biases in research are covered, showing how biases can affect both individual investors and professional analysts. The influence of Company Management on analysts' forecasts and the functioning of Investment Committees are also discussed. The course concludes by revisiting key Market Anomalies and examining how behavioral theories explain deviations from expected market behaviors.\nConclusion:\nBy the end of this course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how behavioral finance differs from traditional finance, along with practical tools for applying behavioral insights to investment strategies, portfolio construction, and client relations. They will be equipped to recognize and mitigate the impact of biases on financial decisions, creating more effective and psychologically informed financial strategies.",

This will start by preparing a board-level paper for approval, then choosing the right climate models and corresponding scenarios and data, through to conducting workshops with the businesses and functions. Finally, I will show you how to present the results of the work to the board meeting and then implement the process into the regular strategic planning cycle and climate risk management process.\n\n\nIn the final part of this training course, I provide an overview of the key elements of the International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS S1 on sustainability-related disclosures, and IFRS S2 on climate-related disclosures. Although the ISSB has granted at least one-year relief to companies on sustainability disclosures under S1, not for S2, on climate-related reporting that is seen as more urgent. So, this standard must be complied with from 1st January 2014. That is why I have called this training course target 2024.\n\n\nThis is the right course for you if you are new to climate scenario analysis and want to learn what it is, including best practices, and how to implement them in accordance with the reporting standards across various jurisdictions.",

      "description": "Added new recording session of SAP CO S4 HANA -Complete End to End Scenarios of Cost center accounting, Product Costing, Material Leger and COPA ( Account based-Margin ANLYSIS)\nThe Product Costing module allows organizations to determine the production costs of products. This is integral for controlling and for assessing profitability. Material Ledger enables actual costing and supports multiple valuations in parallel.\nProduct Costing Techniques:\nProduct costing by order (Make to Stock): Costs are determined based on manufacturing orders. It's suitable for non-repetitive production.\nProduct costing by Sales order (Make to Order): Costing is done for specific sales orders. Typically used for customized products.\nProduct costing with Sales order controlling vaulted stock with sale order controlling: When both anticipated stock and actual sales order-driven stock exist.\nProduct costing with sales order controlling non-vaulted stock with sale order controlling: For products produced directly against sales orders without anticipation.\nProduct costing by period: Periodic costing for products irrespective of orders.\nRepetitive manufacturing without reporting points consideration: Costs for products that are manufactured repetitively and without specific checkpoints.\nRepetitive manufacturing with reporting points (work in process) consideration: Costs are captured at different stages or checkpoints of the production process.\nJoint Production Process: Multiple main products are derived from one production order.\nCO-Product costing process and By Product Costing Process: Co-products are main products with similar value, whereas by-products have minor value compared to the main product.\nMixed Costing process- Split Valuation: When a material can be procured/manufactured in more than one way.\nSub-Contracting, External Operations Product costing process: Costs when a part of the manufacturing process is subcontracted to external suppliers.\nCross plants –Special Procurement product costing: Costs are determined when procuring from a different plant within the same company.\nAdditives cost estimation: The costs of additive materials in the manufacturing process.\nSAP CO S/4 HANA -Material Ledger/Actual Costing\nMultiple Currencies:\nCompany Code Currency: Primary currency for a company code.\nGroup Currency: Consolidation currency.\nIndex based Currency: Adjustments for inflation or other index-based factors.\nMultiple Valuations:\nLegal Valuation: As per local regulations.\nGroup Valuation: Consolidated valuation.\nProfit Center Valuation: Based on profit center reporting needs.\nTransfer pricing:\nInter Company: Pricing between different company codes.\nIntra Company: Pricing within the same company code.\nWork in process functionalities to Actual Costing: Determines the cost of semi-finished goods.\nPhysical Inventory count integrated with Material Ledger/Actual Costing: Actual stock valuation as per physical count.\nDistribution Usage variances: The differences between planned and actual usage of materials and activity types in production.\nActivity Types: Quantitative measures of services provided by a cost center. Adjustments made for variances between planned and actual activity provided.\nMaterial Ledger- Actual Costing Execution and CKM3: The CKM3 transaction provides a detailed material price analysis showing the evolution of material prices.\nThis overview provides a detailed but condensed understanding of the topics related to SAP CO: S/4 HANA 2021 in the context of Product Costing and Material Ledger. Each of these topics can further be elaborated into detailed processes, configurations, and examples based on real-time scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nVariance analysis is a critical component of controlling in the manufacturing sector, as it highlights the deviations between the planned (or standard) and the actual outcomes, which then informs management decisions.\nLet's delve into the nuances of these variance categories for a better understanding:\nInput Side Variances:\n1. Input Price Variance:\nThis is the difference between the standard cost and the actual cost of inputs.\n\n\nFor instance, if a company planned to purchase raw material at 10 per unit but actually purchased it at 11 per unit, this leads to a price variance.\n2. Input Quantity Variance:\nIt's the difference between the standard quantity and the actual quantity used.\nIf a company planned to use 50 units of a raw material but ended up using 52 units, this will result in a quantity variance.\n3. Resource-Usage Variance:\nThis arises when alternative resources are used instead of the ones originally planned.\nFor instance, using a higher-grade material instead of a standard one can lead to this variance. It's essentially the difference in cost between the actual resource used and the planned one.\n4. Remaining Input Variance:\nAny variance that cannot be attributed to the previously mentioned categories falls under this. Overhead rate changes during the production cycle are common culprits.\nOutput Side Variances:\n1. Output Price Variance:\nThis arises from the difference between the actual selling price and the standard selling price of the finished product.\n\n\n2. Mixed Price Variance:\nIn scenarios where materials are valuated using a mixed cost estimate, any difference between the standard cost (derived from a standard mix) and the actual cost (resulting from an actual mix) leads to this variance.\n3. Lot Size Variance:\nDifferences between the actual batch size or lot size used in manufacturing and the lot size considered during standard costing lead to this variance. This is crucial because certain costs might be fixed per batch, and deviations in batch sizes can lead to cost discrepancies.\n4. Remaining Variance:\nThis is a catch-all category for variances that don’t fit into any other specified category. A common reason for such a variance is the absence of a target cost for the material, which can arise if a standard cost estimate is unavailable or if there's been no goods receipt against a production order.\nScrap Variances:\nIn manufacturing, scrap refers to the portion of a raw material or semi-finished goods that, due to defects or inefficiencies during the production process, doesn't end up as a part of the final product. Understanding the sources and reasons for scrap is vital to optimize production processes, minimize waste, and control costs. Scrap variances help pinpoint where in the process the wastage is happening and how it might be minimized.\n1. Assembly Scrap:\nDefinition:\nAssembly scrap pertains to the waste or defects that occur during the main assembly process. This is when different components or materials are being assembled to form the final product or a significant subassembly.\n2. Operation Scrap:\nDefinition:\nOperation scrap refers to the waste that happens at a specific operation or stage in the manufacturing process, well before the assembly.\n3. Component Scrap:\nDefinition:\nComponent scrap is related to the waste of specific components or parts used in the production process. This isn't necessarily about a stage in the process but is about defective parts.\n\n\nIn Conclusion: Variance analysis is crucial in manufacturing to pinpoint areas of inefficiency or unforeseen changes. By understanding where and why variances occur, companies can adjust their operations accordingly, resulting in better cost management and profitability. However, the key is not just to identify but also to act upon these variances by taking corrective measures",

Intuit, the owner of QuickBooks often offers a free 30-day trial for each software package.\nThis will be a project based course. We will enter transaction in Excel before entering them into the accounting software, QuickBooks desktop and QuickBooks Online. Excel is more transparent, making it easier to understand the process. QuickBooks will then automate the process making it more efficient.\nWe will learn how to turn multicurrency on in both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Desktop. We will learn which accounts will be affected most by multicurrency transactions, these accounts being cash account types, accounts receivable account types, and accounts payable account types.\nThis course will work an example problems related to the sales cycles and the purchases cycle. The sales cycle will focus in on tracking foreign currency receivables. the purchases cycle will focus on foreign currency payables.\nWe will also demonstrate transactions related to forward contracts. We will discuss the uses of forward contracts including for speculative purposes and to mitigate risk on foreign currency transactions.\nThe multiple currency feature is useful when the company is holding onto cash in a foreign currency, the software helping us to record the home currency equivalent for financial statement presentation.\nMultiple currency functionality is also helpful when we make sales on account, sending an invoice, hoping to get paid in the future, tracking accounting receivable, but expecting to be paid in a foreign currency. The accounts receivable account will need to be valued in the home currency even though we will be paid in a foreign one.\nWe have a similar situation when we make purchases on account, promising to pay in a foreign currency at some point in the future. The accounts payable account will need to be valued in the home currency equivalence even though we will be paying in a foreign currency.",

      "description": "Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a method of budgeting in which all expenses must be justified for each new period. The process of zero-based budgeting starts from a \"zero base,\" and every function within an organization is analyzed for its needs and costs. The budgets are then built around what is needed for the upcoming period, regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the previous one.\nTraditional budgeting calls for incremental increases over previous budgets, such as a 2% increase in spending, as opposed to a justification of both old and new expenses, as called for with zero-based budgeting.\nTraditional budgeting also only analyzes only new expenditures, while ZBB starts from zero and calls for a justification of old, recurring expenses in addition to new expenditures. Zero-based budgeting aims to put the onus on managers to justify expenses and aims to drive value for an organization by optimizing costs and not just revenue.\nAs per the latest Survey by Delloitte zero-based budgeting users appear to be moderately more successful at meeting their cost targets. Sixty-three percent of respondents, globally, who did not conduct ZBB did not meet their cost targets, while the same is true for 58 percent of those that did use ZBB. Although ZBB users in the US reported higher cost program failure rates than non-ZBB users (65 percent vs. 57 percent), in all other regions the failure rate for ZBB users was lower than for non-ZBB users (57 percent failure rate vs. 68 percent in Latin America; 52 percent vs. 56 percent in Europe; and 60 percent vs. 71 percent in the Asia Pacific).\nIn this course we will explore practical aspects of Zero Based Budgeting.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nAs a manager, you will be tempted to trust your gut and use your experience to decide what and how to do it. Quite often, this approach may be misleading. It is much better to use a data-driven approach, and before you make the decisio,n look at the potential consequences. In this course, I will show you how to make more rational choices as a manager using Excel. We will go through a lot of case studies that will help you master this skill.\nIn the course, you will learn the following things:\nHow to be data-driven in solving problems\nHow to make better decisions using Excel\nHow to handle uncertainty when you are making decisions\nWhich method, or framework, should you use in a specific situation\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from the Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who are now Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that, my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 315 000 students, including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excel files, as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures, so as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nI had the pleasure to support numerous Managers, Directors, COOs, and CEOs, and I have noticed that making decisions is a complicated process that requires a lot of data and the right approach to balancing the pros and cons. You also have to take into account the uncertainty that managers have to deal with on a daily basis. When you transition from a specialist to a manager or a director, usually nobody shows you how to make decisions using a data-driven approach. We will try to fix this gap. This course will help you master numerous techniques that will make your life easier and help you make the right decisions.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to be a successful manager and CEO, you should master techniques and frameworks that will help you make better decisions. I will show in this course numerous useful methods and will teach how to use them in practice. That is why. I highly recommend this course not only to young managers and entrepreneurs but also to senior managers who want to learn a data-driven approach to decision-making.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed of analyzing and making decisions. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience, as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that, thanks to the course, you will learn:\nHow to be data-driven in solving problems\nHow to make better decisions using Excel\nHow to handle uncertainty when you are making decisions\nWhich method, or framework, should you use in a specific situation\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is currently divided into  the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course, as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nBasic tools to make decisions. In the second section, I will show you the essential tools that we will use to make decisions. I will show you what NPV, IRR, and time value of money are. Later on, we will go through 5 cases where we will apply this framework to make specific decisions on whether the investment makes sense or not\nOption comparison. In this section, I will show you how to compare different options. We will go through 3 cases: how to shorten the lifespan of a product, whether it makes sense to transition from selling a product to selling a service (SMCG), and what is a better choice, to rent or to buy an apartment.\nRankings. In this section, I will show you how to use rankings in practice. In one case, we will analyze entering foreign markets. In the second example, we will use the framework to pick the perfect boyfriend for a friend\nMake-or-buy Analysis. As a manager, you will quite often have to decide whether to do something internally or buy it from a 3rd-party supplier. In these cases, you have to perform a make-or-buy analysis. We will discuss this in detail in this section\nWhat to do when there is a lot of uncertainty. As a manager, quite often you will have to somehow take into account the uncertainty. In this section, we will see how we can take it into account to make better decisions. We will discuss here: voting models, backward logic, strategic alignment framework, value proposition framework, portfolio decision framework\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\nReady-made analyses that you can use for your firm\nTools that you can use for your firm\nList of useful resources\nLinks to additional presentations, articles, and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nMake much better decisions as a Manager\nMaster a data-driven approach to decision making\nAnalyze any decision in Excel using a data-driven approach\nCarry out a make-or-buy analysis\nAnalyze different scenarios in Excel\nAnalyze in Excel potential investments and strategic decisions, and pick the best option for your business\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagers who want to make better decisions\nOwners of small and mid-sized businesses\nManagement Consultants and Business Analysts\nStartup Founders\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

      "description": "This course provides a detailed exploration of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are used by companies around the globe to maintain transparency and comparability in financial reporting. Designed for professionals and students seeking to understand and apply IFRS, the course covers multiple aspects of these standards, from basic overviews to complex applications. Each section delves into specific IFRS standards, offering a comprehensive understanding and practical insights to navigate the world of international accounting.\nIntroduction to IFRS\nThe first section introduces students to the basics of IFRS, setting the foundation for understanding international financial reporting. This section begins with an overview of the IFRS framework and its significance in the global accounting landscape. Key topics include the history of IFRS, its development, and why it is essential for creating transparency and consistency in financial reporting across countries. Students will grasp the fundamental principles of IFRS and its objectives, including how IFRS compares to local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). This section emphasizes the timeline, requirements, exemptions, and disclosures necessary for adopting IFRS for the first time, which helps in understanding the intricacies involved in the transition to these standards.\nIFRS 1 - First-time Adoption of IFRS\nIn this section, students dive into IFRS 1, focusing on the first-time adoption of IFRS. It covers the process that organizations need to follow when transitioning from local accounting standards to IFRS. Key discussions revolve around the scope and objectives of IFRS 1, exemptions, exceptions, and specific disclosure requirements. The section highlights the importance of comparative information and explores how first-time adopters must present their financial statements. Students also learn how to handle differences between local standards and IFRS, understand the impact on various financial assets and liabilities, and see real-world examples to better appreciate the complexities involved in IFRS adoption.\nIFRS 2 - Share-based Payment\nThis section focuses on IFRS 2, which covers share-based payments. Students learn about the scope of the standard, focusing on transactions where companies compensate employees or other stakeholders with equity. Topics include the basic principles of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments, the significance of grant dates, vesting and non-vesting conditions, and how these affect the valuation of awards. Additionally, the section addresses the implications of modifications, cancellations, and settlement of awards, concluding with the disclosure requirements and practical examples to help understand the treatment of share-based payment arrangements.\nIFRS 3 - Business Combinations\nThis section explores IFRS 3, which pertains to the accounting for business combinations. It starts with a discussion of the scope of the standard and the key definitions, such as business combinations and goodwill. The section details the method of accounting for acquisitions, from determining the acquisition date to recognizing acquired assets and liabilities. It also covers the measurement of non-controlling interests, contingent considerations, and indemnification assets. Students will gain an understanding of how goodwill is calculated and allocated, including real-world examples of business combinations in stages. Disclosure requirements, acquisition costs, and contingent liabilities are also thoroughly covered.\nIFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts\nIFRS 4 is a pivotal section for students interested in accounting for insurance contracts. The section begins by defining the scope and objectives of IFRS 4, helping students understand how it applies to the financial reporting of insurance entities. Topics include the recognition and measurement of insurance liabilities, embedded derivatives, and unbundling scenarios. Students will also explore the Liability Adequacy Test (LAT), impairment issues, and how changes in accounting policies impact financial reporting. The section concludes with insights into disclosures related to insurance contracts and a discussion on discretionary participation features.\nIFRS 5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nThis section delves into IFRS 5, addressing the classification and measurement of non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations. Students will understand the criteria for classifying assets as held for sale, as well as the accounting implications of such classifications. Topics include impairment losses, measurement requirements, and the reversal of impairment losses. Additionally, the section covers the requirements for disclosing discontinued operations and provides practical examples of how to handle complex asset sales and disposal groups in financial statements.\nIFRS 6 - Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources\nIn this section, IFRS 6 is explored, focusing on the specific challenges in the exploration and evaluation of mineral resources. Students will learn about the recognition and measurement criteria for exploration and evaluation assets, including the accounting policy choices available under IFRS. The section also covers the impairment of these assets and the necessary disclosures related to exploration activities. Practical examples of how to account for exploration and evaluation expenditures help students understand how this standard applies in real-world scenarios.\nIFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures\nThis section covers IFRS 7, focusing on the disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The section begins by explaining the objectives and scope of the standard, followed by detailed guidance on disclosing the fair value of financial instruments in the balance sheet and income statement. Topics include qualitative and quantitative risk disclosures, liquidity risk, market risk, and credit risk. Students will also learn about the disclosures related to hedge accounting and how financial institutions can comply with IFRS 7 by presenting comprehensive information about their financial instruments.\nIFRS 8 - Operating Segments\nThis section focuses on IFRS 8, which provides guidance on the disclosure of information about a company’s operating segments. It emphasizes the importance of segment reporting in providing transparency to stakeholders about the different revenue-generating activities of a business. Students will learn how to identify operating segments based on the internal reports that the company’s management uses for decision-making purposes. Topics include the aggregation criteria, disclosure of segment revenues, profits, assets, and liabilities, as well as how to report segment information in interim financial statements. Practical examples are provided to help students understand how companies disaggregate their financial performance by segments, including industry-specific cases.\nIFRS 9 - Financial Instruments\nIn this section, students will explore IFRS 9, which deals with the classification, measurement, and impairment of financial instruments. The section starts by explaining the new categories of financial assets—amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Students will learn about the concept of business models and contractual cash flow characteristics to determine the classification of financial assets. Additionally, IFRS 9 introduces the expected credit loss (ECL) model for recognizing impairments, which replaces the incurred loss model from previous standards. The section also covers the hedge accounting framework under IFRS 9, providing a detailed understanding of how to align accounting with risk management activities. Real-world examples of financial instruments are discussed to ensure students can apply the concepts effectively in practice.\nIFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements\nThis section provides an in-depth look at IFRS 10, which sets out the requirements for preparing consolidated financial statements. Students will explore the concept of control, which determines whether an entity should be consolidated into the parent company’s financial statements. The section explains the three key elements of control—power over the investee, exposure or rights to variable returns, and the ability to use power to affect the returns. It also covers situations such as potential voting rights, de facto control, and consolidation of special purpose entities (SPEs). Practical exercises focus on real-world scenarios involving group structures, non-controlling interests, and how to handle acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries.\nIFRS 11 - Joint Arrangements\nIn this section, IFRS 11 is explored, focusing on the accounting treatment for joint arrangements. Students will learn the two types of joint arrangements: joint operations and joint ventures, and how to differentiate between them based on the rights and obligations of the parties involved. The section covers how to account for each type, with joint operations requiring proportionate consolidation of assets and liabilities, while joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Practical examples are provided to help students understand complex joint arrangement structures, and how disclosures related to these arrangements should be presented in financial statements.\nIFRS 12 - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities\nThis section deals with IFRS 12, which focuses on the disclosure requirements for entities that have interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates, and unconsolidated structured entities. Students will learn about the scope of IFRS 12 and how it aims to provide transparency regarding the risks and financial impacts of these interests. Key topics include the nature and extent of significant restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds, non-controlling interests, and the risks associated with interests in unconsolidated structured entities. The section also emphasizes how these disclosures enhance the understanding of a company’s financial position by giving insights into its relationships with other entities.\nIFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement\nIFRS 13 provides guidance on how to measure fair value and disclose fair value information in financial statements. This section explains the fair value hierarchy, which categorizes inputs used in fair value measurements into three levels based on their observability. Students will explore how to apply valuation techniques such as the market approach, cost approach, and income approach, depending on the available inputs. The section also covers specific considerations for measuring the fair value of non-financial assets, liabilities, and equity instruments. Practical examples and case studies help students understand how to apply fair value measurements in a variety of industries and financial reporting contexts.\nIFRS 14 - Regulatory Deferral Accounts\nIFRS 14, titled Regulatory Deferral Accounts, is a temporary standard aimed at entities that are first-time adopters of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and currently recognize regulatory deferral account balances under their previous accounting frameworks. These balances arise when a rate-regulated entity is allowed by a regulator to recover specific costs, or earn a certain return, over time through regulated rates, which differ from standard IFRS treatment.\nThis standard permits entities that adopt IFRS for the first time to continue recognizing regulatory deferral account balances in their financial statements, even though there is no specific guidance in full IFRS for such accounts. However, IFRS 14 requires these accounts to be presented separately from other items in the financial statements, both on the face of the financial position statement and in the income statement. This distinction helps users of financial statements understand the nature of regulatory deferral balances and their impact on an entity’s financial performance.\nIFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nThis section focuses on IFRS 15, which provides a comprehensive framework for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. Students will learn the five-step model of revenue recognition, which includes identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. Topics such as variable consideration, warranties, significant financing components, and the treatment of contract costs are also covered in detail. The section includes numerous real-world examples, ensuring students understand how to apply IFRS 15 to complex revenue arrangements such as long-term contracts, licenses, and sales with multiple performance obligations.\nIFRS 16 - Leases\nIn this section, students will delve into IFRS 16, which revolutionized lease accounting by requiring lessees to recognize almost all leases on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Students will learn the scope of IFRS 16, the distinction between leases and service contracts, and the exemptions available for short-term leases and low-value assets. The section explains the initial and subsequent measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, including how to account for lease modifications. On the lessor side, students will learn about the classification of leases as operating or finance leases and the corresponding accounting treatment. Practical examples from various industries, such as retail and aviation, help students grasp the impact of IFRS 16 on financial reporting.\nIFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\nThis final section covers IFRS 17, a standard that fundamentally changes the accounting for insurance contracts. Students will learn how IFRS 17 aims to increase transparency in the financial statements of insurance companies by requiring consistent measurement of insurance liabilities. The section covers the general measurement model, which is based on the fulfilment cash flows and a contractual service margin. It also explores the premium allocation approach, an alternative for short-duration contracts. Students will understand how IFRS 17 affects the recognition of revenue and profits from insurance contracts and how to handle reinsurance contracts. Practical examples ensure that students can apply these concepts to real-world insurance accounting challenges.\nSection 18: Consolidated Financial Statements (Before & Post IFRS)\nThis section delves into the preparation and understanding of Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) before and after the introduction of IFRS standards. Consolidated financial statements are vital for businesses with subsidiaries as they present the financial health of the entire group. The lectures start with an introduction to CFS and focus on working on CFS sheets, highlighting the major changes that have occurred post-IFRS, particularly the redefinition of control in IFRS 10. The section explains the three elements of control and compares the new and previous definitions of control, emphasizing potential voting rights and control assessments. Special attention is given to the agency-principal relationship, structured entities, and the purpose and design of these entities in financial reporting. Practical examples, such as kick-out rights and relevant activities of investees, help clarify the application of these concepts. The section also covers consolidation procedures, including practical examples, key issues, and required disclosures under the new standards. The lectures conclude with an overview of GAAP versus IFRS and the complexities of joint venture accounting.\nSection 19: Revision - IFRS 1\nIFRS 1, First-time Adoption of IFRS, is a crucial standard for entities transitioning to IFRS for the first time. This section provides a comprehensive revision of the objectives and principles behind IFRS 1, discussing key concepts like exemptions, reporting requirements, and the conceptual framework underpinning IFRS. Using Excel examples, the lectures illustrate how first-time adopters should prepare financial statements, addressing initial and subsequent recognition and measurement. Emphasis is placed on disclosure requirements and reporting under IFRS, ensuring transparency for users of financial statements.\nSection 20: Revision - IFRS 2\nIFRS 2: Share-Based Payments focuses on the accounting treatment of transactions where entities receive goods or services in exchange for equity instruments or cash based on equity prices. The lectures cover key definitions and distinguish between equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments. Detailed disclosures and Excel examples are provided to demonstrate the practical application of IFRS 2 in financial reporting. The section concludes with an overview of the standard’s implications for financial statements.\nSection 21: Revision - IFRS 3\nIFRS 3: Business Combinations provides guidance on the accounting and reporting of business combinations, where one entity obtains control over another. This section introduces the objectives of IFRS 3, its definitions, and its approach to accounting for business combinations. Lectures focus on the recognition of non-controlling interests (NCI), the determination of acquisition dates, and the accounting for goodwill. Practical examples highlight the complexities involved in acquisition-related disclosures.\nSection 22: Revision - IFRS 4\nIFRS 4: Insurance Contracts provides interim guidance on the accounting for insurance contracts before the final IFRS 17 standard. This section explores the definitions and characteristics of insurance contracts, including the assessment of significant risk and the portfolio approach to measurement. Lectures cover initial recognition, subsequent measurement, and disclosure requirements, with Excel examples demonstrating these concepts in practice. The standard ensures that entities provide relevant information to users of financial statements regarding insurance risks and uncertainties.\nSection 23: Revision - IFRS 5\nIFRS 5: Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations focuses on the classification, measurement, and presentation of assets that are no longer part of an entity’s core operations. The section begins with an introduction to the standard’s objectives, conditions for classification, and accounting requirements. Through Excel illustrations, lectures explain the treatment of assets and liabilities held for sale, as well as disclosures related to discontinued operations, ensuring accurate representation in financial statements.\nSection 24: Revision - IFRS 6\nIFRS 6: Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources offers guidance on accounting for mineral exploration costs. This section introduces key definitions and explains the recognition and measurement of exploration assets, emphasizing the impairment of these assets. Lectures cover the presentation of mineral resources in financial statements and include Excel examples for depreciation and revaluation, providing practical insights into this niche area of accounting.\nSection 25: Revision - IFRS 7\nIFRS 7: Financial Instruments - Disclosures requires entities to provide information on the significance of financial instruments in their financial position and performance. This section highlights the qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to financial instruments, including risk exposures, management practices, and examples of financial instruments disclosures. The aim is to enhance transparency and enable users to understand an entity's financial risks.\nSection 26: Revision - IFRS 8\nIFRS 8: Operating Segments provides guidance on segment reporting, ensuring that the information reflects how management views the business. This section covers the identification of operating segments, their scope, and the related disclosures required for comparative reporting. Lectures explain segment reporting through Excel examples, illustrating how companies present financial performance across different business units or geographical areas.\nSection 27: Revision - IFRS 10\nIFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements outlines the consolidation model for reporting financial performance across a group of entities. This section introduces the control model for determining when an entity should consolidate another, addressing exceptions and practical challenges. Detailed examples help clarify the requirements and the proper application of IFRS 10.\nSection 28: Revision - IFRS 11\nIFRS 11: Joint Arrangements focuses on the accounting treatment for joint ventures and joint operations. This section covers the assessment of joint control, types of joint arrangements, and the appropriate accounting methods. Excel charts and examples demonstrate how to recognize and disclose joint ventures and operations in financial statements.\nSection 29: Revision - IFRS 12\nIFRS 12: Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities mandates comprehensive disclosures for interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and unconsolidated structured entities. This section explores the attributes of sufficient disclosures, covering both quantitative and qualitative information. Practical examples are used to show how to apply these disclosures in real-world scenarios.\nSection 30: Revision - IFRS 13\nIFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement provides a framework for measuring fair value and related disclosures. This section introduces key concepts such as the principal market, highest and best use, and measurement techniques for assets and liabilities. Through Excel examples, lectures illustrate the practical application of fair value measurement and the required disclosures to ensure transparency in financial statements.\nSection 31: Revision - IFRS 14\nThis section covers IFRS 14: Regulatory Deferral Accounts, which allows first-time IFRS adopters to continue recognizing regulatory deferral account balances. The lectures provide an overview of accounting for these accounts, their presentation in financial statements, and the necessary disclosures. Excel examples demonstrate the practical implementation of IFRS 14, helping entities transition to IFRS while maintaining the recognition of rate-regulated activities.\nConclusion\nBy the end of this comprehensive course on IFRS, students will have gained a thorough understanding of the International Financial Reporting Standards and how they apply to a variety of financial reporting situations. From first-time adoption to the recognition of complex transactions such as revenue, leases, and financial instruments, students will be equipped to handle the most challenging aspects of IFRS in their professional roles.

      "description": "This is an MBA Level course on Corporate Finance Fundamentals. We will begin by examining financial decisions that companies make. We will examine Capital Budgeting and Capital Structure decisions. We will examine data sources that are available for financial analysts to analyze financial decisions made by companies. Once we have analyzed financial decisions, we will carefully delineate the roles played by banks and financial institutions. We will distinguish between different types of financial institutions such as Commercial Banks, Investment Banks and Custody Banks. After we examine the roles played by financial institutions, we will examine different types of financial statements such as the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement and Statement of Shareholders' Equity. Next we will examine Time Value of Money concepts and Financial Asset Valuation. We will examine the concept of \"No Arbitrage Valuation by Comparable Companies.\" We will examine the Dividend Discount Model and the concepts of Expected and Realized Returns. Later in the course, we will examine historical returns. We will also examine how data is collected by statisticians and the applications of statistics in finance. Specifically we will examine several descriptive and inferential statistics. We will define risk specifically and statistical measures used to define risk. Finally we will examine the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital. We will cover the topics from a US Perspective but examine Global Insights once we cover topics. There are eight Global Insights sections in the course that will give you unique perspectives on how corporate finance is practiced worldwide.",

      "description": "SAP's Controlling (CO) module, specifically its Product Costing component, facilitates the comprehensive costing of products, taking into account various facets of production. In the context of Make To Order (MTO) scenarios combined with variant configurations, Product Costing allows businesses to ascertain the cost of customized products. Let's delve into the configuration and process flow:\n\n\nBasic Configuration Settings for Product Costing:\nOrganizational Structure (FI & CO): Define controlling areas, plants, company codes, and other relevant structures to enable financial and controlling functionalities.\nFinancial Accounting Settings:\nGL Accounts Creation: Define various general ledger accounts for inventory, cost of goods sold, etc.\nOBYC-FI-MM Integration: This is the automatic posting settings between FI and MM modules.\nBusiness Partner Creation: In S/4HANA, both vendors and customers are managed as business partners (BP).\nCost Component Structure (OKTZ): Define how various costs (e.g., material, labor) are grouped and shown in a cost estimate.\nCosting Variants (PPC1, PPP1, PPP2): These variants determine how the cost estimate is calculated. This includes valuation variants, date control, and transfer control.\nVariance Calculation & Settlement Configuration: Define variance keys and categories. The settlement configuration defines how these variances are allocated to different CO objects.\nSplitting Structure Mapping: Maps cost elements to activity types. This facilitates the activity-based costing method.\nActivity Rate Calculation (KP06, KP26, KSS4, KSPI): Plan and calculate rates for each activity type.\nMaterial Ledger Configuration: If you're using actual costing, the material ledger keeps track of price differences.\nProduct Costing by Sales Order with Variant Configuration:\nCosting Variant (PPC4): Specific to sales order costing; determines the rules of how a sales order item is costed.\nRequirement Class & Strategy: Ensure alignment of MRP and sales order behavior for the Make To Order scenarios.\nMaterial Type KMAT: Configuration materials are categorized under KMAT material type.\nCharacteristics & Classes (CT04, CL01): Characteristics represent features (e.g., color, size) of configurable products. They're grouped under classes.\nConfigurable Material Creation: Once characteristics and classes are in place, the KMAT material is created, indicating possible configurations.\n\"Super BOM\" Creation (CS01): This Bill of Materials (BOM) takes into account all possible components for the configurations.\nWork Centers & \"Super Routing\": Create work centers and then a comprehensive routing for the KMAT material that includes all possible operations.\nConfigurable Profile (CU41): Determines how the configuration of a KMAT material will be managed.\nProcess Flow:\nBusiness Partner Creation: Create vendors and customers.\nSales Order Creation (VA01): The sales order is raised with selected variants which trigger costing.\nPurchase & Transfer Posting: Raw materials are procured and then transferred to sales order stock.\nProduction Confirmation: The production process is confirmed for the sales order.\nGoods Receipt: The final product, based on the sales order, is received into stock.\nDelivery & Billing: The final product is delivered, and the customer is billed.\nVariance Calculation & Settlement: Any production variances are calculated and then settled to relevant CO objects.\nIn summary, the integration of Product Costing with the Make To Order scenario, especially with variant configuration, allows businesses to effectively and accurately cost products tailored to individual customer requirements. Proper configuration ensures efficiency, accuracy, and seamless integration between the module",

      "description": "In the finance business, a yield curve is used to visually display the current conditions of the market, and specifically some particular fixed income product (such as a corporate bond, or government note). The yield curve is a snapshot of interest rates in that market at a point in time, plotting the “yield to maturity” on the vertical axis and the “time to maturity” on the horizontal axis. A yield curve also is sometimes referred to as “the term structure of interest rates.”\nSimply put, if you are involved in the financial markets on any level (as an investor, analyst, salesperson, banker, advisor, or trader) you must understand what yield curves are, how they work (with changes in economic conditions, market movements, government policy, etc.), and you must be able to explain these curves to lay-people (including your colleagues and clients).\nIn this course, we dive deep into yield curves, although we start out with the basics:\n\n\nWhat is a yield curve and how is it “constructed?\nWhy do yield curves matter?\nWhat is “duration” and how does that impact the shape of the curve?\nHow is duration used in financial and market analysis\nWhat are “spot” and “forward” rates\nWhat is “total return analysis?”\nIf you want to “look smart” and BE smart in the investment management, investment banking, investor advisory and other related financial fields, this course is a MUST, not merely “optional.”\nMore about this course and Starweaver\nThis course is led by a seasoned capital markets industry practitioner and executive with many years of hands-on, in-the-trenches financial markets sales, trading and analysis work.

      "description": "Subcontracting and External Operation Process are crucial aspects of manufacturing in SAP. They represent ways in which a company can outsource part of their production to third parties. Here’s a detailed elaboration on the processes:\nSubcontracting Process\n1. Creation of Valuation Classes: Valuation classes help in determining the G/L account for postings.\nRM: Raw Material\nPACK: Packaging Material\nFG: Finished Goods\n2. Creation of G/L Accounts:\nRM & PACK Consumption: This is where costs related to the consumption of raw materials and packaging are posted.\nFG - COST of MFG from Vendor: Represents the cost incurred when manufacturing is done by the subcontractor.\nSubcontracting Charges Account: Captures additional charges related to subcontracting that are not part of material or production costs.\n3. OBYC Settings: Determines the automatic postings in Financial Accounting.\nConfigure for RM & PACK, FG, and subcontracting charges.\n4. OKTZ (Overhead Cost Groups):\nAssign overheads for RM and PACK. This determines how indirect costs are allocated.\n5. Cost Center Creation:\nSpecifically for the subcontracting process. Cost centers capture costs for specific departments or activities.\n6. Design Costing and Valuation Variant:\nTailored to the subcontracting process, determining how costs are calculated.\n7. Purchase Order:\nCreate using item category 'L' (Subcontracting). Transfer the necessary components to the subcontractor via a transfer posting.\n8. Goods Receipt:\nWhen subcontracted goods are received using Movement Type 101.\nExternal Operation Process Costing\n1. G/L Accounts for External Operation:\nRepresents costs associated with external operations. Configure this in OKTZ.\n2. Costing and Valuation Variant Design:\nFor external operation processes. This variant controls how costs are calculated for external operations.\n3. Purchase Info Record and Routing:\nPurchase Info Record contains details of the vendor and pricing for the external operation.\nRouting, with an external processing control key, dictates the sequence of operations and designates one or more operations as external.\n4. Production Order Creation:\nWhen the production order is created for a material with an external operation, a purchase requisition is automatically generated for that operation.\n5. Goods Receipt:\nGoods or services related to the external operation are received against the purchase order and are posted to the production order.\n6. Production Order - Cost Trend Option:\nThe cost trend in a production order shows various cost elements. It will display goods issue (cost of components), activity confirmation (production costs), and goods receipt (cost of the finished product).\n7. Variance Calculation and Settlement:\nAt the end of the month or production cycle, variances between planned and actual costs for the production order are calculated. The variances are then settled to their respective cost objects (like a cost center or a finished goods inventory account).\nBoth these processes showcase the flexibility of the SAP system to handle complex manufacturing scenarios where not all operations are performed in-house. The setup ensures proper accounting and cost tracking for activities outsourced to third parties.",

EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou'll learn about the basics of financial automation, including the most frequently automated activities (transaction processing, financial analysis, expense management, reconciliation), the benefits that financial automation has (higher efficiency, accuracy, scalability, real-time insights, cost reduction), and the usual types of automation technology;\nYou'll learn about the role of IT in finance, including the IT systems usually involved in automation (such as big ERP systems, external integrated platforms such as APIs, and internal proprietary applications), and their usual concerns (cybersecurity, compliance, disaster recovery, scalability, or model biases);\nYou'll learn about human versus automated forecasting, including the usual forecasted elements (equity prices, credit scores and defaults, sales and revenue, bank customer behavior like account closures, insurance claims, and portfolio risks, for example), the characteristics of human versus automated forecasting (the statistical and numerical methods used, like time series analysis and regression, and the data usually needed for each type), the usual AI/ML forecasting models used (such as neural networks, decision trees or ensemble trees, or deep learning models), the pros and cons of each, and when to use human or automated forecasting;\nYou'll learn about AI and ML as a type of automation technology, including common use cases (credit scoring, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, predictive analysis, recommendation systems), their different characteristics (explainable vs. accurate, generative vs. discriminative, supervised vs. unsupervised in training, or static vs. dynamic, for example), their major types (regression, classification and clustering), and their usual pros and cons;\nYou'll learn about RPA (Robotic Process Automation) and OCR (Optical Character Recognition), used to automate repetitive tasks, including their common use cases (invoice processing, compliance and monitoring, form automation, report generation, reconciliation, expense management, etc), and their usual pros and cons;\nYou'll learn about chatbots and NLP (Natural Language Processing), used to recognise and reply to text queries, including their common use cases (such as customer support and queries, transaction authorisation, finance advisory, document processing, onboarding processing, and so on), and their usual pros and cons;\nYou'll learn about blockchains and smart contracts, used to fully automate transaction process in a secure manner, including their common use cases (such as automated stock trading, automated insurance claims, automated lending and escrow, or automated identity verification), and their usual pros and cons;\nYou'll learn about generative AI, used to generate text, image, or other forms of media, its usual use cases (generating images, scenarios, reports, emails, documents, personalised financial advice, and more), and its usual pros and cons;\nYou'll learn about key AI ethics and considerations, including AI bias (and its causes and effects), AI transparency and explainability (including the accuracy - explainability tradeoff and XAI - eXplainable AI - techniques), the dilemma of false positives versus false negatives, the role of human intervention (should it override machine decisions, and, if so, under what circumstances), and security and robustness (how to protect models against unexpected inputs, and how to not reveal too much in outputs);\nYou'll learn about data considerations, including the key data disciplines (Data Management, Data Governance and Data Stewardship), important data principles (such as maintaining high Data Quality, or DQ, and seeing data as assets), and a focus on data protection by DG (such as what data to keep and when, how to protect the data, and what purposes the data can be used for);\nYou'll learn about some common challenges when implementing financial automation, of three major types (technological challenges, operational challenges, and security/ethical challenges), as well as how to mitigate these;\nYou'll learn about possible future trends, such as Intelligent Process Automation (IPA), quantum computing, decentralised finance, and ChatGPT and LLMs, including the challenges they may bring, and possible large-scale consequences in financial automation (the mass personalisation of everything, the interconnectedness of all systems, and a bigger focus on sustainability);\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit. I don't want you to waste your money.\nIf you think this course is a fit, and can take your knowledge of dealing with change to the next level... it would be a pleasure to have you as a student.\nSee on the other side!",

Save for the future, retire, and adjust your mindset for future financial success. 6 in 10 Americans don't have enough saved to cover an emergency. After this course, you will have the foundation built to keep you from becoming one of them. This course has helped over 1,000 students on Udemy take control of their finances.\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, one out of two Americans feels concerned or anxious about their personal finances.\nWhy?\nThere’s a huge number of reasons. A lot of people have none or very little money saved up for emergencies, plus, the majority of them have substantial student loans and credit card debt. Nevertheless, a lot of issues could be prevented if these people knew how to budget.\nIt might seem simple: you receive this amount every month, and you spend that amount. But do you actually know where your money goes? By paying just a little attention to tracking your payments, you might realize you overspend on unnecessary things and find ways to save that you never noticed before.\nA survey by Gallup shows only one-third of households in the US plan their finances and stick to the budget every month. In this personal finance course, I will teach you to do it too!\nA building block for your financial future\nIn 2008, the world was hit by a financial crisis, and I have personally seen a lot of people struggle. They hadn’t planned ahead, and the loss or shrinkage of income affected them in tremendous ways. To help people handle their money smarter and prevent similar disasters, I have started to consult people on how to budget.\nBy planning your finances, you can save without needing to restrict yourself too much, and be ready for whatever comes your way, be it an emergency, a vacation, or retirement. Therefore, understanding how to budget is truly a crucial skill for any individual or household.\nSimple enough for every family\nWhen asked why people do not plan their household budget, most people say it’s just too complicated for them. However, it’s very likely they never tried. The truth is, you do not need any particular skills or software. I will explain how to make a budget spreadsheet step by step – all you will need is a little time and dedication.\nBeing able to plan and track your income and spending will give you control over your personal budget that you need to feel comfortable. Not only will you learn how to make a budget spreadsheet, but you’ll also find out how to make your money work for you, invest and save for retirement! As you learn how to budget step by step, you will see it’s not that hard – however, your life will change immensely!\nWhy it’s worth to take a personal finance course\nThe video lectures I have prepared will not take a lot of your time. Nevertheless, it will give you a solid foundation of understanding how to budget. As soon as you get the basics down, it’s simple enough to become a monthly habit and even a regular evening activity for the whole family.\nNo matter your income, making a financial plan and sticking to it is a feasible task – let’s start working for a prosperous and no-stress future now!",

      "description": "Collateral Management\nWhat is collateral? Collaterals simply are the set of assets, in the form of securities or cash, delivered as security by the debtor to the creditor to hedge the credit risk of the financial transactions agreed between two parties. In the event of a debtor's default, the creditor has the right to keep the assets pledged as collateral to compensate for the financial loss suffered.\nThe practice of offering collateral, or \"collateralizing\" operations, has grown steadily in recent years, with the financial crisis of 2007-2008 resulting in further growth. The management of available collateral that may be used as security for debt thus becomes a strategic concern for the parties to mitigate the credit or counterparty risk.\nYou might be familiar with the collateral provided on loans, like a mortgage, where the banks or lending institutions have the right to take ownership of the house; if the debtor defaults on mortgage payments, the bank can take ownership of the house.\nHowever, collaterals are not limited to loans; from an investment banker’s perspective, collaterals are also required in derivatives and securities financing transactions. In derivatives, if the trades are made Over the counter (OTC) that is directly between two counterparties, the basis and arrangements of collateral will be made by the terms on which both the counterparties have agreed, and if the trades are made on exchanges, listed derivatives then the arrangements of collateral will be made on the rules determined by the clearinghouses.\nNow for securities financing transactions, collaterals are required for repurchase agreements, commonly known as Repos and Reverse Repos, where banks lend money among themselves or to the central bank for brief periods, usually overnight. Collaterals are also required in Stock Borrowing and Lending schemes, where stocks are borrowed and lent, for a maximum period of 12 months. A margin lending scheme that allows us to borrow money for investment purposes also requires collateral.\nReady to learn more, come learn with us.",
      "target_audience": [
        "The course is suitable for collateral management staff who would benefit from understanding the high level introduction of the topic, those who have had limited exposure to collateral but who require a greater understanding of the relationships between their work and collateral and those who have recently been transferred to the collateral management department."

      "description": "Welcome to the ultimate hands-on guide for aspiring investment bankers, finance analysts, and business professionals. This course—Investment Banking: Valuation, Financial Modeling & Pitchbook Mastery—covers everything from fundamental IB concepts to advanced DCF modeling, relative valuation, full-scale financial modeling of Siemens AG, and real-world pitchbook creation.\nYou'll begin by understanding the core structure of investment banking and work your way through in-depth valuation techniques, culminating in building financial models from scratch and presenting professional-grade pitch materials. Whether you're prepping for interviews or heading into your first IB role, this course prepares you to deliver at the highest level.\nSection 1: Investment Banking Fundamentals\nThis introductory module demystifies the investment banking ecosystem. You'll learn how IBs operate, their service offerings (like M&A advisory, capital raising, and trading), and how derivatives and commodities fit into their strategies. Real-world examples help illustrate how investment banks drive corporate finance globally and the key attributes that define the industry.\nSection 2: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method of Valuation\nIn this extensive section, you’ll master the foundational valuation approach used in investment banking—DCF. You'll learn how to forecast cash flows, calculate terminal value, and apply net debt, cost of capital, and beta adjustments. Several lectures cover a complete DCF case study, from assumptions to sensitivity analysis, preparing you for both real-world modeling and technical interview questions.\nSection 3: Relative Valuation\nThis section teaches you how to value a company by comparing it to peers using trading multiples like EV/EBITDA and P/E. You’ll understand how to select comparable companies, gather and clean data, and create comps tables. Siemens AG is used as a reference case to ground these techniques in a real-life scenario. You’ll also explore when comps don’t work and how to justify valuation decisions during interviews.\nSection 4: DCF Modeling Using Microsoft Excel\nApply your DCF theory in Excel, where you’ll calculate WACC using CAPM, project terminal value using the Gordon Growth method, and estimate intrinsic value. This module brings your conceptual learning into application, making your models presentation-ready. It's designed to solidify your grasp of building robust, defensible models that align with market valuations.\nSection 5: Financial Modeling of Siemens AG\nThis is the heart of the course, where you construct a complete 3-statement financial model for Siemens AG. You'll start with historical data, forecast income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows, and then perform detailed analysis: working capital, depreciation, debt schedules, equity roll-forward, and valuation. The section concludes with scenario analysis, ratio evaluation, indexing, and model optimization techniques.\nSection 6: Pitchbook Preparation\nInvestment bankers must present their findings in client-ready formats. This section teaches you how to write and structure pitchbooks. You’ll explore different types, including M&A, sell-side, and company profiles. Case studies like Dell, Autonomy, and Silverwood are used to illustrate layout, messaging, valuation summaries, and key investor insights—mirroring the deliverables expected at top banks.\nSection 7: Create Strip Profiles for Pitchbooks\nTake your presentation skills up a notch by learning to build strip profiles—one-page summaries of target companies. These mini pitch decks include recent news, financial highlights, ownership data, industry context, and more. You’ll practice creating these profiles using UK-based companies and real press release data to mirror how analysts work in deal teams.\nConclusion:\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have a full command over the investment banking toolkit—DCF and comps valuation, building financial models, preparing pitchbooks, and presenting your insights in a boardroom-ready format. This is more than just theory—it's hands-on, real-world training for anyone entering high-stakes finance.",

Or are you just interested in learning how to use credit cards responsibly and effectively? If you answered yes to any or all of these three questions then this course is aimed at you. The value you will receive from this course will be knowledge that you can use for a lifetime (so long as credit cards exist!). Every day people leave money on the table or throw money away paying interest. In this course you are going to learn how to never pay interest payments and reap benefits out of credit cards. If this was a clickbait style article this course would have to be called something like \"Credit card companies hate these tricks you can use to save & make money!\" because what you are going to learn in this course is how to shift the power paradigm in your favor instead of the credit card companies. There are no \"hacks\" or \"tricks\" it is just learning enough to take advantage of this system instead of it taking advantage of you.\nWhat will you learn?\nHow credit cards work\nHow to apply for a credit card\nHow credit card interest works\nThe many different types of credit cards available\nWhich type of credit card is right for you\nHow to get great deals and avoid the downsides of retail credit cards\nOverall advantages vs. disadvantages of using credit cards\nMost importantly: how to make free money using credit cards\nWhy choose this course?\nI created this course because I looked around myself and realized how little most people know about credit cards. There are many misconceptions around them and many people were never taught how to use them responsibly. This is not their fault but it is something that can be fixed and I want to help with that. Credit card companies have power over people who use them irresponsibly and/or don't understand how to reap the benefits of using them. Choose this course to gain the knowledge needed to be in control and get the free money that is left on the table by the credit card companies.",

      "description": "We live in a time in which credit scoring, specifically FICO scoring, means everything.\nYour score determines when and if you can purchase a home, when and if you can obtain a credit card and at what interest rate, where you rent or where you live, how much your transportation will cost you, what type of employment you have and how much you pay for insurance.\nIt is virtually impossible not to have your credit score affect you. You would literally have to be living off the grid for credit scoring to not affect you. Not many people can live off the grid.\nMy point with this course is for everyone to be well informed about credit and credit scoring, especially the FICO method. As you will see, the truth will probably open most of your eyes.\nEven if you have great credit and a great credit score, you will benefit, sometimes immensely. Just by applying some of my principles, you could see your credit score go up significantly.",

Perfect for investors and those who wish to fully understand a companies performance...including the one they may work for!\nYou will quickly learn step x step through screen sharing of real financial statements how to read each financial statement and evaluate how well that business is performing and are there any red flags or concerns.\nThere are 3 big financial statements that everyone should understand.\n1. The Balance Sheet (Company Report Card)\nA balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity.\nIt provides a snapshot of a company's finances (what it owns and owes).\nThe balance sheet adheres to an equation that equates assets with the sum of liabilities and shareholder equity.\nFundamental analysts use balance sheets to calculate financial ratios.\n2. The Income Statement (Did We Make Money?)\nReports a company's financial performance over a specific accounting period.\nNet Income = (Total Revenue + Gains) – (Total Expenses + Losses)\nAn income statement provides valuable insights into a company’s operations, the efficiency of its management, under-performing sectors and its performance relative to industry peers.\n3. Cash Flow Statement (What Does Our Cash Position Look Like)\nA cash flow statement is a financial statement that summarizes the amount of cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving a company.\nThe Cash Flow Statement measures how well a company manages its cash position, meaning how well the company generates cash.\nThe main components of the CFS are cash from three areas: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.\nI will share my screen and show you step x step, line x line, as we evaluate a company together.\n\n\nThanks for your interest in the course and all you need to do now is click the button to enroll and get started.\nMany thanks and I look forward to seeing you in your first lesson!\nSteve Ballinger\n\n\nDisclaimer Note: This course is for educational and informational purposes only.

      "description": "Still confused about Islamic finance? Islamic and conventional finance seem similar?  What exactly is Riba? Search for answer to these questions led me to be a part of Islamic finance industry. Why?\nLike many of you out there; who require answer to these questions; my research journey started with reading articles on the internet and papers by scholars and academicians. The review of this rich text sustained my initial interest in the subject while at the same time clarifying the questions that I had in my mind.\nHowever while doing my personal research I realized two things. Firstly the text on Islamic finance is very diverse in nature with differing opinions between scholars and academicians. Secondly it presents Islamic finance as an idealistic or utopian model purely in a theoretical manner. This theoretical manner completely ignores the current realities of the business, economics, societal and other practical implications in the real world. This led me to question how far is the theoretical model implemented by Islamic banks and financial institutions in areas related to Corporate finance, trade finance, treasury, investment banking, etc. This question could only be answered by by observing and experiencing the practice of Islamic finance industry first hand.\nIn this introductory course, rather than focusing on theoretical aspects of Islamic finance only, we take a real world practice based approach to present the concepts of Islamic finance and how it differs from conventional banking. The course aims to equip students to acknowledge the theoretical aspects of Islamic finance and how far that theory is practiced by Islamic banks.\nAt the end of this course the students will be able to:\n1) Understand the definition of riba as per classical texts\n2) Identify whether riba is present or not in any given banking transaction.\n3) Understand the ways in which Islamic banks avoid riba in there daily financial transactions.\n4) Realize the difference between balance sheets of Islamic and conventional banks.\n5) Understand and respond to the doubts raised on Islamic financial systems.",

Most issuances to date have mimicked bond structures that are ultimately dependent upon a sovereign credit. However, the use of Sukuk is rapidly expanding into other areas like project, infrastructure and real estate financings; corporate financings and true asset securitizations. The aim of this workshop is to familiarize individuals practicing in Islamic and conventional finance with the principles, structures, and methodologies and practical transactional issues relating to the use of Sukuk in modern Islamic finance. It will also  explain various structures that underlie Sukuk, including the Ijara, Musharaka, Mudaraba, Murabaha and others.",

      "description": "**Latest course update and full review in August 2024. Now with more than 30 Udemy Online Coding Exercises - NEW Feature!**\n\n\nHi and welcome to this Course!\nThis is the first-ever comprehensive Python Course for Business and Finance Professionals. You will learn and master Python from Zero and the full Python Data Science Stack with real Examples and Projects taken from the Business and Finance world.\nThis isn´t just a coding course. You will understand and master all required theoretical concepts behind the projects and the code from scratch.\nImportant: the quality Benchmark for the theory part is the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) Curriculum. The Instructor of this course holds a Master´s Degree in Finance and passed all three CFA Exams. In this course, we leave absolutely no room for wrong/dubious (but frequently promoted) practices like LSTM stock price predictions or using stock prices in linear regressions.\nYou will become an expert not only in Python Coding but also in\nBusiness & Finance (Time Value of Money, Capital Budgeting, Risk, Return & Correlation, Monte Carlo Simulations, Quality and Risk Management in Production and Finance, Mortgage Loans, Annuities and Retirement Planning, Portfolio Theory, Portfolio Optimization, Asset Pricing & Factor Models, Value-at-Risk)\nStatistics (descriptive & inferential statistics, Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis Testing, Normal Distribution & Student´s t-distribution, p-value, Bootstrapping Method, Monte Carlo Simulations, Normality of Returns)\nRegression (Covariance & Correlation, Linear Regression, Multiple Regression and its pitfalls, Hypothesis Testing of Regression Coefficients, Logistic Regression, ANOVA, Dummy Variables, Links to Machine Learning, Fama-French Factor Models)\nThis course follows a mutually reinforcing concept: Learning Python and Theory simultaneously:\nLearning Python is more effective when having the right context and the right examples (avoid toy examples!).\nLearning and mastering essential theories and concepts in Business, Finance, Statistics and Regression is way easier and more effective with Python as you can simulate, visualize and dynamically explain the intuition behind theories, math and formulas.\nThis course covers in-depth all relevant and commonly used Python Data Science Packages:\nPython from the very Basics (Standard Library)\nNumpy and Scipy for Numeric, Scientific, Financial, Statistical Coding and Simulations\nPandas to handle, process, clean, aggregate and manipulate Tabular (Financial) Data. You deserve more than just Excel!\nstatsmodels to perform Regression Analysis, Hypothesis Testing and ANOVA\nMatplotlib and Seaborn for scientific Data Visualization\nThis course isn´t just videos:\nDownloadable Jupyter Notebooks with thousands of lines of code\nDownloadable PDF Files containing hundreds of slides explaining and repeating the most important concepts\nDownloadable Jupyter Notebook with hundreds of coding exercises incl. hints and solutions\nI strictly follow one simple rule in my coding courses: No code without explaining the WHY. You won´t hear comments like \"...that´s the Python code, feel free to google for more background information and figure it out yourself\". Your boss, your clients, your business partners and your colleges don´t accept that. Why should you ever accept this in a course that builds your career?  Even the best (coding) results have only little value if they can´t be explained and sold to others.\nI am Alexander Hagmann, Finance Professional and best-selling Instructor for (Financial) Data Science, Finance with Python and Algorithmic Trading. Students who completed my courses work in the largest and most popular tech and finance companies all over the world. From my own experience and having coached thousands of professionals and companies online and in-person, there is one key finding: Professionals typically start with the wrong parts of the Python Ecosystem, in the wrong context, with the wrong tone and for the wrong career path.\nDo it right the first time and save time and nerves! What are you waiting for? There is no risk for you as you have a 30 Days Money Back Guarantee.\nThanks and looking forward to seeing you in the Course!",

      "description": "Account-Based COPA (Controlling Profitability Analysis) is a critical component of SAP S/4 HANA Finance and offers significant advantages over the traditional costing-based COPA.\n\n\nLet's delve into the advantages and topics covered in an Account-Based COPA course.\nAdvantages of Account-Based COPA:\nReconciliation with General Ledger (GL):\nIn the ECC world, account-based COPA was primarily leveraged to reconcile with the GL. In S/4 HANA, the integration with the Universal Journal ensures that all postings in the GL are simultaneously posted to COPA.\nStructure of the Profitability Segment:\nThe profitability segment in account-based COPA is built using GL accounts and characteristics, providing a clear representation of profitability.\nEnhanced Importance in S/4HANA:\nWith the advent of S/4HANA, the functionality and importance of account-based COPA increased manifold, especially with the Universal Journal's introduction.\nSimplified Configuration:\nAccount-based COPA requires less configuration than costing-based COPA. The elimination of condition types, variance mappings, and other complexities reduce the setup time.\nEasy Reconciliation:\nWith all values being directly mapped to GL accounts, the reconciliation process is straightforward and can be executed without additional periodic settlement jobs.\nReal-time Updates:\nThere's no waiting for periodic jobs to run. All postings reflect in the profitability segments in real-time, ensuring up-to-date profitability analysis.\nDirect Reconciliation with GL:\nGiven that values in account-based COPA are from GL accounts, reconciling is more straightforward, further strengthening its advantage.\nTopics Covered in the Account-Based COPA Course:\nSetting Up:\nCreating the Operating Concern for account-based COPA and configuring the required settings.\nUnderstanding the concept of TR (Transfer Requirement) generation.\nSales Planning and Margin Analysis:\nUsing KEPM for sales planning with a cost element perspective.\nValue flows in Margin Analysis.\nPredictive Accounting related to Incoming Sales Orders.\nExtension Ledger creation for Predictive Accounting.\nReal-time COPA in S/4 HANA:\nCovering topics like activation of derivation for items without a profitability segment.\nUnderstanding how items tied to cost centers, internal orders, and production orders update in ACDOCA.\nCOPA Realignment and Derivation:\nUsing KEND for COPA realignment.\nLeveraging KEDR for COPA derivation.\nUnderstanding COPA assessment cycles with KEU1 and KEU5.\nSettlement to COPA:\nSettling expenses from internal orders to COPA.\nCOGS Split in Margin Analysis:\nUnderstanding the split of the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).\nConfigurations related to COGS split in OBYC.\nReporting in Account-Based COPA:\nThough traditional reporting tools like Report Painter and KE30 might not be heavily used, the course would touch upon them. Emphasis would be on extracting data from the ACDOCA table and designing custom reports (Z-reports).\nThe approach to Account-Based COPA in S/4HANA integrates financial and managerial accounting on one platform, offering real-time insights, faster month-end closes, and simplified data models. This course would equip participants with the knowledge to implement and use Account-Based COPA effectively in an S/4HANA environment.",

      "description": "I believe the best place to start is with \"Why\".\nWhy: Far too many people are stuck in the system, not living the life that they actually want to be living. “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” - Howard Thurman\nHow: One way is financial independence, via personal finance.\nThis course is a breakdown of simple, actionable, day-to-day steps that you can take right away to get on the path to financial independence. We'll cover the biggest spending categories of 1) food 2) shelter 3) transportation 4) and self care, and how to optimize these to lower spending, increase income, and maximize savings. Savings that you can invest to make your money work for you, not the other way around! So that you have the time and resources to pursue what makes you come alive.\nThis course breaks down, step-by-step, how to save over $60,000 in 2 years. I did this while living in one of the most expensive cities, while at the same job, and while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. No deprivation required.\nWho: Maybe you're broke, struggling with credit card debt, drowning in student loans, living paycheck-to-paycheck, unable to save much of anything. Or perhaps you have some savings but want to get in control of personal finances and save more faster in order to do your thing as soon as possible.\nMe: I've been through all these scenarios -- from broke in NYC with nothing but a suitcase and lots of debt, to a cushy job where I made money and spent money, through a struggle of working for someone else's dream, to a realization that I have to create my own path.\nIn 2 years I completely changed my life, doing something that I didn’t think was possible.\n\nI saved over $60,000, bought and renovated a multi-unit property in Brooklyn, moved my mom up to NYC, started working for myself, and doing what I've always wanted to do (but didn't think was possible), all the while on the path to financial independence.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nSome things you'll learn in the course:\n- How to assess your personal finances: your current net worth and savings rate\n- How to calculate # of years to financial independence\n- How to automate financial tracking, so you always know where you are and where you're going\n- How to optimize the biggest spending categories of 1) food 2) shelter 3) transportation 4) and self care\n- Every tip and trick I used to cut spending by 60% and push my savings rate over 75%\n- How to simultaneously supplement your income via the sharing economy\n- No jargon approach to invest your surplus wealth, and get your money to work for you\n- Concrete, step-by-step breakdown to a financial independence foundation\n- Plus so much more. There are over 50+ lectures included in this course.",

      "description": "A bank card is typically a plastic card issued by a bank to its clients that performs one or more of a number of services that relate to giving the client access to bank account.\nPhysically, a bank card will usually have the client's name, the issuer's name, and a unique card number printed on it.\nIt will have a magnetic strip on the back enabling various machines to read and access information. Depending on the issuing bank and the preferences of the client, this may allow the card to be used as an ATM card, enabling transactions at automatic teller machines; as debit card, linked to the client's bank account and able to be used for making purchases at the point of sale.\nCards can be classified on the basis of their issuance, usage and payment by the card holder. There are four types of cards (a) debit, (b) credit, (c) prepaid, and (d) electronic.\nDebit cards are issued by banks and are linked to a bank account. Credit cards are generally issued by banks and a couple of non-banks, but can also be issued by other approved entities. Prepaid cards are issued by banks / non-banks against the value paid in advance by the cardholder and stored in such cards which can be issued in the form of cards or wallets\nA card can be swiped (Magnetic-Stripe card), dipped (Chip based card) or tapped (Contactless Near Field Communication {NFC} Card) at a PoS terminal.\nThis course discusses about the working mechanism of cards.

This course is no different to the latter, however, I feel a brief background of your teacher may explain why this course is special.\n\n\nI have been extremely fortunate to have an extensive education and even more so, the opportunity to teach at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa’s best university for Accountancy and Finance. I am currently completing my articles, on my way to becoming a certified Chartered Accountant. I have been even more fortunate to be exposed to the teachings of Warren Buffett and many famous investors from a very young age. It is no coincidence that, as a result of this exposure, value investing is the one thing that keeps me up at night. It is the one thing that entices my interest like no other. I have a deep passion for value investing which I would like to share with you. It has been a culmination of hours of reading, rookie mistakes, patience and a little luck which has enabled me to be in a position where I feel I am able to teach you something that is not ordinarily taught at university or college.\n\n\nThis is a brand new course. None of that out-dated information and old fashioned slides stuff. This course provides modern material and slides, high-quality sound, to the point lectures, easy to understand concepts, real-life examples, interesting articles, bonus content and much more.\n\n\nComing out of this course, you will:\nHave an investing account set-up;\nKnow how to trade stocks;\nKnow the value-investment plan for the active and inactive investor;\nKnow key financial concepts and the important areas of the financial statements;\nKnow how to determine intrinsic value; and\nHow to invest your hard-earned money safely and maximise your return.",

They taught you next to NOTHING about how to manage it in school! The result has been a generation who has mismanaged budgets, racked up debts, defaulted on mortgages, lost investments, and failed to keep retirement plans. While a small proportion of the country has figured out how to make money work for them, most of us are part of the shrinking middle class who are losing out.\nThat's where Personal Financial Well Being comes in. University Instructor and former Silicon Valley Chief Financial Officer Richard Okumoto has developed this course for the Dot University to narrow the Wealth GAP and demystify personal money management.\nThe course applies two core techniques which Accelerates Time-to-Knowledge. Starting with a landscape view then introducing primary building blocks provides an accelerated path to connect-the-dots on how money works:\nHow do you manage your money?\nHow do you manage debt?\nHow do you determine your financial wealth?\nHow do you pay your fair share of taxes, and nothing more?\nHow do you prepare for retirement?\nHow should you invest your money?\nHow do you prepare your estate for when you pass on?\nPersonal Financial Well Being means having the answers to all of these questions and knowing how they interlock and work together. The course is built on the following (3) CORE Building Blocks (GAP Approach):\n1. Generating Positive Cash Flow – “Understanding your money to keep more of it!”\nTools and techniques to understand your money. This includes: Personal Budgeting, Debt Management, Personal Income Taxes, and Retirement Planning (Part 1).\n2.

This includes: Determining Wealth, Investing (part 1 & 2), and Retirement Planning (Part 2).\n3. Protecting What you Have – “How to conquer Financial Risk!”\nTools and techniques to understand asset protection.

Industry-specific factors, such as the unique risks associated with different sectors, are also explored to give students a nuanced understanding of credit assessments. By the end, participants will be well-versed in how rating agencies evaluate credit risks using standardized yet adaptable practices.\nSection 12: Credit Ratings of Banks\nFocusing on the banking industry, this section delves into the specific criteria that influence a bank’s credit rating. Learners will understand the importance of asset quality, how restructured loans affect a bank’s financial standing, and the impact of foreign currency exposure on credit risk. This section is particularly relevant for those looking to specialize in financial institutions, as it explains the nuances of how banks are rated differently compared to other businesses due to their unique financial structures. Students will also explore how liquidity, capital adequacy, and regulatory environments play a role in determining a bank’s overall creditworthiness.\nSection 13: Credit Risk Modeling for Beginners\nIntroducing students to the world of credit risk modeling, this section offers a foundational understanding of how to assess and predict the risk of default.

Each method of raising capital has its pros and cons which the company has to consider carefully, as the choice will affect the company's weighted average cost of capital, profitability, liquidity, and solvency.\nThe course starts by looking at the financial life-cycle of a company, from start-up to corporation. At each stage, the type of financing will differ. If the company decides to go public, it can do so via an initial public offering (IPO) which is the more popular way. Setting the offering price is a very important aspect of the IPO and we will explore different methods of calculating the offering price.\nNext, we will look at different activities that generates revenue for the investment bank, from M&As to trading operations.\nPublic listed companies may decide to go private and the course explores the advantages of doing so.\nIf the company decides to issue debt to fund capital projects, then it must choose a maturity for its debt and there are different considerations. Companies may also decide to restructure its existing bond issue and refund it at a lower rate. You will learn to calculate the components required to arrive at the net present value of the bond refunding.\nFinally, the course looks at the risk structure of debt in project financing and its potential benefits for borrowers and lenders.",

      "description": "This 2-part course covers both the operational budgeting process and the capital budgeting process.\nIn part 1 of this course we focus on how to prepare an operating budget. Done well, a budget provides a clear flight plan for where the organization wants to go in a given year, what route it plans to take there and what resources it will need to do so. However, unfortunately few budgets are done well and even fewer leaders use their budget effectively on a day-to-day basis to manage their department, business unit or division.\nSo, to help you buck that trend we will teach you a 4 step process to help you prepare a really good budget and we will also discuss in detail how to use your budget as an effective management tool.\nIn part 2 we then focus on the capital budgeting process. This is the process of allocating resources for major capital expenditure or investment expenditures. Leaders throughout a company will need to know how to work through this process as and when their strategic plans for their department or division involve significant capital investments. It varies by company what the actual threshold is at which a company requires its leaders to go through this process for approval. It can be as low as $1000 or as high as $50,000.\nWe will explore in detail how to analyze any proposed capital expenditure and how to make recommendations based on the outcomes of those analyses. This will involve a review of the following 4 capital budgeting methods:\nPayback period\nNet Present Value\nInternal rate of return (IRR)\nProfitability index\nAfter working through this part of the course you should feel fully equipped to successfully handle your company’s capital budgeting process as and when you need to gain approval for key capital expenditures.\nNote: At the end of each section you'll find a downloadable copy of the syllabus for that section of the course.",

You are helping the clients discover whether they are really as cash strapped as they think they are.\n\n\nSecondly, you are helping the clients from a psychological standpoint. This is the part that most financial advisors miss out on... People save more money when they feel good about what they are doing with their finances.\n\n\nThis program teaches you how to paint your prospects and clients in a way that gets them to be financially responsible and have that manifest itself in a very cool-looking budget for them, the clients, and you, the advisor.\n\n\nThis rings your cash register.\nIt’s not just about creating a budget\nDon’t let the title of this course fool you. We’re not just creating a budget here.\nThis program includes Jason Teteak and Guru Karl Dettmann. Karl will show you exactly what he does in his practice to uncover your clients spending pain points, how to bridge the marital stress gap, delivering a “budget” solution, and more.\nYou’ll learn how to ask the right questions to get your client acting and thinking the way they need to.\nThis is how we help our clients live better lives.",

Where answers are set, the calculations have been turned into quizzes to be taken at the end of each chapter, with immediate grading available.\nThis online class has been slightly modified from the physical paperback book. Quizzes have been added that will allow the students to quiz their knowledge of the chapter topic immediately. The paperback books available through my site or on Amazon, will not have all of these quizzes.\nPersonal financial literacy is a required topic in high school, earning the student either half a credit or one full credit.\nEach chapter will have a list of learning objectives.

It also emphasizes on the execution of options strategies. These tutorials will help you kick start your career in this exciting market. All countries have financial markets, which invariably play a key role in their economic growth story.

Nevertheless, irrespective of their size, their contribution to the economy remains the same globally.\nThe essential function of a financial market is to connect investors and borrowers. Thus, it links the two, and the market earns some commission for providing the bridge. They ensure transactions are smooth.\nThe trust of the investors drives the financial markets. Hence, the regulation of financial markets ensures that the investors are always protected. The financial markets are governed by rules & regulations that differ for each market.\nThe financial intermediaries are banks, NBFCs, stock exchanges, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokers to these companies, etc. These facilitate the trade between the parties.\nThe financial markets are readily available for both parties. However, the timing of each financial market differs as per the type of market.\nThe financial market includes securities that are marketable as well as which are non-marketable. Investors trade non-marketable securities, such as fixed deposits in banks, post office investments, or private loans, over the counter (OTC) rather than on an exchange. On the other hand, marketable securities such as stocks and bonds are traded over an exchange.\nInvestors may have short-term, medium-term, or long-term perceptions. Therefore, if a financial market can meet the needs of every type of investor, it is considered effective.\nAlso, the financial market should be effective enough to reward the investor based on the risk the investor assumes.\nThe online Financial Markets and Products tutorials would help you:\nUnderstand what Derivatives are and how this market works.\nIn depth learn the types of Derivative instruments\nComprehensive understanding of the Options contract and the strategies involved.\nTo design alternative derivatives-Options strategies that would be appropriate for different situations and describe the advantages and disadvantages of each.\nMechanics of futures markets\nHedging strategies using futures\nInterest rates\nDetermination of forward and future prices\nInterest rate futures\nSwaps\nProperties of stock options\nTrading strategies involving options\nBank| Insurance| Fund Management| Derivatives| Futures| Markets| Forex| Options| Interest Rates| Bonds| Mortgage etc",

      "description": "***Now with over 50% more course content. Get explosive information on market strategies... options... Bitcoin... and more, all for the same price.\n\n\nThroughout the developed world there is an invisible glass ceiling above the middle-class... Keeping average people from getting ahead.\nMortgage debt... Auto debt... Credit card debt... Student loan debt... Rising costs of living... Exploding health care costs... Stagnant wages... Artificially low interest rates... Globalization... Automation... Robotics... Artificial intelligence...\nIt all conspires to keep the glass ceiling just overhead.\nBut there is a way out. Financial independence is more possible than ever in the Information Age.\nYou won't shatter the glass ceiling playing their game, however. To achieve financial freedom, you need a new game... a new set of rules.\nYou need a new perspective.\nSimply contributing to a 401(k) or buying a basket of mutual funds just isn't going to cut it. Not in today's world.\nYou see, most of the conventional wisdom is dangerous when it comes to personal finance. There may be nuggets of truth in the mainstream messages... But they approach finance as if it were a static institution.\nThey do not explore money and monetary history. They do not analyze macroeconomic trends. They certainly don't cover the intricacies of the capital markets with central bank interventions.\nMost conventional sources still parrot the same message:\nBuy term and invest the difference... earn 6-8% a year in low-fee mutual funds... stop buying lattes... retire rich.\nIt sounds nice. And it sells books. But it doesn't work.\nFor one, you can’t earn 6-8% a year in mutual funds anymore. You will be lucky to break even. And you may even lose your shirt if you own the wrong assets.\nAnd saving $5 a day by dropping Starbucks amounts to a whopping $1,825 per year. Do that for twenty years and you'll have $36,500... Which won't even fund one year of retirement.\nYou see, generalizations are deadly in the world of finance. There are just too many moving pieces.\nYou need a targeted investment strategy if you want to shatter the glass ceiling and achieve financial freedom.\nAt Bulletproof Personal Finance, there are two layers to this...\nFirst, we want to spread our capital across a number of asset classes according to a targeted allocation ratio. Think of these asset classes as \"buckets\".\nCash... Precious Metals... Real Estate... Stocks... Bonds... and Bitcoin - we want to build strategic exposure to each asset class.\nAnd this course will cover everything you need to know to build your own asset allocation model.\nNext, we want to employ the best strategies within each asset class. We want to fill our buckets with strategic investments according to the financial climate.\nThat's where our advanced strategies come in. This course series presents strategies that will succeed in both bull markets and bear markets.\nSo, we want to build a strategic outer layer of asset buckets. Then we want to hone in on targeted investments to put into those buckets.\nIn his book titled Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder, Nassim Taleb defined antifragility as: the ability to benefit from shocks; the ability to thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors.\nOur two-layer approach is all about building antifragility.\nWe want to build an asset portfolio that will protect our capital... benefit from existing macroeconomic trends... and generate big returns with a few key investments.\nThe goal is to gain financial independence - the ability to choose our own course regardless of what life throws at us.\nAnd that means we need to be able to thrive as the world around us changes. After all, this universe is irrefutably marked by change and paradox. Nothing stays the same forever.\nBulletproof Personal Finance accounts for this with our two-layer strategy. The outer layer is all about fundamentals. The inner layer is all aboutdynamic strategies that work in any market and economic climate.\nBut it all starts with the fundamental principles.",

      "description": "Engineer-to-Order (ETO) product costing flow in SAP S/4 HANA, which is often associated with the Project Systems (PS) module due to its project-oriented nature.\n\n\nETO is a strategy where products are manufactured based on each specific customer's requirements. It involves unique designs and specifications for every order, requiring close integration of sales orders, design, manufacturing, and costing.\nA) ETO Production Process with Production Order\nProject Creation: Upon receiving a sales order, a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) element is auto-generated. This is achieved by having a standard project template with predefined WBS elements and networks.\nDesign Phase: This includes designing the BOM (Bill of Material) and Routing, which lay out the materials required and the production steps, respectively.\nProduction Order Creation: A production order is generated with reference to the WBS. This production order gets its BOM and routing from the ETO product.\nGoods Issue: Materials required for production are consumed. This process reduces inventory and books the costs to the production order.\nActivity Confirmation: The labor hours and machine hours used in the production process are confirmed, recording the actual time taken for each operation.\nGoods Receipt: Once the production is completed, the finished goods are received into stock. This results in capitalizing the finished product's cost.\nVariance Calculation: Differences between planned and actual costs are determined.\nSettlement: The costs accumulated on the production order are settled to the WBS element.\nBilling & Revenue Recognition: Once the product is delivered to the customer, billing is done. The revenue is captured at the WBS level.\nResults Analysis (RA) Key Calculation: Determines profit/loss by comparing the revenue against the costs.\nCOPA Settlement: The profitability of the order is analyzed by settling the data to Controlling Profitability Analysis (COPA).\nB) ETO Production Process without Production Order\nProject Creation: Similar to the above process, a WBS element is auto-generated upon receiving a sales order using a standard project template.\nWork Centers & Activities: Define work centers for different activities like machining, labor, etc.\nGoods Issue: Materials are issued directly to the WBS element, thereby reducing inventory and booking costs to the WBS.\nActivity Confirmation: Labor and machine hours are confirmed directly against the network activity.\nResults Analysis (RA) Key Calculation: Determines profit/loss by comparing the revenue (from billing) against the costs accumulated at the WBS element level.\nCOPA Settlement: The profitability is analyzed by settling to COPA.\nConclusion: In ETO scenarios, the SAP Project Systems (PS) module's integration with Controlling (CO) and Logistics (LO) is crucial. Whether with a production order or without, it's essential to maintain transparency of costs and revenues associated with each project. SAP's ability to link these elements ensures accurate cost tracking and profitability analysis for ETO scenarios.",

It is delivered in a clear manner which made the subject easy to understand. I had little very little corporate finance knowledge before the course and know I feel confident with reading financial documents and interpreting the stock-market. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to learn about corporate finance as its a great introduction with many valuable resources/ It would suit a person with a non finance background or someone who is looking to refresh their knowledge.

The answer is a resounding no. Let's explore the potential pitfalls of this approach...\n\n\nImagine your business as a competitive sports team. Just as a coach needs to understand each player's strengths and the dynamics of the game to win, mastering your financial numbers is essential for driving your business to victory.\n\n\nWith my expertise in business and mathematics, I'm here to guide you in developing a winning financial strategy. Together, we'll unravel the intricacies of your finances, empowering you to make confident, informed decisions that drive your business forward.\n\n\nReady to make the leap?\n\n\nCritical Strategies for Leveraging Financial Insights:\n- Demystify Your Revenue Streams: Gain a precise understanding of how your business earns profit, much like knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your team. This knowledge of revenue inflows and associated costs will enhance profitability and operational efficiency.\n- Focus on Gross Profit: Recognize that gross profit is more than a number; it's the backbone of your business, supporting all other activities and facilitating future planning and investments, just as a strong defense supports a winning team.\n- Smart Allocation of Budgets: Use your understanding of gross profit to allocate funds to critical expenses like rent and payroll intelligently, ensuring they support rather than hinder your growth. It's like strategizing your resources to strengthen the key players in your team.\n- Strategic Marketing Investment: Learn the art of budgeting for marketing. Determine the optimal amount to invest in attracting new customers, which is crucial for expanding your market reach without compromising operational funds, similar to how a coach invests in training to improve the team's performance.\n- Utilize Numbers to Propel Growth: Move beyond maintenance; use financial insights strategically to drive your business to new heights.

I'll give you the hammer, you decide where to drive the nail.\nI take complex ideas and make them simple enough for a 5th grader to understand.\nFor the first time, those who can educate and motivate themselves will be almost entirely free to invent their own work and realize the full benefits of their own productivity.\n\n\nEveryone should learn at least one new skill every year, otherwise you’re going backwards.\nSkill Stack = Net Worth\n\n\nInvestor’s Edge: This course also sharpens your investing acumen, enabling you to make informed decisions by understanding the intricate ties between market dynamics and corporate health. It’s an approach designed for managers and those looking to become savvy investors, providing the knowledge to assess potential, risk, and reward with the insight of a seasoned financial strategist.\n\n\nI have added lots of quick quizzes to test your comprehension along the way.\nPractice with struggle > practice without struggle.\nAn example is a study of two groups of students. Group A studied a paper for 4 days. Group B studied it for 1 day and was tested on it for 3 days.\nAt the final test, Group B scored 50% more than Group A.\nWhy?\nWith every test, group B struggled. And that targeted struggle made them acquire more knowledge in the same amount of time.\nThis is about self motivation and the measure of self-motivation in a person is the best predictor of upward mobility.

A very engaging course, which I will be recommending to my colleagues! Thank you, John!\n\n\nI was looking for a whole overview course as opposed to the shorter more specialized learnings. I am delighted I chose your course! Hopefully many students will decide to take this course!\n\n\nThanks again for everything John! Best of luck with all your future students, they will benefit from this course!\n- Kim\n\n\n“The first half of my life I went to school.

Corporate Finance comprises a set of skills that interact with all the aspects of running a business. It is also extremely helpful in our personal lives when making decisions about buying or leasing, borrowing money, and making big purchases. It provides analytic tools to think about getting, spending, and saving.\n\n\nThe tax law is a series of incentives for entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe tax laws favor entrepreneurs and investors. That’s because entrepreneurs and investors generally put money into the economy to produce rather than consume.\n\nBut, paying taxes is less expensive than failing at business. Be sure to get educated before you begin.\n\nStart acting like an entrepreneur or an investor. That means the first thing you need to do is to increase your financial intelligence by investing in financial education.\nContent and Overview\nWe will explore the time value of money and develop a set of tools for making good financial decisions, tools like Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return.  We will explore the trade off between risk and return, and how to value income producing assets.\nValuation of companies and assets can seem mysterious. Where do you even begin? How can you value a startup that doesn’t even have any revenues yet? You will gain confidence in your knowledge and understanding of these concepts.\nThe tools of corporate finance will help you as a manager or business owner to evaluate performance and make smart decisions about the value of opportunities and which to pursue.  An understanding of Corporate Finance is essential for the professional manager in order to meaningfully discuss issues with colleagues and upper management. You need to be versed in this subject in order to climb any corporate ladder. Get started understanding corporate finance today.\n\n\nThis course is based on my best selling book MBA ASAP Understanding Corporate Finance. Here are some reviews:\nI am a big fan of your books, which make all these difficult topics really easy to understand. This is excellent work.   Adnan\n\n\nAfter reading John Cousins' book I was finally able to understand a subject that has been, for me, very foreign and intimidating. He makes the topic of corporate finance accessible to people like me who need the knowledge but easily get lost \"in the weeds\". Clear and very easy to digest and apply!  Lizabeth\nHaving read the ’10 minutes to understanding Corporate Finance’ I can honestly say that it comprises a well-structured and straightforward presentation of the core elements of corporate finance. Nikolaos   Learn:\n· What Is an Asset?\n· Profit\n· Profit Margin\n· Valuation\n· Cash Flow Statement\n· Income Statement\n· Balance Sheet\n· Financial Ratios\n· Cost-Benefit Analysis\n· Lifetime Value\n· Overhead\n· Costs: Fixed and Variable\n· Breakeven\n· Amortization\n· Depreciation\n· Time Value of Money\n· Compounding\n· Leverage\n· Bootstrapping\n· Return on Investment (ROI)\n· Sunk Costs\n· Internal Controls\nAnd much, much more!\nKnowing finance is power.\nPerhaps the most fundamental atomic unit of business is the asset. Understanding what an asset is, why it matters, and why investors paradoxically like asset-light businesses is critical to career success. This is the way I wish I was taught finance!\nI encourage you to take this course. But if you decide not to, please take another class, or read a book.\n\n\nTo know what you don’t know is power. To ask and learn what you don’t know is a superpower.\n\n\nInvesting in learning makes you better at earning.",

        "Why take this finance course? Understand the Numbers side of Business Financial Literacy Matters. Senior executives routinely share and discuss financial data with marketing directors, operations chiefs, and other direct reports. But how much do those managers really understand about finance and the numbers? A recent investigation into this question concluded most managers understand not enough to be useful. Asked to take a basic financial-literacy exam—a test that any CEO or junior finance person should easily ace—a representative sample of U.S. managers from C-level executives to supervisors scored an average of only 38%. Lack of financial literacy matters and impacts an organizations ability to optimally perform. Those who can’t speak the language of business can’t contribute much to a discussion of performance and are unlikely to advance in the hierarchy or reach their full potential. Does a lack of financial literacy matter? From a managers’ point of view, it surely does. Those who can’t speak the language of business can’t contribute much to a discussion of performance and are unlikely to advance in the hierarchy. They may get caught off guard by financial shenanigans, as many employees at Enron were. They also are unable to gauge the health of a prospective or current employer. The CFO of a small manufacturing company often asks candidates for engineering positions whether they would like to review the past two years of the company’s financials. None yet have taken him up on the offer—knowing, perhaps, that they could make neither head nor tail of the statements. People don’t tell their bosses that they don’t speak finance. It’s the usual human reluctance to admit ignorance. In a survey managers were asked what happens in meetings when people don’t understand financial data. The majority chose answers reflecting that reluctance, such as “Most people don’t ask because they don’t want to appear uninformed in front of their boss or peers.” Don’t let this be you. Take this course and understand Corporate Finance.",
