That's a huge mistake and you're leaving a lot of money on the table.\nWhat's the point of buying traffic to your site if you don't put in the effort to understand how to convert it?\nIn this landing page design course you will learn:\nHow to implement persuasion frameworks like scarcity, reciprocal concessions and cognitive dissonance theory in your landing page design\nHow to write headlines and calls to action that will motivate your users to act instead of turning them off\nHow to design an action block with a clearly defined conversion goal\nHow to triple your conversion rates by using the principles of readability, simplicity, perceived value and clarity in your landing page design\nHow to run professional usability tests on a tight budget\nHow to build a landing page from scratch on a custom domain without writing a single line of code\nThe Fogg Behavior Model and how it applies to good landing page design\nWhy understanding the AIDA sales funnel is so important in conversion rate optimization\n... and much, much more!\nFor the price of dinner out with your friends, you have the power to transform your landing page into a sales machine. I guarantee you there are significant issues with your landing page design that are causing visitors to leave when they would have converted. You're leaving money on the table.\nIf you think this stuff is complicated, it's not.\nIf you think landing page design stuff is expensive, it's not.\nIf you think conversion rate optimization is time consuming, it's not.\nIf you think watching this course won't make a different to your bottom line ... think again.\nI've consulted with hundreds of companies around the world and have redesigned websites for publicly traded companies and businesses generating over 1 Billion dollars annually. Trust me, I learned all this the hard way.\nThis is the course on landing page design I wish I had when I was first starting out!\nEnroll today and enjoy:\nLifetime access to the course and all future updates\nOver 10 hours of high quality, up to date video lectures\nExercises and feedback\nAccess to the student-only discussion forum\n30 day, no questions asked, money back guarantee\nOver 11,000 studnets enrolled\n4.8 average student rating\nThanks again for checking out my course and I look forward to seeing you in the classroom :)",

      "description": "CSS animation is an incredibly useful and powerful tool. It can add interest or creative excitement, direct the user's eye, explain something quickly and succinctly, and improve usability. For that reason, recent years have seen more and more animation on sites and in app.\nWhat is CSS animation?\nCSS animation is a method of animating certain HTML elements without having to use processor and memory-hungry JavaScript or Flash. There's no limit to the number or frequency of CSS properties that can be changed. CSS animations are initiated by specifying keyframes for the animation: these keyframes contain the styles that the element will have.\nAnimated content reveal effects seem to be quite popular right now, and used properly they can capture user focus and engage your audience. You’ve seen this before: a block of  color grows from one side or another horizontally or vertically, and then retreats to the opposing side, this time revealing some text or an image beneath. It’s a concept that might seem tricky but really relies on just a few things.\nWith CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.\nAnimations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.\nTransitions\nAs mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.\nAnimations Keyframes\nA set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.\nClip-path\nThe clip-path property in CSS allows you to specify a specific region of an element to display, rather than showing the complete area\nUsing clip-path with CSS Shapes\nThe clip-path property is a great companion to the CSS Shapes properties, particularly the shape-outside property.\nUsing shape-outside you can change the way content flows around an element because the shape applied using shape-outside changes the geometry of the element’s float area. However, the shape does not change anything else about the element, like backgrounds and borders and such. This means that any borders and background images will not adapt to the shape created on the element. So, even though the element’s float area changes, the content around the element may end up being on top of the element’s background image.\nHelp and inspiration ?\nNot only do you get a load of practical, useful starting projects in this course, you can also head over to CSS Animation.rocks for more, and even sign up to a weekly newsletter packed full of tutorials, inspiration and tips for animating on the web.\nThere’s no better time to learn Animations : You’ve made a smart choice, because CSS 3 Animations is the most popular language out there. This is no exaggeration. This popularity and growth means more jobs and opportunities than ever before.\nGet access to fast support if you get stuck : There’s nothing worse than getting stuck ten hours into a course and not getting the help you need to continue. Getting stuck is part of the learning process. That’s why I’m here to answer every single question that comes my way.\nI guarantee that this is the most up-to-date and engaging course available, and it comes with a Udemy 30-day money-back guarantee.\nI can’t wait to see you on the inside !\n- B.

      "description": "Ready to Move Your WordPress Site Without the Headache?\nMoving a standard HTML site from one web host to another used to be as simple as copying and pasting your files. Easy, right? But when it comes to WordPress, things can feel a bit more complicated.\nThat’s because WordPress isn’t just a bunch of files. It’s a script that stores your website’s content (like pages and posts) in a database. So when you move your WordPress site, you’re not just moving files – you’re also moving the database. And here’s the kicker: even after moving both, your site still won’t work until you connect the script to the database correctly.\nSound daunting? Don’t worry – I’ve got you covered.\nIn this course, I’ll walk you through the entire process, step by step. Whether you prefer a hands-on manual method or an automated way to make it all a little easier, I’ll show you both. You’ll get to look over my shoulder as I move real sites that I own. You can follow along and repeat the steps on your own site – it’s like having a personal guide by your side.\nAnd the best part? Apart from your hosting and WordPress site, everything else you need is completely free.\nHere’s what you’ll learn:\nWhy you might need to move your WordPress site (and how to know when it’s necessary).\nA simple breakdown of the steps involved, plus detailed video tutorials to guide you through the entire process.\nHow to move your WordPress files and database from one domain or host to another.\nHow to edit your WordPress configuration file to make sure the script and database communicate properly.\nHow to create redirects so your old site points visitors to your new one seamlessly.\nHow to check and make sure your move was a success.\nA few plugins that make the whole process faster and easier.\nWhether you’re upgrading your hosting, changing your domain, or just tidying things up, this course will give you the confidence to move your WordPress site without stress.\nLet’s make your site move smooth, simple, and stress-free. I’ll be right here to guide you through it.\nReady to get started? Let’s move that site!",

      "description": "The principles, practices and real-world techniques I'm going to show you here are the same ones that have informed graphic design for hundreds of years. And while that may sound like blasphemy to some of you, I guarantee you'll see why and how they apply equally to the world of digital design — especially for mobile devices and their small screens.\nI'm going to give you 50 lessons across 5 hours, packed with timeless, ironclad, unchanging rules for good UI design that you can apply to anything and everything you ever work on. You’ll learn how to create and apply hierarchy, color, contrast, typography, and gestalt principles to design appropriate visual cues for your users — and that's just for starters.\nYou'll learn how to make it easier for people to interact with what they see on the screen – whether they know what to tap, swipe or click, and whether what happens meets their expectations and moves them closer to their goals. You'll learn how to create and apply hierarchy, color, contrast, typography and gestalt principles to design appropriate visual cues so people know where and how to take action.\nI'll show you how to make good visual decisions for even the most challenging applications, from simplifying complex visual information to designing with data. My goal with this course is to give you everything you need to know to make great UI design decisions, no matter what the content, context or product may be.\nTrends will come and go, and it won't matter: your UI will still be useful, usable, appropriate and relevant for its users. From this point forward, you'll be equipped to make strategic, impactful User Interface designs that communicate, guide, encourage, motivate and educate. Anything else is decoration, and decoration has a very short shelf life.\nWhen it comes to User Interface (UI) design, your job — whether you're a designer, developer, UXer or a mix of all those things — is to make sure that no aspect of someone’s onscreen interaction happens without explicit intent. The UI design choices we make have to reflect the user’s motivations, expectations, environment and possible actions.\nAll of those things manifest themselves in the User Interface — so what people see on the screen is usually the sum of their understanding about what this is and how it works.\nSo what we show them has to do a hell of a job communicating what’s there for them, how it’s organized, how they get to it and what they can do with it once they do.\nBy the time you finish Design Rules, you'll be able to do much more than create a more beautiful User Interface. Instead, you'll be able to design a UI that truly works for the people who use it. One that it allows them to easily figure out where to start and how to get what they need — quickly, efficiently and intuitively.\nOf course, it'll also just happen to be beautiful ;-)",

Just follow along -- and you’ll be up and running in no time! It doesn’t matter if you are ‘technically challenged’, With these step-by-step, over-the-shoulder video guides, you'll be able to create your first WordPress site. We'll leave the advanced concepts for some other time: the goal of this course is not to confuse you, but to walk you through the steps of building your very first WordPress site.\nThe course gives you three options: build a WordPress site locally, on your computer, build a live website - or both!\n\nYou will learn, amongst other things, what localhosting is, how you can build your website locally without paying for hosting or domain.

I'll be your guide in every class of this video training course, and you'll be watching me 'click by click' as I build a professional WordPress site, setup my blog, and integrate it with powerful online tools. I go at a nice, slow pace and explain everything as I'm doing it, so it'll be easy for you even if you are new online.\nCheck out the description of the course modules below and read some of my client's reviews.

Evan Kopelson is indeed a master when it comes to Wordpress. I'm still half-way and I have already gained a tremendous insight into things which I have never thought about. Will update the review once I complete the course.\n-by Knowledge Decoded! Shameer Mohammed\n----- Client Review -----\nAmazing course.\nI already have installed wp on a couple of websites. I'm self taught and I had the idea that if my website loads on a browser, this was enough. Yet, I wasn't happy. Wordpress is really user friendly if you just want to post something quick online, but watching Evan starting from scratch really taught me I was doing many things the wrong way. From setting up email accounts, to how to choose a host, and get a domain with a different company so you may be able to get the best deal. Evan also goes over what are the pros and cons of all the available settings and plugins that wordpress has available. I already finished the class, but I find myself revisiting many of the lectures because the information and advice is really valuable. Evan also makes the videos entertaining, and easy to understand. I enjoyed learning a lot from this course :)\n-Erick Sandoval\n----- Client Review -----\n\"I used to find WordPress very difficult, but working with Evan I now have more confidence and knowledge. His clear explanations of why and how things are done have helped me tremendously.\"\n-Jackie Holl\n----- Client Review -----\n\"Evan is a great teacher and coach! He always gives more value than I have ever paid for. Evan consistently takes my ideas and expands them with his expertise in WordPress.

Each class runs between 3 minutes and 30 minutes. There are very few classes over 30 minutes long. A lot of the longer classes isn't harder work, it's just me explaining things carefully and going extra slowly so you won't get left behind if you're not totally comfortable with computers. It's up to you how long to take.\n----- Client Review -----\n\"Evan was extremely helpful when I needed to figure out a couple of crucial things in WordPress before launching my last product. If you need guidance on building your WordPress site, Evan is the man!!!\"\n- Paul West",

Pass yours, enroll now!\n\n\nree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nThe CloudOps Team at GlobalConnect Solutions is deploying a highly available web application in AWS, requiring an Elastic Load Balancer to route requests to multiple target groups based on the URL, ensure all traffic uses HTTPS with TLS offloaded, and preserve the user's IP for web server logs. Which solution will meet these requirements?\n\n\nA. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.\nB. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.\nC. Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.\nD. Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nThe requirements specify the need for routing requests to multiple target groups based on the URL in the request, offloading TLS processing, and preserving the user's IP address for logging.\nLet's evaluate each option:\n* A. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.\n* Application Load Balancer (ALB): Operates at Layer 7 (application layer), which is essential for URL-based routing (path-based or host-based).\n* HTTPS listener: This fulfills the requirement for all traffic to use HTTPS and for TLS processing to be offloaded to the load balancer. ALBs can terminate TLS.\n* Path-based routing rules: This directly addresses the need to route requests based on the URL. ALBs are capable of advanced routing based on URL paths, host headers, HTTP methods, and more.\n* X-Forwarded-For request header: When an ALB processes a request, it adds or appends to the `X-Forwarded-For` header to preserve the client's original IP address. This allows the web server to log the user's true IP, meeting the security logging requirement.\n* This option perfectly aligns with all specified requirements.\n* B. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.\n* While ALBs support HTTPS listeners and X-Forwarded-For, the question specifies routing based on the *URL*, which often implies the path component rather than just the domain (host). Host-based routing is typically used for different domain names. More importantly, you generally don't need an HTTPS listener *for each domain* on an ALB if using Server Name Indication (SNI), as multiple certificates can be associated with a single HTTPS listener. Path-based routing (Option A) is more precise for \"based on the URL\".\n* C. Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.\n* Network Load Balancer (NLB): Operates at Layer 4 (transport layer). NLBs *do not* support path-based or host-based routing rules, as these are Layer 7 features. This immediately makes the option unsuitable for routing based on the URL.\n* While NLBs can handle TLS listeners and preserve client IP addresses (by default), their lack of Layer 7 routing capabilities fails a critical requirement.\n* D. Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.\n* Similar to option C, this option involves a Network Load Balancer. As NLBs operate at Layer 4, they cannot perform Layer 7 routing like host-based or path-based routing. Therefore, this option fails to meet the requirement for URL-based routing.\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only solution that fully satisfies all the stated requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nThe Cloud Infrastructure Team at Nexus Innovations is designing a new service requiring end-to-end encryption with mutual TLS between the client and backend, which must not be decrypted by any intermediate components, using gRPC over TCP port 443, hosted on an Amazon EKS cluster configured with Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to handle thousands of simultaneous connections. Which solution will meet these requirements?\n\n\nA. Install the AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes. Using that controller, configure a Network Load Balancer with a TCP listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the IP addresses of the backend service Pods.\nB. Install the AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes. Using that controller, configure an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the IP addresses of the backend service Pods.\nC. Create a target group. Add the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group as a target Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the target group.\nD. Create a target group. Add the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group as a target. Create a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the target group.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nThe core requirement is that \"The traffic must not be decrypted between the client and the backend of the service,\" and that \"mutual TLS for two-way authentication\" is required. This explicitly mandates TLS passthrough, meaning the load balancer should not terminate the TLS connection.\nLet's analyze the options:\n* A. Install the AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes. Using that controller, configure a Network Load Balancer with a TCP listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the IP addresses of the backend service Pods.\n* Network Load Balancer (NLB) with a TCP listener: An NLB operating with a TCP listener at Layer 4 simply forwards TCP packets without inspecting or decrypting the payload. This enables true TLS passthrough, where the entire TLS handshake (including mutual TLS) occurs directly between the client and the backend Pod. This satisfies the \"no decryption between client and backend\" and \"mutual TLS\" requirements.\n* AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes: This is the recommended way to integrate AWS Load Balancers with Amazon EKS. It allows the NLB to automatically discover and target the IP addresses of Kubernetes Pods, ensuring dynamic scaling with the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. This meets the scalability and EKS integration requirements.\n* gRPC over TCP port 443: Since NLB passes through raw TCP traffic, it is compatible with gRPC over TCP.\n* B. Install the AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes. Using that controller, configure an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the IP addresses of the backend service Pods.\n* Application Load Balancer (ALB) with an HTTPS listener: An ALB operates at Layer 7 and performs TLS termination by default when configured with an HTTPS listener. This means the ALB decrypts the traffic before forwarding it to the backend. This directly violates the requirement that \"The traffic must not be decrypted between the client and the backend.\" While ALB can support mTLS, it does so by terminating mTLS at the ALB, not passing it through end-to-end to the backend.\n* C. Create a target group. Add the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group as a target. Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the target group.\n* Application Load Balancer (ALB) with an HTTPS listener: As explained for Option B, an ALB performs TLS termination, violating the \"no decryption\" requirement.\n* Targeting the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group: This method targets the EC2 instances (nodes) themselves rather than the specific Kubernetes Pods. While possible, it's less direct and efficient for EKS deployments, especially when using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale individual pods. The AWS Load Balancer Controller dynamically targeting pod IPs is the preferred method for EKS.\n* D. Create a target group. Add the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group as a target. Create a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener on port 443 to forward traffic to the target group.\n* Network Load Balancer (NLB) with a TLS listener: While NLB can have a TLS listener, an NLB TLS listener *terminates* TLS at the NLB. This is different from a TCP listener, which provides passthrough. Since TLS is terminated at the NLB, it violates the \"no decryption between client and backend\" requirement. For true TLS passthrough, a TCP listener is required.\n* Targeting the EKS managed node group's Auto Scaling group: Similar to Option C, this is not the most optimal way to integrate with dynamic EKS Pod scaling.\nTherefore, Option A is the only solution that satisfies all the specified requirements, particularly the critical need for end-to-end encryption and mutual TLS without decryption at the load balancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nThe SmartConnect Team at VendingVista Corp manages a global vending machine inventory application in us-east-1, running on an Amazon ECS cluster with an Application Load Balancer, which must be accessed only through AWS Global Accelerator, not directly over the internet. Which solution will meet these requirements?\n\n\nA. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Attach an internet gateway without adding routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port.\nB. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port.\nC. Configure the ALB in a public subnet of the VPAttach an internet gateway. Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the accelerator's IP addresses on the ALB listener port.\nD. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Attach an internet gateway. Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the accelerator's IP addresses on the ALB listener port.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nThe question requires the application to be accessible *only* through AWS Global Accelerator and *not* through a direct connection over the internet to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) endpoint. This implies that the ALB should not have a public IP address or be directly routable from the internet.\nLet's analyze each option:\n* A. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Attach an internet gateway without adding routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port.\n* ALB in a private subnet: This is crucial. Placing the ALB in a private subnet ensures it does not have a public IP address and cannot be directly accessed from the internet. This meets the requirement of preventing direct internet access.\n* Attach an internet gateway without adding routes in the subnet route tables: This is the correct pattern for using AWS Global Accelerator with an internal (private) endpoint. The VPC needs an Internet Gateway (IGW) attached to signify its capability to handle internet traffic. However, *the specific subnet's route table should NOT have a route to the IGW*. This keeps the subnet private, ensuring the ALB is not directly routable from the internet. Global Accelerator uses the AWS backbone to deliver traffic to the internal ALB, bypassing the need for a direct public route for the ALB itself.\n* Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint: This is a standard and necessary step to integrate the ALB with Global Accelerator.\n* Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port: While seemingly broad, for an ALB in a private subnet with no direct internet routing, the *only* way \"inbound traffic from the internet\" can reach it is through a service like Global Accelerator. If Global Accelerator is configured to preserve client IP addresses, the traffic will appear to originate from the client's public IPs, which are \"from the internet\". Therefore, this security group configuration, combined with the private subnet setup, ensures that legitimate traffic delivered by Global Accelerator can reach the ALB, while direct public access is prevented by the network configuration.\n* B. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the internet on the ALB listener port.\n* This option is missing the critical step of attaching an Internet Gateway to the VPC. Even for an internal ALB endpoint, the VPC must have an IGW attached for Global Accelerator to be able to route traffic to it. Without an IGW, the VPC is isolated from the internet.\n* C. Configure the ALB in a public subnet of the VPAttach an internet gateway. Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the accelerator's IP addresses on the ALB listener port.\n* ALB in a public subnet with routes to IGW: This directly violates the requirement that the application must *not* be accessible through a direct connection over the internet to the ALB endpoint. If the ALB is in a public subnet, it can be directly accessed from the internet, even if its security group tries to restrict access.\n* D. Configure the ALB in a private subnet of the VPC. Attach an internet gateway. Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway. Configure the accelerator with endpoint groups that include the ALB endpoint. Configure the ALB's security group to only allow inbound traffic from the accelerator's IP addresses on the ALB listener port.\n* Add routes in the subnet route tables to point to the internet gateway: This step converts the \"private subnet\" into a public subnet by providing it with a route to the Internet Gateway. This means the ALB could then be directly accessible from the internet, which violates the core requirement of preventing direct internet access to the ALB endpoint. While the security group rule restricting to \"accelerator's IP addresses\" is a good security practice, the underlying network configuration negates the primary security goal.\nConclusion:\nOption A correctly implements the recommended AWS architecture for using Global Accelerator with an internal (private) Application Load Balancer to ensure that the application is accessible *only* via Global Accelerator, preventing direct internet access to the ALB itself. The key elements are the ALB in a private subnet, the VPC having an IGW attached, and critically, the subnet's route table *not* having a direct route to the IGW. This setup forces all internet-originated traffic through Global Accelerator.\n\n\nWhy Choose Our Certification Exam Prep Courses?\nWhen it comes to passing your certification exam—whether it’s AWS, Microsoft, or Oracle—quality training makes all the difference.

This course will allow you to develop your web design and development skills, and you can add web developer to your CV and start getting clients for your skills.\n\n\nHi everyone. I'm Arash, and I'm a UI/UX designer and a web developer. In the past few years, I helped over 50,000 designers worldwide to build their own UI/UX design business from the ground up. In this course, I will help you learn and master Webflow comprehensively from scratch.\n\n\nWebflow is an innovative and brilliant tool for web designers. It allows you to build custom websites visually. Don't get me wrong; it's not a website builder like Wix or Squarespace that comes with extensive limitations. On the contrary, it allows you to build modern and responsive websites without any limitations visually. It's used by everyone from entrepreneurs and start-ups to Dell, Zendesk, etc.\n\n\nMany designers think that web development is hard, boring, and complex, but I will teach you how to develop amazing websites in a simple, fun, and engaging way.\n\n\nThis is not another development course where you learn HTML & CSS. Instead, you will learn how to convert any design to a fully responsive website with complex animations and interaction without code.\n\n\nIn the first part of the course, I will teach you the basics of web development, and we will go through all the features of Webflow in the Webflow Academy section. In the second part of the course, you will put everything you learned into practice by building a complete website for a design agency from scratch. Next, we will dive into advanced topics like responsivity, animations, and interactions. Last but not least, you will learn how to optimize a website for search engines (SEO).\n\n\nIn the last part of the course, we will talk about the business side of the web design industry. You will learn how to get your very first client, how to price your work, how to prepare amazing proposals, and so much more. Eventually, you will learn how to become a world-class freelance web developer and how to run your own web development business.\n\n\nWith over 11 hours of content across 80+ lectures, I will take you from beginner to expert, and teach you everything you need to know in order to use Webflow in a professional manner.\n\n\nAn amazing course for people with zero web development experience or for experienced UI/UX designers who want to learn and master Webflow and become no-code web developers. By the end of this course, you’ll have a complete, real-world project for your own portfolio, and every student will have the knowledge and confidence to apply for a web developer job.\n\n\nDon't just take my word for it, see what my past students had to say about my design courses:\n\"I loved this course. Highly recommended if you want to build real-world designs. loved Arash's style of teaching.\" - Mustafa Alabdullah\n\"This course is AMAZING! I really like the content especially the projects.

A Step By Step Blogging Video Course & Professional Blog Design.\nThe Ultimate Online Blogging Course for beginners.\nMitch here, and first things first… I wanted to thank you for checking out:\n- NEW MASSIVE BONUS - Buy 1, Get 1 Free ($98 Value in Total)\nI have decided that I wanted to provide massive value to your design career. So buy this course and get access to \"Easily Learn Web Development with Drop & Drag - OptimizePress\" course. Enjoy!\nBottom Up Blogging\nThis blog and web development product has turned into quite the beast… …I'm extremely proud of what it's become and the impact it's having on so many people's lives… Anyway, let me ask you a question: Is Your Life Where You Imagined It Would Be?\n\nDo you have the career you dream of?\nAre you making enough money to do the things you love more often?\nWould making a few thousand extra dollars on the side each month change your life?\nDo you have the freedom and passive income you would like? Or are you chained to the desk for the next 20 years?\nBEEN THERE!! I've talked the talk And walked the walk\n\nThe number one reason I've been able to get such explosive results quite recently is from “years\" of trial and error blogging. As well as investing tens of thousands of dollars into many businesses, blogs and personal development!\nI love living each day to the extreme. Pushing boundaries and getting out of my comfort zone……….\nThat Is Where The Real Magic Happens……. But life hasn't always been like this for me…….\n\nThere were times when I felt lost……\nStuck in my comfort zone.\nChained to a 9-5……..wondering if there was any light at the end of the tunnel.\nNot making the money I knew I was worth.

I've spent time and money making my own mistakes until I came across this course. The ideas that Mitch presents helps me cut short my learning curve and also cut out most of the uncertainties that I face. The course also gives me practical and applicable action steps which I can follow easily.\nA great course and a steal at its current price. Thanks Mitch!\"\nby John Mitchell, a day ago\n\"Keeps getting better\nI am 50% of the way through the course already and it just keeps getting better and better. There are so many things I would not have known if someone didn't tell me about it. I think this has saved me a lot of time and well worth the investment\"\nby Jake Gerter, 9 days ago\n\"Amazing Ideas\nWow, what an awesome idea. I love the fact I don't have to be an expert but instead I can get experts to provide my content. I never though of that before. I am definitely going to pursue this angle further. The instructor Mitch had a nice voice to listen to, it wasn't boring like many of the others I have taken. I would recommend this program to anyone wanting to start a blog. I also liked the live demonstrations of setting up a blog because I have no experince with that so it helped a lot to follow step by step.\"\nIf you've read this far you KNOW there's something VERY beneficial here for you.\nIf you want to start your own personal blog just to begin writing a message to yourself or to the world\nIf you want to create an online personal branding business and make 6 or 7 figures per year blogging\nIf you want to start a lifestyle blogging business designed to make you money from anywhere in the world while you travel\nIf you want to create your own online blog and create your own products to bring your message out into the world and package it up at a high price to make you money\nIf you want to be an Author, Speaker, Coach, Consultant or Industry Expert\nIf you have read this far then It's highly likely this cutting edge blogging information is just what you need to give you an unfair advantage over everyone else…\nThis blogging coaching is designed to get the ball rolling for you, do the heavy lifting, give you the inspiration you need to take the first few steps which are always the hardest.

Take Action Now And Click \"Take This Course\"! - see you on the inside.\nFrequently Asked Questions & Answers\nHow quickly will I reach my first 1,000 subscribers blogging? This is completely dependent upon you. You could reach 1000 in a week, or you may never reach that number of subscribers. It comes down to your ability to put the effort in, as well as the methods you employ to generate subscribers. Just know that something magical happens when you reach that number, so do whatever you can to push through and get them!\nHow much will it cost to set up & launch my blog? You can get your blog online and launched for the cost of a domain name (around $10) and web hosting (as little as $5 per month)! I recommend paid themes in the training, but none of them are more than $50, and there are lots of free options available as well. Any other costs associated will depend on the methods you use to promote and grow your blog. There are also free ways to do every step (which I will cover in the training) if you choose to bootstrap your growth.\nHow much money can I make with my blog? Unfortunately there is no way I can answer that realistically. Every person is different, has different skills and work ethic, etc, so it's impossible to answer. How much you make will be completely up to you and your skills and effort.\nHow long do I have access to the blogging course? The course is available online with unlimited access 24/7.\nCan't I just figure blogging out on my own? Probably…but why would you want to? Wouldn't you rather just take a short-cut and learn what has already been proven to work? Look, I've made every mistake you can make so that you don't have to. But hey, if you want to spend your valuable time and hard-earned money trying to figure this out on your own, you certainly can.\nIs there a guarantee? Udemy have a 30 Day, 100% Money-Back Guarantee. So, YES, your purchase is 100% guaranteed. If you're not happy with Bottom Up Blogging for any reason, we'll happily refund every penny. No hard feelings.",

It allows you to create a Wordpress website from scratch, and to personalize pages of an existing Wordpress site. Divi is both a page builder and a theme.\nThe page builder allows you to edit any page from a Wordpress theme. It is thus possible to create original pages, with a freedom that you will not have just by using Wordpress. Everything is done by click and drop, which means that you do not need to know how to code, you edit your pages easily as in Wordpress but using the power of Divi to create your pages.\nThe Divi theme allows you to create a website from scratch. You have total freedom. It is possible to use the theme builder to create a header, main sections and a footer, and to choose which pages to apply them. By taking the Divi license, you will have access to all of these features.\nWhy use Divi\n- You can customize your pages on your Wordpress site\n- You can use the power of the Divi theme\n- You can create a website without coding\nTraining video\nIn this training I will show you how to use Divi. You will see how to install Divi, both the theme and the page builder. You will then see how to use the different modules, which will allow you to build pages, both for a Wordpress theme and for a Divi theme. You will see the theme builder to create a Wordpress site from scratch. Finally I will show you an example of a simple website using the Divi theme.",

Other online courses are focused on coding tutorials, and although that can be great for users who want to be able to make something from scratch, it is impractical for others, especially entrepreneurs.\nIf you're still a little unsure about what exactly this course is, perhaps a little car analogy will help. We teach you how all the components of a car make it run, but we won't teach you what type of wrench you'll have to use to loosen a bolt.

      "description": "How to Build a Form?\nThis is the exact question we get asked almost daily by our WordPress website clients. Our answer has always been “…get the Gravity Forms plugin.”\nWhy?\nBefore the Gravity Forms plugin existed we used a variety of freely available plugins for WordPress that allowed us to build web forms but we quickly reverted to creating our own custom web forms as soon as something more robust than a simple “Contact Us” form was needed.\nThen Gravity Forms was Released by Rocketgenius.\nWhen we first became aware of Gravity Forms back in 2010, our first thought was “why do we need to buy a plugin to build website forms when we already have free ones available, and if needed, we could simply code our own?”\nBut that thought quickly faded as we took a closer look at the features and capabilities of the Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress. Not only does it provide a simple interface for building web forms, but it also provides incredible tools for creating very advanced web forms, all with a simple point and click interface.\nWhy We Created This How to Build a Form Video Tutorial Course.\nSince purchasing the developer license of the Gravity Forms plugin and using it on our sites and those of our clients, we have have been nothing but impressed with both the ease of use and also the support that the folks at Rocketgenius provide. Not only that, but they are continually developing this plugin and adding new features requested by customers.\nHowever, although there is a lot of written documentation provided to purchasers of this plugin, we are visual learners and do much better when seeing something in action rather than reading through a “how to build a form” series of web pages.\nIt wasn’t just us. Because we own the developer license and we use this on many clients sites, there were numerous times when site owners wanted to use the plugin to create an additional web form for their business and didn’t know how to use Gravity Forms. It was then that we started including “how to build a web form” videos for our clients, and it turned out that they were visual learners too. Seeing it in action allowed them to “just get it”.\nMaybe you’re a developer or site owner with the same set of problems? Then this course is for you.",
      "target_audience": [
        "Our teaching style is direct and streamlined, with no fluff. Not only will you learn about all of the features included in the Gravity Forms plugin on our video training course, but you’ll see us creating advanced forms right in front of your eyes."

Less edits and faster payments\nThis immersive experience helps clients better understand the flow and usability of the design without further questions.

Speed up the process of animation projects\nEverything becomes easy once you understand how it works. By the end of this course, you'll be able to understand the principles of animation and use them to make your designs pop.\n\n\nRecommended but not necessary to use paid programs and applications to take the course.\nYou can use the free Figma Starter Plan, and for the rest of the tasks, I will show you 100% free alternatives.\n\n\nDoes the course show how to implement all types of animation on a real website?\nNo, the course only shows the process of creating animation in Figma. No code or programming. Animation in Figma is created for presenting a project to the client (to increase the percentage of project approval) and social networks. Animations of varying complexity are shown and further development depends on many factors. Some animations can be implemented on the site by creating a GIF or video, for some elements you need a senior javascript developer, parallax we can create in website builders like Framer or Webflow etc.",

In this course I am gonna walk you through every single step of creating a complete website.\n\nDreamweaver CC is an application provided by Adobe and is used by professional to create and edit websites.\nAs I said from scratch! So we will start from a blank page. Then we'll add some text in the page and will learn how to customize the text. After working with text, we will create and stylize links. Then After positioning our content we'll learn the basics of HTML5 and CSS. And then we'll use the power of CSS to stylize our page. And working on CSS is much easier in Adobe Dreamweaver CC because Dreamweaver gives you the full control on CSS with the new advanced layout of CSS designer panel. Then we'll learn how to use web fonts to stylize text. And then we'll learn the important part of a website designing and that is its responsiveness means the webpage should be flexible across different screen sizes. And then we'll create the mobile version of our website means our website will have different layout on mobile devices.\nThen we'll learn how to create stylish menu bar and other pages for our website as our website is gonna contain four web pages. Then I'll show you how we can insert a widget in our website by inserting an awesome gallery widget. A website can't be complete without social media plug-ins, so we'll learn how to add twitter or Facebook widget and a YouTube video in our website. Then we'll create and stylize a form with which your visitors will be able to contact you. And finally we'll upload our website to get this online and to access this from anywhere in the world. We'll be discussing all these topics and much more in this course.\nThe course has been created in 720p High Definition video and extra zooming and panning has been applied in the videos so that you can easily watch this course on your tablets and mobile devices.\nSo this course is a great place to start if you are looking to make your first website or to familiarize with the latest version of Dreamweaver.\nIf you are interested in designing a website and don't know how and from where to start, then this course is for you. I'm really excited to get started on this course with you and hope you are too, so let's get started..",

I’ve led training sessions for Fortune 500 companies and I’ve already helped over 140,000 people on Udemy and received the following feedback:\n\"Brad definitely has some of the best techniques to embed the lesson into your mind… hands down these are the best tutorials I have had the opportunity to view.\"\n\"Presentation is concise without being tedious… you honestly feel that you have a thorough understanding of the subject.\"\n\"…[Brad] explained the process.

      "description": "Hello Learners,\nI am really Happy to announce that I have found a tool that will enable you to create a website without coding, without hustling and without losing your mind. This tool will give you a power like a website developer God. Do you think I am kidding? Obviously not, because you can change every small thing with that tool in your website, if this tool were not there, then 1000 lines of codes would be required or may be 10,000 lines who knows...\n\n\nThe Story\nBefore a couple of years I found Elementor, that day was kind of good. it was sunshine. Earlier, before Elementor, I used other website builder, but the problem with that was, a lot of editing or changes was done on back-end so things were quite hard especially for those who didn't know anything about creating a website. Then Elementor came and it was game changing...\n\n\nWhy Elementor?\n1- Elementor enables you to work on the front end. Any changes that you make on your website you can see all happening live. You don't have to change pages or click here & there just to see what changes you have made.\n2- Elementor gives you a lot of flexibility. You know in Elementor everything is customizable like for example you have to add one button, then you can customize its text color, outer color and hover color (mean when someone put their cursor on a button then the color will change).\n3- Elementor is FREE. Elementor is a free website builder and there are 27 free elements in it and we get lot of premade pages and blocks as well.\n\n\nAbout this course?\n1- I have few highest rated courses and thousand of students. Well, I am not bragging and I don't need to tell you this data, but you know what, these are some stats that proves my courses are good and people are getting results from them. Again, I am not bragging :-D\n2- I made this elementor course very easy where you will learn a ton of stuff and yes in an easy and precise manner.\n3- This Elementor course is Procrastination proof. We all are procrastinator in something so even if you start this course from middle or you think you know this topic then you can easily jump on the next topic and then also you will be able to understand each and everything. All the lessons are topic in themselves.\n4- This course can be your savior guide. We all need help when we start something new, suppose for example, you want to use image carousel in Elementor and you don't know how to use it, then what you can do at that time just login to udemy and open this course and then watch the video of image carousel and you will easily understand how to use image carousel. And if you find any difficulty then feel free to ask me.\nSo have a great day, see you there in the course.",

Today, it's the world's most popular website building tool, used by millions. WordPress is a powerful, flexible platform favored by beginners and experienced web designers. A new WordPress install isn't too attractive or usable, so there's work to do. Users can choose from thousands of free and premium themes. These templates transform the look and feel of an entire site with only a few mouse clicks. If there's a particular feature needed, there's likely a plugin or widget for it. Plugins and widgets are small programs used to enhance the user experience. Some examples are contact forms, SEO optimizers, social media share buttons, and more. WordPress websites are easy to maintain after the initial setup. Webmasters can then focus on creating good quality content and attracting visitors.\nWhat is WordPress used for?\nWordPress is an online software that offers tools to build impressive blogs and websites. Its creators, Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg, released the first version in 2003. Back then, it was a free blogging tool. WordPress has since grown into a powerful site-building platform used by millions. Today, WordPress powers over 35% of all active sites on the internet. This includes sites from well-known companies like Sony Music, Microsoft News, TechCrunch, Disney, and more. What gives WordPress its edge is the platform's flexibility. You can create a blog, a business site, an e-commerce store, or an interactive forum. Best of all, self-hosted WordPress is free and open-source. Developers from all over the world can create exciting themes, plugins, and widgets. If you can dream it, then you can build it with WordPress.\nWhat is the best way to learn WordPress?\nMany first-time WordPress users find the learning curve steep and the experience frustrating. But it doesn't need to be this way. A well-structured online course taught by a knowledgeable instructor is the solution. Online courses let beginners get familiar with the WordPress platform and learn the basics of web design and site structure. Students can take full control of their learning experience at a pace that suits them. The instructor is available through online forums to answer any questions that come up along the way.\nIs WordPress for free?\nThere are two versions of WordPress. One is a service on wordpress com that offers a 100% free website, though there are strict limitations on what you can do with that site. When most people talk about WordPress, they are referring to a different, self-hosted version, where you download WordPress and install it yourself on a web host. This version of WordPress does not have any limitations but does have two required costs. You'll need a domain name (~ $12 per year) which gives your website a permanent address online. You'll also need web hosting which is essentially a computer where you can build your site. A reliable web hosting provider ensures the website is up and visible 24/7. Web hosting starts at around $36 per year. If you just want to learn how to use WordPress, without the expense of a domain and hosting, you can learn how to install WordPress on your own computer. It's a zero-cost solution for those who want to try the platform before they commit.\nCan I use WordPress without coding?\nYes, it’s easy to use WordPress without any knowledge of coding or computer programming. The design goal for WordPress is to be user-friendly to people at all skill levels. The user interface is simple and welcoming to beginners. Users can do most of their editing at the touch of a button, while WordPress handles the coding on the back end. WordPress offers many templates that make it easy to create a new website without designing everything from scratch. Website creators can easily add features with plugins, widgets, and templates. For any tasks that do require lines of code, WordPress offers a wealth of helpful guides online. These provide simple instructions for adding code to a WordPress site, with no need for programming knowledge. Users who do know how to code can also access the advanced tools for web designers and developers.\nWhat are some alternatives to WordPress?\nWhile WordPress is one of the most popular self-hosting platforms, it’s not the only accessible option for people who want to start a blog or website. Platforms such as Wix, Squarespace, Blogger, Medium, and Tumblr have emerged as alternatives to WordPress. Wix and Squarespace are both designed with entrepreneurs and startups in mind. These platforms include templates, customization options, user-friendly editing tools, and online payment features. Wix offers free and premium plans, while Squarespace only offers paid plan tiers. Google's tool Blogger is free and easy to learn, making it popular for hobbyist bloggers. Although it may not provide the customization options that professionals are seeking. Medium and Tumblr are blog hosting tools that also act as social media platforms. They are both popular for writers and creators to connect and network.\nWhy is WordPress so popular?\nWordPress is a leading choice for hosting blogs and websites due to the platform's ease of use and low barrier to entry. Its user-friendly features make it easy for people to create websites without any coding or web design skills. The platform is highly customizable and well-optimized for search engines. Because WordPress existed in the early days of internet blogging, it gained a reputation as a leader in website hosting. It grew into one of the most well-known platforms for anyone who wants to create their own website. There is now a global community of users who support each other and develop resources for WordPress. There are thousands of plugins and themes available for customizing a WordPress site.

      "description": "Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.\nA web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.\nTwo of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are responsive and adaptive design. In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size; in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes that match common screen sizes. Preserving a layout that is as consistent as possible between devices is crucial to maintaining user trust and engagement. As responsive design can present difficulties in this regard, designers must be careful in relinquishing control of how their work will appear. If they are responsible for the content as well, while they may need to broaden their skillset, they will enjoy having the advantage of full control of the finished product.",

      "description": "Dear Business Owners,\nA recent study by Sucuri revealed that around 90% of all hacked content management systems they investigated in 2018 were WordPress sites.\nIf your business relies on its website for marketing, operations, or any critical activity, protecting that asset is non-negotiable. The reality is, just like physical businesses can face break-ins, online businesses are also vulnerable to intrusions — except in many cases, you won’t even know your site has been compromised until months or even years later.\nThis is why proactive security is essential.\nIt’s important to note that WordPress sites typically don’t get hacked because of the original WordPress core code. The problem usually comes from vulnerabilities in third-party plugins or themes — often called “backdoors.”\nSo, what exactly are backdoors, and how can you protect your website if you’re not tech-savvy? The good news is that there are quick, effective, and beginner-friendly ways to secure your WordPress site.\nIntroducing:\nHow to Secure Your WordPress Site — Even If You’re Not a Security Expert\nThis course was created to give you the tools and strategies you need to protect your valuable website.\nHere’s what you’ll discover inside:\nIntroduction to WordPress Security\nGet an overview of WordPress, the common risks, and how this course is structured to guide you step by step.\nBackdoors Explained\nLearn what backdoors are, how hackers use them, and how to block these vulnerabilities before they cause damage.\nSecure WordPress Hosting\nYour hosting company plays a huge role in your website’s security. Discover what to look for in a secure host and which providers excel at keeping sites safe.\nProtecting the Admin Area\nThe WordPress login page is one of the most common entry points for hackers. Learn how brute force attacks work and the steps you can take to secure your wp-admin access.\nSecurity Plugins That Work\nWith hundreds of plugins available, we’ll show you which ones provide real protection against different types of attacks.\nTwo-Step Authentication\nAdd an extra layer of protection by enabling two-step login verification. We’ll walk you through the setup process.\nFile Protection\nUnderstand the concept of “hotlinking” and how to stop others from using your images and media in ways that cost you money and bandwidth.\nStrong Password Practices\nWeak passwords are still one of the biggest vulnerabilities online. Learn how to create strong, secure passwords and use tools to manage them effectively.\nThis course is designed to give you peace of mind, knowing that your website is safe and your business is protected.\nUdemy offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there’s no risk in getting started today.\nTake action now.

With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, organizations must adopt robust security measures to protect their cloud infrastructure, applications, and data. AWS offers a comprehensive security framework, including identity and access management, encryption, threat detection, and compliance tools. The integration of generative AI in cloud security on AWS enhances threat detection, automates response mechanisms, and strengthens overall security posture.\nAWS provides multiple security services, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Key Management Service (KMS), and Amazon GuardDuty, which help monitor, detect, and mitigate security risks. However, traditional security methods may struggle with the growing complexity of cloud environments. This is where generative AI comes into play, offering advanced capabilities such as anomaly detection, automated incident response, and predictive threat analysis. One of the key applications of generative AI in AWS security is in threat intelligence and automated remediation. AI-driven models can simulate potential attack vectors, predict vulnerabilities, and suggest proactive measures to mitigate risks.\nThe combination of AWS security features and generative AI creates a powerful defense mechanism against evolving cyber threats. By leveraging AI for threat detection, automated response, and predictive analysis, businesses can enhance their cloud security, reduce risks, and ensure the integrity of their data and applications on AWS.",

      "description": "Hi everyone. I'm Sofiullah and I'm a full-stack web developer. I started this career as a front end web developer.\nIn the beginning, I was not so good with the user interface designing. Do you know that most of the front and back end web developers are terrible in the case of designing skills? But without a great UI design, there is no chance of getting any user satisfaction at all. For those reasons, developers are dependent on UI UX designers. They use complex tools like adobe photoshop to create UI designs.\nAt that time, I don't have enough money to hire a designer or to buy a website design template. So, I tried to create the HTML template based on my own design and to sell it. I used to create an imaginary design in my mind or do a basic sketch or mockup on a piece of paper. Then I would just jump into the coding process. But that was very tough. If I don't like a style I have to change the code to change the style. And I had to keep changing the codes until the style feels good.\nBut that was a terrible way of doing things. It was very time-consuming and not productive at all. Because as you already know...coding takes a lot of time. Then I decided to create the basic design first then to code this.\nAlthough, most of the graphics designers use adobe photoshop to create a PSD website template. But the problem with photoshop is...it is a bit costly and not easy to learn. I don't need to learn all the complex functionality of photoshop to create a basic template of a website. That's why I have chosen figma...its totally free and extremely easy to work with. You can create your own UI design also by using simpler tools like Figma. Figma is an innovative and brilliant tool for User Interface design. It's used by everyone from entrepreneurs and start-ups to Apple, Airbnb, Facebook, etc.\nSo, that's what this course is about. In this course, we will create a mockup using Figma. We will use almost all of the functionality of the Figma UI to create this template. We will learn by creating real-world template design. No boring stuff needed to learn anything, right?\nAfter creating the UI design by Figma, we will move on to the front end part. We will convert the template in a static bootstrap template. In this course we will design a template from scratch by using Figma and than we will convert it into a bootstrap template. If you are stuck with designing or just starting out your web design career then this course is a great start for you. I have tried to share all the experiences I have gathered on my journey as a web developer and tried to explain everything very simply for your better understanding.\nSo, I think u will be very much benefited from the course. And if you don't like this course after enrolling in....no problem...you can get your money back within 30 days. Udemy guarantees you that.\nSo guys....see you in the course. Take care!",

      "description": "Cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations manage and utilize IT resources, offering a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to traditional on-premises infrastructures.  Cloud computing involves the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet, or \"the cloud.\" This model enables businesses to access and pay for these resources on a need basis, without the upfront costs and complexities of owning and maintaining physical infrastructure.\nOne of the fundamental concepts of cloud computing is its service models, which include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, allowing organizations to rent virtual machines, storage, and networks. This model offers maximum control and flexibility but requires users to manage the operating systems, applications, and data. Cloud computing also encompasses various deployment models: public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud. Public clouds are operated by third-party service providers and offer resources over the internet to multiple customers, promoting cost savings through shared infrastructure.\nCloud computing also presents challenges, such as security and compliance concerns, potential downtime, and dependency on internet connectivity. Ensuring data privacy and meeting regulatory requirements require robust security measures and compliance frameworks. Despite these challenges, the benefits of cloud computing make it an essential component of modern IT strategy, driving innovation, agility, and competitive advantage.",

      "description": "UPDATE: The latest update to this class was made in June 2025. I keep all tutorial videos up-to-date to the latest versions of Figma and Webflow. If you notice any discrepancies just post in the Q&A and I'll get the update shipped right away.\nWeb design is fun. It's creative.\nIt gives you huge self-satisfaction when you look at your work and say, \"I made this.\". I love that feeling after finishing something. When I lean back in my chair, look at the final result with a smile, and have this little spark joy moment.\nIt's especially satisfying when I know I just made $5,000.\nWouldn't you want to have that?\nWouldn't you want to be your own boss?\nWorking 2-3 hours a day and earning more than people working full-time?\nWaking up whenever you want?\nWorking from home? Or Starbucks? Or the bathtub—if that’s your thing. Or maybe somewhere awesome, like Bali?\nI do! That's why I got into this field. Not initially for the love of web design, though I do love it now. I got in for the lifestyle.\nThere are many ways one can achieve this lifestyle. This is my way—this is how I reached the life I dreamed about for years. And I’m going to teach you to do the same.\nOften people think web design is complicated, that it needs creative talent or knack for computers. Sure, a lot of people make it complicated. People make the simplest things complicated—just like most subjects taught in universities.\nBut I don't like complicated. I like easy. I like life hacks. I like taking the shortest, simplest route to my goal. I didn’t go to art school or get a computer science degree. I’m an outsider who hacked my way into this field, and somehow, I ended up as a sought-after professional.\nThat’s how I’m going to teach you web design—so you’re not discouraged by needless complexity. So you enjoy the process because it's simple and fun. So you can become a freelance web designer in no time.\nFor example, this is a design course, but I don't teach Photoshop. Why? Because Photoshop is needlessly complicated for web design, yet people still teach it to web designers. I don't. I teach Figma—a simple tool that is taking over the design world. You will be designing a complete website within a week, while others are still learning basic layouts in Photoshop.\nSecond, this is a development course, but I don’t teach you how to code. Coding for web design is needlessly complicated and takes too long to learn. Instead, I teach Webflow, a tool revolutionizing web design. You’ll be building complex websites within two weeks while others are still learning HTML and CSS basics.\nThird, this is a freelancing course. But I don’t just teach you how to write great proposals—I give you a winning proposal template. By the end of the course, you’ll have a stunning portfolio website, complete with portfolio pieces.\nEnroll now and start whenever the time is right for you. I keep the course up to date, review every assignment, and answer every question in the Q&A.",

      "description": "Web design as a life-skill\nIn today’s world, the ability to build and manage your own website is a life-skill that can revolutionise your business if you have one, or open up amazing doors of opportunity, enabling you to share your passion with the world. It is a skill that I learned when I wanted to launch my first business, and it proved to be the key to my business success, giving me a huge advantage over my local competitors.\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is for you if you own a mac computer and want to build a website using Rapidweaver. Rapidweaver is the best web design software for Mac. It makes web design easy and accessible for the amateur. Importantly, you don’t have to learn to code. I will show you how to build a website with the drag-and-drop simplicity of 'stacks'. This course is aimed primarily at those who want to build and manage websites for their own use. That includes:\nBusiness owners who want to attract more customers\nSelf-employed workers like Plumbers, Electricians, Artists, Authors, or Entrepreneurs\nAnyone with a hobby or passion they want to share with the world.\nOr it might be that you’re an employee of a small business and your boss has asked you to make a website.\nAs I said at the beginning, in today’s world, being able to build a website is an important life-skill. The applications of it are limitless.\nWhat you will be able to do at the end of it?\nThis is a beginners course that requires no previous web building experience. At the end of this course:\nYou will be able to build and publish a simple website\nYou will understand important considerations in choosing a domain or web address for your business\nYou will understand key elements that make a website convert visitors into customers\nYou will know how to find whatever addons you require to meet your particular website needs\nYou will be able to spend your website budget wisely, identifying the addons you need without wasting money on ones you'll never actually use\nYou will know where to find tutorials on advanced Rapidweaver topics in order to take your skills to the next level, including integration of eCommerce solutions, Content Management Systems (CMS), and Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).\nShould you wish to start a new career building websites as a business, this course could be the start that you need.\nHow is the course structured?\nThere are 8 sections to this course:\nIntroduction\nStart building using Rapidweaver's built-in page types\nIn this section you'll gain an overview of Rapidweaver's interface and tools, and learn how to add several built-in page-types. These pages will be replaced in a later section after adding the Stacks plugin, so web building will only be taken to a very basic level in this section.\nChoose a Web Hosting company\nI'll guide you through a list of top recommended companies.\nChoose your own Internet Domain\nI'll guide you through various important considerations to help you choose the right address for your website.\nManage your hosting and domain, and publish your website\nYou may choose a different hosting company to me, but I'll give you a brief tour of the control panel for my web hosting and demonstrate how to obtain your publishing details and input them into Rapidweaver's publishing settings.\nEnhance Rapidweaver using Addons\nThe reason Rapidweaver is such a powerful web building solution is that it provides a platform for third-party developers around the world to create their own addons. There are now over 1,000 addons available and in this section I guide you through the various different categories to choose from.\nContinue Building using Stacks\nThis is the longest and most detailed section, in which you will follow me step-by-step as I create a new and better website for my plumbing business. If you keep apace with each lesson and build your own website, by the end of this section you will have a website of your own sufficient for many types of business use.\nCourse Wrap-Up\nIn this lesson I will show you how to extend your Rapidweaving skills further beyond the scope of this beginners' course. I will introduce Search Engine Optimisation. I will show you where to find courses and addons for advanced topics like integrating eCommerce solutions and Content Management Systems. I will give you an overview of graphics and video apps that you may find useful in your web building projects. I will show you why building your own website gives you such an advantage over your competitors who mostly outsource their web design. And I will give you an overview of strategies I have used to advertise my business and attract visitors to my website.\nCourse Support Page\nThroughout the course I refer you to my Rapidweaver support page on a website that I have created as an informative support to my Udemy students. This page contains a detailed description of 'All Things Rapidweaver', together with a multitude of links to help you find all the tools you need to excel in your Rapidweaving skills. I also refer you to the Rapidweaver Community website where you can find the most comprehensive library of addons as well as to the Rapidweaver Forum. If you have questions about any of my lessons I encourage you to message me via Udemy and I will try to answer your questions or add Q&A Videos if appropriate. For general questions about Rapidweaver or specific addons, I encourage you to contact the specific developer, or make use of the Rapidweaver Forum where you will find enthusiastic users only too eager to answer your questions.\nWhat are the requirements?\nRapidweaver is a mac-only web design app, so you need:\nto own a mac computer running a recent version of Mac OS X\nto purchase Rapidweaver from Realmac Software. It costs £79.99 GBP, but you can also download a free trial version to start with. This course was made with Rapidweaver 7 which is very similar in layout to the newly released Rapidweaver 8. You can learn about its new features and refinements by visiting Realmac Software's website.\nto buy web hosting from a hosting company and register a domain so that you can publish your website. Prices vary according to company, but start from about £20 for the first year.\nto buy the Stacks plugin from Yourhead Software, which costs about $50. Without this, you can build a good website with just the Rapidweaver app, especially if you know a bit of html. Stacks is such a revolutionary enhancement that I would recommend this as a must-have for most users. It enables you to build your website with the simplicity of drag-and-drop stack elements and no coding expertise.\na budget for additional addons. As much as possible, I show you addons with a demo version that you can 'try before you buy' in order to help you make best use of your website budget, and avoid wasting money on addons that you won't actually use. A recommended website budget will depend on your particular requirements, but it is certainly helpful to have another two or three hundred pounds or dollars to spare. If your budget is tight you can create a website within your budget and improve it with more addons as and when additional funds become available. In addition to the searchable addons library at Rapidweaver Community, on my own support website I have created a RWstacks page that is my own searchable stacks library. You can filter stacks by several categories, including price, and pick out the free ones if you're on a tight budget. This page is a work in progress, so is not yet as complete as the one at Rapidweaver Community, but I hope you will find it helpful.",

      "description": "In 2025, it is even more important that you secure your WordPress website.\nA few years ago it was estimated that only 44% of web traffic came from genuine visitors.  The rest was from bots, hacking tools, scrapers and spammers.  With that volume or dodgy web traffic coming to your website, are you confident that your website can withstand a hacker attack?  What if I told you that an estimated 37,000 websites are hacked EVERY DAY.  How confident are you now?\nSecuri, a top internet security service, reported that they dealt with 500 website infections a day, 7 days a week.  Out of 11,000 infected sites they dealt with, 78% were Wordpress sites.\nOnce a site is hacked, it can be used for all kinds of malicious purposes, such as directing your traffic, stealing customer details, deleting files, changing your login details to lock you out, sending spam emails to millions of people (which will label your domain as spam and remove any chance it has of ranking in Google), you get the idea?\nAnd hackers don't just target large, popular sites.  They'll use computer software to scan millions of websites for vulnerabilities, and then attack the soft targets.  There is no softer target than a newly setup Wordpress website!\nThere is obviously good reason to be concerned about your website security.  However, I don't want you to think that Wordpress is an insecure platform that should be avoided, it isn't.  Wordpress is actually very secure and if a security hole is found, it is usually plugged very quickly by the Wordpress security team and pushed out to all Wordpress installs - automatically.  The real security issues come from the people running the websites.  They often don't have enough knowledge to make educated decisions about the content they put on their site, the plugins they use or the themes they install.\nThis course has two aims:\nI want to give you the knowledge you need so that you can understand where the main threats come from.  With that knowledge, you will understand how your administrative actions can affect the security of your website.  This knowledge gives you the power to stop hackers.\nI want to give you a step-by-step solution to make your website as hackerproof as possible.  We'll install a single Wordpress plugin and go through the entire setup process.  Simply watch the tutorials, and follow along on your own site as I secure one of my own.\nIf you are not very technically minded, don't worry.  This course assumes no technical ability and no programming skills.\nAbout the Course\nThe course starts off with an introduction to hacking.  Why hackers hack, and what makes some Wordpress sites more vulnerable to hackers than others.\nWe'll then go through the main ways that you can harden up your Wordpress installation, and I'll show you how to manually set some of these up on your site.  You can try out some or all of these techniques yourself if you want to, but it is not essential (see lower down). You may just want to sit back and absorb the information so that you have the knowledge you need to make informed decisions on your Wordpress website going forward.\nIn the second half of the course, we'll install a Wordpress Security Plugin that covers all of the major security weaknesses outlined in the first half of the course, and work our way step-by-step, configuring the plugin to make our site virtually hack-proof.\nBy the end of this course, you will have both the knowledge and the skill set to secure a Wordpress website against hackers.",

Idea Mapping\nIn this stage, I listen to the clients and gather as much information (requirements) from them as possible.\nThen, based on the information I do research. Look at some web designs on pinterest and behance.\nThen I make rough sketch (wireframe) of the web page on paper with pen or pencil.\nAnd then design it (UI) using softwares like Photoshop or Sketch.\n2. Structuring\nIn this stage, First I divide the conceptual web page design into different sections.\nThen, Add HTML elements on each sections based on their requirements.\n3. Styling\nIn this stage, we make our structured web page more beautiful or presentable using CSS.\nThe web page will get its real colors, space, images, etc.\n4. Making Mobile Ready\nBy this time, our web page is well designed and presentable. The only thing left is, to make it responsive or mobile ready. To make it beautifully viewable on any different sizes, we will use media query to make it responsive.",

      "description": "This course is part of our \"Psychology Driven Web Design\" collection.\nThis is a beginner level course as gestalt psychology is concerned.\nPlease note that NO subtitles are available with this course.\n\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nOur brains use complex neurological mechanisms to interpret the constant stream of visual information entering our eyes, thereby turning our experiences into cohesive, meaningful, and usable representations of the world.\nGestalt theory attempts to simplify and explain visual perception by giving us clues as to how these cognitive processes are organized in the mind. It is built upon the premise that the whole is different than the sum of its parts and assumes that we perceive whole objects before their constituents, and that it is perceptual organization that underlies human perception.\nGestalt theory can help web/UX/UI/app designers use the biases and quirks that characterize human visual processing, in order to achieve superior designs, by structuring visual information in a manner that will make it easy for users to pursue their goals, while also having a good user experience.\nAfter you finish this course, you will be able to design websites that account for perceptual biases of visitors, because you will become conscious of how the human mind decodes a scene by scanning it, how it simplifies it by grouping items in it, and how it supplements missing information to make sense of it. By catering to your users’ perceptual biases, you will be able to structure your content based on the natural way they interpret visuals. Imposing a proper structure on your website will in turn help you to frame information, so they can find what they are looking for faster, it will help to highlight and prioritize information, so they can be redirected as desired, and it will help to chunk and order information, so the display can be simplified, making it visually more appealing.\nThis course is beneficial for all web, user experience, user interface, app, icon and logo designers. There are no prerequisites. The curriculum does not contain matters where understanding code, programming or even visual design would be required. However, you must be able to understand English without needing subtitles.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: MOST PARTS OF THIS COURSE ARE ALSO CONTAINED IN OUR COURSE “PSYCHOLOGY DRIVEN WEB DESIGN”. IF YOU HAVE TAKEN THAT COURSE ALREADY, WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU TAKE THIS COURSE.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: WE DO NOT OFFER SUBTITLES IN THIS COURSE.",

I’ve been a designer for almost 18 years– And I have worked with different startups for quite a while. I want to teach you how to apply the tools I use every day–and I’ll give you some insight into my workflow and process as a product designer.\nOn this course you'll learn how to design web and mobile products using Sketch 3. We’ll also learn how to prototype full flows and micro-interactions using the most current apps in the industry like Flinto, Principle, Marvel App, and Invision’s Craft Plugin. And the coolest part about this course? We’ll learn how to create detailed UI animations and how to apply them to your projects.\nThis course is designed in different sections so you can jump around depending on your skill level. You’ll be able to learn how to use the tools to make your own designs from scratch. And we’ll also learn by doing, getting hands-on with more advanced projects.\nSo, Why Sketch?\nSketch 3 is a design tool focused on user interface and user experience design. Because of its simplicity, it’s really easy to understand; anyone with little to no training can learn Sketch. It’s perfect for designing for multiple mobile devices, working on responsive web design, delivering assets in an easy way, and makes collaboration with developers amazing. It also costs a fraction of the price of Adobe Suite (goodby monthly payment). So yeah, it's pretty cool.\nWhy Flinto, Principle, Marvel App and Craft by InVision\nPrinciple makes it easy to create animated and interactive user interface designs. Great for Multi-screen app, or new interactions and animations.\n\nFlinto lets designers quickly make interactive prototypes of their mobile, desktop, or web apps.with custom animations, gestures, and Sketch import\n\nThis simple editor in Marvel allows you to link all your designs together in seconds, then add gestures and transitions to make your prototype feel just like a real app or website.\n\nThis Course\nThis course covers the basics, but also goes into detail on some advanced features, tricks, and plugins that I use in my daily workflow.\nWe'll also work on some cool projects that we'll be able to prototype and share on our mobile devices and the web. We'll even do some UI animation and micro-interactions that will make your prototypes look pretty realistic.",

      "description": "Building a website is similar to painting, except that you cannot see the finished design until the page has been published and is being viewed in a browser. Thanks to the Divi Page Builder for WordPress from Elegant themes, users can now \"paint\" a website while actually viewing it in real-time.\nThe issue with WordPress was that, until recently, the only option to build a website was to utilize a WordPress theme, which is always constrained since you have to work within the boundaries of what the developers built. Your options for features and designs may frequently be constrained as a result. But when the Divi theme for WordPress was made public, it completely altered the narrative!\nWith Divi, you can construct complicated layouts graphically and design your website live without having to move between the editor and preview mode. Divi is a visual WordPress website builder that replaces the default WordPress editor with a live frontend editor.\nYou will be able to create stunning and useful designs without using code or CSS and without consulting developers once you have finished this comprehensive Divi course. Your designs will automatically be displayed beautifully on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices since they are responsive by default.\nAdditionally, you will learn how to use Divi's \"Theme Builder,\" which enables you to build every aspect of your theme using the Divi interface, including your header, footer, WooCommerce shop pages, and custom body layouts. Likewise, you will learn how to establish global settings that enable one-click control over the design pattern for your entire website.",

      "description": "IMPORTANT: This is NOT a WordPress Development course about coding, or tech. If You are looking for that, you will get NO VALUE from this WordPress Training. This is 100% For People Who Are Not Techy, and who want to build WordPress Sites WITHOUT TECH!\n\n\nIs One Or More Of These Things True?\n\n\n1. You're fed up with your progress or your profits so far?\n2. You're sick of buying courses only to discover you were only told a tiny bit of what you had to do?\n3. You are confused with overly complex training?\n4. You're ready right now to learn what will work for you in 2023 and beyond?\n\n\nIf there is one thing that holds many people back, especially when starting out it's being fed overly complex information and losing trust in your trainer...\n\n\nMy Promise To You:\n\n\nI, Ciaran Doyle, promise to show you the WordPress website building steps to...\n· Eliminate the confusion, squash the uncertainty and frustration, while...\n· Showing you Non-tech ways to get what you need done,\n· Getting more results, WITHOUT spending more money,\n· And NOT trying to sell you anything during the training,\nSo, if you are looking for that final breakthrough, that last little push towards success, you are in the right place.\n\n\n===========================================\nDon't take my word for it, here's what my students say...\n\n\n…I have Ciaron to thank for his magical messaging. It's fun, engaging, and somehow has penetrated into my brain. I recommend the course to anyone interested in learning this stuff. It will happen! Robin Richardson.\n\n\nThis course is spectacular. Ciaran knows how to teach effectively and to really connect with his students, providing clear explanations of concepts, processes, and tools. He really lives up to his promise…I look forward to taking other courses with him. P.S. He really over-delivers for the price he charges… Ellen C.\n\n\n…I cannot believe that you as a tutor can be more concerned about the individual success of each and every student rather than your own financial gain. You truly are a rare find! We salute you! – Alphie J\n\n\nThis is my second training with Ciaran and it does not disappoint again. Thanks, Ciaran – Steve B\n\n\nThank you so much, Ciaran for such an amazing course… It’s well structured, very informative, and easy to understand. Again thank you! – Eva\n\n\nPlus a whole host of others...\n===========================================\n\n\nWordPress can be so much fun, even better when you are profiting from it.\n\n\nAnd that is what I'm going to show you how to do...\n\n\nTo build on top of WordPress, to show you the key steps you need to know to be able to do pretty much everything you need to run all manner of online businesses…\n\n\n\n\n1. Follow along with this WordPress Tutorial as I build professional-looking WordPress sites from scratch, even though I'm not a designer,\n2. Get the easiest non-technical ‘technical” overview of WordPress,\n3. Get floods of free visitors from the search engines (Yep, even this), and...\n4. Turn your ideas into fun and profitable WordPress sites.\n==============================================\n\n\nBut what if you’re not techy?\n\n\nHere’s the truth about starting a new WordPress site…\n1. You don’t need to be an expert,\n2. You don’t need to have done this before to create a great WordPress site, create brilliant WP content and get floods of visitors,\n3. You don’t need to be a tech wizard, university graduate, or college, or even high school…\n4. And, you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars hiring so called experts to make this a reality, (This really is KEY FOR THIS TRAINING)\nSo,\nWHY TAKE THIS WORDPRESS COURSE AND NOT ANOTHER ONE?\nWell, this WordPress training is based on WordPress implementation that works, and excels online, and that I use in my own business.\nEverything you will see has been tried and tested, put through actual real world experience, cutting your learning curve, so you can benefit from it right now!\nAlso, the more you do with this, the stronger your WordPress skills and knowledge will become.\nI’m not only going to teach you how to do WordPress… but MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW TO THINK WORDPRESS!\nYou see,\n\n\nThis WordPress training focuses on great understanding of how to use WordPress without being a:\ndesigner or developer,\nwithout being a techy person, and just simply,\nwhat you as a technophobe are actually capable of doing,\ninstead of what is just going to make your brain explode.\nVs.\n\n\nWhat many people teach, which is Skimming over the inner workings, or passing the work over to Upwork to get a designer to do that etc…\n\n\nWhich does work, but, as you have probably already discovered, hiring people is a nightmare!\n\n\nFor a start... if you just simply get others to create your WordPress sites for you:\n\n\nYou don't even know what is good or bad work,\nOr what you even need to have on your site to make it work the way you want, and…\n9 times out of 10, THEY DON’T DO IT CORRECTLY!\n\n\nNon WordPress Understanding = Overcharging, Bad Work and Bad Site Functionality!\n\n\nPlus…\nDid you know?\n\n\nWhen people come to your website, you only have up to 0.05 seconds to make an impression on them, or they will leave, and most likely never come back…(Yep, only 50 milliseconds)\n\n\nNow imagine your website runs slowly…\n\n\nWhen your WordPress site runs sluggishly (which most do), this can lead to your potential customers never even getting to see your website, as it takes too long to load…\n\n\nAnd guess what happens then?\n\n\nThey LEAVE, and look somewhere else!\n\n\nYour website is just ‘One’ of the multitude of solutions out there…\n\n\nSo, YOU need to know how to sort out these problems yourself, quickly, making your WordPress website more USER FRIENDLY instantly!\n\n\nQUICKER SITE = MORE USER FRIENDLY = MORE VISITORS = A GROWING WEBSITE!\n\n\nAnd ultimately that means more sales/money/signups…\n\n\nIf you have fallen foul of the ‘gurus’ before, with their overly complex training and lessons, don’t worry, many of my students have been in the same predicament before they came to me.\n\n\nSo, for a change, you will learn the real fundamentals of how WordPress works, for YOU and YOUR WEBSITE!\n\n\nThe skills and step by step instructions will open your eyes to the world of WORDPRESS and the internet like never before!.\n\n\nThese are the things that actually WILL work for you, no matter your technical ability (As there is NO CODE HERE), and in a much quicker time.\n\n\nDo you want to get real results for a change?\n\n\nYou will be able to easily follow along with the over-the-shoulder step-by-step approach to help this become a reality for you…\n\n\nSimply do what I do, and let me guide you to succeeding with WordPress.\n\n\n==============================================\nHow This Making WordPress Easy Training works\n\n\nThe training is split into 13 Modules:\n\n\nPart 1 – Before You Begin\n\n\nThis is all about you and how you can get the most out of the training,\n\n\n· Finding out how best to approach this training for exceptional results,\n· How it will work for you,\n· How to get to the core of what you want to create,\n· How to find out any answers you may have... sometimes this can be the hardest point, getting to the core of the ‘jargon’ used with new softwares…but it is a breeze with this method.\n\n\nI’ll show you how to pick the correct WordPress for your new website, and where to install it, so you can get the proper understanding of the most important elements of your site.\n\n\nPart 2 – Web Host Installation\n\n\nWe get straight into getting your WordPress website LIVE online...\n\n\nYou will follow along step by step as I bring you through the whole WordPress website setup, including explanations of it, from:\n\n\nPurchasing your first domain,\nGetting your hosting set up (multiple types for you to choose)\nYour DNS changed,\nYour SSL requirements,\nWhen done correctly following this specific setup formula, your WordPress website will:\n\n\nSave you money,\nGet a WordPress website performance boost,\nEnsure that you fill a requirement of the search engines (like Google),\nAnd see how easy it is going to be to reproduce WordPress sites in a flash.\n\n\nYou will get addicted to creating these WordPress websites, and the more you create the better and easier they will become.\nAnd when you follow along, build yours out and learn the process, you will be able to do it too, but you need to learn it first.\n\n\nPart 3 - A First Look At WordPress\n\n\nFollowing on from the WordPress website installation section, I’m going to bring you through an overview of your new WordPress dashboard…\n\n\nGiving you the immediate confidence to know…\n\n\nWhat the different sections are for,\nHow to access them,\nHow to find things you want,\nAnd most importantly, to be able to navigate your dashboard to get the best out of not only this training, but every single WordPress site you create.\nWithout this,\n\n\nYou won't know where to start, and what you see in front of you will look overly complex.\n\n\nDon’t let something so easily explained confuse you before you start, and that is why I do this section, to make sure you get such a good grounding to WordPress that the next sections become a breeze.\n\n\nBecause we move onto something very special in Module 4…\n\n\nPart 4 - Gutenberg Editor\n\n\nContent is King as they say...\n\n\nBut, while it might be king, and it is that important, it is a learned skill...\n\n\nIt is not something that you automatically get good at!\n\n\nBUT...\n\n\nContent Isn’t ONLY The Words You Create…\n\n\nIt’s HOW you create them, and what you make it:\nLook like,\nRead like, and…\nFeel like.\nSo, understanding how to turn an ordinary piece of text writing into something of easy beauty is key to making a brilliant website.\n\n\nWhat if I was able to show you how to work one of the most powerful content creation platforms in the world, and…\n\n\n1.

And make your site work like a dream, would that interest you?\n\n\nMINUS THE WORDPRESS TECH, DEVELOPERS AND CODING OF COURSE!\n\n\nEnter, WordPress Plugins…\n\n\nA WordPress Plugin is an external piece of software that add functionality to your website like…\n\n\n1.

WordPress SEO is the icing on the cake for ANY WordPress Site, PERIOD!\n\n\nPart 9 - Legal Pages\n\n\nWhen it comes to creating WordPress website, you need to also take into consideration the things that EVERY Single website MUST have, like legal stuff…\n\n\nThis really isn’t for your visitors, more for yoru website to be considered a reputable business in the search engines eyes…\n\n\nMore Reputable looking = More Chance Of Ranking High!\n\n\nSo, this section is all about doing just that, making your WordPress website seem like you are a quality website the search engines can trust!\n\n\nBut not only that, I’m going to give you some copy/paste templates you can use to get these things done quickly, without too much hassle!\n\n\nYou'll also uncover:\nMy top resources for getting your document pages created, and how you too, can get all the legal requirements done and dusted within a few clicks, not to be missed!\n\n\nPart 10 - The HomePage\n\n\nOnce you have gotten here well done.

It is also updated to the latest version of bootstrap.\n\nWelcome to The Complete Bootstrap 4 Guide, the only course you need to learn Bootstrap 4. There are a lot of ways to learn Bootstrap 4, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective way to learn the latest version of Bootstrap. Here's why:\nThis course was carefully planned and took over 8 months to create\nEverything I cover is up-to-date and relevant using only the latest version of Bootstrap 4 - version 4.3.1 final release (not an alpha or beta version)\nI built a special Bootstrap Playground where you can quickly learn all of the Bootstrap Classes and Components.\nThe course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and lectures. Feel free to offer suggestions of what else you would like to see.\nDon't be a code monkey, actually understand WHY we are doing something\nWhy should you learn Bootstrap?\nIt is the fastest way to build websites without having to re-invent the wheel. When building a website there is a lot of repeated code such as what a button looks like or how to make a website responsive. There are countless other examples, but all you need to know is that it makes your life a whole lot easier, especially if you are a junior web developer.\nThroughout this course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:\nHTML5\nCSS3\nBootstrap 4 (4.3.1)\nFlexbox\nResponsive Design\nSASS & SCSS\nThis course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many times instructors just show you the Bootstrap 4 documentation or worse they just jump right in and expect you to learn it along the way. This course is different. I have built a custom site called the Bootstrap Playground which allows you to:\nQuickly learn the Bootstrap 4 class names\nBe able to differentiate between the different Bootstrap 4 components\nPlay around with Bootstrap without a lot of setup\nA quick way to compare my code and yours\nAnd more!",

Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, simplifies the automation and management of cloud and on-premise infrastructure. Beyond its basic capabilities, Terraform offers advanced features that help organizations manage complex infrastructure with precision, scalability, and efficiency. This course highlights key advanced Terraform topics, including modules, workspaces, state management, dynamic configurations, and CI/CD integration.\nOne of the most significant advanced topics in Terraform is the use of modules. Modules encapsulate sets of related resources into reusable components, promoting code reusability and consistency. By breaking infrastructure into logical units, modules allow teams to maintain a cleaner codebase and reduce duplication. Proper use of modules also makes it easier to standardize configurations across different projects or environments. State management is critical in Terraform for tracking infrastructure changes. Advanced topics in state management include remote state storage and state locking. Remote state storage, using services like AWS S3 or Terraform Cloud, ensures shared and consistent state files across teams.\nadvanced Terraform topics empower organizations to efficiently manage large-scale, complex infrastructure. By leveraging modular design, robust state management, dynamic configurations, and automation, teams can enhance scalability, maintainability, and operational excellence. Workspaces are a powerful feature in Terraform for managing multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production.",

      "description": "This course is part of our \"Psychology Driven Web Design\" collection.\nPeople are physiologically, psychologically, and socially influenced by color and color sets the mood through which a design is seen.\nColor psychology, which is the field of study of how color affects human behavior, has long been used by marketers and advertisers to convey specific feelings and messages to their markets. Our aim in this course is to teach you to do the same in web design, which means that you must learn how different colors impact people, so that you can select appropriate colors for using in your concepts.\nNotwithstanding the commonly accepted fact, that color does affect people, many believe this influence to be entirely culture based and completely subjective. In recent years, this assumption has been proven wrong experiment after experiment. When our eyes take in a color, say red, they communicate with our brain, which in turn sends a cascade of signals to different parts of our body through the release of different hormones, which cause fluctuations in mood, emotion, and resulting behavior, in everyone, without exceptions. One color may speed up the heart rate, while another may slow it down. It should therefore not come as a surprise that colors can influence people’s urge to purchase as well. In fact, we know that 60 to 90% of purchasing decisions are based on colors! Making sure that you use the right colors at the right places in your designs is very important, since your website’s color scheme not only impacts its aesthetics but also its usability and accessibility.\nAfter you finish this course, you will be able to create beautiful color harmonies that will positively affect the mood of your visitors, understand the physiological, psychological, and social influence of individual hues, choose appropriate colors for your website in a systematic manner, use colors more effectively in e-commerce to increase sales, and much more.\nThis course is beneficial for all web and app designers and more generally all content creators. There are no prerequisites.The curriculum does not contain matters where understanding code, programming or even visual design would be required. The topics covered include how color is interpreted, its components, color theory, color harmonies, meanings of hues, how colors are effectively used in web design, and subjects that relate to designing for people with color vision deficiency, all explained in an easy to understand, basic manner.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: MOST PARTS OF THIS COURSE ARE ALSO CONTAINED IN OUR COURSE “PSYCHOLOGY DRIVEN WEB DESIGN”.

If you convert your site to Wordpress, you'll not only have a great looking website, you'll also have one that is responsive!  That means the site looks great in any browser on any device - mobile phone, tablet or desktop computer.  The beauty of Wordpress is that it takes care of the technical stuff, you just concentrate on your site content.  Now you don't need to be a designer.\nIf you are concerned about the upcoming changes to Google's algorithm and how they will affect your HTML site, then this course is for you.  Within a few hours, you'll have a beautiful, responsive site that Google will reward.\nWhat's in this course?\nThis course starts off with an introduction, telling you why it is important to make the switch to a responsive theme.\nI'll then introduce you to one of my old HTML websites, built a long time ago when SEO had very different rules. During this upgrade to Wordpress, I'll also be cleaning it up and bringing the SEO up to date.\nYou'll then see an easy way of collecting a list of URLs on the site, and using a spreadsheet, organize them to help the conversion go smoothly.\nAfter installing Wordpress, you'll learn how to make it invisible to the search engines until you are ready to switch it on.\nYou'll also learn the simple strategy to make sure your site has ZERO downtime during the conversion.\nOnce the site has been ported over to Wordpress, you'll learn how to make the switch, and test the new site to make sure everything is as it should be.  You'll even be able to go to Google, search for your pages and click on the old HTML pages and be redirected to the new version of that page on the Wordpress site.\nSo, what are you waiting for?  Let's start to convert your site.",

Assuming everyone can use things in the exact same ways leads to an experience that works well for some people, but creates major issues or barriers for others.\nAccessibility is starting to gain more traction in the design and tech industries, especially since more and more countries are creating laws surrounding accessibility.

You will be blogging in no time!\nThe best time to start blogging is now.\nYou don't have to be a developer anymore to setup a website, or be a website designer for that matter. There are so many tools out there that make it easy for you to setup your own website in no time at all.\nWhy would you want to setup your own website?\nTest an idea: Before investing in a custom website, you can setup your own website to test your idea and see if it is worth investing in. I have done this on multiple occasions by setting up a simple Wordpress website to test an idea before I spent a lot of time working on something custom.\n\nConnect with others: A blog is a great way to connect with others who have similar interests. Writing about your experiences is a great way to learn and share with others. If you have a business, you are probably already aware of what a website could do to help you connect with new customers.\nShare Information: A website helps you share information with others. If you are a professional or have information that you feel would be useful to others, a website can help you expand your reach and set you apart from your competition.\nWith all of the themes and plugins available these days, it is easy to setup a Wordpress website and add the features you need.\nThere is no better time to start a website than now. The earlier you get started the more content you will have. The issue with waiting is that by the time you do get around to building your website, you could have had a nice head start.\nTake this short free course and get started on building your own website today.\nAs a website designer and developer of 13 years, I have coached many people through the process of having a website designed. I have suggested to even more people that they start smaller by designing their own website. This process used to be more difficult. Now, I suggest that people start their own website just as I outline in this course. When their business or needs grow to require customized support, that is when you call a designer or developer to help you take your website to the next level. One of the greatest features of Wordpress is that you can completely redesign the website without having to reinsert all of your content. Get started today and learn as you go.",

      "description": "This is PART 2 of the course \"Psychology Driven Web Design\". It also contains our courses  \"Content Design Fundamentals for Bloggers\" and \"E-Commerce Psychology\".\n\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThere are over 250 million regularly updated websites on the internet, that look, in one way or another, similar. How can yours stand out in this crowded place? How can you make sure that your first-time visitors have an engaging user experience and come again? And when they do, quickly find what they’re looking for to accomplish their goals? Can you change their mood to the better and use that positivity to achieve your website goals? Or anticipate their unconscious desires and cater to them?\nThis course will enable you to create effective and affective websites that are centered around how human beings work. By teaching you how to take findings in applied psychology into account when designing, it will empower you to predict how people will interact with your website and to take their perceptual biases, motivations, emotional states, and unconscious cognitions into consideration.\nOnly when you thoroughly understand the human mind can you hope to create designs that are simple yet pleasing and engaging at the same time. Psychology driven design aims to help accomplish that, by making you aware, at every step of a creative process, how humans think, feel and act. And the result of it is a product that appeals simultaneously to the intellect, emotions as well as unconscious desires of users.\nSome people refer to this method as “designing for the mind” others as “designing for humans” or even “neurodesign”. We prefer the term “psychology driven design”, because the concept relies on findings in cognitive, behavioral and social psychology to determine, how, for example, the structure of a website influences users’ perception of it; how the colors and types used by its designer affect their mood; and how they interact with it to connect with others.\nThe psychological impact of the design of a website determines if users will trust it or not, if they will feel important, or at ease, or curious and so on. In short, it is the number one determinant of a good or bad web user experience, and regardless of whether you are new to web design or a seasoned professional, if you would like to understand how you can use its power, then this is the right course for you.\n\n\nWHO THIS COURSE IS FOR\nThis course is useful for all web designers, to a great extent also app designers, independent of their level of expertise and years of experience, from individuals who are using readymade templates to publish their first personal conceptions, to highly professional designers who are creating original web interfaces for Fortune 500 companies. This course is very useful even for those content creators, who are not versed in web design at all, but wish to insert some content into an existing web-based platform in an impactful manner.\nThe course is especially beneficial for those who want to accomplish the creative part of designing a website, to then have a web developer do the coding; for those who use ready-made web templates that can be modified by users to quickly personalize them; and of course, for those who are already proficient in developing websites but who can use deeper design knowledge to make their creations more effective. If you are in this last category, this course can give you sound reasons for much of what is felt intuitively, and yet not fully understood.\n\n\nHOW THIS COURSE WILL BENEFIT YOU\nWebsite elements have become more or less standardized, so that by combining them within some context you can quickly end up with a fairly good-looking website. But the problem is, content and design are interrelated. Websites that are based on off-the-shelf themes by themselves cannot claim the kind of relationship that makes a website impactful, as a theme is always built on dummy content. This means that, in order to select content appropriate layouts, visuals, colors, typography etc., to create content that is scannable and shared more, to design user experiences that are gamified and personalized, you do have to master the way to influence the perception of your visitors, whether you design from scratch or use a template. In that sense, learning about psychology driven web design will enable you to:\n\n\nUnderstand why successful websites have been designed the way they have been;\nEvaluate why, in some context, a certain design generates positive emotions and thoughts while another leads to user frustration;\nCreate designs that increase conversions by taking latest findings in applied psychology into account;\nDesign websites that support the quirks, biases and defining features of the human mind;\nDesign displays that support human visual perception and improve the user experience.\n\n\nIn a word, by the end of this course, you will be able to create better websites and be more successful at what you do.\n\n\nMAIN LEARNING OBJECTIVES\nPART 1\nLearning to design with user focus, from goal setting, through user research, defining personas, creating scenarios, devising user journeys and user experiences, user motivations, all the way to information architecture, usability and usability testing, and accessibility issues.\nLearning to take the characteristics and limitations of human attention, memory, perception, language and reading skills, learning abilities, and different types of emotions into consideration when designing a website.\nLearning how to account for perceptual biases of users in order to create websites that are more appealing to their subconscious mind and easier for them to navigate, by understanding the gestalt principles of perception.\nLearning to create perceptual organization using similarity and contrast, visual weights, visual directions, dominance, focal points, compositional hierarchy, flow and rhythm, compositional balance, proportion, whitespace and much more to achieve strong visual hierarchy, simplicity, unity, variety, and consistency in design.\nLearning to use the impact of color on human psychology to convey specific feelings and messages in your designs.\nPART 2\nLearning to create content that is suitable for scanning, better legible and readable, more impactful, socially accepted, and shared more, which are essential skills for any blogger.\nLearning to judge the purposefulness, appropriateness as well as psychological impact of visuals, multimedia, and typography by taking into consideration such issues as the psychological impact of faces and anthropomorphic forms on photographs, the attractiveness bias, the meanings of common shapes, the use of digital arts, infographics, iconic representation, the psychology of typography and much more.\nLearning to take characteristics and differences of individual users, as well as subtle details relating to specific user groups, including culture, gender, age, etc. into account for creating personalized experiences that resonate differently with different psychological profiles, groups and communities.\nLearning to take human time requirements, responsiveness of designs, conceptual models in interactions, the usability of controls into account, and to be able to design effective call-to-action buttons, effective forms, gamification, real-time technology and mobile user interactions.\nLearning to account for the triune nature of the human mind, the inconsistency of the self, the psychology of trust, the psychology of choice, the psychology of decision making, the price and quality perception, the psychology of scarcity and urgency, the psychology of reciprocity and rewards, the effects of social validation, and more generally, for all idiosyncrasies of human psychology to be able to design e-commerce websites that convert.\n\n\nPRERQUISITES\nYou should take our course \"Psychology Driven Web Design - PART 1 Fundamentals\" before taking this second part of the course. But other than that, there are no prerequisites for this course. If you can browse the internet and know what menus, buttons and links are, you can follow all the lectures. No literacy in psychology is required as all necessary knowledge will be conveyed, in laymen’s terms. However, you must be able to understand English without needing subtitles.\n\n\nTHE LEVEL OF STUDY\nThis is a comprehensive course for students at all levels, from beginner to advanced, where every aspect of psychological influence in web design is dealt with in detail. It is not a quick, one-hour design tutorial, not a presentation of inspirational lists and certainly not a tool tutorial. While someone on their first project can easily follow the lectures, even a seasoned professional web designer can find here some inspiration in terms of psychological impact to improve their work.\nThe course consists of two parts, where PART 1 covers the Fundamentals and PART 2 covers Advanced Topics.\nThe curriculum of the course is completely original, meaning that it does not follow any one book written by a third party. However, the information contained in the over 800-page course script has been checked against 12 contemporary design / psychology books and over 600 pages of design / psychology blogs.\nThe summary of this course is being sold as a kindle book on Amazon. It is provided to all students of the course free of charge.\nYou will receive a valuable certificate that you can add to your CV when you finish this course.\n\n\nTHE TEACHING METHOD\nThis course contains a total of 160 video lectures, 80 in PART 1 and 80 in PART 2, with each lecture having a duration of approximately 15 minutes (some a few minutes longer, others a few minutes shorter). The lectures are organized in 10 coherent content sections, plus one introductory section and one conclusion section.\nThe second section of the course serves as an extended introduction, where the entire user focused web design process is explained from goal setting all the way to usability testing, so that someone with no experience in web design at all can, having studied this section, easily understand the later section. For more experienced designers, this section may appear to be superfluous, but should nevertheless serve to solidify the basis for later sections.\nSections three and four convey the fundamentals of cognitive psychology so far as required for designing impactful websites, with lots of illustrations and always in laymen’s terms. From the fifth section onwards, the lectures are heavily supported by exemplary websites, either screenshots or video captures, where concepts are discussed with the help of design examples.\nAt the end of each section, there is a quiz. However, due to the nature of the subject matter, the quizzes can only serve to reinforce what has been explained in the lectures rather than testing design knowledge. Your actual progress can only be attested to by yourself in the long run through the changes you will notice in your creations.\nEverything you’ll learn in this course relates to creating effective and affective websites. But it is one thing to hear about concepts, yet another to actually implement them in design work. Even though a great many number of examples are shown in the lectures, mastery in design requires practicing and so you will have to do the real work more or less by yourself. There are 82 assignments that accompany the lectures to facilitate a more active learning experience, which are the secret ingredients to the success of learning psychology driven design.\nAll assignments are applicable on any one of 5 web design projects, based on imagined scenarios introduced in the fifth lecture. The assignments, if properly worked on, can take the student from an empty canvas to a finished web design project. In other words, a student applying all assignments on all 5 scenarios will end up with not one but five portfolio-ready website designs by the end of the course.\n\n\nWHAT THIS COURSE IS NOT ABOUT\nThis course is NOT about learning web development using HTML / CSS / Scripting Languages. It is also NOT about encoding, implementing, or publishing an actual website on some platform. This course is about web design.\nThis is also NOT a psychology course. While a great number of topics are covered here that are usually taught within the curriculum of a psychology course, including advanced topics in neuroscience, the emphasis is always on practical design implications of these and NOT on theoretical notions of cognition or behavior.\nPsychology driven design is NOT about the psychology of the designer or designers in a design team or their interactions with other project stakeholders or the design methods they may be employing. The focus here is always on the psychology of the website visitor.\nPsychology driven design is also NOT about hacking people’s brains, or using techniques for manipulating their unconscious mind, or persuading them to buy things they don’t need. It is merely about using knowledge gained about the way human beings work for designing impactful websites, apps and more generally, web-based user experiences.\nPsychology driven design is NOT the same thing as user-centered design. Nevertheless, even though this course is NOT particularly about teaching the standardized user-centered design methodology, or the design thinking concept, it touches upon many of the topics that are usually covered in those fields of study, but then goes way beyond.\nThe applicability of psychology driven design is NOT limited to creation of business websites. It is applicable to all types of websites, from personal blogs to virtual reality-based community forums.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: WE DO NOT OFFER SUBTITLES IN THIS COURSE.",

      "description": "Welcome to Building & Designing Stunning 3D Websites with No Code course. This is a project based course where you will be guided step by step on how to build, design, and animate a 3D website from scratch using tools like Dora Run, Wix, and Muse. Even better, you don’t have to write a single line of code as those tools will enable you to build and customise your websites using drag and drop features. In addition, this course will also concentrate on ensuring the smoothness of 3D models integration with the user interface of the website. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of 3D websites like its use cases and common 3D file types that can be integrated to your website. Then, continue by learning how to get high quality 3D assets for completely free on platforms like Sketchfab, Turbosquid, and Free 3D or perhaps generate your own model using text to 3D asset AI generators where you do not have to create your 3D model from scratch using tool likes Blender which will most likely take a lot of your time. Afterward, you will also be shown several examples of interactive 3D websites which hopefully could give you some inspirations or new ideas about what website that you should consider to build. Once you have all the necessary knowledge, to make this learning experience even better, this course also comes with fully guided website projects where you will be guided step by step on how to build an E-commerce online store, agency, portfolio website from scratch using Dora Run, Wix, and Muse. By building these projects, you will be able to apply all skills and knowledge that you’ve learnt into practice and that is definitely the most effective method to learn new skills. Once the websites have been built, we will be conducting testing on the website to ensure that those websites have been fully functioning. There will be four testing objectives that we will be focusing on, those are functionality testing, compatibility testing, user experience testing, and performance testing. Lastly, at the end of the course, you will also learn several ways that you can choose to monetise your expertise in building and designing 3D websites as well as potential business models that you should consider to start.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we learn and build 3D websites? Some people might even be asking, what’s wrong with 2D websites? Well to answer that question, there is nothing wrong with 2D websites and the vast majority of websites today are still 2D websites, nonetheless, the technology and the market have been transforming to a more advanced level where to stand out from the crowds, you need to be different and have your own uniqueness. Let me give you an example here by asking you this question, let’s say there are two E-commerce store selling the same product with very similar qualities and the only thing that distinguish their store is the websites where one has relatively ordinary website with average quality 2D interface while the other has highly engaging and interactive 3D website interface and even better, the store also offers a virtual store feature where the customers can easily drag the product that they want to purchase into their baskets like in a metaverse world. Based on those two scenarios, which seller would you predict to generate more sales? Not only that, we are also still early in this game, by mastering 3D websites design, you would have high demand skills in the market which will definitely open up a lot of opportunities in the future as more and more businesses and companies start transforming their websites from 2D to 3D.\nBelow are things that you are going to learn from this course:\nLearning the basic fundamentals of 3D websites, its use cases, and common 3D file types that can be integrated to your website\nLearning how to download 3D assets from marketplaces like Sketchfab and Turbosquid\nLearning how to generate 3D model from text using 3dfy AI\nLearning how to build 3D website using Dora and animate the 3D model\nLearning how to build 3D website using Wix and embed HTML code to attach 3D model\nLearning how to build semi metaverse 3D website using Muse\nLearning website testing objectives like functionality testing, user experience testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing\nGetting to know several ways to potentially monetise your expertise in building and designing 3D website templates\nLearning how to build interactive 3D website using Lovable\nLearning how to create 3D Models with Polycam and Tripo AI",

This course covers everything from the basics of UI design principles, wireframing, prototyping, to the advanced techniques of creating a Hero Section that works both visually and functionally.\nCreating a comprehensive Udemy course on building a Hero Section in UI/UX Design involves a mix of theory, practical steps, and design principles. Below is a suggested outline for the course, detailing the modules and lessons. This course will walk students through everything they need to know to design a visually compelling and functional hero section for websites or applications.\nUX refers to the overall experience a user has while interacting with a product or service. It’s focused on making the experience efficient, enjoyable, and easy. UX involves understanding the users' needs, their journey, and the context in which they interact with the product.\nUser-Centered Design:\nThe product should be designed around the needs, goals, and pain points of the user. This involves extensive user research (e.g., surveys, interviews) to understand what users want and how they behave.\nExample: A weather app should provide accurate, easily understandable weather information with quick access to the most important features.\nUsability:\nThe product should be intuitive and easy to use. Navigation should be simple, and tasks should be easy to complete with minimal steps.\nExample: A checkout process on an e-commerce website should only require essential information and have clear instructions.",

Meanwhile, others seem, well, kind of bland—just a title, URL, and a description.\nWhy do some results stand out while others fade into the background?\nHere’s the secret: it’s all about Structured Data.\nWebsites that show up with those attention-grabbing “rich” features have implemented structured data. And here's why that matters: search engines are making it clear that “rich results” are the future of search.\nIf you own a website, it just makes sense to use structured data. Why? Because pages with those enhancements get more clicks. It’s simple—people are naturally drawn to listings with star ratings, images, or other engaging elements.\nSo, what is structured data anyway?\nThink of it as a way of giving Google a little extra nudge. Sure, search engines are pretty good at figuring out your content, but structured data makes it crystal clear what’s important. For example, if you’ve got a video on your site, adding structured data can help Google understand the title, duration, and description, and might even feature it as a thumbnail next to your listing.\nNow, I know—just the thought of setting up structured data might seem overwhelming, especially if coding isn’t your thing. But don’t worry. This course is designed to take you from zero to structured data hero—no previous experience needed.\nWhat you’ll learn:\nThe basics: What structured data is and how Google uses it.\nWho benefits from it (spoiler: you do) and why it’s worth your time.\nYour options for adding structured data the right way—just like Google wants.\nHow to make your content stand out with zero coding skills required.\nFree tools to create, test, and troubleshoot your structured data.\nHow to use Google Tag Manager to seamlessly insert structured data into your pages.\nWhy using structured data on WordPress can be a game-changer—and how to make it happen with just a few clicks.\nI get it—adding structured data can feel like a big task. But with the right guidance, it’s totally doable—and worth every minute. Imagine your site standing out with rich snippets, more clicks, and better engagement.\nLet’s make your website the one that catches everyone’s eye. Sign up now, and let’s get your site noticed!",

Businesses, public figures, publications and everything in between all have a presence on the web; and the more professional their website looks, the more successful they tend to be. Web designers are more in demand than ever before, and the profession is constantly changing along with the web itself. This course aims to teach the most up to date fundamentals of web design from scratch.\nLearn Web Design from Scratch\nUnderstand the basics of CSS and HTML\nLearn about current web designing trends and developments\nGain an insight into web development, debugging, etc. as well as design\nBuild your own portfolio website\nWeb Designing for Beginners\nThis course has been developed for both complete beginners and those who already have a limited knowledge of web design. Aspiring web designers, web developers who want to understand the design side of the business, and graphic designers - as well as those from completely unrelated disciplines - will all be more than capable of handling the content of this course.\nThis course will take you through the fundamentals of web design from scratch. That means getting to grips with HTML, CSS and Foundation Grid Framework; working with images, webfonts and sprite sheets among other elements; understanding grids and responsive design; and achieving flawless layouts, eradicating bugs, and more.\nThroughout the course you will work towards designing and developing a colorful, modern and responsive portfolio website. By the end of the course you will have this website completed, and can use it when starting out on your career in web design.\nAbout HTML and CSS\nHTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the code used to define colors, graphics, hyperlinks, paragraphs, and other simple elements of a website. It was developed by the founder of the web, Tim Berners Lee, back in 1990.\nCSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, define the more advanced aspects of websites like fonts, background images, positioning and much more. It is a style language that defines HTML layout, so the two are intrinsically linked. Both form the basic frameworks for all websites on the internet.",

      "description": "Getting started as a designer is intimidating if you’ve never done it before. Especially if you’re learning at home by yourself. Even if you know what you should be doing, sometimes you just need to see how something in as much detail as possible. If you don’t have the time or money to go to design school you can’t be in the classroom to see how the teachers do it. You have no idea where to start, so you get frustrated and do nothing.\nWhat if you could sit behind a web designer for a week and watch them at work? And not just see part of the project, but watch them from start to finish. Along the way they would do some serious hand holding by explaining what they were doing and why. And what if they did this for a variety of projects, in different styles? For example on Monday you watched them do a website for a bank. Then on Tuesday they designed a clothing site. And so on. See the design process unfold before your eyes would help you better understand the design concepts you read about in books.\nIn these five videos I do just that. I design five sites from start to finish. You see everything from the blank Photoshop document to the finished site. Each recording is sped up about 4x so that you see each site come to life in about an hour. During that hour I talk about what I’m doing on screen and my thinking behind each design choice. The original non-sped up  videos are included too if you want to view how I did something in real-time.\nAlso included is my 139 page e-book that explains the concepts in the video. I recommend students read the book first, then watch the videos.",

Even if you're a complete novice in the realm of WordPress, I guarantee that by the end of this course, you'll be a bona fide WordPress pro!\nYou know, one of my greatest passions in life is sharing what I know with others.

Don't change anything of you, and everybody must remember that the above courses, which gave you a basic way to do a lot of personal work, are the key to success. BRAVO Ferdy. Take care, Ferdy.\"\n\"Ferdy, Your videos have taught me and guided me so much! I've watched the enfold and mail chimp all the way through as I've gotten started! You are an excellent teacher, and I am so grateful that my search led me to you and your videos. I'm inspired by you already, and you have made a huge difference in my life! I respect your drive and devotion to be excellent in what you do. I want that, too! Your English is definitely understandable in the videos. I have never struggled to hear or interpret what you say and mean, and because you enunciate so well, your Dutch accent does not hinder your message. But I respect you for wanting to continue to improve! Keep going! I'm so excited about your next videos and tutorials!\"\n\"Ferdy, I really like your tutorials and, of course, the way you deliver things to people. Please keep going on.\" \"Man, you are the best.

If I told you two or three years ago that you can build a fully functioning website from just a single text prompt, you wouldn’t believe that. However, what if I told you that now you actually can utilise Ai to generate a fully functioning website without having to write a single line of code and with just a single AI prompt describing how the website should look and in less than a minute AI can deliver the website to you. That’s exactly what you are going to learn in this course, you will extensively learn how to use Mixo IO, Butternut IO, Durable which are basically AI text to website generators to build your own custom website in less than a minute.

His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.\nHaving been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time. Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.\nAndrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.\nTaking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.\n\n\n\nDaniel is a design leader in tech with extensive experience in helping startups build and iterate on their products. Daniel is passionate about teaching and empowering designers and working with other disciplines to build purposeful products that meet both user and business goals.\nHis approach to design is always thoughtful and iterative. Daniel often finds himself working collaboratively with his team whether that is sketching concepts and flows or leading design strategy with team leads and external stakeholders.\nDaniel is a multi faceted designer who’s expertise expands across multiple design disciplines. This includes User Experience and Visual Design, User Research, Product Strategy, Lean and Agile Design Methodologies and much more. HIs work has helped to shape different solutions for a variety of industries such as housing, blockchain and health.\nWhen he is not building products, Daniel has spoke and mentored at different meetups and events. He aims to give back to the design community that he has learnt and continues to learn so much from. Daniel aims to always help, teach and support other designers in their careers.\n\n\nSee you inside the courses!",

The main claimed feature is high graphical performance (the ability to display 120 frames per second). Full support for creating web applications appeared in version 2.0 (March 2021), from the same version support for desktop applications for Windows, macOS and Linux and Google Fuchsia (in the Dart virtual machine with JIT-compiler) was implemented.\nDue to restrictions on dynamic code execution in the App Store, under iOS Flutter uses AOT compilation[3]. A widely used feature of the Dart platform is \"hot reloading\", where source code changes are applied immediately to a running application without the need to restart it.\nThe main components of the kit are Dart platform, Flutter engine, Foundation library, widget sets and development tools (Flutter DevTools).\nFlutter engine is written primarily in C++, supports low-level rendering using the Google Skia graphics library, has the ability to interact with platform-dependent SDKs for Android and iOS.\nFoundation library[4], written in Dart language, contains basic classes and methods to create Flutter applications and interact with the Flutter engine.\nThe user interface design of Flutter applications involves the use of widgets, described as immutable objects of any part of the user interface. All graphical objects, including text, shapes and animations, are created using widgets; combining simple widgets creates complex widgets. The framework comes with two main sets of widgets - Material Design (Google style) and Cupertino (Apple style).",

You’ll see how to use colors creatively, whether you’re looking for classic web-safe shades or something a bit more vibrant.\nWe’ll also dive into how to style specific elements, like headers and lists, using base selectors. Then, we’ll crank things up a notch with Classes and IDs, giving you the power to take your designs to the next level.\nOne of the most confusing parts of CSS for beginners is the Box Model—but don’t worry, we’ll break it down with simple diagrams and real-world examples. You’ll get to experiment with the code alongside me, using free tools that make the learning process fun and interactive.\nIf you’ve ever struggled with CSS or just want a gentle introduction, this course is perfect for you.

We’ll create our very own mobile 'burger menu' from scratch learning some basic JavaScript & jQuery.\nI am an Adobe Certified Instructor and better yet I work closely with Adobe themselves to develop their own online help videos. I am also a Dreamweaver speaker at the huge Adobe Max conference in Las Vegas. I’m even inside your version of Dreamweaver right now... go on try it... open Dreamweaver > Go to Help > quick tutorial - I’m right there!\nThis course is for beginners. You do not need any previous knowledge in Dreamweaver or web design. We will use Dreamweaver ‘split’ view so we can use all the good visual tools as well as doing some simple amends down here in the code as well.\nIn this series we will take this static design from either Illustrator or Photoshop and together, step by step, build everything in HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. We will make our own responsive design navigation. We will make adjustments so that everything looks great on different mobile devices.\nWe will work with beautiful fonts & colours & even add Google Analytics to our site to get amazing information about exactly who visits your site.  Now web design can sometimes be tricky so I am here to help - just message me if you get stuck. There are also exercise files so you can follow along. I even save a full copy of the website at the end of every video so that you can check yours again mine if you’re is not working quite right.\nLet's get excited about finally being able to build a website like a professional web designer.

An amazing theme that contains a front end editor that makes creating websites easier and faster than ever before! Disclaimer: The Divi theme costs money.\nFirst I will show you how to get a domain name and webhosting. After getting that I will show you how to install and configure Wordpress and get the Divi theme. After installing the Divi theme we will create the homepage using the Divi Builder.\nThe Divi builder is a front end editor that shows the result of your editing immediately. The Divi Builder works with Sections. In those sections you can place rows. Rows can have different amount of columns, and in those columns you can place modules. Modules like images, gallery, text, counter, contact form and more. Using Sections, Rows and Modules you can create your website with ease and save a lot of time im comparison with other themes and builders and editors.\nDivi also has the possibility to import premade pages with a few clicks. That is a real timesaver! So just look at what kind of page you want to create, import a page like that and adjust it.\nBesides the Divi theme you will get access to 80 other themes and a few amazing plugins! You can use the themes and plugins on unlimited websites and even can pay a one time fee so you can use all the themes and plugins inlimited times for the rest of your life! A great choice for webbuilders!\nThis is what other people say about me and my courses:\n\"Ferdy, thanks so much for this! It has helped me put my entire website together :)\"\n\"Hello Ferdy, I would thank you for all your shared videos. You're a very kind person (we can see it through your videos). ...

This is your course.\nCreating a website from scratch can be tedious and quite a nightmare, and getting it online, more of the same. This is why, in this course, you will learn how to modify an amazing template to quickly get results, so you can focus on the things that really matter for you or your personal business.\nWe are not here to learn how to create a website from scratch, but this course is about getting results, getting your website working as quickly and efficiently as possible. And the most important thing, I will tell you how to hire the hosting and how to upload it.\n\n\nIn this course we will go over these steps:\nA light theory about the webpage ecosystem\nConceive your webpage\nChoose the perfect template\nModify the template to suit your needs.\nPrepare the web package\nGet your web online\n\n\nDesign a beautiful landing page for you or your business, with plenty of complements. Become fully independent, owner of your website from end to end. What is the price for a website?\nAdd Youtube embedded videos, images, Spotify banners, tables, downloadable files, sections. We’ll even learn how to implement a php form and get it working. Google captcha as well!\nNo need to master any programming languages or software, everything is explained in a plain way, for all publics. Sometimes we may go slightly technical, but nothing that you cannot handle.\nThe free used software exists for both Mac, Windows and Ubuntu.\nDISCLAIMER\nWe will NOT be using Dreamweaver or other packages, this is not a course on Dreamweaver.\nThe course does not cover, either, a web with shopping cart or so.\nThe hosting service is ALWAYS something that you have to pay, the same way you would buy a photography camera for taking pictures, and the same way you would need your camera for going through a photography course.\nIn this course we will edit the HTML code. Yes, there's black screen, but I believe this approach is a lot faster than learning how to use a new tool like Dreamweaver or so. And it is explained in a way everybody can understand it.\nThis course gives general guidelines for the different templates exposed at html5up. Knowing this, I cannot handle answering every question regarding individual students’ elements. The design is personal and the path to walk is drawn. The course is very complete, and it covers a wide variety of modifications.\nCREDITS\n-FX by kwahmah_02, dersuperanton, goldendiaphragm, tim.kahn, Winamice by Freesound.\n-Background music by Bensound.\n-Picture by Pixabay from Pexels.",

Whether you want to create a blog,  a personal portfolio, or a business website to sell your products and services, you can do it with WordPress.\nWhile WordPress might seem scary from the outside, once you get started, it's fairly intuitive. Everything from hosting to installing a theme, then actually building your first pages can be learned in the first few lessons of this course.\nWith this WordPress course, you don't need to actually pay for hosting to practice with WordPress. I'll show you how to create a free temporary site so you can follow along.\nWhy learn WordPress from me?\nI've been building WordPress websites for years. Just like you, there was a time when I was a complete newbie! I was honestly scared of starting a WordPress website because it seemed so daunting.\nNow I love WordPress! I wouldn't recommend using any other web-building tool.\nI still remember what it is like to be a beginner, and I've kept that in mind while creating this entire course. I walk you through every process step-by-step to make sure you understand things clearly. And if there is ever anything that is confusing, just let me know and I'll create more lessons that explain or walk you through myself.\nWORDPRESS COURSE CONTENT:\nBuild your own beautiful website using WordPress.\nDesign your WordPress website the way you imagine.\nCustomize your WordPress website for any purpose of yours - whether it's a blog, a portfolio to show off your work, or an e-commerce site to sell your products or services.\nHost and publish your website in an inexpensive and secure way.\nDesign pages, menus, sidebars, footers, and create a professional and modern website.\nFind and install themes.\nFind and install plugins.\nBack up your WordPress website in case of emergency.\nGet your website found by search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.\nSet up email opt-in forms throughout your website.\nIncrease social sharing of your posts and pages with free plugins.\nSet up comments and contact pages, while blocking spam.\nSpeed up your website with caching plugins.\nMake your website secure and protected from hackers.\nSet up a membership and / or e-commerce site.\nDESIGN A WORDPRESS WEBSITE THAT WORKS FOR YOU:\nNo matter what your goal is with your WordPress website, I want to make sure you're able to achieve those goals.

I show you step-by-step PLUS give you copy & paste code snippets.\nWatch me -> Copy -> Paste -> Done!\nYou'll learn how to create custom fixed-term PayPal buttons.\nHow to prepare your WordPress site for the S2Member plugin.\nHow to connect your s2Member site with Amazon S3 & CloudFront for added speed & security.\nand much more.\nYou want to create a WordPress membership site...\nBut you are not sure how to properly set things up.\nYou want a powerful and secure membership script that works with WordPress...\nBut you are not made of money so it cannot cost a fortune.\ns2Member is a WordPress plugin – It is FREE – It's Powerful & Secure...\nBut is is so feature rich that all those bells & whistles are too difficult to setup.\nThis course on making\nWordPress Membership sites\nusing the FREE\ns2Member\nFramework plugin and other FREE WordPress plugins is your answer.\n→ No more reading the sleep-inducing blog posts that claim to have all the answers.\n→ No more wading through ancient YouTube videos trying to figure things out.\nThese s2Member Training videos are brand new (2015) and you can get a feel for the audio and video quality by checking out the Free Preview on Lecture 1.\nI’ve been using s2Member in a few of my WordPress sites since late 2011 but only the basics of s2Member.\nI just never found the time to dive in and learn how to get more out of s2Member than just the basic settings.\nOne of my long-time Customers kept asking me about doing a set of training videos on creating a WordPress Membership site & several months ago I finally had the time.\nSo over the last 4 to 5 months I’ve been learning how to squeeze more out of an s2Member site than just putting up secured post and pages & PayPal buttons.\nI knew s2Member had a lot to offer but my goodness, I was like a kid in a candy store with everything I was learning about s2Member.\nAND IT’S FREE!!\nNot only is it FREE but you also get the source code to the plugin, meaning if you are a programmer or you know one, you can customize the code to make it do whatever your imagination can come up with.\nYou might be surprised to learn some people have done just that and charge upwards of $300 for what they created from the s2Member Framework source code.\nNow I’m NOT A PROGRAMER so these s2Member training videos are GEEK-SPEAK-FREE Video Guides.\nThese videos are over the shoulder style videos that allow you to see me doing the actions – not just talk about them. That along with the included exclusive copy & paste templates and code snippets your task of building an S2Member powered WordPress site just got a lot easier.\nOne of my pet-peeves with some of the other training videos, is they assume you already know this or that about the topic and a gaping hole is left in your training if you ARE NOT 'in the know'.\nWhen I make my training videos I assume you are brand new to the topic so I focus on leaving no technical stone unturned.\nIf you are brand new to WordPress & s2Member then you will be able to follow along easily and just do as I do.\nIf you are NOT NEW to WordPress and / or S2Member but simply want to learn more, then some of this will already be familiar & you will move along even quicker to creating your own Powerful & Secure S2Member Membership site.\nThe first lecture is an introduction video to the series. It lays out a brief description of each video.\nIf you have not yet installed and setup your WordPress site then I suggest you start at the bottom of the Lectures where my Bonus Lectures are.\nI have included some basic WordPress install & setup videos in the Bonus section at the bottom of the page.\nStart there then come on back to lecture 2 and move on from there.\nYou may be tempted to jump around the different lectures but they are put together in progression so I suggest you stick to the numbers & go in order.\nBut hey, you have lifetime access so you can always come back and re-watch them however many times you need.\nThere is no time like the present to create your own powerful & secure S2Member powered WordPress site and this course will get you there – GUARANTEED!",

He also updates material as he uncovers new needs.\" by Jon Arbizu\n\"This course saved a project i was working on ... Thank you a lot :).\" by Omåř Ħàny\n\"I was very impressed with how the emphisis was on simplicity. I thought that rather than getting bogged down in the techy stuff the tutor made things easy to understand. I have been overwhelmed with the amount of stuff crammed into ultimatum and it his left me uninspired. Doing this course has made me feel good about the software, it has allowed me to feel I can use it. Thanks Sean.\" by Justin Martin\n\"This course covers anything there is to know about the Ultimatum framework.\nIf you are staring at your screen and don't know where to start? TAKE THIS COURSE!\"\nThese are just a few of the great reviews this course has already received (and which I am very grateful for).\nYou can build a mobile responsive themed website in less than 1 hour using the lectures in this course combined with Wordpress and Ultimatum.\nThe one thing I disliked about Wordpress was that; although you can get MANY themes, to create your own mobile friendly responsive theme you had to know and understand Php, CSS and how to edit those in the theme to get what you wanted.\nThis is not a simple task, especially how the source is set out.\nWell, I discovered the secret. Ultimatum. The Ultimatum framework can be simply used to create YOUR Theme.\nNot edit someone else's but create YOUR theme. Just using drag and drop components. Better still, you can export it and use on other sites.\nTake this course today if you want to understand how to use Ultimatum and you could create your own Wordpress Themed website in less than 1 hour.\nNo editing Php, no changes to CSS in files. Its all done from the interface using Drag and Drop and configuration setup.\nBelow is a little more info on this course if you still need it :\nHave you ever wanted to create your own webpage but don't want to spend hours and hours learning HTML, Php, JQuery and all the other languages and APIs?\nWhat if you could create an awesome website with no code?\nWhat if you could use the power of the Wordpress CMS and create YOUR own theme?\nWhat if that theme creation was just drag and drop and update of parameters?\nWhat if you could then export this as a child theme and load onto other sites?\nWhat if you could use this to create customer websites and become a web developer?\nWell you can. This course shows you how to use Wordpress and Ultimatum 2.7 to create websites using drag and drop.\nCreate custom layouts and themes. You can then export those themes and import into other sites running ultimatum\nUse wordpress and Ultimatum to start a website design business.\nChild Themes created can even be sold to others running ultimatum.\nThis course will show you just how easy Wordpress is while using the Ultimatum Theme Framework\nI walk you through how to put together a page using Wordpress and Ultimatum. I show you how easy it is to get your page up and running. Then using this knowledge and skills you can go and create your own custom theme using the framework.\nAt the end of this course you will know what Wordpress and Ultimatum are. You will know how to install Ultimatum; you will know how to create your own Template and Layout in Ultimatum and have the knowledge to create your own unique Wordpress Website.\nAfter completing this course you will understand how to :\nInstall and activate ultimatum\nHow to create layouts\nHow to add content, posts\nPartial and Full layouts\nHow to create a menu\nHeader and Footer creation\nDo you want to know how to create and use a static page? Maybe you want to add a contact us form? This is covered too.\nSo, if you want to create your page then please start today and start building your dream page.\nUpdates:\n08/01/15 - New lecture to demo the Visual Composer. Visual Composer is a tool to help create your Ultimatum site. This is supplied by the Ultimatum team.\n15/01/15 - New section 7 with 5 new lectures where we quickly create a first website using using the drag and drop techniques that were shown in the course\n28/02/15 - New lecture showing how to change the website background from the CSS configuration. This lecture gives in-sight on just how easy this is to do with Ultimatum\n05/03/15 - New lectures just added on using BBPress and BuddyPress with Ultimatum.

To give some idea of the new things you can do I have created section 6 (at the moment) which has 5 new lectures talking about Ultimatum 2.8 and showing how to change you template, layout and widgets to use this new Bootstrap 3 functionality.\n11/08/15 - I've added 2 new lectures, currently 35 and 36, on Showbiz Pro Plugin.

Learning Sass will not only let you scale styles when working on big web development projects, it will also make it much faster and more efficient to write reusable styles from scratch for smaller projects.\n\nSass is what's known as a \"pre-processor\" language, and it basically supercharges your CSS so you can create flexible, clean and incredibly powerful stylesheets.\nThe entire purpose of Sass is to save you time & energy when styling websites and applications.\nWhy is this a good thing?\nI've done some experiments and I've discovered that you can style websites 150% faster using Sass vs. CSS...\n\nFor example, let's say a custom web design project takes 50 hours to style in CSS (not unusual!)",

      "description": "Introduction\nAccording to Techcrunch recent article in June 2016, Virtual Reality (VR) is the next big thing. Facebook also made the bold move to acquire Occulus Rift, which is a company that designs VR headsets, for a staggering $2 billion. All data indicate that VR is the next big wave of change in the Media landscape. We've witnessed an exponential growth in availability of apps in the decade following commercial production of tablets and smart mobile phones. We can foresee that in the next decade, innovation in VR will also grow exponentially and websites will have a VR version that will allow users to view from their mobile devices+headset. As the hardware is currently getting more popular and sales are on the rise, there will be a demand for VR online applications.\nContent\nThe course was designed to teach the students about the latest technology for developing VR websites and the easiest way to make a start in designing such websites. The easiest technology that a developer or a newbie to use to make VR websites is the A-frame, developed by Mozilla. Although this technology is at an early stage, it is slowly gaining popularity. But it would require more developers to use it and build websites with the technology in order to further develop a systematic design methodology.\nThe first section is about using A-Frame and building on various tags to give the student to knowledge and skills to understand and use varioius objects on a VR scene. In the next sections , you will learn simple animations and use of cursors.\nThis will be followed by lectures on how to use Javascript and PHP with A-frame.\nThe course ends with simple projects such a Multicolored bubbles, Interactive Hotel rooms view and VR shopping page.",

This course will help you get the most out of your CSS skills; you will create more than 25 different shapes, logos and drawings. Some of them are complex in ways that are different from web pages, and the methods we’ll use to solve these creative puzzles are also different. That means this course will help you open your mind to things you never knew you could create with CSS, and hopefully, you’ll learn to see more of the fun, imaginative side of CSS in each lesson.\nA very important heads-up, though: before taking this course you should have basic knowledge of CSS—things like positioning elements on the screen or adding borders and backgrounds.\nThe drawings and logos we will create include some well-known items, like the Batman symbol, Captain America’s shield, Homer Simpson, and logos for Adidas, Brackets (the code editor), Git, Google, Instagram, and Pepsi! We’ll even do some original illustrations, like a camera, a donut, a diamond, a panda, and more!\nDon’t worry, though.

He dives right in and starts building a great website. I don't think that I need to elaborate on how amazing the end result website looks, but the clear, step by step approach and the high definition resolution are things I wish were standard for all other Udemy courses\". - Alex Fisher\n\"Saad, this is an excellent course and I am using it to get my own website designed and then up and running once I finish all the copy for the pages\". - Mike Hulme\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThis course teaches you how to build a professional website, using the popular WordPress platform. The website you'll be building incorporates design elements that are inspired by websites belonging to some multi-Billion dollar companies, such as Apple, Uber, AirBnB, and other big companies.\nJust start this course, and in less than 4 hours you will be able to create the same awesome website we are going to be creating together. Everything is FREE, except for the domain name and the hosting plan, which are needed by every website, but they are also fairly inexpensive. The website will cost less than $12.96 to start, and this price includes the domain registration for an entire year, as well as the first month of hosting. After that, there will be a recurring monthly fee for hosting. And depending on your plan, the monthly hosting fee should start at around $5/month).\n\nTake advantage of what I think is one of the best WordPrss courses on Udemy. This website will be built using some of the most popular plugins, and it will use one of the most popular themes on WordPress.\nIn this course, you will not only build an amazing website, but you will optimize it even before it is launched, so that by the time the site is ready to go live, your site will be off to a great launch. The course consists of 7 sections, containing over 33 lectures. Lectures are easy to follow and the screen-cast was conducted using a high definition resolution.\nYou should take this course if you want to create an awesome website for yourself or your business, but also if you want to get started with search engine optimization, since building the website is only half the battle. By the time you get done, you will have a website that rivals those of well respected companies.\nThis course will be updated regularly to make sure that every bit of information remains relevant, because the digital world is fast moving.",

If so, you should know that learning how to create a blog will be the key to setting up an online business which attracts the interest – and sales – of customers all over the world!\nWhile the idea of starting a blog yourself, without outsourcing the task to a web design firm, may seem a little daunting, you should know that the process really isn’t that difficult or complicated. In fact, thanks to the power of WordPress, which allows for simple and straightforward blog creation, even without technical skills, it’s actually possible to make a blog in the amount of time that it takes to drink just one cup of coffee!\nIn other words, mere minutes are all that will be required in order to create your own blog from scratch! Now, we’d like to share some important facts which will help you to put together a truly wonderful blog. Your new blog will function as a perfect venue for online money-making…\nGet Familiar with WordPress\nWordpress is a blog creation and management application, which is utilized by millions of people all over the globe. The truth is that you don’t need to bone up on Wordpress in order to make a blog with the platform.\nHowever, learning more about this practical and popular platform certainly won’t hurt. In fact, it’s bound to make the process more enjoyable, as you’ll understand what Wordpress is and how it’s used in order to create different themes, palettes and functional elements (such as web pages, blog posts and Widgets)\nCreated in order to offer true “WYSIWYG – What You See Is What You Get” performance, this intuitive and user-friendly interface is the subject of countless blogs, tutorials and articles, all of which are available online. Many people who want to build their own blogs choose to watch convenient and entertaining video tutorials in order to gather skills and step-by-step instructions – you can do it, too.\nBear in mind that Wordpress comes with help features which are perfect for newbies just like you. So, it is definitely possible to explore, to learn and to gain assistance while you’re creating your new blog.\nIt’s As Easy as 1,2,3\nBasically, there are three steps to self-creating a blog. You’ll need to register your preferred domain name and arrange hosting of the domain name and website (Hostgator dot com is your safest bet for domain purchase, domain hosting and website hosting). Once you’ve done this, it’s time for step two, which is all about utilizing Wordpress in order to create the ideal blog for your needs.\nIn order to begin with Wordpress, you will need to enter ID information which is provided to you via your hosting company. This will open up your website and allow you to work within the Wordpress platform. The last step is publishing your new website via Wordpress and your hosting company.\nAs you can see, getting a self-created website up and running is really as easy as 1,2,3!\nYou Can Make Money Online\nNow that you know what’s involved with starting a blog, you’ll be ready to decide if doing so is really right for you. If you do choose to build your own blog, you’ll develop Wordpress skills which will allow you to manage and update your website in the future.\nSo, aside from the small amount of energy that you’ll need to invest, learning how to build a blog has no downside and it does offer tons of advantages.\nMake your online business ambitions into reality.

You'll start off with a design brief to see what direction we'll take to make the webpage better. Then, you'll learn about the importance of picking images and how to remove subjects from the background… like a pro.\nYou'll learn how to create a header, a mega menu, a Call-to-Action (CTA), and much more.\nOnce you've practiced what you learned, by re-doing my web design, you'll use YOUR creative vision to develop a web design for your portfolio.\n\n\nPhotoshop - UX - Web Design Project 2\nThis UX web design project will have you transform an old, outdated, real estate website into a professional design style. The new design was created for a better UX (user experience). This will help the client grow their business by including a call-to-action that prospects will not refuse.\nYou'll learn about irresistible offers and how to create them through a CTA\nhow to create custom hero sections with custom shapes in Photoshop\nhow to use layer masks to show/hide different elements\npro tips for using images of people in Photoshop\npro tips for deciding on what type of photos to include\nhow to use gradients to make your backgrounds more dynamic, in Photoshop\nhow to easily update your client's logo for a more up-to-date and modern look\nhow to increase the credibility of your clients\npro tips on how to promote your client through persuasive writing (or outsource)\npro tips on how to qualify leads through great design\nand much more…\nWhat you'll learn can easily be applied to any type of company and web design. Plus, I'll share with you one of my little secrets on adding credibility and elevating your client's standing in the community. And how to increase the chances more people will do business with your client.\n\n\nPhotoshop - UX - Web Design Project 3\nOur next UX web design project consists of updating another old, outdated website and giving it a new, fresher, modern design.\nMany new tips and web design tricks are revealed in this project. Learn why I chose a sticky menu for this website, why I chose a hidden menu (via the Hamburger icon), how I created a seamless gradient background (from header to hero to the footer) for a modern flair, more pro tips on images, how to work with a third party application as part of your UX web design, and much more.\n\n\nPhotoshop - UX - Web Design Project 4\nIn this UX web design project, the learning continues! Starting off with a large Hero image as the backdrop of the UX design. This image alone will elevate this company's existing brand and distinguish it as a leader in its area. As great as the image is, it could be better. We'll make it better by learning how to remove 2 cars from the foreground… you'll learn how to retouch like a pro.\nThe next part of this web design involves creating a great (UX) user experience by giving visitors exactly what they are looking for. In this case, a place to rent. You'll achieve this by designing a filter in the Hero section that will allow visitors to narrow down their search.\nSuppose visitors are not ready to do business through this site. In that case, they'll be more so after scrolling down to the first section that includes 4 benefit-driven services. You'll learn how to create 4 custom icons from scratch and tips on selling your client to showcasing their benefits. Plus, additional tips throughout for communicating with your client on why you designed the page the way you did.\nThen, I'll give you some UX design tips for quickly and easily adding multiple listings using Command/Control J (Photoshop shortcut). This section of the web design project has a lot more pro tips. One is arranging, styling, and choosing fonts to make it easier to read the content.\nWe're not done with what you'll learn in this project! In fact, I give you 2 services you can up-sell your clients on (you'll put in your design first since it's so easy to do, and then you sell them on it). One of which can put more money in their pocket with minimal effort. Your clients will have a hard time turning down money. The hard part is deciding how much to charge. Which is entirely up to you.\n\n\nPhotoshop - UX - Web Design Project 5\nYour next UX web design project consists of taking an old, outdated, government text-based design and creating a more image-based web design. Why the switch? The \"government\" is trying to sell their location to tourists, and images tell the story better than text. After all, an \"image is worth a thousand words.\"\nYou'll start off with a simple Header and Hero section.\nThen, you'll learn more about typography choices and styling for Photoshop.\nHow the right choice of images is essential, and the wrong choice can be a disaster.\nLearn how to create a pop-up Hover state in Photoshop\nand much more\n\n\nPhotoshop - UX - Web Design Project 6\nOh boy! You're in for a treat.\nThis is my favorite UX web design project! You'll learn something you didn't know was possible… how to find out what font was used from a (flattened) JPG file! Yep, I'll show you where to upload your file, and a computer will crunch its database of 100,000+ fonts and tell you which one was used!\nSo far, most of our UX web design projects have had a modern, clean UX web design style applied to them. Not this time. We're going all out on transforming a plain, boring site with a bold, fun retro design style.\nYou'll start off by creating a retro slider for the Hero section. Then you'll design an e-commerce like body section featuring old-movie posters. All while learning more pro-UX web design tips along the way!\nPhotoshop - UX - Web Design Project 7\nBy now, you've learned just about all my UX web design tips. Don't despair. I have a few more pro tips and Photoshop tricks to share with you in this final UX web design project.\nIncluding how to transform an ordinary, boring, plain photo into a work-of-art via a Watercolor (in Photoshop). No worries. No need to buy a canvas, brushes, or watercolor paint. I'll show you how to do it in Photoshop!\nOnce you've completed all 7 UX web design projects, you'll have mastered over a dozen keyboard shortcuts (that will help you design faster). Plus, if you applied my suggestions, you'll have 7 UX web designs developed from YOUR creative vision and design style for your portfolio. All of which, can be submitted to our Q&A section for feedback or just to show off your new skills.",

      "description": "**UPDATE** See our new course \"Website Design\" - This course covers all the material in this course plus shows you how you launch your own business designing websites.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the course about?\nWeb development - Plain and simple. Everyone needs a website, whether it's to market your business, sell your new e-book, make money through advertising and affiliate marketing, or just for your family. The problem is that it just seems so difficult to create, and so really expensive to get someone else to do it for you.\nTry Google \"custom website design\" and see what you find. You'll find companies offering to design a site for $500, $1000, and more. And don't forget the monthly fee, which can be anything from $50 upwards. So, that's not an option for most of us, unless you have your own private jet - in which case you can probably buy the website design company.\nThe other option is to create your own website. However this sends tremors of fear rippling through your body as you imagine weeks and months of trying to learn Javascript, HTML, XML, and what the 'L. Or maybe you can try and master Wordpress. Some say that is not too hard. Yeah sure! It's also not too hard to do a backflip on a trampoline (or so I'm told). But you're likely to hurt yourself trying.\nThe Web Development Solution - A simple drag and drop way to design a website. This course will show you how to use an awesome online website creator to design the most professional looking site possible. In fact I will start of by letting you watch me create an amazing website in under 5 minutes. Yes, that's correct. It is possible to create a fully functional, professional website in 5 minutes, if you know how! And I will show you how to do just that! By the end of the course...actually by the end of the first section you will be able to create a website in 5 minutes too!\nI'll show you how to develop a website that includes videos, images, contact forms, a blog, twitter feeds, contact forms and more. And you do not need to know anything about website creation, HTML or anything else. It's simply copy/paste, drag/brag!\nWe will also cover other important things (after you've mastered creating your site) such as choosing a domain name, buying a domain, getting images and video, etc. And to really make sure the website you develop is not only awesome but professional and money generating, there is a section where I will share Power Tips from the experts. Tips on getting free resources, making sure your website looks professional, making sure your website is found in Google (Search Engine Optimisation), and even some power tips on how to turn your website into a money making machine!\nWhat kind of materials are included?\nEverything you need for web devlopment will be explained. In fact you will be so good you could even start creating websites for others and making money. The course will consist of some really easy, professional, step-by-step videos that show you how to create your website. I mean professional...both in presentation and recording. This is not just some guy mumbling ramblings into a webcam! Plus there are downloadable tip sheets, and more. This is the ultimate web development guide!\nHow long will the course take to complete this web development course?\nThere are 4 sections to this web development course. After you have done Section 1 you can easily begin building your website. And that will take you just over 30 minutes of learning! Seems unbelievable, but I guarantee it! Thereafter Sections 2, 3 and 4 will extend your ability, in the same easy way as Section 1, helping you create the most amazing website possible.\nHow is this web development course structured?\nThis is an action course. So the course starts with getting to the doing straight away. Sure there is lots of \"fluff\" like choosing domains, and sourcing images etc. which is important, but that is left till later. I want you to get building immediately, and then we can deal with the rest. The course is structured in the following way:\n1.Section 1 - A website in 5 minutes.\n2.Section 2 - Making my website awesome\n3.Section 3 - Making my website professional\n4.Section 4 - BONUS - Making your site famous!\n\n\nWhy take this web development course?\nIf I am looking for an online course there are 3 key things I look for. Firstly, the qualification/experience of the teacher. Secondly, the ability of the teacher to teach/present. Thirdly, the quality of the teacher’s material. So here are my credentials.\nMy Qualification/Experience - I have just completed a PhD in the use of IT for education. I've been involved in IT both as a university lecturer, IT consultant and entrepreneur for over 20 years. This includes starting up multiple businesses both online and offline.\nAbility to teach - In addition to having been a lecturer for over 20 years I have spoken around the world to everyone from business leaders to politicians to teachers to children. But don't believe me, here are what some of those who have heard me say:\n-  \"Craig has the rare ability to engage personally with each member in his audience\" (A. Byrnes, PDM Pty Ltd, Australia),\n- \"Craig is a dynamic speaker, out-of-the-box strategic thinker and professional\" (R. van Rooyen, Associate Partner, Deloitte)\n- “Mr. Blewett is a pleasure to take in. The excitingly focused style by which he speaks keeps you on the edge of your attention.” (C. Stickney, USA)\n- “Craig is an experienced and highly competent teacher and presenter. He has the rare ability to convey innovative concepts in an engaging fashion that is packed with enthusiasm but also logic and balance.” (Dr. Alleyne, UK)\n- \"Craig is possibly on of the most interesting presenters I have encountered. His students love him and in public forums he is unequalled.\" (Prof. Maharaj, UKZN, South Africa)\n3. All the material presented in this course is professionally produced using HD video, high quality audio and specialist video editing software.\nBesides all this, you wont find a better value, easier course that will enable you to develop your own online business website. If you need a website for your company, to sell products online, to launch your e-book, or just for your family - then this is the web development course for you.",

We will use WordPress to build an amazing website that you can easily use.\nThis complete course is designed for DIYers and beginners like you who have never built a WordPress website for business (or any other website for that matter).\n\nNo Programming or technical skills needed!\nHi I'm Chris Heidlebaugh, the instructor for this course! Throughout this course you will learn the exact process I teach my students and clients who have built successful websites using this exact method.\nDon't throw 1000's of dollars away on a basic website when you can build it yourself for almost nothing.In fact I had one client you got scammed for 13k for a basic website. Don't be another statistic.\nI know you have many choices of courses to take, so why take this one?\n\nWell... not only do I own a digital marketing agency, but I'm a college professor, podcaster, YouTuber, author, speaker, and simply and honest guy! In fact I threw in 2 amazing bonuses because I'm so confident in this course.\nIn this course we will be talking about:\nThe purpose of your new website\nChoosing a domain name\nWeb Hosting\nIntroduction to WordPress\nWordPress dashboard walkthrough\nCreating Posts\nCreating Pages\nSaving & Templates\nContact forms\nLogos\nMenus\nPermalinks\nReset WordPress\nand more!\nThis course is NOT a complete WordPress walk through, it's a \"We need a business website to gain exposure for our business, we can learn the details later\" type of course.\nYou will learn the 80% what you need to know right now to get things done. Built your website today, start succeeding, worry about the 20% of random details later.\nAnd what I mean by that is, there is a lot of stuff that you don't need to worry about right now. You need a business website, so we're going to build one in as little as 30 minutes, but typically it could take a couple of hours.\nBut you're saving money, you have complete control, and you have me to help you!\nYou will need to purchase web hosting and a domain name. I show you a few options, but please use whoever you want.\nWe will be going from needing a small business website, to using WordPress to create a responsive, lightweight, and feature rich professional website\nThank you for taking this course and I'm excited for your success!",

These plugins will help with a wide range of tasks from automated internal page linking, adding a Google map, a CSS visual editor for modifying your site design, visitor analytics, eCommerce, and even being able to hide or show Gutenberg blocks based on a wide range of specific, user-defined rules.\nI have been building Wordpress websites for twenty years.  During that time, I've refined my list of recommended plugins for features that all of my sites really need.\nThis course will help you install, activate and configure these must-have plugins on your own website, as well as make you aware of other exciting plugins that are available.",

      "description": "WordPress is a website platform often used for blogs but now powers websites for companies and organizations. WordPress is a simple platform and is easy to use but knowing what options to use when can often lead to confusion.\nI am a website designer with over 13 years of experience. I have been designing websites with WordPress for over 5 years. In 2013, I deployed over 62 customized WordPress websites for Small Businesses and Organizations in my area. With each deployment, came the training. I provided recorded tutorials for each of my clients so they could have something to reference. That is where this course comes into play.\nI want you to completely understand how to use your WordPress Website so you can get the most out of it. You either spent a lot of time setting up your website or paid somebody else to do it, so it needs to provide you value. In this course, I will walk through WordPress section by section describing how and when to use each feature.\nBy the end of this course, you will know everything that WordPress is capable of doing on its own. I want your website to be a successful website and that starts with understanding how to use it.\nThis course is for anybody who has either just setup Wordpress or was just handed login access to a website they had designed by a website designer. If you have had your Wordpress Website for a while and never got the hang of using it, this course will refresh and renew your desire to create good content and share your story with the world.\nSign up today. You can use the Udemy.Com app to view the content on your smart phone or tablet which makes it easy to follow along with your browser as you watch me describe Wordpress features and best practices.\nSome say I am a little long winded with my explanations, however I am that way because I want all to understand. Some aspects of Wordpress are very apparent to some while others struggle with understanding how a certain feature works. Fast learners may want to cruise through the video at a faster pace.",

      "description": "Discover the Secret to Creating Content That Ranks – Without the Headaches\nIf you’re a website owner or a blogger, you’ve probably faced that frustrating moment when your content just doesn’t seem to rank – no matter how much effort you put in. Or maybe your site has been hit by one of Google’s algorithm updates, and you’re wondering what went wrong.\nYou’re not alone. It’s easy to feel lost when there’s so much conflicting advice out there. That’s why this course was created – to give you practical, up-to-date strategies that actually work.\nBut don’t just take my word for it. Here’s what some students have to say:\n\"After the historical introduction of SEO, this has turned into a goldmine of information. I was basically stuck on new content ideas for my niche that I promote. But after seeing all of the components of new content ideas from the ranking websites, I no longer have headaches. I know where to go, and this information is priceless for me.\"\n\"This is a great course for bloggers and for people who want to rank with great content published on their blog. It's difficult to find a course that describes the writing methods and tools so in-depth like this one. Many good recommendations in this and a good way of looking at writing. Be better, write better than the competition, don't just copy the same article. Analyze and plan your own post but make it better, more personal, more technical, or whatever way but make it different. I honestly think this is a good investment for those who want to stand out with their great and original content.\"\n\"As always, the good doctor under promises and over delivers. Comprehensive and easy-to-understand course – I wish I would have had this information 10 years ago.\"\n\"Author gets right to the practical without a lot of fluff. The course moves quickly and is a constant waterfall of info that you can, and want to, use right away. Author knows his stuff and I appreciate the recommendations on resources to help. Recommend it highly.\"\n\"I wanted to take this course because I wanted to see what else Andy knows about creating great content. Andy always overdelivers on his courses. His voice is easy to understand. And if you do what Andy says about writing content, you will have a successful website. Mine is. Most of my content is on the first page of Google. That's because of Andy's teaching.\"\nWhy This Course Works\nThe course kicks off with a bit of a history lesson – because understanding where we’ve been helps us see where we’re going. You’ll learn about key Google algorithm updates like Panda and Penguin that changed everything going forward.  You'll learn why they were introduced, and how they impact your content today.\nFrom there, we dive into the strategies that really matter. You’ll discover how to come up with fresh, creative content ideas that your visitors will love – even before you write them. Plus, you’ll learn how to find and use niche vocabulary that makes your content more relevant and searchable.\nWe’ll also talk about \"link bait\" and \"share bait\" – two powerful concepts that help your content get noticed and shared. And because it’s not just about theory, you’ll get practical exercises that make applying what you’ve learned easy and intuitive.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have a toolkit of proven techniques to help your content rank higher, attract more visitors, and boost your site’s visibility.\nImagine writing content that not only brings in traffic but also sticks around on the first page of Google. This course makes that possible – and you’ll feel confident knowing you’re using strategies that are current, practical, and effective.\nIf you’re ready to start creating content that works, let’s get started!",

      "description": "Building a website is like painting a picture, except you can not see what you are painting unless you publish the page and view it on the browser. Thanks to the Elementor Page Builder for WordPress that lets users see the actual live website while they 'paint it'.\nThe problem with creating a website with WordPress was that until recently the only option to build a website was with a WordPress theme and that is always limited because you have to work within the boundaries of what the developers made. This will oftentimes limit you in terms of features and design options. But, when the elementor was released, it changed the whole story!\nElementor is a visual WordPress website builder that replaces the basic WordPress editor with a live frontend editor, so you can create complex layouts visually, and design your website live, without having to switch between the editor and the preview mode.\nAfter completing this complete Elementor course, you will be able to build beautiful and functional designs without needing to use code or CSS, and without relying on developers for help. The designs that you will learn to create will be responsive by default, which means they’ll automatically look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.\nYou will also learn How to use The Elementor Theme Builder, with which you will be able to design your entire theme using Elementor’s interface, including your header, footer, WooCommerce shop pages, 404 pages, and more. You will also learn how to create global settings that let you easily control the design palette for your entire site in just a click.\nIn addition to designing your theme, you will also learn how to use Elementor Popup Builder to design any type of popup that you can target and trigger according to your needs.\n______________________________________\n\n\nThis Complete Elementor course is divided into 3 main modules:\n\n\nElementor Beginner: Covers Basics of Elementor that includes sections, columns, elements, and a basic website project.\nElementor Intermediate: Covers extra settings like global colors and fonts that help developers speed up their process and reduce revision hassles.\nElementor Advanced (Requires a Pro Version): Covers Custom theme designs that include headers, single and archive templates, popup builders, Motion Effects, and much more.",

New quiz questions were added in November 2016+++\n\"I really enjoyed this course, I learned a lot, the lectures are very informative and enjoyable, Mr. Dawid is a gifted teacher, he can present the topics in a very engaging manner.\nBut there is one thing that the potential buyers should know about this course, you learn many great concepts about using illustrator for web design and designing a template for future projects with placeholders for web content but to practice designing a real website and using those concepts you learn in this course, it is advisable to take another course by Mr.Dawid named \"How To Design a Website in Illustrator\", I highly recommend those two courses together for any one who wants to learn about web design in illustrator.\"\nAre you a web design beginner?\n\nHave you been designing web sites for a while, but never in Illustrator?\nOr maybe you have been using Illustrator for some time, but never thought you could use it for web design?\nStop wasting your time on wondering and guessing.\nThanks to this course you will gain all the knowledge you need start designing amazing websites independently.\nInside you will find unique information on:\n\nHow to transform Illustrator into a web design supertool.\nHow to easily build a wireframe and a website on top of that – fast!\nHow to master desktop, tablet and smartphone web design – all in one file thanks to Illustrator’s artboards\nHow to make your design faster and more professional with a custom, Bootstrap like 12-column grid\nWhat you get is an exclusive occasion to start designing wonderful websites, that you can charge thousands of dollars for.\nAnd yes, you can do that using Adobe Illustrator.\nBut you don't have to take my word for it. Take a look at what Jason Martinez, one of the students in this course, had to say about it:\n\"This course will help out tremendously in getting set up for web design. Takes all the guess work out of the picture and has practical tips to make the process less difficult.\nThis course will save you time! Recommend to any beginner who wants to learn about web design. Also, covers saving in file type(s) before submitting to the client. Awesome instruction.\"\n-\nThis course is for all those who want to start designing websites in Adobe Illustrator.\nOtherwise, this course isn't for you.\nI know, that it is not that common to use Illustrator for web design. Well that’s mainly because developers are simply used to receiving designs made in Photoshop. And that’s ok! Illustrator lets you export files to Photoshop with ease!\n\nSo you get the best of both worlds: design in Illustrator, deliver in Photoshop.\nAnd this goes to all you logo designers and all you dtp designers: you don’t have to ditch Illustrator to design web sites! You can do that successfully in your favorite design tool!\nI vouch for this course. I wish I came across this kind of knowledge, when I was starting out as a designer.\nBut if, within the 30-day guarantee period, you are not convinced, that this course is going to kick-start your web design projects in Adobe Illustrator…\n… simply ask Udemy for a refund, but I really doubt that you will have a reason for it.\nYou risk nothing.\nIt’s up to you now.\nClick that Enroll button and take your first step to creating sensational web designs in Illustrator.\nSee you inside.",

It is a real revolution when it comes to designing and implementing both static and dynamic websites and even ready-made e-commerce systems. With the use of no-code, publishing pages is faster and easier than ever. This course introduces you to the world of web design without coding with Webflow, addressing the most important element - layout. In short, you will learn all the techniques that allow you to create static websites in Webflow, from a blank page. This is a great introduction for those of you who have not dealt with Webflow yet, want to establish your foundations, or create your first website!\nA practical website implementation\nCreate a static one-page site\nLearn layout tools in Webflow\nPublish your website on a subdomain\nStructure and Layout explained\nFrom XD to Webflow\n\n\nWho is this course for\nWebflow is a brilliant tool for all willing to start their adventure with creating websites - simple visual interface, extensive possibilities, hosting, SSL, custom domains - all in a few clicks. Therefore, this course is a good starting point for beginners who want to build a website. However, without a solid foundation of HTML and CSS it's pretty difficult to work with Webflow. That is why I strongly recommend that you do at least the basic HTML and CSS course before Webflow courses. Webflow's greatest potential is for those of you who already understand web technology and are able to create websites. In the hands of such people, Webflow is a tool that incredibly speeds up work and delivering new projects to clients. Webflow is also a great tool for UI/UX designers and web developers who can work and deliver projects in a completely new way!\nModern Visual Editor\nIf you've heard about WYSiWYG - Webflow has practically nothing to do with them. The code generated by Webflow is clean, aesthetic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and its quality is only determined by how well you know the tool and web technologies. Weblflow allows you to create pages in record time, thanks to the fact that you do not have to write code. Most tasks can be done in visual editor while our website is still based on semantic code and modern standards!\nWebflow's Abilities\nThey are practically endless. Apart from the fact that you can create static pages, you also have the option of preparing dynamic websites based on CMS and even complete E-commerce systems, building them from ready-made components. Webflow, however, differs from \"page builders\" - we usually start from a blank page, and thus we can implement completely custom layout. Then, with the help of Webflow - publish the finished website, add domain name, hosting and... violla! Your website is live without difficult configuration. In addition your client can edit page directly in the browser with the help of the built-in CMS Editor!\nWhat you'll learn?\nIn this course, we'll focus on Layout - the basis of effective work in Webflow. This means that we will discuss the semantic elements of the page (HTML) as well as its styling (CSS). You will learn how to use popular CSS Layout constructs such as Grid or Flexbox in Webflow. I will show you how to implement a complete page layout from a blank page, which we previously designed in the Adobe XD course. If you want to learn how I designed the website itself - I refer you to this course. You can rewrite it in advance or in parallel with the Webflow course in front of you.",

I should clearly represent HLD, LLD & focus on the component architecture.\n\n\nHello, my name is Manoj Satishkumar.\nI have attended interviews in 35+ companies and got selected by multiple companies including Walmart, PayPal, Oracle, Tesco, JP Morgan, and Cerner. This is a LIVE session I conducted for all the job seekers who are able to crack the coding round but are not able to crack the design round.\nI am trying to shed light on what are the aspects interviewers look at in the frontend design round.

      "description": "Wordpress for Beginners - A Complete Guide to Wordpress!\nIn 2025, it's never been easier to build a fantastic, responsive website that looks great on computers, tablets, and mobile phones.\nYou can learn Wordpress WITHOUT having to buy web hosting or a domain name.  I'll show you how you can set it all up on your own computer using free tools.\nThe primary goal of this course is to teach anyone, even a complete beginner, how to become a Wordpress guru in a few short hours, without lots of technical jargon.  I'll guarantee that after taking this course you'll have the knowledge you need to build a responsive, beautiful website with the latest version of Wordpress.  Not only will you know more than 99% of Wordpress users out there, but you'll actually enjoy using Wordpress too.\nThis course is taught by Wordpress author and teacher, Dr. Andy Williams, who has been using WordPress since 2004, and teaching Wordpress to people of all skill levels since then.\n\nHere is an email from one student on this course:\n\"Hi Andy,\nI have taken several of your courses (and have a couple that I've purchased and haven't started yet). I just want to let you know how much I appreciate your commitment to updating your courses in meaningful ways (including asking for input from students at times). I also appreciate your notifications when changes have been made or are pending. I have taken many online courses and have never seen this level of commitment to students and to keeping the content up to date and relevant. And your courses are great too! Just know that what you are doing is appreciated.\nMany thanks,\nJan Beasley\"\n\n\nAbout the Course\nThis course will guide you through every single step from installation to finished website.  I'll show you how you can install Wordpress on your own computer for free, so you don't have to pay for a domain name or hosting fees while you complete this course.  Once you've got Wordpress installed on your computer, you will learn how to build and run a successful, beautiful, responsive-design website you can be proud of.\nAfter taking you through all of the main options in Wordpress, explaining what everything does and showing you how to set things up, you can watch over my shoulder as we explore the many tools available to create pages, and build a beautiful site.  You'll learn how to use the Gutenberg editor to create your web page content, but also to edit the headers, footers, and templates on your site, so you can create the design you want.\nI've even got some content you can import into test sites so you can follow along as we build three different types of website - A blog, a business site, and what I call a hybrid site.  WordPress is so versatile, you can create just about anything.\nWho is this Wordpress course for?\nHave you ever wanted to build a professional looking website, but didn't know where to start?  Now you can.  Wordpress for Beginners is a complete course for anyone, no matter what your technical ability.  This course assumes no prior knowledge!\nAt the start of the course, I'll walk you through setting up Wordpress on your own computer so that you don't need to pay for a web host (or a domain name) while you master wordpress.  When you decide you want to put a website online, you can then watch over-my-shoulder as I buy a domain name and hosting, and install Wordpress online.\nWhether you decide to host your site on your own computer, or at a web host, you'll be ready to start mastering Wordpress. We'll start at the very beginning by logging in to have a look around to familiarize ourselves with the main areas of the Dashboard.\nOnce you are happy navigating around your new tools, we'll go through the main features you will need as you create your site, including:\n\n\nThe WordPress editor, called Gutenberg.  This is your tool for building web pages using dozens of building blocks.\nWe'll consider WordPress themes, and you'll have the option of using a newer block theme, which gives you total control over your site design in WordPress's Full Site Editor. Of course, many people still use the older non-block themes, so we cover those as well.\nThe Media Library, to manage your images, videos, sound files and other media you want to share on your site.\nWordpress Settings, and I'll take you step by step to set those up just right.\nWe'll look at the differences between Wordpress posts and pages, and I'll give you a simple way of knowing which one to use on any occasion.\nWe'll look at post excerpts, categories and tags, and how to use them on a well-structured site to maximize visitor experience and search engine ranking benefits.\nYou'll see the two main ways you can set your homepage up.\nWe'll use a plugin to create a contact form so visitors can get in touch. And another plugin to create a Terms and Conditions page.\nWe'll discuss the navigation system on your site, and how you can set up customized navigation in the header, footer, or widgetized areas (theme permitting) of your site.  We'll also talk about internal site linking.\nYou'll learn how to use the Full Site Editor to customize a block theme, and how to use the Customizer (and other tools) for non-block themes.\nWe'll cover Wordpress security, and set up a system that will keep the site safe from hackers.\nWe'll check out some great free plugins.\nAt the end of the course I'll provide some downloadable content that you can import into your own site, and use to follow along three special tutorials.  The first takes you through the steps of building a blog. The second tutorial will show you how to setup a business site.  And the third will create a highly customized site that has features of a blog and business site.  I call this model a \"hybrid\" site.\nThe final section of the course provides some tutorials I created over the last few years to answer student questions.  And if you have any questions yourself that need a tutorial to explain, I may add that too.\nIf you have questions or problems throughout the course, I am always available.  I answer Q&A questions from students daily, around 360 days of the year.  You rarely have to wait 24 hours to get a response.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a website that you are truly proud of.\nJust of few of the many Student Reviews\nThis is a fabulous course, and I would it give it six stars if such a rating were available! Everything is very clearly explained, and Andy promptly answers any question you might have. If you are interested in using and learning WordPress, you owe it to yourself to take this outstanding course. Robert Weiser\nLectures are well-structured with lots of details given. The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and communicates very effectively. I've been able to set up my first website based on what I've learned here. A definite plus is that questions posted via the course are answered quickly! Susan Worms\nI love this course. I have spent a few hours today and I have already learned so much. Really excited about the potential for when I am done. Great Course! A. Luis Acosta\nI learned a lot more than how to use WordPress in basic terms. Andrew shares a lot of insider knowledge and tips that would take you countless hours of doing your own research to learn...and answering questions you may not have thought to ask. Couldn't have asked for a better course to help me jumpstart into WordPress. Nathaniel Stephens\nWhat a fantastic share of knowledge. I really appreciated and loved how a \"real\" site was used for the lectures, real world examples of everything. I would definitely take this course - highly recommended! Glen Schafer\nThis course is perfect for people who want to start a blog or info page with wordpress. He covers all the basics and sometimes goes even a little deeper, to give you an idea what to look for. The provided documents are gold and very helpfull. I can't wait to go public with my site. Thank you for the great lectures. Andreas Lackmann\nI really wish I had access to a course such as this four years ago when I first started dabbling with Wordpress as a hobby in my retirement. The learning process at the time, for a non-techy like me, was painstaking. Andy's course was the ideal step-by-step teaching method. I'm now much more confident about starting a new affiliate marketing website. Leon\nWell delivered, well structured. Easy to follow and logical. Developed my own website in parallel with the course, and had it up and running within two weeks of starting. Looking forward to undertaking a couple of the course developers other courses now. Highly recommended. Steve Laing\nExcellent instructor. Andy is great. He used visuals for everything he say. I was able to pause him and go to my site and test my understanding in all areas that I did know. The results and excitement are fantastic. Esau Khan\nA fantastic course. Thank you Andy. This is a great course and it has helped me start to build my own WordPress website. I was very impressed when I had a problem with viewing my site that you took time to check for me. That shows what a great teacher you are. I have booked up another course by to and can't wait for more. Once again. Thank you. B Brown\nMany of the courses I've been through related to learning Wordpress are either too complicated or the author doesn't spend enough time explaining concepts so that you can understand what's being said. Andy strikes a nice balance with this course in that all the modules are broken up into easily digestible pieces. I like that he takes enough time to explain each new concept or module without being repetitive or using jargon that's difficult to follow. I also love being able to follow along with Andy as he explains each new module as well (as opposed to just talking off of slides all the time). He literally walks you through everything, so it's like you're right there looking over his shoulder. For anyone wanting to understand all the fundamentals of Wordpress, I think you'll absolutely love this course. It will save you tons of time by having all this information in one place. And you'll even learn some additional features like setting up affiliate links (not that everyone needs to know this but I like that Andy included it so it's there if you ever want to know). Truly a fantastic course! Lance Gross\nSuperb Course - Extraordinary Instructor!! Andy's Wordpress for Beginners-Master Wordpress Quicky course is by far the best Wordpress course I've seen. And I definitely wouldn't say it's just for beginners. I'm not a beginner - I thought I knew Wordpress pretty well, but I learned SO MUCH MORE from this course! I've always had a lot of questions about the many settings and various options in Wordpress and most courses just skip over them or tell you to check this box and move on with no explanation. I never really got my questions answered until now. Andy is very detailed in his instruction. He walks you through step by step and tells you what each setting or section is for, how it is used (or not used) and why. I got more out of Andy's course than any other course I've ever taken. He has an extensive teaching background and it is evident in his clearly produced videos. After taking this course, you'll find your confidence level will soar. Carol",

Instead of the terse definitions written for experts found in online documentation resources, or long commentaries to ease novices into programming, this course strikes a balance between succinct explanation and complete visualizations of code so that the key concepts are learned through easy-to-follow examples.\nThis course details comprehensively the practice of making websites responsive to a wide variety of display types and sizes, by covering the main features of the Bootstrap 4 and 5 libraries. The course assumes a prior knowledge of HTML and CSS. If you have worked through the precursor Udemy courses to this one– HTML 5 and CSS 3 Visual Learning– or have equivalent knowledge and skills in using markup for web pages, you will be able to work through the Bootstrap examples in this course.\nNo previous experience with Bootstrap is required. Since HTML and CSS experience is presumed, it is also expected that you have basic knowledge of how to use a code editor, and how to use an FTP client application if your eventual goal is to design live websites that are stored on a web server. Those topics are also covered in my Udemy HTML 5 and CSS 3 Visual Learning courses.",

      "description": "There are over 250 million regularly updated websites on the internet, that look, in one way or another, similar. How can yours stand out in this crowded place? How can you make sure that your first-time visitors have an engaging user experience and come again? And when they do, quickly find what they’re looking for to accomplish their goals? Can you change their mood to the better and use that positivity to achieve your website goals? Or anticipate their unconscious desires and cater to them?\nThis course will enable you to create effective and affective websites that are centered around how human beings work. By teaching you how to take findings in applied psychology into account when designing, it will empower you to predict how people will interact with your website and to take their perceptual biases, motivations, emotional states, and unconscious cognitions into consideration.\nOnly when you thoroughly understand the human mind can you hope to create designs that are simple yet pleasing and engaging at the same time. Psychology driven design aims to help accomplish that, by making you aware, at every step of a creative process, how humans think, feel and act. And the result of it is a product that appeals simultaneously to the intellect, emotions as well as unconscious desires of users.\nSome people refer to this method as “designing for the mind” others as “designing for humans” or even “neurodesign”. We prefer the term “psychology driven design”, because the concept relies on findings in cognitive, behavioral and social psychology to determine, how, for example, the structure of a website influences users’ perception of it; how the colors and types used by its designer affect their mood; and how they interact with it to connect with others.\nThe psychological impact of the design of a website determines if users will trust it or not, if they will feel important, or at ease, or curious and so on. In short, it is the number one determinant of a good or bad web user experience, and regardless of whether you are new to web design or a seasoned professional, if you would like to understand how you can use its power, then this is the right course for you.\n\n\nWHO THIS COURSE IS FOR\nThis course is useful for all web designers, to a great extent also app designers, independent of their level of expertise and years of experience, from individuals who are using readymade templates to publish their first personal conceptions, to highly professional designers who are creating original web interfaces for Fortune 500 companies. This course is very useful even for those content creators, who are not versed in web design at all, but wish to insert some content into an existing web-based platform in an impactful manner.\nThe course is especially beneficial for those who want to accomplish the creative part of designing a website, to then have a web developer do the coding; for those who use ready-made web templates that can be modified by users to quickly personalize them; and of course, for those who are already proficient in developing websites but who can use deeper design knowledge to make their creations more effective. If you are in this last category, this course can give you sound reasons for much of what is felt intuitively, and yet not fully understood.\n\n\nHOW THIS COURSE WILL BENEFIT YOU\nWebsite elements have become more or less standardized, so that by combining them within some context you can quickly end up with a fairly good-looking website. But the problem is, content and design are interrelated. Websites that are based on off-the-shelf themes by themselves cannot claim the kind of relationship that makes a website impactful, as a theme is always built on dummy content. This means that, in order to select content appropriate layouts, visuals, colors, typography etc., to create content that is scannable and shared more, to design user experiences that are gamified and personalized, you do have to master the way to influence the perception of your visitors, whether you design from scratch or use a template. In that sense, learning about psychology driven web design will enable you to:\n\n\nUnderstand why successful websites have been designed the way they have been;\nEvaluate why, in some context, a certain design generates positive emotions and thoughts while another leads to user frustration;\nCreate designs that increase conversions by taking latest findings in applied psychology into account;\nDesign websites that support the quirks, biases and defining features of the human mind;\nDesign displays that support human visual perception and improve the user experience.\n\n\nIn a word, by the end of this course, you will be able to create better websites and be more successful at what you do.\n\n\nMAIN LEARNING OBJECTIVES\nPART 1\nLearning to design with user focus, from goal setting, through user research, defining personas, creating scenarios, devising user journeys and user experiences, user motivations, all the way to information architecture, usability and usability testing, and accessibility issues.\nLearning to take the characteristics and limitations of human attention, memory, perception, language and reading skills, learning abilities, and different types of emotions into consideration when designing a website.\nLearning how to account for perceptual biases of users in order to create websites that are more appealing to their subconscious mind and easier for them to navigate, by understanding the gestalt principles of perception.\nLearning to create perceptual organization using similarity and contrast, visual weights, visual directions, dominance, focal points, compositional hierarchy, flow and rhythm, compositional balance, proportion, whitespace and much more to achieve strong visual hierarchy, simplicity, unity, variety, and consistency in design.\nLearning to use the impact of color on human psychology to convey specific feelings and messages in your designs.\nPART 2\nLearning to create content that is suitable for scanning, better legible and readable, more impactful, socially accepted, and shared more, which are essential skills for any blogger.\nLearning to judge the purposefulness, appropriateness as well as psychological impact of visuals, multimedia, and typography by taking into consideration such issues as the psychological impact of faces and anthropomorphic forms on photographs, the attractiveness bias, the meanings of common shapes, the use of digital arts, infographics, iconic representation, the psychology of typography and much more.\nLearning to take characteristics and differences of individual users, as well as subtle details relating to specific user groups, including culture, gender, age, etc. into account for creating personalized experiences that resonate differently with different psychological profiles, groups and communities.\nLearning to take human time requirements, responsiveness of designs, conceptual models in interactions, the usability of controls into account, and to be able to design effective call-to-action buttons, effective forms, gamification, real-time technology and mobile user interactions.\nLearning to account for the triune nature of the human mind, the inconsistency of the self, the psychology of trust, the psychology of choice, the psychology of decision making, the price and quality perception, the psychology of scarcity and urgency, the psychology of reciprocity and rewards, the effects of social validation, and more generally, for all idiosyncrasies of human psychology to be able to design e-commerce websites that convert.\n\n\nPRERQUISITES\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. If you can browse the internet and know what menus, buttons and links are, you can follow all the lectures. No literacy in psychology is required as all necessary knowledge will be conveyed, in laymen’s terms. However, you must be able to understand English without needing subtitles.\n\n\nTHE LEVEL OF STUDY\nThis is a comprehensive course for students at all levels, from beginner to advanced, where every aspect of psychological influence in web design is dealt with in detail. It is not a quick, one-hour design tutorial, not a presentation of inspirational lists and certainly not a tool tutorial. While someone on their first project can easily follow the lectures, even a seasoned professional web designer can find here some inspiration in terms of psychological impact to improve their work.\nThe course consists of two parts, where PART 1 covers the Fundamentals and PART 2 covers Advanced Topics.\nThe curriculum of the course is completely original, meaning that it does not follow any one book written by a third party. However, the information contained in the over 800-page course script has been checked against 12 contemporary design / psychology books and over 600 pages of design / psychology blogs.\nThe summary of this course is being sold as a kindle book on Amazon. It is provided to all students of the course free of charge.\nYou will receive a valuable certificate that you can add to your CV when you finish this course.\n\n\nTHE TEACHING METHOD\nThis course contains a total of 160 video lectures, 80 in PART 1 and 80 in PART 2, with each lecture having a duration of approximately 15 minutes (some a few minutes longer, others a few minutes shorter). The lectures are organized in 10 coherent content sections, plus one introductory section and one conclusion section.\nThe second section of the course serves as an extended introduction, where the entire user focused web design process is explained from goal setting all the way to usability testing, so that someone with no experience in web design at all can, having studied this section, easily understand the later section. For more experienced designers, this section may appear to be superfluous, but should nevertheless serve to solidify the basis for later sections.\nSections three and four convey the fundamentals of cognitive psychology so far as required for designing impactful websites, with lots of illustrations and always in laymen’s terms. From the fifth section onwards, the lectures are heavily supported by exemplary websites, either screenshots or video captures, where concepts are discussed with the help of design examples.\nAt the end of each section, there is a quiz. However, due to the nature of the subject matter, the quizzes can only serve to reinforce what has been explained in the lectures rather than testing design knowledge. Your actual progress can only be attested to by yourself in the long run through the changes you will notice in your creations.\nEverything you’ll learn in this course relates to creating effective and affective websites. But it is one thing to hear about concepts, yet another to actually implement them in design work. Even though a great many number of examples are shown in the lectures, mastery in design requires practicing and so you will have to do the real work more or less by yourself. There are 82 assignments that accompany the lectures to facilitate a more active learning experience, which are the secret ingredients to the success of learning psychology driven design.\nAll assignments are applicable on any one of 5 web design projects, based on imagined scenarios introduced in the fifth lecture. The assignments, if properly worked on, can take the student from an empty canvas to a finished web design project. In other words, a student applying all assignments on all 5 scenarios will end up with not one but five portfolio-ready website designs by the end of the course.\n\n\nWHAT THIS COURSE IS NOT ABOUT\nThis course is NOT about learning web development using HTML / CSS / Scripting Languages. It is also NOT about encoding, implementing, or publishing an actual website on some platform. This course is about web design.\nThis is also NOT a psychology course. While a great number of topics are covered here that are usually taught within the curriculum of a psychology course, including advanced topics in neuroscience, the emphasis is always on practical design implications of these and NOT on theoretical notions of cognition or behavior.\nPsychology driven design is NOT about the psychology of the designer or designers in a design team or their interactions with other project stakeholders or the design methods they may be employing. The focus here is always on the psychology of the website visitor.\nPsychology driven design is also NOT about hacking people’s brains, or using techniques for manipulating their unconscious mind, or persuading them to buy things they don’t need. It is merely about using knowledge gained about the way human beings work for designing impactful websites, apps and more generally, web-based user experiences.\nPsychology driven design is NOT the same thing as user-centered design. Nevertheless, even though this course is NOT particularly about teaching the standardized user-centered design methodology, or the design thinking concept, it touches upon many of the topics that are usually covered in those fields of study, but then goes way beyond.\nThe applicability of psychology driven design is NOT limited to creation of business websites. It is applicable to all types of websites, from personal blogs to virtual reality-based community forums.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This course also contains our courses \"Gestalt Theory for Web/UX/UI/App Designers\" and \"Color Psychology for Web/UX/UI/App Designers\"\nIMPORTANT NOTE: WE DO NOT OFFER SUBTITLES IN THIS COURSE.",

      "description": "Welcome to Building & Designing Interactive 3D Website with Webflow course. This is an extensive project based course where you will learn step by step on how to build and design an interactive 3D website using Webflow alongside with Spline which is a 3D designing tool. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of Webflow, such as getting to know its main features, common use cases, and I am also going to show you several project showcases created using Webflow. Then, in the next session, you will learn to build 3D models using a tool called Spline, then those 3D models will be integrated to your website later on. After creating several 3D models, we will move on to the project section. Firstly, you will explore all features on the Webflow editing page and you will get to know how to edit the website’s content, upload images, change the design, style, colour etc. Afterward, we will start the actual project. In this course, we will build three websites, the first one is a professional portfolio website, the second one is the product's landing page, and the third one is a website for restaurants. We will start by adding contents and also optimise the SEO, then, we will integrate 3D models that we created using Spline to the website. In addition to that, we will also animate the website and make it more interactive. Even more exciting, we will build and integrate AI chatbot using Orimon AI. This chatbot will help to answer questions from your website's visitors. After building the website, we will be conducting testing to make sure that the website functions as it should and also to check if the website has a user friendly interface. There will be four main testing objectives that we are going to be focusing on, those are functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing. Lastly, at the end of the course, we will explore several business models that you can consider, for examples like starting a web design agency, selling Webflow templates, offering SEO service to website owners, selling design assets, and building an E-commerce store for clients.\nFirst of all, before getting into the course, we need to ask ourselves this question, why should we learn to build and design a website using Webflow? Well, there are many reasons and let me explain these two major reasons. Firstly, as the world economy undergoes a digital transformation, an increasing number of businesses are transitioning to online platforms to sell their products and reach a broader customer base. Consequently, there is a growing demand for the creation of high-quality and compelling websites. Secondly, Webflow stands out as a powerful and user-friendly tool that empowers designers and developers to create sophisticated websites without delving into complex code. This accessibility makes it an ideal platform for individuals and businesses seeking to establish a strong online presence without having extensive technical expertise. Last but not least, acquiring the skill of building interactive 3D websites using Webflow will certainly equip you with valuable skill sets and potentially open up a lot business opportunities in the future\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of Webflow, such as getting to know its main features and use cases\nLearn how to build 3D models with Spline\nLearn how to edit text, add content, upload images, change background colour, font type, font colour on Webflow editing page\nLearn how to integrate 3D models to Webflow\nLearn how to animate 3D models on Webflow\nLearn how to build a professional portfolio website, product landing page, and restaurant website using Webflow\nLearn how to build and integrate AI chatbot to Webflow\nLearn how to create online reservation forms using Typeform\nLearn how to conduct SEO audit using SEOptimer and Semrush\nLearn how to build website using WebWave\nLearn about website testing objectives, such as functionality testing, user experience testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing\nExplore business models like starting web design agency, selling Webflow templates, offering SEO services, building E-commerce website, and selling design assets",

It looks fancy, but it’s not particularly hard.\nI built this course for beginners. You do not need to know how to code or how to edit video to take this class. We’ll start with the super basics. This could totally be your very first website, wouldn’t starting with a video background be a super cool first project?\nWe’ll go through the full process. I’ll show you where to find some video, I’ll show you how to edit it in Premiere Pro. We’ll do cool video effects like blurs, tints and transitions. I’ll show you how to export the video so we can get the file size super small. Once we’ve created our video we’ll build a basic website together and make our video all cool and full screen.\nWe’ll also create a second option where the video peeks in through a specific box.\nIn this course I’ve got exercise files so you can play along. I’ll also save my files as I go through each video so you can compare yours to mine - handy if something goes wrong. We’ll be using Dreamweaver & Premiere Pro but 95% of this can be done in generic web & video tools.\nRemember: I’m happy to help & I’m pretty handy with replying. Also - there is a handy cheat sheet you can print out.\nThe best thing - is that it’s not that hard. But a super awesome video background will impress the heck out of your clients.",
