      "description": "What do C, Go, Python, Perl, Java, Node.js, Git, SSH, Docker, Kubernetes, MySQL, SQLite, iOS, MacOS, Android and SO many more programming languages, tools & platforms have in common? They were all developed on Unix-related operating systems like Linux, MacOS (yes, MacOS IS Unix too), FreeBSD & many others. That means these tools are 1st-class citizens in Unix. Virtually every modern developer will interact with some aspect of Unix in their career whether they're using Git and GitHub or deploying their web applications and services to The Cloud, Unix is nearly inescapable.\nIn this course, we'll teach you the basics of this amazing and powerful operating system so that you can get the most out of it and feel comfortable working with it to get useful work done. There's a reason Unix is so ubiquitous, and by the end of this course, you'll know exactly why.\nWhat's so special about Unix? It's an operating system that was designed by programmers for programmers. It's basically a giant open development platform. Unix doesn't try to hide its programming tools away from the casual user. Those tools are all up front and center, making it easy and pleasurable to develop sophisticated software and test it out on the platform. That's why so many of the world's most popular languages and development tools have been developed on Unix over the decades.\nDo you have to learn Unix to be a developer? No, of course not. But many developers are forced to interact with Unix-related technologies every day without realizing that's what they're doing. As a result, they stumble their way through cryptic-seeming commands and invocations without understanding the underlying technology and the systems and theories on which they are based. If one understands where these commands and techniques are coming from, they become much easier to master and they are much less intimidating. It is at this point that one can truly unleash the power of the tools.\nLet us help you to unleash that power for yourself to take your skillset to the next level.",

Linux command line is a cross-cutting skill.  If you are comfortable with the command line, you can learn a lot of different skills very quickly and with minimal hassle.  After taking this course, you will be all set to work with highly useful concepts such as Linux System Administration, setting up architectures for Machine Learning and Deep Learning, work with systems that enable VoIP and many many more areas.\nIn this course, we will start from scratch. This is a very applied course, so we will immediately start with the command line! We will explain everything through the commands and not bore you with dull slides. In fact, there isn't a single slide in this course!\nIf you have never worked with Linux before (or installed it), this course will show you how to set it up in a Virtual Machine with minimal effort. If you already have Linux or Mac, you can use that too. Then, we will start from zero and get you up to the level of expert without dumping too many commands on you.\nWe take a case study-based approach and motivate why we need the commands we're learning. If there is a command that is typically taught in courses but isn't used too often, we skip it so that you learn only the stuff that will be useful to you.\nIn this course, we aim to give you the feel of the rhythm behind the command line so that you are in the position to understand the philosophy behind the command line and use it to your advantage. Through this approach, we can cover the whole spectrum in less than 3 hours.\nThere is also a real-time chat system in place for students who enroll in this course. With a free signup, you get access to real-time chat with myself and fellow students who are working to complete this course (or have completed the course before you). We plan on creating this network of like-minded experts who can help each other out and collaborate on exciting ideas together.\nWhat will I learn?\nBasics of the command line\nWorking with files and directories from the command line (and understand why you would want to do that in the first place)\nApplying the commands to solve real problems instead of made-up issues\nUnderstand how very simple and easy-to-understand commands work together to solve much bigger and important problems\nKnow keyboard shortcuts that will save you a lot of time and effort when working with the command line\nPerform operations that simply cannot be done in the Graphical User Interfaces\nFollow a case study that shows how the command line can be used to download a complete YouTube playlist (and learn quite a few commands along the way)\nWork with the extremely powerful vi editor and understand why people are so crazy about it (and how it can be useful to you)\nLearn how the professionals make their command lines look cool (and again, learn a few commands along the way)\nAbout the instructor:\n\nTeacher and researcher by profession\nPhD in Security and a PostDoc from Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany\n17+ years of working with computers and 15+ years of teaching experience\n10+ years of working professionally as a Linux System Administrator/VoIP DevOp -- including 5+ years of provable track record on UpWork (with 5.0 star rating there)\nTarget Audience:\nAnyone who:\nWants to know why the command line is a necessary tool for anyone working with computers\nHas never worked with Linux and wants to know what the fuss is all about\nHas worked with Linux or needs to do so but has been avoiding the command line\nWhat you need to know before starting:\n\nNo prerequisites are assumed.\nYou can take this course even if you have never worked with Linux before.",

From organizing digital files and folders to switching seamlessly between applications, mastering these shortcuts will help you work faster and more efficiently.

From one perspective it is a classical stack-based general-purpose language, not tied to any specific development methodology.\n\n\nAda is not like other programming languages. Instead of using symbols or shortened naming conventions, Ada uses readability by using unabbreviated keywords as well as explicit language to minimize misalignment within the code. Therefore,  Ada is very often used in industries where software must run faultlessly and without bugs.\n\n\nAdditionally, it has a simple syntax, structured control statements, flexible data composition facilities, strong type checking, traditional features for code modularization (“subprograms”), and a mechanism for detecting and responding to exceptional run-time conditions (“exception handling”).\n\n\nADA advantages\nHelps you design safe and reliable code\nReduces development costs\nSupports new and changing technologies\nFacilitates development of complex programs\nHelps make code readable and portable\nReduces certification costs for safety-critical software\nADA features\nObject orientated programming\nStrong typing\nAbstractions to fit program domain\nGeneric programming/templates\nException handling\nFacilities for modular organization of code\nStandard libraries for I/O, string handling, numeric computing, containers\nSystems programming\nConcurrent programming\nReal-time programming\nDistributed systems programming\nNumeric processing\nInterfaces to other languages (C, COBOL, Fortran)",

Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager Release 4.5 is based on oVirt, which is a free, open-source virtualization solution. To deploy Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager, you install and configure the engine on a host with Oracle Linux 8.8 (or later Oracle Linux 8 release), configure KVM hosts, storage, and networks, and create virtual machines.\nIn Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager, a self-hosted engine is a virtualized environment where the engine runs inside a virtual machine on the hosts in the environment. The virtual machine for the engine is created as part of the host configuration process. And, the engine is installed and configured in parallel to the host configuration.\nSince the engine runs as a virtual machine and not on physical hardware, a self-hosted engine requires less physical resources. Additionally, since the engine is configured to be highly available, if the host running the Engine virtual machine goes into maintenance mode or fails unexpectedly the virtual machine is migrated automatically to another host in the environment. A minimum of two KVM hosts are required.",

      "description": "Microsoft Windows Server OS (operating system) is a series of enterprise-class server operating systems designed to share services with multiple users and provide extensive administrative control of data storage, applications and corporate networks.\nDevelopment for Windows Server started in the early 1980s when Microsoft produced two operating system lines: MS-DOS and Windows NT. Microsoft engineer David Cutler developed the kernel of Windows NT with the intent to provide speed, security and reliability that large organizations require in a server operating system.\nPrior to the release of Windows NT, many companies relied on the Unix operating system that required expensive RISC-based hardware to run file and printing services. Windows NT had the ability to run on less costly x86 machines.\nA key feature in the NT architecture is symmetric multiprocessing, which makes applications run faster on machines with several processors.\nLater iterations of Windows Server can be deployed either on hardware in an organization's data center or on a cloud platform, such as Microsoft Azure.\nKey features in later versions of Windows Server include Active Directory, which automates the management of user data, security and distributed resources, and enables interoperation with other directories; and Server Manager, which is a utility to administer server roles and make configuration changes to local or remote machines.\nWindows Server 2019 Provides Some new features too like:-\nStorage Spaces Direct\nStorage Migration Service\nStorage Replica\nSystem Insights\nShielded Virtual Machines\nImproved Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)\nWindows Admin Center\nAfter Completing the course candidates will able to learn about Managing, Configuring and Troubleshooting Server 2019.",

This is a programming project course for Undergraduate Students.\n\n\nLevel : This Course is Best for those looking to do some non-trivial project after they have learned just more than basics of any main-stream programming language. Beginners to Intermediate level audience can opt for this course.\n\n\nThis is yet another very valuable Programming based Course Project - Programming Finite State Machines and harness its benefits in your Application. This course assumes that you have done the UG course on - Theory of computation and at-least you know the basics. TOC is completely theory based course, this course is the practical version of it.\n\n\nFinite State Machines are an integral part of computer science and is used in many state driven problem solving.  For Example - Designing an Elevator Software.\nIt is important that we, as a Software Engineer, develop an ability to design and implement commonly used data structures, and FSMs are one such among many. Doing such Project based Courses develop critical skill of translating a real world Problem into Computer Algorithm.\nDo all my courses, specifically project based one, and separate out yourself from the crowd.\n\n\nIn this Course, We shall develop Programmable Finite State Machine Library using which an application can instantiate specific FSM object and use it for FSM based problem solving such as Pattern Matching, Validation or Computation.\nI guarantee, you will love the final product of this Course, and you will play around it like it is your favorite toy.\n\n\nWhatever you learn through my courses, you learn from absolute ground level. This course does not violate the principle and teaches you how to FSM library step by step from absolute scratch - No framework, tools, supporting libraries or anything - just pure programming language of your choice is enough. Emphasis is on learning the concepts, not fancy tools.\n\n\nAlso, Please just do not sit and watch my codes. Write your own codes, even if it is same as mine !\n\n\nNo Third Party libraries\nWhatever logic you implement, you need to implement it from scratch, beginning from #include <stdio.h>. This course do not suggest taking help of any third party library to get the jobs done. Use of external libraries completely defeats the purpose of the course. However, it is recommended to use third party libraries for commonly used data structures such as linked lists/Trees/Queues etc which saves a lot of time implementing these data structures.\n\n\nRefund : This Course is covered by 30 days Full refund guarantee, no questions asked.",

      "description": "Are you tired of Windows? Do you think there must be more? And that it can be easy, sexy and secure at the same time? Great! Because that's true for the beginner friendly Linux Mint.\nIn this course I will show you how you can easily install and configure this operating system.\nWe will start at a very basic level. No prior Linux knowledge is required.\nFirst you will learn how to prepare for the installation, doing this like creating a bootable USB stick and checking the system requirements.\nThen you will dive in with the live system. It allows you to run Linux without installing it. This way you can have a look around as long as you want.\nAnd from there it’s also really easy to actually install the system.\nOnce rebooted and logged in, we will do some basic configuration. You will see that all this can be pretty easy – compared to other operating systems.\nAnd then you will make yourself feel at home by setting themes and appearance the way you want.\nAnd the good things don’t end here: The system comes with a great amount of common programs installed, such as drivers for most devices, a complete office suite equivalent to Microsoft Office, and much, much more.\nSure, there are a few things to get used to: The file system works differently and permissions are important to understand. But don’t worry. We will go that way together!\nYou will also learn how to manage programs on your new machine easily. The software manager takes charge of updating the system components and most of the applications, that can be installed. And there is a wide variety of applications available for Linux Mint: almost 60.000 are in the official repositories. This includes nearly any type of software you can imagine.\nThen I will also help you making your transition from Windows to Linux easier: We will look at common programs and their alternatives under Linux Mint.\nAnd if you want to dive deeper: no problem. There is also a section on the Linux terminal that will help you make your first steps with it.\nLast but not least you will find a section with useful tips and tricks for common tasks, that you will be doing on your new operating system Linux Mint.\nWhat are you waiting for?

This will allow you to easily open a command prompt with the current folder. This saves tons of time when trying to perform some command on the current folder.\n\nTo use it you can download it from our site and run it. The program is a small AutoHotkey script and we provide the source code, so you have full control of verifying what it is doing.\n\nThis tool is completely free!   You will need to provide your email address to get the download.\n\nDuring the course, we also show how you can leverage AutoHotkey,  a free scripting language, to negate the need of working from the command prompt.\nWhile it may be hard to believe, sometimes things are actually easier to fix in DOS compared to working with Windows GUIs.  We cover some networking commands that will help troubleshoot some of the tricky topics.\nWe also show you how you can easily export your DOS window commands to a text file or to the clipboard (both of which are extremely helpful!)\nIf you're having issues with your hard drive we also walk you through how to \"check it\" as well as format it.\nDOS has some pretty powerful commands to copy and move files.  We even cover how to search for files that contain text as well as use a regular expression in your search!\nStart learning DOS today!  We never know when Windows will fail and learning the critical commands ahead of time will save you a lot of stress (not to mention $)",

This can lead to compatibility issues and make it difficult to reproduce bugs and test new features.\nVagrant addresses this issue by providing a way to create and manage virtual development environments that are identical for all team members. This eliminates compatibility issues and makes it easy to reproduce bugs and test new features.\nVagrant also simplifies the process of setting up new development environments, which can be time-consuming and error-prone when done manually.\nBy using Vagrant, developers can quickly spin up a new development environment with the necessary software and dependencies already configured, streamlining the development process.\n\n\nUpdated - Jan 2025",

      "description": "Welcome to Machine Learning for Insurance: Predict Claim & Assess Risk course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn how to build insurance risk assessment models, predict insurance claim amounts, and detect insurance claim fraud using models like XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Logistics Regression, SVM, and KNN. This course is a perfect combination between machine learning and risk assessment, making it an ideal opportunity to level up your data science skills while improving your technical knowledge in insurance business. In the introduction session, you will learn about machine learning applications in insurance and also its technical limitations. Then, in the next section you will learn how insurance risk assessment models work. This section will cover data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection, splitting data into training and testing sets, model selection, model training, assessing risk, and model evaluation. Afterward, you will download insurance datasets from Kaggle, it is a platform that provides many high quality datasets from various industries. Once everything is ready, we will start the project, firstly we will clean the dataset by removing missing values and duplicates, once the data is clean and ready to use, we will start exploratory data analysis, in the first section, we are going to analyze the relationship between age, gender, and insurance claim amount, which will enable us to identify demographic patterns in claim behavior and better understand how different age groups and gender identities influence the likelihood and size of insurance claims. Following that, we are going to find the correlation between body mass index and blood pressure with insurance claim amount, which will allow us to quantify how health indicators relate to the amount claimed, providing valuable insights into health related risk factors. Afterward, we are going to investigate the correlation between smoking status and insurance claim amount, which will help us to evaluate how lifestyle choices such as smoking contribute to higher insurance claim amounts and increased risk profiles.\nThen after that, we are going to conduct feature importance analysis using a Random Forest model, which will allow us to identify and rank the most influential features affecting insurance claim amounts, enabling more focused and efficient model development. Next, we are going to predict insurance claim amounts using XGBoost and LightGBM regressors, which will enable us to leverage the power of machine learning to make accurate predictions and capture complex interactions between input features and claim amounts. Following that, we are going to build an insurance risk assessment model using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, which will enable us to classify individuals based on risk levels, allowing insurance companies to improve underwriting strategies and make informed decisions. Then, we are also going to detect insurance claim fraud using Support Vector Machines and K Nearest Neighbors, which will enable us to identify unusual claim patterns, flag suspicious activity, and reduce financial losses due to fraudulent claims. Lastly, at the end of the course, we are going to test our machine learning models using synthetic data generated by ChatGPT, which will allow us to validate model robustness in diverse scenarios by formatting synthetic datasets into CSV files and uploading them to a Gradio user interface.\nBefore getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves, why should we integrate machine learning to insurance? Well, here is my answer, machine learning enables insurance companies to make faster, more accurate decisions, reducing costs and improving operational efficiency. By predicting risks and detecting potential fraud more effectively, insurance businesses can enhance profitability and maintain competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn about machine learning applications in insurance and its technical limitations\nLearn how insurance risk assessment models work. This section covers data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection, splitting data into training and testing sets, model selection, model training, assessing risk, and model evaluation\nLearn how to clean dataset by removing missing values and duplicates\nLearn how to analyze relationship between age, gender, and insurance claim amount\nLearn how to find correlation between body mass index and blood pressure with insurance claim amount\nLearn how to find correlation between smoking status and insurance claim amount\nLearn how to conduct feature importance analysis using Random Forest Regressor\nLearn how to predict insurance claim amount using XGBoost\nLearn how to predict insurance claim amount using LightGBM\nLearn how to build insurance risk assessment model using Logistic Regression\nLearn how to build insurance risk assessment model using Random Forest Classifier\nLearn how to detect insurance claim fraud using Support Vector Machine\nLearn how to detect insurance claim fraud using K Nearest Neighbor\nLearn how to test machine learning model using synthetic data\nLearn how to handle class imbalance using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique",

The only reason is that after a detailed study of the theoretical part, it is easier for the student to follow the practical part. Many people do not like this type of teaching, but as an instructor, I want to do everything to teach and prepare the person who trusts me and buys my course as well as possible for an exam or some other business opportunity. If you don't have patience and only want the practical part, then don't buy my course, or if you only want to watch the practical part, then skip the theory. Basically, all my courses contain a large number of practical exercises.\nDuring my training and work with students in Azure, I often found that many of them are not familiar with Linux and that this is one of the main problems for them in mastering and understanding certain parts of the Azure cloud. In order to help them learn and to eliminate this deficiency, I decided to create a course on the basics of Linux, the commands we encounter every day and the general understanding of this OS. During the course itself, we will get acquainted with the structure of Linux, we will start from the most basic things, through frequent commands, while the second part of the course is designed to use the acquired knowledge in working with Azure. In the second part of the course, we will learn where and how we can apply Linux, so we will experience it with explanations and labs. If you want to learn Linux and Azure basic this is the right course for you, all you need is a willingness to learn and we are ready to go.\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to work with Azure resources and enrich your knowledge with Linux.

      "description": "This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Linux kernel design and architecture, aimed at equipping you with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. I will begin by covering essential operating system concepts and terminologies, ensuring that you have a strong foundation. From there, you'll dive into the intricate workings of the Linux kernel, learning how to build it from source code and create a fully functional, custom bootable Linux system. This includes setting up a BusyBox user-space environment to complete the operating system, giving you a hands-on understanding of the system's internals.\nIn addition to kernel building, this course will teach you how to develop your own Linux kernel modules, with a deep dive into loadable kernel modules (LKMs). You'll explore how to extend the kernel's functionality dynamically, enabling you to create, load, and debug modules efficiently. The course also delves into key features like kthreads, interfacing with the procfs (/proc) filesystem, allowing you to expose any module / kernel related statisitics to user-space, and also interfacing with debugfs (/sys/kernel/debug), allowing you to expose variables from within kernel-space to user-space for diagnostics and debugging.\nFurthermore, you'll gain experience in contributing to the Linux kernel by learning how to create patches and apply them following the official Linux kernel development workflow. Upon completing this course, you will be proficient in exploring, managing, and modifying the Linux kernel source code, ready to embark on a path toward becoming a skilled Linux kernel developer.",

It is used to improve the availability of software services such as databases, file sharing on a network, electronic commerce websites, or other applications. Sun Cluster operates by having redundant computers or nodes where one or more computers continue to provide service if another fails. Nodes may be located in the same data center or on different continents.\nBackground\nSolaris Cluster provides services that remain available even when individual nodes or components of the cluster fail. Solaris Cluster provides two types of HA services: failover services and scalable services.\nTo eliminate single points of failure, a Solaris Cluster configuration has redundant components, including multiple network connections and data storage which is multiply connected via a storage area network. Clustering software such as Solaris Cluster is a key component in a Business Continuity solution, and the Solaris Cluster Geographic Edition was created specifically to address that requirement.\n\n\nSolaris Cluster is an example of kernel-level clustering software. Some of the processes it runs are normal system processes on the systems it operates on, but it does have some special access to operating system or kernel functions in the host systems.\n\n\nIn June 2007, Sun released the source code to Solaris Cluster via the OpenSolaris HA Clusters community",

These are NOT \"follow along\" exercises to use during the course, but new exercises you can use afterwards to practice the skills using different examples.  People tell us this is a better way to learn because it provides an opportunity to work with new data.\nOur Microsoft instructors are seasoned professionals - they don't just know the software: they've used it commercially and taught it in a classroom environment for years. You won't be in better hands!\nAnd we don’t waffle! Do you want to sit through hours of over-explaining before you get the knowledge you need? We doubt it! So we make sure that everything is covered in easy-to-follow video lessons, and we get to the point so you make the best use of your time.\nThe Introduction course takes you from the very basics in opening and saving workbooks, using the different tabs, working with data and editing data, formatting sheets, reviewing workbooks and creating charts.\nThe Intermediate course starts with file management, encryption and accessibility, before moving on to functions and formulas. It teaches you about using tables, data tools like validation, before moving on to more advanced charts and finishing with SparkLines.\nThe Advanced course really does take you to another level. It begins with grouping, outlining and subtotals before showing you how to perform What If Analysis, use PivotTables, perform advanced tasks before teaching you about HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP functions. If that wasn’t enough, it finishes with one of out most popular lectures: an introduction to Macros.\nFinally, in the Professional course you’ll learn about advanced ways of using conditional formatting, LOOKUPs, more functions and PivotTable tools. There’s a lecture on form controls and templates, and the final section introduces you to User Defined Functions (UDFs) using VBA.\nEach lecture is self-contained, so you don’t need to sit through them all: once you’re at a comfortable level, you’ll be able to use this as your reference library, where you can select what you want to view.\nWe’ll say it again: don’t forget the course workbooks and exercises – downloadable with the first “General Introduction” module at the start of each course – which really enhance and deepen your learning. Remember that practice makes perfect!\nSo although this is offered as a single course, it’s genuinely four courses in one – there are no shortcuts or reduced features. We don’t think you’ll find better value, so why not stop wondering which course to choose, and enroll with us now!",

      "description": "Docker in 2024: The Backbone of Modern Application Deployment\nAs we navigate through 2024, Docker remains a pivotal technology in the realm of application deployment and development. Originally introduced in 2013, Docker has evolved significantly, but its core value proposition—simplifying and standardizing application deployment—has remained consistent.\nDocker's containerization technology offers a unified solution for packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated units called containers. These containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent, allowing applications to run seamlessly across various environments, from a developer’s local machine to production servers in the cloud. In 2024, this feature is more critical than ever as businesses increasingly operate in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Docker's ability to ensure that applications behave the same way regardless of where they are deployed reduces the common headaches associated with environment inconsistencies.\nAnother key trend in 2024 is the continued rise of microservices architecture. Docker excels in this area by enabling the development and deployment of microservices in separate containers. This modular approach allows teams to build, update, and scale individual components of an application independently, leading to more agile development cycles and easier maintenance.\nDocker’s ecosystem has also expanded, with advanced orchestration tools like Kubernetes becoming more integrated into container workflows. Kubernetes, often used alongside Docker, provides powerful features for managing containerized applications at scale, making it easier to deploy, monitor, and scale applications dynamically.\nSecurity remains a top priority, and Docker's containerization provides an additional layer of isolation that helps mitigate security risks. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, Docker reduces the potential attack surface and enhances overall system security.\nIn summary, Docker's relevance in 2024 is undeniable. Its ability to simplify application deployment, support microservices, and integrate with modern orchestration tools makes it an essential technology for developers and organizations striving for efficiency and consistency in their software delivery processes.",

I know we live in the times of clicking, dragging dropping, double-clicking' selecting, and moving the mouse pointer on the screen, But there is another world of Command Line Interface ( CLI ) which is very different from Graphical User Interface.\nEarlier MS-DOS was being used to instruct the Operating System but for ease of the user, GUI was introduced. But if you are a computer geek and looking for learning a new skill your search ends here.\nCMD- Command Prompt\nThis course is for beginners who want to learn Windows Command Prompt. I ensure you that after completion of this course you will have knowledge of all the basic concepts of CMD and also will be able to learn Tips and Tricks for using CMD.\nSo what you are waiting for when Udemy has back\ned you with a 30days return policy also. And you are gonna get a certificate after completion of the course too.\nSo see you in the first lecture.\nThank You, Students.",

A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. For example, AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, and so on, and enables other authorized users on the same network to access this information.\nActive Directory stores information about objects on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use. Active Directory uses a structured data store as the basis for a logical, hierarchical organization of directory information.\nThis data store, also known as the directory, contains information about Active Directory objects. These objects typically include shared resources such as servers, volumes, printers, and the network user and computer accounts. For more information about the Active Directory data store.\nSecurity is integrated with Active Directory through logon authentication and access control to objects in the directory. With a single network logon, administrators can manage directory data and organization throughout their network, and authorized network users can access resources anywhere on the network. Policy-based administration eases the management of even the most complex network. For more information about Active Directory security",

      "description": "Most people have no clue how to enable Apple’s built-in Security for Protecting their Mac. Honestly this concerns me, because it’s really easy, you just need to know how to do it! The built-in free tools are fantastic, but the problem is that Apple cannot ship the Mac with all the different Security options enabled. This means YOU must be the one to enable these Security options, but if you have no idea what they are and what they do, then why would you… That is why this course was made, to help everyone Secure their Mac!\nThroughout the years I have assisted many people with their Mac Security, but what I discovered is that people really need to learn themselves and not just have it done by their Mac Guy. When you take this course and learn it, then go back to it whenever and forever, you gain a feeling of control and understanding of what the Security does and how to Configure it. My recommendation is to always enable the built-in tools from Apple, cause they are great and I recommend it to all my friends and family, which means you should do it too!\nJesse’s personal goals for this course:\nOne Hour Max Course Length - People are extremely busy and I did not want my course to feel like a burden.

This course will teach you from the basics to advance topics of installing, configuring and managing a windows server. I wanted to focus on real world scenarios. Something that emulates a real network with a server and a client computer. That's what I chose Hyper-V as the hypervisor for the virtual lab and Windows Server 2022 and Windows 11 as the Server - client computers. Many of the task in System Administration consist on configuring client - server applications and services. In order to gain competence as a Systems Administrator you have to practice configuring and managing difference services and set the client computer to communicate with the server, that is the bread and butter of a systems administrator. Most of the call you will face when supporting servers and clients computers will involve that scenario, where there’s a client communicating to an application or service running on the server. That’s why I decided to create this course to cover from the basics to more advance topics. By the end of this course you will gain competence in performing the most essential task of Windows System Administration.",

It's a creative art, that requires constant study and learning of the ins and outs of how processes work on multiple levels.\nBut learning the basics of hacking some times is regarded as something too difficult to learn without prior knowledge of certain topics like Linux\nSo this course is for all of you that want to get a very practical \"feel\" of both, with Linux being the primary goal.\nHere is what we will learn:\n1) Linux Basics. Apart from some basic theory, this will be massively HANDS ON:\nWe will use the most famous Linux distribution for Ethical Hacking: Kali Linux\nWe will have a walkthrough of the Linux filesystem to understand what it is and how things work\nWe will learn many commands that go well beyond the very basics. This set of knowledge will offer you an amazing foundation to be able to familiarise with the OS and get comfortable with it\nWe will write scripts. It's not only about learning commands. It's about putting them together to create something meaningful\n2) Hacking basics:\nWe will understand what hacking is and the stages of Ethical Hacking\nWe will learn some of the most important hacking tools and their purpose\nWe will crack our own password among other things!!\nWe will put Linux + Hacking knowledge together to build useful scripts!\nAs part of the above we will have also some theory. Of course the main goal is hands-on, but theory is very important to be able to understand the \"why\".\n\n\nI want to be very involved throughout your journey.

The skills learned today will still be useful ten years from now.\nThis course is created in a logical sequence each covering some aspect of the command line experience, which will help you understand how it works in real time and how it is setup from the Administration point of view and what are the channels in which the connection can help to communicate with the server, much like a tutor sitting next to you guiding you along.\nAnother goal is to acquaint you with the UNIX way of thinking, which is different from the Windows way of thinking.

      "description": "The first question for the freeRTOS on ESP32 lessons is why we need to study freeRTOS. The most important reasons are probably as follows:\n(1) First, it is totally free and open source. You no need to pay any fee for using it in your any projects. And you can get all the source code from it's official website;\n(2) Second, it is a \"RTOS\". \"RTOS\" means \"real time operating system\". It can processes data and events that have critically defined time constraints.\n(3) Third, it is very tiny and simple. The kernel resource files are only three c files. It is very fit for microcontroller which has limited ram or rom.\n(4) Forth, it is well supported. It has been porting on lots of platform, even including xilinx FPGA.\n\n\nThe second question is why we study freeRTOS based on ESP32?\n(1) The first reason is the original SDK software of ESP32 is using the freeRTOS as its operation system. We no need to port it again. We will have a very stable platform to study all kinds of software features of the freeRTOS.\n(2) ESP32 is a very wonderful chip. It has internal flash and sram. It has the wifi and bluetooth function on the same chip. The wifi and bluetooth is a critical function for the \"internet things\" application. It also has other powerful peripheral interfaces, such as, I2C, SPI, I2S, UART, ADC, DAC, RTC, USB etc.\n(3) It also has a very small package size and very low price compared with other similar function chips. It is very easy to DIY products by hobbyist.\n\n\nNOTES:\n(1) All the course examples have been tested on idf sdk ver4.4.1 software. For other versions, the code might be a little different.\n\n\n(2) If you are using one regular ESP32 board, not one ESP32C3 board, you might need to change FreeRTOS running on two kernels to running on one kernel by setting \"Run FreeRTOS only on first core\" in menuconfig.",

PowerShell can automate tasks across thousands of computers simultaneously. If you’ve ever wondered what PowerShell is and what it’s for, this article aims to answer some of the most common questions you may have about Microsoft’s versatile command-line shell.\nOne of the greatest strengths of PowerShell is that data returned in the shell is not just simple text, but actual .NET objects with metadata. PowerShell’s language is open-source and built on top of the Microsoft .NET platform.\nPowerShell is mainly used to manage computer systems. Hardware, software, registry settings, file management, and network configuration are all examples of things PowerShell can manage. In short, PowerShell can manage almost any aspect of a computer system.\nPowerShell’s popularity is due to its simplicity to get started with, but also its versatility. You can manage your computer with PowerShell, but you can also manage hundreds or thousands of other computers in a computer network at the same time using the exact same interface.\nSystem administrators have traditionally been the main users of PowerShell. Sysadmins like it because it helps them perform tasks and do their jobs easier and faster than if they had to work in a GUI application. PowerShell also allows repetitive tasks to be automated by creating scripts.",

      "description": "A DHCP Server is a network server that automatically provides and assigns IP addresses, default gateways and other network parameters to client devices. It relies on the standard protocol known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP to respond to broadcast queries by clients.\n*** if you have any questions or need help you can contact me over my LinkedIn ***\nA DHCP server automatically sends the required network parameters for clients to properly communicate on the network. Without it, the network administrator has to manually set up every client that joins the network, which can be cumbersome, especially in large networks. DHCP servers usually assign each client with a unique dynamic IP address, which changes when the client’s lease for that IP address has expired.\nWhen to use a router/switch as your DHCP Server\nThere are many enterprise companies who are still using DHCP for IPv4 on their routers/switches. This is typically done by the network administrator who needs to get a DHCP capability up and running quickly but does not have access to a DHCP server. Most routers/switches have the ability to provide the following DHCP server support:\na DHCP client and obtain an interface IPv4 address from an upstream DHCP service\na DHCP relay and forward UDP DHCP messages from clients on a LAN to and from a DHCP server\na DHCP server whereby the router/switch services DHCP requests directly. However, there are limitations to using a router/switch as a DHCP server\nRunning a DHCP server on a router/switch consumes resources on the network device. These DHCP packets are handled in software (not hardware accelerated forwarding). The resources required make this practice not suitable for a network with a large number (> 150) of DHCP clients.",

Microsoft revolutionized how we use the computer when it introduced Windows operating system in the mid-1980s by introducing an operating system with a user graphical interface. Before then using computers with black and with screens was a nightmare for ordinary computer users. Microsoft has introduced several versions of OS since then. The supported Windows versions today are 10 and 11. Windows. Windows 10 will still remain relevant for years to come because the basic requirement of windows 11 is not within the reach of an ordinary user, one of the scariest requirements is that it installs on 8-generation computers and above.\nWindows is an operating system tagged OS. Operating is the root of digital computing. It is the first program that Runs on a computer without it other programs cannot Run. It is the operating system that allocates computer resources to other computer applications and peripheral devices. OS keeps track of the files and folders in the computer and helps the user in storing and retrieving them. OS can be likened to the housekeeper the gateman and the overall manager of a computer.\nGood knowledge of the OS is one of the basic requirements for the use of a computer\nThis course is designed to impart the basic working knowledge of windows 10 OS.\nYou will learn to set up a windows 10 workspace by personalizing, and managing storage devices including flash Drives, managing application programs, create and manage files and folders.",

We have used them for a while now to store paper documents for safekeeping.\nBut notice I said paper documents.\nIn school when your professor gave you a writing assignment where were you most likely to write that document?\nHandwritten in a notebook? Most likely not.\nIf i took a while guess i would think you would have typed that document inside an app like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.\nBut the question is these apps are not physical. So, when you finish your writing assignment a week before the due date (Because i know you're a Scholar) where do you save it? Inside a filing cabinet? Most likely not.\nYou probably clicked on file and save as. Once you did that you stored your document on your computer, but where?\nInside the app called File Explorer which is your virtual filing cabinet for Windows 10.\nYep, that's right, a virtual filing cabinet right on your Windows 10 computer.\nIn this (Windows 10 Course: Understanding How to Use File Explorer) We are going to learn everything that we need to know in order to use this app effectively.\nFrom learning how to browse through virtual folders inside File Explorer to how to zip and unzip files (the right way) when you are done with this course you will become a master on how to use File Explorer to help you manage your virtual documents effectively.\nThen while you're at it, you can take your filing cabinet and donate it to charity because you won't be needing that anymore, freeing up more space in your office. It's a win-win. Come join us by Enrolling in this Course.",

      "description": "These days, when virtualization has become mainstream, any physical resource can be sliced, so that multiple users can share that resource in a carefully partitioned way. This enabled much better capacity utilization, and provided a much easier way to instantiate new workloads.\nThe rapid evolution of containers over the past two decades has changed the dynamic of modern IT infrastructure -- and it began before Docker's debut in 2013.\nContainers are a light-weight solution which preserves all the goodness of VMs while increasing performance and improving server resource utilization for varying loads. As the figure shows, a container contains only an application and any associated software – such as libraries – it needs to run, but does not have any OS.\nWhen Docker emerged in 2013, containers exploded in popularity.\nDocker is a technology whose aim is to facilitate the deployment of applications and the provisioning management of the underlying infrastructure.\nUsing Docker containers helps get rid of the infrastructure dependency while deploying and running applications. This means that any containerized application can run on any platform irrespective of the infrastructure being used beneath.\nIn this Course, you'll learn the foundations of using Docker,create and manage Docker images and containers,and explore the Docker ecosystem which consists of several useful tools that will allow you to simplify and standardize your software development process .",

      "description": "About This Course\nAre you the kind of person who learns best by doing? Do courses with nothing but Power Point voice-overs leave you cold? Are you looking to challenge the VMware Certified Professional - Data Center Virtualization (VCP-DCV) exam? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this course is for you.\nThis course offers 16+ hours and 96+ videos in 23+ Sections of of me demonstrating and explaining all of the major features, installation tasks and administrative tasks you need to master VMware vSphere 8.0. In this course, I'll show you how to build, configure, administer, run, and scale vSphere 8.0 from scratch. I'll also show you how to deliver better than 99.99% VM service availability.\nThis course consists exclusively of 100% Hands-on Lab demos videos of a live VMware vSphere 8.0 installation. I'll take you from first-principles (powering on a new server) to a completed, working Compute Load Balancing / Failure Recovery cluster and everything in between. And, this course will provide you with the knowledge and hands-on skills you need to successfully challenge the VCP-DCV exam.\n\n\nWhat Does This Course Cover?\nBasics: ESXi, vCenter installation, configuration\nNetworking: Introductory, advanced vSwitch networking, jumbo frames, pNIC teaming, dvSwitches\nVirtual Machines: Build, configure, right size, deploy, VMware Tools snapshot, hot-plug vHardware\nRapid VM Deployment: Guest OS Customization, cold clone, hot clone, rapidly deploy\nStorage: NFS, iSCSI, VMFS, Multipathing, Capacity Management, Raw Device Maps, Content Libraries\nAdministration: ESXi and vCenter permissions. Infrastructure monitoring with Alarms\nCompute Resource Management: Resource Pools, vApps, VM Cold Migrate, VM VMotion, VM Storage VMotion, DRS clusters\nMaximize VM availability: vSphere High Availability clusters, Fault Tolerant protected VMs\n\n\nI've organized this course into Sections - that focus on the most important vSphere 8.0 topics. Each Section has one or more step-by-step Hands-on Lab demo video(s)... with voice overs to explain what I am doing and why. I cover best practices, things to watch out for, issues / concerns, bugs in VMware's software and much more.\nThere are 6 free-preview lectures (first lecture of Sections 1-6) offering over 70 minutes of free content. I encourage you to watch these lectures to see if this course is for you. You also get a free sample of our vSphere 8.0 Boot Camp Lab Guide PDF ebook.\n\n\nHow to Use This Course\nIf you are new to vSphere, or are wondering how all of the vSphere pieces fit together, start at the beginning to see how it's done. If you are more experienced, jump to the Section that covers exactly the topic you need to know.\nThe nice thing about this approach is that you can use it for many purposes:\n\nLearn how to install, configure and administer a complete, working vSphere 8.0 system\nUse individual Sections or lessons to learn how to do specific tasks (perhaps before you do them at work)\nCompare what I've done in my environment to your environment to see if there are vSphere features that you could be using\nReview your installation.

      "description": "Looking to boost your data integration skills with real-world tools? This hands-on course will teach you how to implement lookup logic in SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) — a critical skill for anyone working with ETL processes, data warehouses, or enterprise reporting solutions.\nIn this beginner-friendly course, you'll learn how to use SSIS to match, enrich, and transform data efficiently using Lookup transformations, cache connections, and SQL Server data sources. Whether you're new to SSIS or looking to strengthen your Microsoft data platform skills, this course provides a clear, step-by-step path from setup to execution.\nWe begin with the fundamentals: installing SQL Server, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and Visual Studio, then configuring SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) with the right templates to build SSIS packages. You’ll also install and connect to a sample database, setting up your own mini lab environment to practice in.\nNext, we dive into ETL and Lookup concepts. You'll learn what ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is, why Lookup transformations are used, and how to implement them in real-world scenarios. You’ll explore different types of lookups, how to write data to cache, and how to perform lookups from cached data for faster, more efficient data processing.\nThrough building two SSIS packages (using SQL Server 2019 and 2014), you’ll gain practical experience working with:\nSSIS Lookup components\nCached lookups and full cache mode\nCreating and running SSIS packages\nDebugging and testing data flows\nReal-world data transformation scenarios\nYou’ll finish the course with the confidence to implement Lookup logic in SSIS as part of any data pipeline, ETL process, or business intelligence project.\nWhat You’ll Learn:\nHow to install SQL Server, SSMS, Visual Studio, and SSDT\nHow to create, configure, and run SSIS packages\nWhat Lookup transformations are and how they’re used in data integration\nHow to implement and optimize Lookup logic using cached data\nHow to use SSIS to clean, match, and enrich data efficiently\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have hands-on experience working with Microsoft’s data integration tools — and the skills to apply lookup logic confidently in real-world data environments.",

      "description": "What is Linux ?\nLinux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work\n\n\nThink about an OS like a car engine. An engine can run on its own, but it becomes a functional car when it’s connected with a transmission, axles, and wheels. Without the engine running properly, the rest of the car won’t work\n\n\nHow does Linux work?\nLinux was designed to be similar to UNIX, but has evolved to run on a wide variety of hardware from phones to supercomputers. Every Linux-based OS involves the Linux kernel—which manages hardware resources—and a set of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system\nThe OS includes some common core components, like the GNU tools, among others. These tools give the user a way to manage the resources provided by the kernel, install additional software, configure performance and security settings, and more. All of these tools bundled together make up the functional operating system. Because Linux is an open source OS, combinations of software can vary between Linux distributions\n\nIn this Course we will learn:\nLinux from the beginning – History and Evolution\nUnix Architecture\nLearn Linux From the scratch\nLinux Directory Structure\nLinux Commands Hands On\nFile and Directory Permissions\nProcesses and Job Control\nLinux vs Unix\nThe Shell\nShell Scripting\nThe Linux Boot Process\nInterview Preparation",

To let your system run smoothly, you need to be able to control what's on your file system. So you need to know how your file system is organized and how you can find files on it. That's exactly what this course is about: finding files. Once you have found files you will want to manipulate them. In the course we show some common examples how to do so. Learning the fundamental concepts of find gives you the power to let your Linux system run smoothly.\nEven in these days of system automation, find is more important than ever. Find gives you the power to explore your system so that you can find what you need to automate.\nContent and overview\n\nSuitable for beginners with some Linux experience, this course teaches you how to tackle some common problems on your Linux file system using the find and friends commands.\nTo ensure that you get the exact same results as the teacher, we start with setting up the course environment. It doesn't matter if you use your Windows 10 machine or an empty machine. Together we will install 3 virtual machines with Linux on it. Our Linux distribution of choice is CentOS 7, hence the 7 in \"7 Linux basics\".\nOn the first Linux machine we do all the instructions, demonstrations and exercises. Concepts are shown on the command line to demonstrate the practical value. You will first hear about a concept in a presentation and right after, it is demonstrated on the Linux machine. We start simple, with exploring the find command. Next, we will use find to manipulate the file system. Some more complex pipelines will be used to achieve our goals. Lastly, you will install a second Linux machine with NFS and a third with iSCSI. These will be used to demonstrate the effect of having different types of file systems mounted under your Linux root file system and how we use find on them.\n\n\nPersonally I like to have a book when I study and references where I can quickly find details. So I have added a course survival guide with information about the video's. It is very useful to quickly go back to a specific topic. Furthermore, I have added quick reference cards so that you can get to the information lightning fast of the commands you have studied in this course.\nHave fun finding files!",

We will first introduce the OS concepts which will then be directly applied to the development of our 300-line mini OS. You will learn about both hardware and software responsibilities from the CPU boot process to scheduling, interrupts, timers, system calls, memory mapping, paging, etc.\n\n\nI struggled a lot myself when learning some of these concepts for the first time in college. It was always hard learning about operating system theory in textbooks without a source code reference. Despite being very interested in the topic, I was not successful in internalizing these concepts the first time around as I didn't have a live example to meddle with and actually see running. This is my motivation for this course - to provide learners with what I myself did not have.\n\n\nI hope you all enjoy the instruction. I would very much appreciate any feedback you may have or suggestions on topics for further content. The best way to help me is to leave a review and share the class link with your friends. I'm currently planning to succeed this course with one on how to fully understand Linux kernel source code (v0.11.0).\n\n\nQ&A:\nYour feedback is always welcome! Once you register my class, you will see each source code file attached. You can also send me messages and make an appointment for the Zoom Q&A meetings on the weekends to let me know your thoughts or raise any questions on the material. Happy to meet you guys.",

      "description": "A virtual machine, commonly shortened to just VM, is no different than any other physical computer like a laptop, smart phone, or server. It has a CPU, memory, disks to store your files, and can connect to the internet if needed. While the parts that make up your computer (called hardware) are physical and tangible, VMs are often thought of as virtual computers or software-defined computers within physical servers, existing only as code.\nVirtualisation is the process of creating a software-based or \"virtual\" version of a computer, with dedicated amounts of CPU, memory and storage that are \"borrowed\" from a physical host computer — such as your personal computer — and/or a remote server — such as a server in a cloud provider's datacentre. A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. It can run in a window as a separate computing environment, often to run a different operating system — or even to function as the user's entire computer experience— as is common on many people's work computers. The virtual machine is partitioned from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a VM can't interfere with the host computer's primary operating system.\n\n\nHere are a few ways virtual machines are used:\n\n\nBuilding and deploying apps to the cloud.\nTrying out a new operating system (OS), including beta releases.\nSpinning up a new environment to make it simpler and quicker for developers to run dev-test scenarios.\nBacking up your existing OS.\nAccessing virus-infected data or running an old application by installing an older OS.\nRunning software or apps on operating systems that they weren't originally intended for.\n\n\nAzure virtual machines (VMs) can be created through the Azure portal. This method provides a browser-based user interface to create VMs and their associated resources.  In this hands-on lab, we will use the Azure Portal to create and connect to an Azure virtual machine. We will log in to the Azure Portal and create a virtual machine. Then, we will connect to the virtual machine via RDP.",

The author had a special interest in finding out the top techniques that with the least effort can give the biggest saving in time, and started implementing these techniques over the years.\nAll these years of hard-learned techniques are now distilled into this compact course, so that anyone with basic familiarity with the terminal get to the productivity and efficiency like a professional linux sysadmin!\nWhat previous skills are required?\nThe course starts from a fairly basic level (you need to know how to execute some basic commands), and goes up to a rather advanced level, about using tools such as screen to manage multiple windows in the command line, and all the steps build consequently on each other. This means that regardless of your existing skill level, chances are high that you can chime in at a suitable place in the course, and start gaining new knowledge by working your way forward.\nFinally, remember that you have a full 30 days money-back guarantee - no questions asked - so if you (against our conviction) find that the course does not live up to the promises, you can always return it within 30 days, and get your money back!\nThis means, we have made everything we can to ensure that you can confidently enroll in the course right away, and be sure not to be dissatisfied!\nKind Regards\nSamuel Lampa, Linux Systems Administrator and Developer",

      "description": "The Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project that provides developers with tools, templates, and methods to create custom Linux-based systems for embedded devices. It's not a Linux distribution; instead, it allows the creation of custom distributions tailored to specific needs. The project is designed to make it easier and more reliable for developers to create and maintain embedded Linux distributions, regardless of the hardware architecture.\nAt the heart of the Yocto Project is the BitBake tool and the Poky reference distribution, but it encompasses various components and tools such as recipes, layers, and classes that work together to automate the tasks involved in building a Linux distribution. Recipes describe the software packages, including where to find the source code, how to compile it, and how to install it. Layers organize these recipes and can be used to separate the cross-cutting concerns, such as board support packages (BSPs), user interfaces, and applications. This modularity allows developers to reuse code and maintain a clean separation between different parts of the system.\nThe Yocto Project supports cross-compilation, enabling the development of software on a powerful host machine that can be run on the target embedded device, which might have limited resources. It also provides an extensible framework that developers can customize to include the exact pieces of software needed for their project, optimizing the size and performance of the resulting system.\nThrough this course, learners will gain hands-on experience with setting up the Yocto Project environment, creating custom layers and recipes, working with existing layers, customizing the kernel, developing applications, and finally, generating and debugging images for their target devices. The course will demystify the complexities of the Yocto Project, making it accessible and practical for developers looking to streamline the development of their embedded Linux systems.",

All basic file / filesystem operations are supported with a module for each operation. We’ll cover everything from file, directory, symlink and hard link creation to reading and writing files to details about filesystem / kernel interactions. There is also a chapter covering how to undelete a file which also highlights potential security issues. With the kernel module, mkfs and fsdb commands, the SPFS filesystem is only 2300 lines of code. The source code is accessible on-line and will be updated every year for new versions of Ubuntu Linux.\nYou will learn the strategy to follow when building a new filesystem. What operations need to come first and which ones can wait until later.\nYou will also learn how to debug the filesystem using a number of techniques from simple use of printk to source-level debugging using gdb/KGDB.\nThe filesystem is very simple and contains intentional errors which help with understanding why the order of operations is very important during filesystem design.\nThe course is supported by a free 450-page online Linux kernel filesystem book.",

      "description": "Welcome to this course on man pages, where you'll learn the ins and outs of the built-in help and documentation system found on Mac, Unix, and Linux-based operating systems.\nMeet Your Instructor\nHello, My name is Jason Cannon, and I'm the author of several best-selling Linux books including, Linux for Beginners, Linux Succinctly, and Command Line Kung Fu. I've also created dozens of highly rated courses that have helped people just like you level-up their careers by teaching them valuable, in-demand skills.\nI've been using man pages since the 1990s, and I've packed all of that valuable experience into this course for you.\nWhat You'll Be Able To Do After This Course\nAfter completing this course, you'll never have to Google what command to use or how to use a given command again. You'll be able to find the correct command you need, determine the exact options to use, and confidently know what the command will do before you run it. And you'll be able to do all this without having to dig through search results or random forum posts that contain conflicting information. You'll finally be self-sufficient when it comes to using the command line.\nCourse Components\nAt the beginning of the course, you'll learn the absolute essential basics, such as how to navigate individual man pages as well as how to navigate the entire man page system.\nFrom there, you'll learn all the conventions used in man pages. If you don't know these conventions, trying to decipher a man page can be overwhelming and the documentation will appear to be filled with random punctuation. However, every single one of those seemingly random characters has a very specific meaning, and you'll learn all of them in detail.\nNext, you’ll learn about order for command line options, and when it matters. Plus, you'll learn the proper way to combine command line options and how to decipher any Linux, Mac, or Unix command you see.\nOf course, you'll put what you've learned to use by looking at actual man pages and by crafting commands based on what you find in those man pages.\nYou'll also learn the rules for writing man pages, including what components, sections, and elements to include. You can use this as a guide if you ever need or want to write documentation for any commands or scripts that you create.\nFinally, you'll learn how to get help for commands that don't have their own dedicated man pages.\nIn short, when you complete this course, you'll be a man page expert.\nThis Course Is For You...\nThis course was designed for anyone who wants to become self-sufficient when using the command line on Mac, Unix, or Linux systems.\nThis course is for you:\nIf you're tired of searching for the right command for your specific situation, only to be left even more confused than when you started.\nOr if you've ever wondered what a command will do when you run it.\nOr worse still, if you've ever been scared to execute a command out of fear of breaking something.\nIf you work on air-gapped systems or on systems with limited or no internet connectivity, this course is absolutely essential.\nWhether you're new to the command line, a system administrator, a security engineer, or a programmer, this course is for you.\nEnroll Now!\nSo, if you're tired of being afraid of the command line or simply want to improve your skills and confidence at the command line, enroll now, and I'll see you in the course!",

I'm an 8yr. accidental DBA and got something out of this course and will take it back to the company. -- JD Mulliken\nThis is a great course about Azure SQL Database. -- G. Begna\nAll videos are filmed in 1080 and all audio is crystal clear!!\nNote: The first ten minutes of every course is free. Please take a moment to watch all the free content. This will help you become familiar with how the instructor will teach the rest of the course.\nAmazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.\nRelational databases are complex. In all of my introductory courses I want to give you a high level look at the product. This isn't a deep dive course. This is a... \"ahhh, that's where I backup my database or limit the user connections.\" This is a... \"ahhh, that's how I install MySQL on Windows\" course.\nMySQL is a full-featured relational database management system (RDBMS) that competes with the likes of Oracle DB and Microsoft’s SQL Server. The RDS cloud implementation is a full featured MySQL RDMS.\nThe basic building block of Amazon RDS is the DB instance. A DB instance is an isolated database environment in the cloud.  A DB instance can contain multiple user-created databases, and you can access it by using the same tools and applications that you use with a stand-alone database instance.\n\nDatabases hold structured data. It’s important to understand the difference between structured and unstructured data. MySQL is a relational database. The data we place in relational database has structure because we define how the data is to be stored using data types.\nIn the relational database, we model data like products, categories, tags, etc., using tables. A table contains columns and rows. It is like a spreadsheet.\nBecause we deal with a large amount of data, we need a way to define the databases, tables, views, stored procedures and other objects process data more effectively.\nThank you for your interest in “The Fast Track Introduction to MySQL on RDS.”\nSee you in the course!!",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Linux and Embedded Linux course by Uplatz.\n\n\nWhat is Embedded Linux?\nEmbedded Linux is a form of Linux kernel which is specifically designed for embedded systems & devices. For e.g. Android, the most popular mobile operating system, is a type of embedded Linux customized for smartphones. Essentially, Embedded Linux is specifically customized for embedded systems. Therefore it is has a much smaller size, requires less processing power and has minimal features. Based on the requirements of the underlying embedded system, the Linux kernel is modified and optimized as an embedded Linux version.\n\n\nAn embedded system is a computer that serves a dedicated purpose involving computation for real-time operations. Embedded systems are all around us in consumer, industrial, telecommunication and even medical applications.\nEmbedded systems can have varying degrees of complexity, ranging from a simple thermometer to modern smartphones. Today, the demand for capable embedded systems are on the rise as modern applications such as machine learning make their way into consumer devices.\nA kernel is the core of an operating system that manages the operations of the computer and its hardware, especially the memory and CPU. In other words, the kernel is the interface between software and hardware.\n\n\nWhy Embedded Linux?\nEmbedded Linux provides flexible, low-cost, open-source environment and gets adapted to specific-purpose microprocessors. Compared to proprietary embedded operating systems, Linux allows multiple software, development, and support vendors; it has a stable kernel and provides the ability to read, modify, and redistribute source code.\nOperating systems based on the Linux kernel are used in embedded systems such as consumer electronics (i.e. set-top boxes, smart TVs, personal video recorders (PVRs), in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), networking equipment (such as routers, switches, wireless access points (WAPs) or wireless routers), machine control, industrial automation, navigation equipment, spacecraft flight software, and medical instruments in general).\nBecause of their versatility, operating systems based on the Linux kernel can be also found in mobile devices that are actually touchscreen-based embedded devices, such as smartphones and tablets, together with personal digital assistants (PDAs) and portable media players that also include a touchscreen. This is a challenge for most learners because their computer experience is mainly based on GUI (Graphical user interface) based interaction with the machine and high-level programming on the one hand and low-level programming of small microcontrollers on the other hand while the concept of command line interfaces is widely unknown.\n\n\nLinux will be a major player in the embedded OS landscape. It emerges as the platform of choice for many vendors of various sorts of equipment. Traditionally, embedded systems are based on proprietary kernels and small microcontrollers but the developments in CMOS technology constantly lowers the price difference between 8-bit controllers and low-power implementations of 32-bit general purpose CPUs. In the same vein, the manufacturers and vendors of embedded systems want to put their equipment over the internet thus requiring TCP/IP and multitasking. Implementing and supporting applications and kernels of this degree of complexity with proprietary software incurs a high cost. Hence, the incentive to replace microcontrollers with general purpose CPUs and in-house developed kernels with a standard operating system is growing rapidly. Thus the ever growing need of Linux kernel.\n\n\nBenefits of using Linux for Embedded Systems\nDesign of communication and application architectures supporting a distributed system in which individual components may drop out and reenter without prior notification\nDesign of services that fits a future home and workplace filled with communicating smart equipment\nMission critical embedded applications need to run efficiently and effectively, thus Linux\n\n\nThis Embedded Linux course explains how embedded Linux systems are developed along with an exploration of the hardware and software ecosystems. The course covers different aspects of Linux and Embedded Linux concepts, command line interfaces, Linux ecology, embedded Linux kernel and device driver development, embedded Linux audio and multimedia, USB drivers. The Linux and Embedded Linux course also explains how to use java for embedded Linux systems, IT OMAP processors, ARM and RT Linux besides covering the new aspects of Linux 2.6, frequently used Linux commands, and more.\n\n\nLinux and Embedded Linux - Course Syllabus\n\n\nLinux - Unix - GNU Linux Command Line\nLinux and Ecology\nEmbedded Linux - Kernel and Device Driver Development\nLinux File System Hierarchy Standard\nEmbedded Linux Audio\nMultimedia in Embedded Linux Systems\nLinux USB Drivers\nLinux for PDA\nJava for Embedded Linux Systems\nLinux for TI OMAP Processors\nARM Linux Specifics\nWhat is new in Linux 2.6\nFrequently used Linux Commands\nRT Linux",

Shell scripts were used for filming, editing, and uploading this video. †\n\n\n❖ This lecture was produced for the same purpose as above.\nHaving been using shell scripts for over 10 years, I know what is difficult and what is important.\n\n\n❖ To be good at shell scripts in Linux you need two elements\nFirst, you need to be familiar with the shell syntax.\nSpecial characters can be used for different functions depending on where they are used.\nFor example, the redirection symbols < > are also used in test statements.\nAlso, in the case of quotation marks, single quotation marks and double quotation marks must be used separately, but it is easy to fail if you do not pay attention to the command when it is linked.\nSecond, you need to remember about 20 to 30 essential commands of Linux, even options.\nThe reason this is necessary is when you quickly construct a workflow using the pipe symbol, you will need to come up with a suitable command to use it.\nWe have to immediately decide whether to use cut, tr, or curly brace expansion.\n❁ \"I made the video with care to make it as easy to understand as possible for beginners to Linux \"  ❤️\nBasic terms are explained using a rich subtitle system and animations so that you can follow the class without difficulty.",

      "description": "In our increasingly competitive marketplace, software developers often need to demonstrate superior software development expertise. In a world full of software development choices, discovering how to create high-performance software also remains an increasingly important part of what every software developer needs to understand.\n\n\nWhy GNU Make?\nWhen it comes to creating vendor-independent soft-wares,  the \"GNU's Not Linux\" (or `GNU`) `Make` and `Makefile` team remain the most popular go-to technologies. Like many, I've used GNU to reliably re-make projects that have been building for decades. -Well after other tools fail to 'make things' like they did once, GNU's Make and other tools continue to 'just work.' Guaranteed.\n\n\nMake Many!\nUnsurprisingly then, no matter if we are creating new software or re-building legacy applications, understanding how to use a Makefile to manage just about any creation activity is a highly sought-after skill set. From dynamically creating documents, websites as well as software, the first step in creating blazingly fast software very often requires using Make!\n\n\nWhy C/C++?\nYet another forever go-to technology, discovering how to create high-performance software often involves using some part - if not all - of the C/C++ programming standard. Not only does every operating system rely upon some part of the C/C++ standardization effort, but every modern, popular operating system supports both C/C++ as well as the GNU Tool-set. -Almost all other programming languages also support, if not directly rely upon the free & open C/C++ community!\n\n\nFrom popular applications, robotics, and operating systems to the Cloud itself then at some point in time everything relies upon software written in C/C++.\n\n\nWhat  Else Will I Learn?\nDemonstrating how to compile, link & test a basic C++ program, the training will also cover the most common set of g++ / c++ operations. Students will create a C++ application, related Makefile, as well as library. GNU's basic compiler, linker, and program-creation process, artifacts, and naming conventions will be reviewed.\n\nBug Busting\nBecause GNU's debugger is important to understand, the operation of both gdb, as well as the graphical xxgdb tools will be explored. Demonstrating how to both include, as well as remove, source code & symbols from your application is also presented.\n\nSymbols\nFinally, students will also learn what `name mangling` is, as well as how to use GNU's tool-set to decipher \"decorated\" classes and function names.\n\n\nYou'll also enjoy practicing what you have learned by completing many hands-on activities!\n\n\nAnd yes, you will understand all of this - and more - in less than a video-hour!",

      "description": "Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is an umbrella term for a collection of technologies used together to create interactive and animated websites by using a combination of a static markup language (such as HTML), a client-side scripting language (such as JavaScript), a presentation definition language (such as CSS), and the Document Object Model.\nDHTML allows scripting languages to change variables in a web page's definition language, which in turn affects the look and function of otherwise \"static\" HTML page content, after the page has been fully loaded and during the viewing process. Thus the dynamic characteristic of DHTML is the way it functions while a page is viewed, not in its ability to generate a unique page with each page load.\nBy contrast, a dynamic web page is a broader concept, covering any web page generated differently for each user, load occurrence, or specific variable values. This includes pages created by client-side scripting, and ones created by server-side scripting (such as PHP, Python, JSP or ASP .NET) where the web server generates content before sending it to the client.\nDHTML is differentiated from Ajax by the fact that a DHTML page is still request/reload-based. With DHTML, there may not be any interaction between the client and server after the page is loaded; all processing happens in JavaScript on the client side. By contrast, an Ajax page uses features of DHTML to initiate a request (or 'subrequest') to the server to perform additional actions. For example, if there are multiple tabs on a page, pure DHTML approach would load the contents of all tabs and then dynamically display only the one that is active, while AJAX could load each tab only when it is really needed.\nDHTML allows authors to add effects to their pages that are otherwise difficult to achieve, by changing the Document Object Model (DOM) and page style. The combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript offers ways to:\nAnimate text and images in their document.\nEmbed a ticker or other dynamic display that automatically refreshes its content with the latest news, stock quotes, or other data.\nUse a form to capture user input, and then process, verify and respond to that data without having to send data back to the server.\nInclude rollover buttons or drop-down menus.",

Here I shall provide almost common issues in real life, what almost users and client-facing issue and how we resolve these issue with a perfect solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope you will enjoy the course\n\n\nWhat is Active Directory (AD)\nActive Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. Initially, Active Directory was used only for centralized domain management. However, Active Directory eventually became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.\nA server running the Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) role is called a domain controller. It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network, assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers, and installing or updating software. For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted username and password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or normal user. Also, it allows management and storage of information, provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy other related services: Certificate Services, Active Directory Federation Services, Lightweight Directory Services, and Rights Management Services.\nActive Directory uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of Kerberos, and DNS.",

I will also teach you about the locate command and its advantages and disadvantages over find.\nThe third section is about grep and regular expressions. I will help you take your first steps in learning regular expressions. They are a very powerful pattern matching tool. You will be able to use them together with grep to select particular lines inside files or on streams received at the standard input. You will see plenty of examples to understand what the metacharacters of regular expressions actually mean and how to use them to match strings.",

While there are no mandatory technical prerequisites, a basic familiarity with everyday computer use, internet browsing, and common technology terms will help learners grasp concepts more quickly. Curiosity about how networks operate, an interest in security, and a willingness to learn are the most important qualities for success. A high school–level understanding of general technology and problem-solving skills can also be beneficial, but the course is structured to explain all essential terms and concepts from the ground up. Because the focus is on theoretical knowledge rather than hands-on labs or configurations, you do not need access to specialized software, hardware, or cloud platforms—only a computer or mobile device with internet connectivity to access the learning materials. Learners are encouraged to bring an open mind and a readiness to think critically about the challenges and opportunities in modern network and cloud environments. Whether you are preparing for further technical studies, considering a career change into IT, or simply aiming to understand the foundational principles behind today’s digital infrastructure, these prerequisites ensure you can start this journey without feeling overwhelmed."

      "description": "This course offers a clear and structured introduction to the essential concepts of network administration and cloud security. It focuses on giving learners a solid foundation in the theories, principles, and key components that underpin modern network and cloud environments—without requiring hands-on configuration or lab work. You will explore how networks function, the fundamentals of securing them, and how cloud technologies have transformed the security landscape.\nIn today’s connected world, both traditional networks and cloud-based infrastructures face evolving threats. Understanding the fundamentals is crucial for anyone entering the IT or cybersecurity fields. Without a grasp of these core ideas, advanced tools and configurations can become confusing and ineffective. This course bridges that gap by ensuring you understand not just how things work, but why they matter.\nBy learning the basics of network architecture, security protocols, and cloud security models, you gain a strategic perspective on how systems interact and where vulnerabilities may lie. The knowledge you acquire here becomes the intellectual toolkit that prepares you for more advanced technical learning later on.\nThe advantages of mastering these fundamentals are significant. You will be able to communicate effectively with technical teams, understand risk assessments, and make informed decisions about security policies. For aspiring network and cloud security engineers, this early knowledge ensures you can quickly adapt when learning real-world tools and configurations. Even for non-technical professionals, this course builds confidence and fluency in discussions about IT infrastructure and security.\nThis course is ideal for:\nAspiring network and cloud security engineers seeking a strong conceptual start.\nIT students and career changers who want to understand the foundations before tackling complex labs.\nManagers, auditors, and compliance professionals who need to grasp the “big picture” of secure network operations.\nLooking ahead, the demand for professionals with both network and cloud security expertise will continue to grow. As more organizations migrate to hybrid and fully cloud-based infrastructures, the line between network administration and cloud security will blur, creating opportunities for those who understand both domains from the ground up. By starting with the fundamentals, you position yourself to meet this demand with confidence and clarity.\nThis course is not about memorizing commands or troubleshooting in a lab—it is about building a mental framework that will serve you throughout your career. Whether you plan to specialize in security, administration, or architecture, the concepts you learn here will be your foundation for future success.",

This is not just another \"online course,\" it is a fully animated, extensive \"Linux Virtual classroom.\" This course will take you to the \"Journey\" of learning a new skill set by following the new methodology of teaching. We used examples extracted from industry requirements, not from boring bookish patterns.\nYeah, We hate them too!!!\n\n\nWhat is Virtual Classroom?\nWe're setting a new trend that will help our learners in staying ahead of the curve. Our \"Virtual classroom\" model provides extensive ranged animation and video options. This will help you craft and learn from interactive content that enhances your ability to grasp and understand your topics of research.\nIn the context of Linux, we prepared content from the best teachers who got years of teaching experience in live classes. We converted their expertise in a model that will help you to learn and grasp complex concepts in seconds.\nIn this model, you will be a part of a virtual classroom and learn complex skills by watching the interaction between different characters.\n\n\nHow we framed our teaching model?\nWe prepared our content by focusing on \"how the human mind learns new skills.\" We consulted different psychologists and framed a new teaching model which can be applied at all levels and age group. This learning framework can be extended up to any level.\n\n\nHow did we make learning easy?\n1. We created fully animated studio-recorded videos instead of boring un-professional videos.\n2. We run the entire course through a storyline, which is divided into multiple sessions. It simulates a movie like visualisation.\n3. We explained a single scenario with numerous real-time examples. Thereby covering various applications of the same concept.\n4. Our \"NO-PPT\" rule helped us, illustrating each example more descriptively and interactively.\n\n\nWhere we focus during teaching?\nThe main focus of this teaching model is on:\n1. Making illustrations more interesting\n2. Repeating the same concept in a different way for better retention\n3. More examples of a single concept\n\n\nBeware, our videos are addictive!!!!",

In the context of C++, IPC mechanisms enable coordination and cooperation among running applications as they share resources and data on various operating systems. Understanding and utilizing IPC can greatly enhance the functionality and performance of applications.\n\n\n### Understanding Processes and the Need for IPC\n\n\nA process is an instance of a computer program that's being executed, which contains the program code and its current activity. In modern operating systems, each process operates in its own virtual address space and does not have permission to access the memory or resources of another process directly. This isolation ensures that processes do not interfere with each other, which enhances the stability and security of software applications. However, there are scenarios where processes need to share data or notify each other about events or changes, which is where IPC comes into play.\n\n\nThese concepts are used for most of the implementations in real life server side projects. In this course you will learn about Shared Memory, Pipes and MailSlots.\nThe downloadable resources are available to help you out to see the real code in action.",

These multiple operating systems can be Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux, or Oracle Solaris.\nThe VirtualBox has two versions, Base Pack and Extension Pack. The Base Pack Consists of all open-source components and is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2. Therefore, it is totally free for personal and business use. We will work around the same version in this tutorial. However, to use the Extension Pack, a license must be purchased for business/commercial use.\nThe VirtualBox tutorial is prepared for students, engineers, and professionals. Beginning with the introduction, you will learn how to set up VM VirtualBox. After that, we will learn to install and set up multiple operating systems on VirtualBox. We will also see how to share between Host and Guest Machine, allow drag-drop, etc.\n\n\nVirtualBox Tutorial – Lessons\n\n\nVirtualBox - Overview\nInstall VirtualBox on Windows 10\nInstall VirtualBox on Windows 11\nInstall Ubuntu Linux (Guest Machine) on VirtualBox (Host Machine)\nIncrease the RAM allocated to the Guest Machine\nCreate a Desktop Shortcut for the Guest Machine\nEnable/ Disable Audio for the Guest Machine\nDelete a Virtual Machine from the VirtualBox\nShare between Host and Guest Machine on VirtualBox\nSet Dark Theme on VirtualBox\nUpdate VirtualBox\nChange the language on VirtualBox\nChange the font size on VirtualBox\n\n\nLet's start!",

This course is designed to give you a deep, practical understanding of multithreading programming in C using POSIX threads (pthreads) and futex, the powerful Linux system call for user-space synchronization.\nWhether you're a systems programmer, embedded developer, Linux enthusiast, or computer science student, this course will walk you through every essential concept you need — starting from the basics and building up to low-level, high-performance techniques used in real-world software.\nYou'll begin by exploring the difference between processes and threads, understand why multithreading is more efficient, and learn how to create, manage, and terminate threads safely. From there, we’ll dive into synchronization tools like mutexes, condition variables, spinlocks, barriers, and advanced topics such as deadlocks, thread-local storage, reentrant functions, and thread safety.\nIn the second half of the course, you’ll learn how to use futex (Fast Userspace Mutex) — a Linux kernel mechanism for fast, scalable thread synchronization. We’ll explore futex APIs, fast vs. slow paths, kernel-level optimizations, and how futex is used under the hood by libraries like glibc and pthreads.\nYou’ll also analyze memory layout, thread stacks, how signals behave in multithreaded environments, and the difference between user and kernel space when working with threads.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be able to write robust, thread-safe, and high-performance multithreaded applications in C — with a deep understanding of what’s happening behind the scenes at the kernel level.",

Your Computer display is turned off, if you have not pressed a key or moved your mouse for a particular time.\nLinux timing subsystem mainly handles two types of timing activities\n1. Keeping the current time and date\na. time() , gettimeofday() and clock_gettime()\nb. Time stamps for files and network packets\n2. Maintaining Timers\na. Mechanisms to notify kernel and user space (ex. alarm()) that a certain interval of time has elapsed.\nHardware Devices\nLinux depends on hardware devices to maintain time. These devices can be basically classified into two types:\n1. Clocks/Counters:  provide precise time measurements\nUsed to keep track of current time of day\n2. Timers: Issue interrupts at fixed, predefined frequency.\nUsed for implementing software timers\nWhat will you learn from this course?\nVarious timing commands: date, uptime\nPOSIX Clocks: CLOCK_BOOTTIME, CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, CLOCK_REALTIME, CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID\nTiming System calls: ctime, gettimeofday, clock_gettime, clock_settime, clock_getres, times, getrusage\nSetting time from userspace\nHow to measure time for a particular instruction\nHardware Devices used in timing measurement: RTC, TSC, Programmable Interval Timer, APIC, High Precision Event Timer\nJiffies\nLow Resolution and High Resolution Timers\nThis course comes with a 30 day money back guaranteed!.

      "description": "* Updated for the 2024 CISSP curriculum *\nWelcome, I am Thor Pedersen, and I am here to help you pass your CISSP certification.\nWith over 700,000 enrollments from 201 countries, my CISSP, CISM, and Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) courses are both the “Best Selling” and “Highest Rated” here on Udemy.\nIn this course I will cover how to approach practice tests, how to deconstruct practice questions, time management, how to make your own CISSP study plan, and finally you get 125 COMPLEX CISSP questions in a full CISSP practice test.\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam questions do.\n\n\nHow are Complex questions different than Hard questions?\nComplex Questions: Involve multiple competing requirements; require evaluating, prioritizing, and balancing different factors to pick the right answer.\nHard Questions: Require deep knowledge and attention to subtle answer differences to pick the right answer.\n\n\nGetting your CISSP certification now is a very smart career move.\n1. The CISSP certification is the gold standard for IT Security certifications.\n2. There are more than 82,000 job openings for CISSPs in the US.\n3. The average CISSP salary in the US is over USD147,000 a year.\n\n\nWhat our other students are saying about my CISSP courses:\nI passed the CISSP with the ISC Book and Thor's lectures and practice questions. Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of the test, you will get an explanation for each question and explaining to why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does.\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions\nAsset Security – 13 questions\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions\n\nI recommend students to do 1,500-3,000 easy/mid CISSP practice questions and 1,000-1,500 HARD/COMPLEX CISSP practice questions before the exam.\nI think learning how to balance competing requirements is critical for passing your CISSP exam, I designed these questions to teach you exactly that.\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it. This is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right and answering from an IT Security manager's point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.\nOn hard questions you will score lower. It is normal to score 80%+ on easy/mid questions and 50-60% on hard/complex questions.\nThe point of all questions is to find the gaps in your knowledge, learn how to deconstruct questions, argue WHY the answer you chose is the RIGHT answer in this scenario, making you ready for exam day.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nYou'll Also Get:\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days no questions asked, money back guarantee.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

      "description": "What is Linux ?\nLinux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work\nThink about an OS like a car engine. An engine can run on its own, but it becomes a functional car when it’s connected with a transmission, axles, and wheels. Without the engine running properly, the rest of the car won’t work\n\n\nHow does Linux work?\nLinux was designed to be similar to UNIX, but has evolved to run on a wide variety of hardware from phones to supercomputers. Every Linux-based OS involves the Linux kernel—which manages hardware resources—and a set of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system\nThe OS includes some common core components, like the GNU tools, among others. These tools give the user a way to manage the resources provided by the kernel, install additional software, configure performance and security settings, and more. All of these tools bundled together make up the functional operating system. Because Linux is an open source OS, combinations of software can vary between Linux distributions\n\nIn this Course we will learn:\nLinux from the beginning – History and Evolution\nUnix Architecture\nLearn Linux From the scratch\nLinux Directory Structure\nLinux Commands Hands On\nFile and Directory Permissions\nProcesses and Job Control\nLinux vs Unix\nThe Shell\nShell Scripting\nThe Linux Boot Process\nInterview Preparation",

      "description": "Cloud Computing is an exciting and ever changing environment and while at first it was simply moving the physical servers into the cloud it evolved and now we have plenty of products and frameworks that we can use to create applications.\nOne of the recent innovations is the Serverless Architecture, where the goal is to make it so that developers don't have to deal with the pain and costs of maintaining a cloud server (e.g keep the server updated, manage server capacity). The idea is that you as developer are abstracted from all the server logic and just focus on what matters, your code and your logic while ignoring everything that is the server responsibility.\nThis concept spawned a whole new ecosystem of both products and frameworks and this course aims to bring a light into this new way of building applications.\nWith a clear goal in mind we will learn about the products, how they operate and their differences from the non serverless products, what they are used for and how we can set them up. Then we will work our way into developing a Serverless Application and deploy into AWS. We will build a demo of Trello, which is an app that is used to keep track of tasks that we have to do.\nSpecifically you will learn:\nUnderstand the serverless ecosystem and how it can save you costs and headaches.\nUse Serverless Application Model (SAM) to create serverless application.\nUtilize Infrastructure as code (IaC) to create automatically all the resources necessary to run the application.\nUse serverless databases (Aurora Serverless with MySQL) and how they differ from normal databases.\nHow to build real-world application fully built on top of serverless products.\nWhether you are a beggining with cloud computing or an AWS season veteran I believe you will find value in this course, you will learn how to architect Serverless apps and learn how to build a real-world application that you can use in future work.\n\n\nThis course also comes with:\nA responsive instructor in the Q&A Section.\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download.\nUdemy's 30 Day \"No Questions Asked\" Money Back Guarantee.\n\n\nIf you get stuck you can benefit from fast and direct support.

This book helps you learn the invaluable and extremely useful C shell fundamentals and scripting quickly.\nLearn something new. Learn C shell scripting and you will discover a path much easier to traverse. There are many excellent BASH shell scripting resources, but the huge content is overwhelming to new students, system administrators and general learners trying to automate their processes. This course goes in detail but in a manner that is gentle. You will find it easy to build upon the knowledge gained after going through the course. For instance, variables and operators are nearly the same in BASH shell. It is also a myth that BASH shell is used more than the C shell, engineering firms noted for accuracy in this work use the C shell. Why would such verticals use the C shell? Because it is much easier to learn. This course is based on my book “Learn C Shell Scripting Gently”. The book, however, goes in-depth and is attached to the course free of cost. I would request you to avail of this opportunity and read the book, it would be beneficial for you. The course and the book go in tandem to give you sustained and usable knowledge based on my experience of nearly 25 years. I hope you enjoy the journey.",

NAS devices are also not that different from each other.\n\n\nIssues related to security are the same. There is a need to block attacked accounts, use strong passwords, give users only those privileges that they need to do their jobs and nothing more. Popular Attacks use similar vectors, and it's good to know what to do to make hackers' life a little bit harder.\n\n\nIf you aren't going to make copies inside your company, that will mean that you are really a \"tough girl\" or \"tough guy\".

While there are at least a hand full of OSINT virtual machines that are prebuilt, having one that is tailored to our unique needs and is built and configured from the \"ground up\" by us will not only give us a deeper understanding of our new OS, but also streamlined to our own unique needs and preferences. We will be covering What Virtualbox and virtualization is, installing Virtualbox, installing Debian Linux, updating, basic commands, installing various OSINT tool and why, and more.\nThis course is not a OSINT Primer, we will not be going over the how's and why for OSINT in this course. If you are looking for learning OSINT I suggest checking out my OSINT: Open-Source Intelligence course.\nAlso if you are coming from my OSINT 1 or OSINT 2 course we are going to be installing largely the same software that we used in those courses to build this machine. I just want to make that clear so you can make a more informed decision about this course.\nIf you have any questions or problems please feel free to contact me, even if you didn't purchase this course or haven't started or even finished it. I am always happy to help if I can.\nAlso I have no direct affiliation with any site(s) , software, or groups/companies presented in this course.\nThank you for checking out this course and happy hunting!",

After that, iOS reverse engineering theories based on Objective-C and ARM assembly are explained in a methodological way, pointing out the core of the book.

      "description": "JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, un-typed and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMA Script language specification. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\nThe ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications. Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.\nEvery major web browser has built-in web development tools, including a JavaScript debugger.\nStatic program analysis tools, such as ESLint and JSLint, scan JavaScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines.\nSome browsers have built-in profilers. Stand-alone profiling libraries have also been created, such as benchmark.js and jsbench.[94][95]\nMany text editors have syntax highlighting support for JavaScript code.\nJavaScript is the dominant client-side language of the Web, and many websites are script-heavy. Thus transpilers have been created to convert code written in other languages, which can aid the development process.",

You don't need any previous experience with Linux or DVR systems; I'll show you how to install a powerful operating system called Mythbuntu. It's a fusion of Ubuntu Linux and a popular, open-source DVR program called MythTV.\nPLEASE NOTE: This course requires that you have a spare computer (to use as the DVR) with a TV tuner card. You'll also need a digital TV antenna. The course will not teach you how to build a computer, but I will help you install your tuner card if necessary.\nOnce you have the necessary hardware, installing Mythbuntu will be quick and easy with my step-by-step instructions. You'll be watching TV in no time!\nIf you have questions about anything, I am here to help you. So, just ask!

Once everything is configured, you'll have a reliable DVR system that will run for years, is fully customizable, and easy to upgrade!\nYou can also play DVD movies, view picture slideshows, listen to internet radio, and watch videos with MythTV!\nIMPORTANT: This course covers digital (over-the-air) television capture and streaming ONLY. Cable and satellite signals are encrypted and it is illegal in many locations to even attempt to decrypt them. I will NOT teach you how to do this, as it is against the law where I live and I do not condone illegal behavior.\nGet started today!

      "description": "This Course Is An Affordable Alternative to Official VMware vSphere 7.0 Training\nDo you need to ramp up on VMware vSphere 7.0 quickly and efficiently? Do you need thorough, detailed and in-depth training that covers both the theoretical and practical sides of vSphere 7.0? If so, you've probably looked at official VMware vSphere training - only to be put off by the price...\n\nQ: What do you do if you need in depth VMware vSphere 7.0 training, but can't afford the $4,000+ cost of an official VMware VMware vSphere Install, Configure, Manage [v7.0] class or the $6,000+ cost of an official VMware vSphere Fast Track [v7.0] training class?\nA: Sign up for this course instead!\nThis course (the second in a 3-part series) was originally developed as a 5-day intensive VMware vSphere 7.0 boot camp class.

This means that you will need to use these different tools together yourself, and this can be difficult to use them in a real world context.\nIn this course we will be making a hands on deployment of an E-commerce Node API application with a custom SSL domain using a combination of the deployments tools that are available. These include:\n\n\nGit Version control\nLinux\nBash Scripts\nTerraform\nDocker\nPacker\nContinuous Integration - GitHub Actions\nAWS\nWe're going to use all of these tools together to make an automated deployment without any manual steps such as configuring infrastructure resources in the UI console. We're also going to have the advantage of versioning our infrastructure in Git, which means that should there be any issues we can simply roll back the infrastructure deployed to a previous state very easily.",

Even across an ever increasing number of operating systems!\n\nBecause standards matter, Python 4000: Linux Commands & DevOps Automation starts by defining the various type of standards we need to be aware of.\n\n\nPOSIX?\nDiscussing cross-platform DevOps automation often requires us to appreciate the formal standards, tools, and operating system conventions & commands that we can rely upon.\n\n\nPOSIX means having a compatible file system that allows us to have the classic embedded permissions, groups, user identifiers, as well as file names which include special 'ops characters (e.g. os.pathsep, os.sep) and other common conventions.\n\n\nBoth in terms of definition as well as compliance, the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX Standard) has been growing since 1996.  Most Operating Systems - even Microsoft Windows - support various levels of POSIX compliance.\n\n\nDevOps Power-Up\nWhile Python is fast, Operating System commands are usually faster.\n\n\nThe POSIX Standard also includes the definition and inclusion of over 159 command-line utilities, as well as user-interface 'shells.'  Each a powerful performance power-up that DevOps can re-use from within the Python programming world.\n\n\nUltimately, using standardized POSIX commands represent an OS-quick, DevOps opportunity that allows us to work on many different Unix-inspired operating systems so as to not be concerned about what flavor of Linux we're running.",

We start with Linux Administration, where you learn how to install, manage, and troubleshoot Linux systems. You’ll work with users, permissions, file systems, services, and networking – all the core skills a Linux admin needs.\nNext, we focus on Linux Security, because keeping systems safe is one of the most important jobs of a system administrator. You’ll learn how to secure user accounts, set file permissions, configure firewalls, and use tools like SELinux to protect your servers from attacks.\nWe then cover Secure Shell (SSH) – the main tool system admins use to connect to remote Linux servers. You’ll learn how to use SSH to log in securely, transfer files, and run commands on other machines without needing to be there physically.\nAfter that, we go into Linux Shell Scripting, which helps you automate boring or repeated tasks. You’ll learn how to write your own scripts using Bash – a must-have skill for saving time and avoiding mistakes when managing multiple servers.\nTo help you apply your knowledge, we include Linux Projects based on real-life situations. These projects will test your skills and help you build confidence in areas like user management, system backups, log analysis, and server setup.\nThen, we introduce Ansible, a powerful tool for automating system configuration and software installation. With Ansible, you can manage many servers with just a few simple commands. This is great for any Linux administrator working in larger environments.\nWe also teach Docker, which helps you run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, fast, and easy to use – and knowing Docker is important if you're working with modern infrastructure or in DevOps roles.\nAnother topic we cover is the Apache Web Server. As a Linux admin, you may be asked to host websites or web applications, and Apache is one of the most common web servers in use today. You’ll learn how to install, configure, and manage Apache.\nLastly, we include Python for Linux Admins, teaching you how to use Python scripts to automate tasks, analyze logs, and manage servers. Python is easy to learn and powerful to use.\nWe finish with some DevSecOps Essentials, helping you understand how security fits into automation and system management – skills every modern Linux admin should know.\nWe believe anyone can succeed with the right guidance and practical experience. Start now. Join us today!",

      "description": "Based on the 440-page book - PowerShell for Systems Engineers: Leveraging Automation and ChatGPT to Solve Business Problems\nThere is no shortage of training materials available for PowerShell. Many of these materials just show you how to use PowerShell, not how you can leverage it. In this course, you will not only learn PowerShell fundamentals, but you will also learn how to use it to automate business tasks, leveraging its power and simplicity to make business workflows better.\nWritten by Jim Tyler, a former Amazon engineer and the author of PowerShell for Systems Engineers: Leveraging Automation and ChatGPT to Solve Business Problems, this course starts with a concise overview of PowerShell fundamentals in the first two sections. In Section 3, James goes over three automation techniques that will be used throughout the course.\nThe breadth and depth of this course are amazing - covering system management, file management, networking, Active Directory, custom functions, graphical PowerShell scripts, and more. Jim makes it a point to cover tips and tricks he wished he would have known earlier in his career, such as profiles, splatting, Get-Help, Get-Command, and more. The structure is modeled after a combination of programming courses and systems administration courses, blending the two elegantly to reflect that PowerShell is a scripting language and a management console.",

They want to use Group Policy to manage these different configurations.\n\n\nSituation: The IT administrator needs to apply specific software installation settings to the marketing department's computers. They also want to ensure that these settings only apply to users who are actually members of the marketing department, regardless of which computer they log into.\n\n\nQuestion: To achieve this, which of the following methods is most appropriate?\n\n\nCorrect Answer: Link a GPO to the Marketing Department OU and use security filtering to apply the GPO only to members of the marketing group.\n\n\nExplanation: Understanding the Scenario:\nDepartment-Specific Configurations: Different departments require unique software and security settings.\nMarketing Department Focus: The immediate task is to apply software installation settings to the marketing department's computers.\nUser-Based Application: The settings should only apply to members of the marketing department, regardless of the computer they use.\nGPO Management: Group Policy is used to manage these configurations.\n\n\nRationale for the Answer:\nLink GPO to Marketing OU:\nLinking the GPO to the Marketing Department OU ensures that the GPO applies to the computers within that OU.\nThis targets the software installation settings to the marketing department's computers.\nSecurity Filtering:\nSecurity filtering allows you to control which users or computers have the permission to apply a GPO.\nBy applying security filtering to the GPO and targeting the marketing department's user group, you ensure that only members of that group receive the settings.\nThis is very important, because it makes the GPO apply to the users, and not the computers. This allows the users to get the software settings no matter what computer they log into.\n\n\nUser-Based Application:\nSecurity filtering enables user-based application of the GPO, ensuring that the settings follow the users, not just the computers.\nThis fulfills the requirement that the settings apply to marketing department members regardless of the computer they log into.\n\n\nWhy This Answer Is Accurate:\nIt correctly identifies linking the GPO to the Marketing OU as the way to target the computers.\nIt correctly identifies security filtering as the method for user-based application.\nIt accurately explains how security filtering ensures that the settings follow the users.\nIt is the correct method to use to achieve the goals.\n\n\nIn essence:\nThe answer highlights the combined use of OU linking and security filtering to achieve both computer-specific and user-specific GPO application, ensuring that the marketing department's software and security requirements are met.\n\n\nIncorrect Answer: Link a GPO to the domain and use WMI filters to target computers in the marketing department.\n\n\nEnroll in this course and successfully pass your Active Directory interview!",

      "description": "Welcome to Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Neural Networks course. This is a comprehensive project based course where you will learn how to build advanced artificial intelligence models using Keras, Tensorflow, Convolutional Neural Network, MLP Regressor, and Gated Recurrent Unit. This course is a perfect combination between Python and deep learning, making it an ideal opportunity to practice your programming skills while improving your technical knowledge in machine learning. In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and neural networks, additionally you will also get to know their use cases. Then, in the next section, you will learn how to find and download datasets from Kaggle, it is a platform that provides collections of high quality datasets from various sectors. Afterward, we will start the project. In the first section, we are going to build complex deep learning models, specifically, a driver drowsiness detection model using Keras and CNN. The system will be able to detect if the driver is drowsy and immediately give a warning on the screen. Following that, we are also going to build a traffic light detection model using Keras and CNN. This model will accurately identify the color of traffic lights in real time and if the detected color is red, it will display Stop, if the detected color is yellow, it will display Prepare to Stop and if the detected color is green, it will display Go. In the second section, we are going to build reinforcement learning models, starting with a maze solver using Q learning. The system will be able to learn optimal paths to efficiently solve the maze.The reward will be given when the agent reaches the goal, while penalties will be applied for hitting walls or taking longer paths. Additionally, we will develop a smart traffic light system using Q learning. This system will be able to intelligently manage traffic lights to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow. The agent will receive penalties for increasing vehicle waiting time and rewards for reducing the total number of stopped cars at the intersection. Then, in the third section, we are going to build neural network models, specifically, we are going to predict energy consumption using a Multi Layer Perceptron Regressor. This model will analyze historical data to forecast future energy demands which can help resource planning. Following that, we are also going to forecast weather and temperature using Recurrent Neural Networks and Gated Recurrent Unit. The system will capture sequential patterns in weather data to provide accurate short term forecasts. Lastly, at the end of the course, we are going to build a handwritten digit recognition system using Artificial Neural Networks. The user will be able to upload a handwritten digit image, and the system will be able to accurately classify the given digit.\nFirstly, before getting into the course, we need to ask these questions to ourselves, why should we learn about deep learning, reinforcement learning, and neural networks? Why are they important? Well, here is my answer, deep learning can help to automatically extract complex patterns from large amounts of data, enabling us to make predictions with high accuracy. Reinforcement learning can help to develop systems that learn optimal behaviors through interaction and feedback from their environment. Meanwhile, Neural networks can help to build intelligent systems that learn in a way similar to humans and it can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\nBelow are things that you can expect to learn from this course:\nLearn the basic fundamentals of deep learning, reinforcement learning, neural networks, and also getting to know their use cases\nLearn how deep learning models work.

      "description": "Hello, and thank you for you interest in this course. I have been programming PHP since 2000. I have also been a Linux/Unix Administrator since 2000. I have worked with PHP in Shell script applications and Web-Based applications since 2000 as well.\nI have written many tools, and managed over 600 servers, and built Linux environments from 2 servers to over 200, in less than 2 years. I have a lot of industry experience, and now I want to share this knowledge with you, so that it can help your career.\nIn my early days, I was in-between C and Java, and I choose C, and even C over C++, because I was more interested in the systems language that Linux was written in. I grew found of PHP mostly due to its C-like syntax. In fact it is like C, but much easier to pick up. There are no type declarations, or linking, or compiling. It is very easy to go from C to PHP, since most of the functions and operators work the same.\nHowever PHP is even better, since you can write it inline with Web-Based HTML. It makes sys admin work, and web-based reports, only needing to know one language to do both jobs.\nWith the helper functions that I show you in the course, you will learn how easy it is to turn command line tools, into objects PHP can easily harness. With this you will be able to write scripts fast and quick.\nMy largest installation of PHP grown scripts, was at a company, where I scripted so much through PHP, that it would have taken 3 full-time people to replace what I had written.\nNever fear running out of work, I was always busy at that job, and I never ran out of work, that is why I had scripted so much, just to get ahead and stay afloat. PHP is a powerful language. You can hardness data, and send it right into a database, in fact PHP libraries work with just about every database on the market, making it great glue code to import and export between different platforms.\nEnroll now, and let's get started putting PHP to work for you, and letting it enhance and move your career forward.",

But it could also be a reverse shell, where instead the server connects to your attack box and lets you run commands on the server. . A backdoor can be placed in a file belonging to an unsuspecting user, e.g. in .bashrc, .profile or .login. But there are many more ways a backdoor can be installed.\nIn this course you will learn about various ways a backdoor can be installed on Linux. You will learn how hackers can compromise your system and to do it yourself.  The backdoor runs hidden and is usually not visible in the process list. It allows the remote user to run arbitrarily defined commands on the victim's machine without them knowing it.\nThe usual security advise is apply patches provided by your OS vendor as soon as possible. Additionally, running only necessary processes with elevated privileges should be considered - especially on publicly facing servers and workstations. But that isn't enough, so in this course you will learn how to detect a backdoor.\nIt is a beginners course. You don't need prior knowledge except basic Linux knowledge, like the basic commands. It helps if you have some knowledge on Linux servers. If you want to check your system for backdoors or if you want to install backdoors yourself, this course is for you.",

Starting from foundational concepts, the course covers the core principles, components, and operations that make PKI a cornerstone of cybersecurity today. You’ll learn what PKI is, why it matters, and how it supports secure communications, identity verification, and data integrity in a variety of real-world scenarios.\nThroughout the course, you will explore the architectural building blocks of PKI, including certificate authorities (CAs), registration authorities (RAs), digital certificates, and cryptographic key pairs. You will understand how trust is built through chains of certificates, and how systems rely on this trust to enable secure web access, encrypted emails, authenticated VPNs, and signed code. The lifecycle of a certificate—from creation and validation to renewal and revocation—is explained in detail, along with secure key storage and management practices using tools like Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).\nYou’ll dive into how PKI is operated and governed within an enterprise, including the creation of certificate policies, trust models like hierarchical and mesh, and techniques for automating certificate issuance and renewal using protocols such as SCEP and ACME. As modern infrastructures scale, you’ll also gain insights into designing PKI environments for high availability and disaster recovery.\nThe course emphasizes hands-on application of PKI across various domains including SSL/TLS for web security, S/MIME for secure email, code signing for software integrity, and certificate-based network access through technologies like 802.1X and EAP-TLS. Governance, compliance, and auditing are also key focus areas, with coverage of international standards, industry best practices, and strategies for risk mitigation and forensic readiness.\nTo ensure you stay ahead of evolving technology landscapes, the course concludes with forward-looking topics like decentralized PKI models, quantum-resistant cryptography, and PKI implementation in resource-constrained environments such as IoT and embedded systems.\nWhether you're a cybersecurity professional, IT administrator, developer, or technical manager, this course will provide you with the skills and knowledge needed to confidently design, implement, and manage PKI systems that support secure digital operations in any organization.\nThank you",

      "description": "Technologies and modern agile practices like cloud computing, DevOps and microservices are encouraging technical teams to pick the right tool for the right job. Rather than be fanatical about a particular platform or operating system, it’s more efficient and cost-effective to embrace all the tools at your disposal.\nTypically you will see some files servers or other network servers running Windows Operating system whereas the knowledge workers work with MacOS with productivity applications. These users need to access files and data across the network regardless of which platform it resides on. These users don’t care which platform the files and data are on. They need access.\nDo you know what it takes to make these two operating systems work together seamlessly within the same environment?\nHow does a MacOS user login to the system using their network credentials?\nHow can Windows and MacOS users share files?

The whole deployment chain from \"automatically install an operating system\" to \"create a VM from a custom VM image in a Cloud\" is very complex.

This is intentional: there are other courses about Packer on Udemy which fill that gap well.\nThis is our first video course so we appreciate if you can provide constructive feedback - this way we can improve the course for you and all future students.

In the introduction session, you will learn the basic fundamentals of AI text to speech synthesis and automatic speech recognition, such as getting to know their use cases and technical limitations. Then, in the next section, you will learn how to import AI models from Hugging Face, it is a platform that offers a diverse selection of pre-trained large language models and they are ready to use. Afterward, we will start the project section. In the first project, we are going to build AI text to speech system using gTTS and Gradio. This system will enable users to convert any given text into speech and download the audio file in just one click. In the second project, we are going to build AI speech to text system using OpenAI Whisper. This system will facilitate users to either record their voice or upload an audio file, which will then be converted into text automatically. Meanwhile, in the third project, We are going to build AI speech to speech translation using transformers and NLP models. This system will allow users to speak in English, and within a few seconds, the speech will be translated into Spanish in audio form. Following that, in the fourth project, we are going to build AI meetings transcriber and summarizer using DeepSeek. This system will enable users to upload a meeting recording, and AI will automatically transcribe the audio and summarize the key points from the meeting. Then, in the fifth project, we are going to build a voice command recognition system for smart home automation. This system will allow users to control the room temperature, turn on or off the air conditioner, heater, and lights using voice commands, simulating a smart home automation dashboard and we will design the user interface using Gradio. Lastly, at the end of the course, we will conduct testing to make sure each system has been fully functioning and all logics have been implemented correctly.\nBefore getting into the course, we need to ask this question to ourselves. Why should we build AI text to speech and voice recognition systems?
