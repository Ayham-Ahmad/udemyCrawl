Tableau is part of a new class of business intelligence tools, which dramatically reduce the time and technical acumen required to derive insights from data and publish it in a consumable format.\nWe'll begin by laying the groundwork for a successful dashboard and then move on to constructing five different dashboards of increasing complexity.\nStarting with the Strategic/Executive dashboard, we’ll design a few of the most common dashboard elements and assemble our first complete dashboard. Next, we’ll show you how to use Tactical dashboards for visualizations that can help depict progress and draw attention to important areas. We’ll then dive into increasing the dashboard interactivity by using Operational dashboards when focusing on granular detail. Using advanced techniques in Tableau, we’ll then show you how to use Analytical dashboards that can provide you with the tools to effectively extract knowledge from your data. We’ll also walk through how to quickly create a visualization using Ad-hoc dashboards that allow you to effectively keep an eye on a specific area of interest. Lastly, we’ll cover the styling settings and publication options and conclude with best practices.\nThis course guides you through the entire “how and why” of each task in the dashboard creation process, which will translate easily to your own dashboard projects.\nThis course uses Tableau Desktop/Public 8.1, while not the latest version available, it provides relevant and informative content for legacy users of Tableau.\nAbout the Author\nTony Kau is a Tableau Desktop 8 Qualified Associate, and he is putting its power to use in his role as a reporting analyst for a Fortune 500 company. His analytical background spans a decade, during which he has used a variety of business intelligence software, though none were better than Tableau. His passion is efficiently leveraging data to inform strategic business decisions.\nHe holds a degree in Business Administration from the University of Oregon, and his background includes web design, programming, and financial analysis.",

      "description": "Welcome to our Design Patterns & SOLID Principles course, developed with Java programmers in mind! We launched the course back in 2020 but are continually checking and updating the coursework as we go along. Our course will help you understand and discover the Design Patterns created by the Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides) who wrote the book \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\".\nDesign Patterns are general solutions to problems that appear over and over again in complex applications. Whether you are familiar with the topic and need a recap, or are starting your programming studies, this course is for you. With a brilliant look at the theory of this topic, the course also brings a practical element into it whereby you can test your own programming skills through our Eclipse projects. Understanding Design Patterns gives you a broad catalogue of general solutions to tackle even the most complicated programming tasks, which have been discovered, analysed and described in detail by the Gang of Four in their book.\nWhat are Design Patterns?\nDesign Patterns are identified as 23 general, repeatable solutions to problems that we are likely to come across as a programmer and were developed by the infamous Gang of Four. They are divided into 3 main categories: creational, structural and behavioural. We take a look at each of these patterns and explain them in an easy to follow manner, explaining how they can be used to elegantly solve problems while complying with the requirements of encapsulation, extensibility and other factors that a professional design requires.\n\nWhat are SOLID Principles?\nSOLID Principles are perhaps the best-known set of principles to assess the quality of an object-oriented system. They help us detect bad smells in our code and create clean architectures. Examples of these principles include the Open / Closed Principle and the Liskov Substitution Principle. This course will highlight to you what a beautiful and essential part of programming they are. Hoping they come in handy and change your perception even of your work.\n\nOur course program:\nEach of our lessons takes you through the theory of a pattern or principle with concise and clear explanations, getting straight to the point. We have created practical exercises via 18 Eclipse projects for you to test your understanding, which comes with an automated correction system. Internalizing the theory through these exercises is fundamental to learning and improving our code writing skills. As well as this, at the end of each section, there is a short quiz for quick-fire checking of your knowledge!\n\nAs our students come from all over the world, we have developed subtitles in both English and Spanish to assist with the learning experience. We intend to give our students the best support they can get while taking our course; therefore, we are always on hand to answer any questions via the Q&A tab and message board.\n\nSummary of what our course includes:\n- Easy to follow presentations covering Design Patterns & SOLID Principles\n- Downloadable PDF of the presentation\n- Practical exercises via Eclipse projects with an automated correction system\n- End of section quiz\n- Subtitles in English (UK & US) and Spanish\n\nIf you've been looking for an opportunity to improve your code-writing skills, this is the right course for you!",

The Java course includes all the content that is covered in this course. However, it is very likely that this course could be extended while the JVM related content in the Java course may not be extended any further.\nTo be a complete Java engineer, apart from having a strong background in Java & design patterns, it is also important to have a good understanding of the internal workings of JVM. Towards this end, this course is about helping you gain a solid understanding of how JVM works. Here is how the course is organized.\nIn section 1, we start off by discussing about why JVM (and Java) were created and then discuss JVM and it's architecture at a high-level. In the process, we will also take a look at how Just-in-time (JIT) compilation works.\nSections 2 - 4 delve into the real internals of JVM.\nIn section 2, we discuss the Lifetime of a Type, i.e., we look at what happens to a type since the time it is accessed for the very first time. Class Loading & Linking (Bytecode Verification) will be discussed in detail and everything will be demonstrated in code.\nIn section 3, we look at the reflection API.\nIn section 4, we look at the different memory areas (runtime data areas) that JVM deals with. Here we will learn about things like method area, heap, method table, garbage collection, stacks and we will also look at some of the Java bytecode instructions too. In one of the demos, we will look at how we can tune the heap size and how it impacts garbage collection process. To  learn about bytecode instructions, we will actually disassemble a .class file and we will inspect the bytecode instructions and learn about how they work.\nThe demo programs are available for download from the resources section of the corresponding lectures.\nIt is very likely that the course will also be updated to make it as comprehensive and as practical as possible.\n\nHappy Learning.",

This course is designed for the learners of all categories: Beginners - who don't have prior knowledge in programming and interested in learning a new skill, Programmers from other languages who wish to learn Java. This course is an experiment that tries to relate almost all the programming concepts in Java to the real world scenarios. In this, we will discuss some real-world scenarios and try to code it using Java. You will also have a very deep insight on Object Oriented Programming in Java which is simply the need of the hour. With bewitching analogies, you will be motivated to pursue in this course with a decent pace so that you can complete the course and earn a certificate.  For example, We will be dealing with the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) through examples like lion and his cubs so that it will be easy and interesting for you to understand the concept as well as keeps you engaged. You will also have access to all the source codes, some optional problem sheets and quizzes for you to practice and master the skill. Using your knowledge in Java after this course, you can also start learning how to develop Android Apps in Android Studio. Java is the one of the most required skills in IT Industry. Get certified as the complete Java programmer now!\nIn order to have as few implementation dependencies as feasible, Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. In other words, compiled Java code can run on any platforms that accept Java without the need to recompile. It is a general-purpose programming language designed to enable programmers to write once, run anywhere (WORA). Regardless of the underlying computer architecture, Java applications are often compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM). Although Java has fewer low-level features than either C or C++, it has syntax that is similar to each of them. Unlike most traditional compiled languages, the Java runtime has dynamic capabilities (such reflection and runtime code change).",

Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\nPython is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\n\n\nWhat is Java Programming?\nJava Programming Language is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.\n\n\nWhat is C Programming?\nC Programming Language is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.\n\n\nWhat is C++ Programming?\nC++ Programming Language is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or \"C with Classes\". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.\n\n\nWhat is C# Programming?\nC# Programming Language is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.\n[Ref: Wikipedia]\n\n\nEmenwa Global instructors are industry experts with years of practical, real-world experience building software at industry leading companies. They are sharing everything they know to teach thousands of students around the world, just like you, the most in-demand technical and non-technical skills (which are commonly overlooked) in the most efficient way so that you can take control of your life and unlock endless exciting new career opportunities in the world of technology, no matter your background or experience.",

My main focus is that you not only learn these advance level concepts but you can use them to make advance level applications in Python. I will assume that you know the basics of Python Programming Language and you are here to learn only the Advance Level Programming in Python. As grabbing the main concept behind Advance Topics is not simple therefor, special attention is given to the intuition part of each concept where we gonna understand these concepts with proper animated slides. The implementation is done by real time examples so that you can best use the concept.\nAlso not only understanding these advance concepts are important but to make something real out of it is very important or else there is no reason to learn Advance Programming therefor we will also make real time Advance level Applications in Python using Advance level concepts that we have covered in this course. We have made couple of GUI Based Advanced Level Applications in Python.\n\n\nI believe that after taking this course, you gonna feel much more satisfied and comfortable with your programming in Python as you will then be a professional programmer who is capable to give any job interview and hopefully you can then use Python to do anything that you can expect ..\n\n\nI wish you very best for the Course",

With cherry picked features from other modern languages such as Clojure, Ruby and Python, etc. it's a joy to use, and makes functional programming much more accessible.\nErlang was built from the ground up, to get distributed, and fault-tolerant computing \"right\". Elixir inherits these qualities, and packages it up in a beautiful modern language, with excellent tooling and access to all the existing Erlang libraries.\nIf you want to understand how Whatsapp, with less than 60 engineers, can send double the text messages of all the Telecoms companies put together, then come and learn Elixir. It'll be fun!\nWhat can you build with Elixir:\n\n* Websites with Phoenix\n* Microservices and APIs\n* IoT devices, with the Nerves project - write and manage the client and the server\n* Use all the cores on your computer\n* Build concurrent event driven services, ideal for Robotics, etc.\nWhat is this course about:\nThis is a beginners guide to learning the Elixir programming language. You will learn how to read and write in Elixir code, understand recursion, data immutability, and pattern matching.\nThis course lays the foundation for learning a functional language and gives you confidence with which to build your knowledge.\nThis is a beginners course in learning the basics of the language thus we do NOT go into OTP, Erlang or Macros.\n\n\nBuild a strong foundation in Elixir and functional programming with this tutorial for beginners.\nWhat Elixir is and what it is good for\nTypes, functions and tools\nFunctional programming, immutable data, pattern matching and recursion\nTools, tests and documenting\n\n\nA Skill for the Future of Programming\nA developer in the future will need to have experience building functional and concurrent software. With the rise of the Internet of Things and greater need for scalable and fault-tolerant systems, developers are going to need experience building software that can cope with these kind of challenges.\n\nLearning the fundamentals of Elixir will give you skills for the future. It's free and easy to learn, with excellent documentation and a thriving friendly community.\nUnderstanding an elegant functional language such as Elixir will greatly improve your programming skills in Object Orientated languages, such as Ruby, Python, Java and C#. It will also serve as a foundation for learning other functional languages.\nElixir is the language of the future, and will equip you with the skills that our future jobs are going to require.\n\n\nContent and Overview\nSuitable for students with programming experience who wish to learn a functional language but don't know where to start. You’ll learn all of the Elixir fundamentals and establish a strong understanding of the concept behind Functional programming.\nStarting from set up, this course will walk you through the main language concepts and how they work, right up to building your own Elixir programs, and using some of the main tools.\nStudents completing the course will have the knowledge and confidence to create functional programs written in Elixir. You will be able to read and write code, and understand when to use the correct data structures.\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\nLearn Elixir code from your own desk.\nSuitable for students with programming experience wishing to learn a functional language, and ideal for users who learn faster when shown.\nVisual training method, offering users increased retention and accelerated learning.\nBreaks down principles into simple steps.",

      "description": "More and more people are realising the vast benefits and uses of analysing big data. However, the majority of people lack the skills and the time needed to understand this data in its original form. That's where data visualisation comes in; creating easy to read, simple to understand graphs, charts and other visual representations of data. Python 3 and Matplotlib are the most easily accessible and efficient to use programs to do just this.\nLearn Big Data Python\nVisualise multiple forms of 2D and 3D graphs; line graphs, scatter plots, bar charts, etc.\nLoad and organise data from various sources for visualisation\nCreate and customise live graphs\nAdd finesse and style to make your graphs visually appealling\nPython Data Visualisation made Easy\nWith over 58 lectures and 6 hours of content, this course covers almost every major chart that Matplotlib is capable of providing. Intended for students who already have a basic understanding of Python, you'll take a step-by-step approach to create line graphs, scatter plots, stack plots, pie charts, bar charts, 3D lines, 3D wire frames, 3D bar charts, 3D scatter plots, geographic maps, live updating graphs, and virtually anything else you can think of!\nStarting with basic functions like labels, titles, window buttons and legends, you'll then move onto each of the most popular types of graph, covering how to import data from both a CSV and NumPy. You'll then move on to more advanced features like customised spines, styles, annotations, averages and indicators, geographical plotting with Basemap and advanced wireframes.\nThis course has been specially designed for students who want to learn a variety of ways to visually display python data. On completion of this course, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of the options available for visualising data, but you'll have the know-how to create well presented, visually appealing graphs too.\nTools Used\nPython 3: Python is a general purpose programming language which a focus on readability and concise code, making it a great language for new coders to learn. Learning Python gives a solid foundation for learning more advanced coding languages, and allows for a wide variety of applications.\nMatplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library that works with the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension 'NumPy'. It allows the user to embed plots into applications using various general purpose toolkits (essentially, it's what turns the data into the graph).\nIDLE: IDLE is an Integrated Development Environment for Python; i.e where you turn the data into the graph. Although you can use any other IDE to do so, we recommend the use of IDLE for this particular course.",

If I had to guess, however, I would venture to say that most programmers are not acquainted with even the most elementary principles of Regex.\n\nSure, You could tell me: “I have survived so far without knowing Regex.”; chances are, however, that the moment will come for you to face a task that includes the need to work with text, in which case I’m sad to tell you that your code will quickly “join the dark side of the Force”... Jokes aside, I can assure you that, without Regex, you will miss many tools that would enable you to write cleaner, more efficient code, not to mention they would save you a considerable amount of time and quite a bit of effort!\n\nFor a quick glance at the topics you will learn on Regex:\nGroups\nCharacter classes (also known as “Character sets”)\nQuantifiers\nBackreferences\nFlags\nBorders\n\n\nIf you are not familiar with any of these subjects, or even if you would like to deepen and/or broaden your knowledge while developing some handy skills, this course will greatly help you not only to effectively use Regular Expressions but also (and more importantly) to become a more well-rounded programmer.\n\nIt will certainly be a joy and a privilege to have you as our student!\n\n\nWe wish you all the best and a great learning experience!",

A programmer that can automate various tasks and give shapes to his ideas in python.\nWhat does this course covers?\nThis course starts from the installation of python in the very first movie. Then instead of using Notepad++ we will take you to a corporate level of development with Eclipse IDE. Moving from fundamentals like datatypes, basic operation, conditional programming, loops and Object oriented concepts, we will take the python training series to next level. We will teach you to integrate database, code Graphical User Interface and Network socket programming basics. Further we will explore the possibility of python scripts in penetration testing.\nWhere is python used?\nThe rapid increase in python usage means the rapidly growing job market. Python is used at Google, Youtube, Yahoo Maps, Battlefield 2, Walt Disney Feature Animation, ABN AMRO Bank, Treasury Systems, National Weather Service, NASA, Red Hat, Thawte Consulting, IBM are just some examples. Since the python modules are available for almost every task, you can implement python all over the internet. Thus the job scope is extremely high.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Python Programming course by Uplatz.\n\n\nPython is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming language is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in software industry.\nPython is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is used in web development, data science, creating software prototypes, and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. Python is one of the high-level, interpreted and general-purpose programming languages that is easy to use, comprehensive and powerful.\nPython is a widely used dynamic programming language compared to other languages such as Java, Perl, PHP, and Ruby. It is often termed as a scripting language. It provides support for automatic memory management, multiple programming paradigms, and implements the basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). Python programming language is supported with a huge and broad standard library. The library of Python provides support for many Internet protocols such as FTP, and IMAP. It has a unique syntax, which makes it different from other programming languages like Java, C++, and C.\nPython has some great applications. It is widely used in the development of frameworks such as Django and Pyramid, and advanced content management systems like Plone and Django CMS.\n\n\nKey areas where Python is used\nweb development (server-side)\nanalytics and data visualization\nsoftware development\nmathematics & statistics\nsystem scripting\n\n\nFeatures of Python programming language\nPython is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.\nPython allows programming in object-oriented paradigms.\nPython programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.\nPython language is being used by top companies across all sectors such as Walmart, Google, Amazon, Tesla, etc.\nThe biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:\nMachine Learning\nGUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )\nWeb frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)\nImage processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)\nWeb scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)\nTest frameworks\nMultimedia\nScientific computing\nText processing, and more\n\n\nUplatz provides this comprehensive course on Python programming.

It has pioneered a LOT of concepts in computer science, and while old it is still used in the industry by Big Corps (all quantum computing ones, Google) as well as one-person companies (me!). I'll help you learn it efficiently.\n\n\nUPDATE October, 2025: I finished recording and editing the chapter about DATA STRUCTURES (lists, plists, alists, vectors and arrays, hash-tables, the CONS cell, trees and sets…). I'm putting the last touch and adapting subtitles.\nThere are subtitles.\nI publish complementary videos on Youtube (vindarel channel).\nIf you subscribe now, you'll get the next chapters at no additional cost.\n\n\nLisp the language is different than the Algol/C-like family of languages, and the Lisp development environments still offer unmatched capabilities: interactive, image-based development experience, while getting type warnings and errors at compile time in a fraction of a second, speed in the same group of C, Rust and Java (while sweating less to get to the result), while ensuring stability through decades, etc, etc, etc.\nHowever, you are about to enter a big new world. There are rough edges, the information is sometimes spread apart and hard to discover, despite my continuous work on collaborative resources.\nSo, I gathered my knowledge and experience of more than seven years of continuous reading, tweaking, writing, asking and answering questions, discovering libraries, trial and error, releasing open-source libraries, starter kits and demo projects, contributing to ambitious projects and running commercial services… into this series of videos.\nWe will learn the language, the tools, the most important pieces of the ecosystem (a dozen libraries viewed so far), in order to be able to develop a Common Lisp software from the ground up. We will see some theory on what a Lisp language is but, be warned, theory isn't our goal, we'll quickly dive into the Common Lisp way. I will develop with Emacs and Slime (you can use Atom/Pulsar, Vim, VSCode, Sublime, Jetbrains/Intellij, LispWorks, Lem, a Jupyter notebook, CLOG or a simple text editor along with a command line prompt as we see in the first chapter), we will learn the syntax, we will create new projects some scratch, we will see everything about functions and macros, all the iteration constructs, error and condition handling, the CLOS object system (new in 2024) and we will build self-contained binaries.\nThe Common Lisp Cookbook (which I mainly wrote) is a good companion to this video series.\nI am genuinely happy to share all that with you in this new video format and I wish you a fun journey.\n\n\nPS: pro tip: if you find a video too slow or if you think you know the content, watch it at speed x1.25 or x1.5. However I recommend to not skip content, as I give tips here and there and inside a section we build on the previous video's content.",

Many find it useful for data handling, cleaning, analysis, and representation. R is also a popular language for data science projects. Much of the data used for data science can be messy and complex. The programming language has features and libraries available geared toward cleaning up unorganized data and making complex data structures easier to handle that can't be found in other languages. It also provides powerful data visualization tools to help data scientists find patterns in large sets of data and present the results in expressive reports. Machine learning is another area where the R language is useful. R gives developers an extensive selection of machine learning libraries that will help them find trends in data and predict future events.\nWhat careers use R?\nR is a popular programming language for data science, business intelligence, and financial analysis. Academic, scientific, and non-profit researchers use the R language to glean answers from data. R is also widely used in market research and advertising to analyze the results of marketing campaigns and user data. The language is used in quantitative analysis, where its data analysis capabilities give financial experts the tools they need to manage portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Data scientists use R in many industries to turn data into insights and predict future trends with its machine learning capabilities. Data analysts use R to extract data, analyze it, and turn it into reports that can help enterprises make better business decisions. Data visualization experts use R to turn data into visually appealing graphs and charts.\nIs R difficult to learn?\nWhether R is hard to learn depends on your experience. After all, R is a programming language designed for mathematicians, statisticians, and business analysts who may have no coding experience. For some beginning users, it is relatively simple to learn R. It can have a learning curve if you are a business analyst who is only familiar with graphical user interfaces since R is a text-based programming language. But compared to other programming languages, users usually find R easier to understand. R also may have an unfamiliar syntax for programmers who are used to other programming languages, but once they learn the syntax, the learning process becomes more straightforward. Beginners will also find that having some knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and probabilities makes learning R easier.\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New tools are released every day, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge. You will always have up-to-date content to this course at no extra charge.\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nPython vs. R: what is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R, you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our contents are created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you with the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\n· Seeing clearly\n· Hearing clearly\n· Moving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nR For Beginners: Learn R Programming from Scratch\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",

      "description": "Like a gruff uncle, C++ seems intimidating, when its just being helpful. These 75 examples will help you understand that.\nLet's parse that.\nC++ seems intimidating because all too often, what you see is not what you get.\nUsually, that's because C++ is trying to help you, but you don't realise that. C++ is incredibly deep, and it sometimes struggles to get you - the programmer - to understand what it's saying\nThese 75 examples will help. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a specific C++ use-case. Each example is simple, but not simplistic.\nWhat's Included:\n\nMoving to C++ from C: If you are a C programmer, this section will run through what you need to know in order to move seamlessly to C++.\nObjects, Classes and Object-Oriented Programming: Access modifiers, classes, objects, the this pointer, new/delete and dynamic memory allocation gotchas\nOperator overloading is a particularly complicated topic - C++ is virtually alone in the ubiquity of overloaded operators. Make sure this doesn't trip you up. Also go deep into the workings of const, static and friend\nInheritance in C++ is considerably more complicated than in Java, mostly because of multiple inheritance, and because of the co-existence of both virtual and non-virtual methods.\nTemplates are a classic generic programming technique that were revolutionary when first added to C++. Understand template functions and classes, as well as template specializations.\nSTL - the Standard Template Library - is incredibly powerful. Get a good sense of collections, iterators and algorithms - the major components of the STL\nC++ casts are quite different than C-casts. Understand const_cast, static_cast and dynamic_cast, as well as Real Time Type Identification (RTTI), and the manner in which explicit conversions can be performed using static_cast\nExceptions and exception handling in C++",

I believe this material will be very helpful in understanding the underlying workings of many game engines. It is also something a bit different that will allow me to work on my python skills having some fun by making games. She is very clear in her instruction, very knowledgeable and of course delivers easy to follow and understand information that you can easily pick up and learn.\nAllow me to say how hugely important this is for a person who is interested in certain types of game design. Creating games where you can create AI behaviors that support emergent situations.\nI honestly love Holistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!\nThis course focuses on providing students with hands-on experience coding a general 3D graphics engine using PyOpenGL, while also providing an easy introduction to Python for the intermediate programmer.",

Please remember  I am just one person, and I make my videos often after I have been working for many hours already.  PLease do not join until you have completed this step.\n3.

This is a course for those who are willing to push themselves. It's not a \"basic\" introduction that gives an overly simplified perspective on OOP. In places, this code connects to the .NET framework, which is a professional level code base written in C#.  My promise is simple: take this course, and you'll discover details not taught in any other course.  Speaking from experience, I can tell you that it is through consistent, daily effort, and I don't mean little effort, but whole-hearted effort, that one makes progress when it comes to these technical subjects. That's what years of struggling have taught me.\n2. Please be sure to watch the free preview videos before enrolling so you can be sure the style of presentation works for you.\n3. I use pictures in the earlier videos to motivate some concepts. This is good for visual learners.\n4. The more advanced videos on the bottom are more about just straight code and the .NET Framework. I have this section on the bottom so you can see how OOP actually looks in a professional level framework.\n5. I have placed questions throughout the videos. I also mention the solutions from my perspective.\n6. There are separate PDF's placed under lesson resources. These contains completely separate examples.\n7. I discuss concepts from multiple perspectives where I feel it's necessary to do so.  I think developing a multidimensional understanding of concepts results in a much deeper level of true understanding.\n8. In some of the videos I place a lot of comments explaining each line bit by bit. I do this because I personally feel that reading comments makes a difference in terms of real understanding.\n9. My explanations focus both on the how and the why, and I stress this difference throughout most of the course.\n10. This is not the first C# course you should be taking.\n11. The bottom sections are a break from the upper sections and show how C# is used in Windows Forms programs in actual code.\nWho should not join:\n1. People wanting the how without the why.\n2. People looking for fast and superficial explanations.\n3. People who are interested only in code without any visual explanations.\n4. People who like fast talking.\n5. People not looking for multiple explanations from multiple perspectives.\nThank you for reading, and I will see you inside!\nnote: parts of promo presentation licensed from presentermedia",

It is a dynamically typed language which is easy to learn and use and has the speed of C.\nThis is the first of a series of courses I plan to teach data science, machine learning and deep learning using Julia. Other courses, \"Data Science with Julia\", \"Machine Learning with Julia\" and \"Deep Learning with Julia\" will follow. In this course, you will learn programming in Julia proficiently. In the upcoming courses you will learn both machine learning and deep learning algorithms and how to build those algorithms from scratch using Julia.\nBesides being ideal for data science and machine learning, Julia is also ideal for production environments. Being one of the most modern languages, Julia can be used to build entire applications and microservices.\nJulia combines best features of dynamic languages like Python and R and low-level languages like C, C# and Java. You can develop a machine learning model or an algorithm in Julia and use that code in a production environment. You don't have to use different languages for development and production.",

Structured Query Language -SQL (pronounced as sequel) is the standard language used to communicate and interact with data stored in relational management database systems like Microsoft  SQL Server Oracle, PostgreSQL,MySQL etc.\nDifferent database management systems have their own proprietary  version of the SQL language  but they all conform to using some commands in SQL the same way.   Microsoft SQL Server's version of SQL is known as Transact-SQL  (T-SQL).    In this course you will learn the basics of the SQL language and Transact-SQL since  both use certain commands in the same way.\nT-SQL is also popularly referenced to as T-Sequel .In this course you will learn all the basics of T-SQL. We will discuss the T-SQL features step by step. We will be using SQL Server Express 2014 (which is a free download). As a sample, we will use AdventureWorks 2014 as our database. Along the way, we will be creating our own t-SQL queries to get data into a database and also out of a database.  But AdventureWorks 2014 will be our main focus. As far as T-SQL, we will start with the simple select statements and add new features as we go. I will introduce you to the data types available so you can make the appropriate selection when creating a column. Then, we will talk about joins, functions, tables, procedures, triggers, indexes, and much more. By the time you are done with this course, you will be very comfortable using T-SQL.\nThis course will provide you with the basic knowledge and skills to create queries using Transact-SQL. It will teach you how to select, filter and sort data from multiple tables and how to use views and stored procedures. You will also be familiar with SQL Server Management Studio 2014 also known in the tech industry as SSMS. This is the tool you will use to write and see the output of your T-SQL queries.\n\n\n\nWhat You will learn includes:\n\n\nInstalling SQL Server\nInstall SSMS\nBasic Database  Concepts\nCreating Database\nCreating Table\nCreating Views\nCreating stored procedures\nReading data from a database\nUpdating database records\nBacking up database\nDeleting Records\nTruncating Table\nDropping Table\nDropping Database\nRestore Database\nQuery Multiple Database Tables\nChange query output column names using case expressions\nPerform Various table joins\nFilter records and remove duplicates\nWrite basic T-SQL Statements\nUnderstand T-SQL TOP Command\nUnderstand Normalisation\nKnow how to use SSMS\nCreate Views\nCreate Stored Procedures\nUnderstand NULL Values\nData Types\nFunctions",

I know what it is like to have no coding experience and desire to code professionally. I started coding in 2016 and landed a full-time development shortly thereafter. It was hard but it was worth it.\nThat's why I'm here. To help you make that transition yourself.\nIn Hello Python you will immediately begin to learn the language of Python. We’ll learn the basic syntax of how the Python language works.\nAfter that, we are going to apply what we learn to mini-projects. That will allow us to take what we have learned and put it into practice. Some courses teach you to build some sort of large application while you haven't mastered the basic syntax of Python.\nThis course will give you opportunities to build mini-applications step by step in a way that makes sense to someone learning programming for the first time or still learning the basics of programming.\nThis is an early release of this course and I will be adding approximately 30 minutes of new material per week. My JavaScript Bootcamp began and just an hour and is now over twenty hours long! Sign up now and come back weekly for updates!\nThis isn't the only Python course you should take but it should be your first!",

In this course, I intend to fix that. Here, I'll first teach you how to program in C in a way that is example driven. We'll start each lesson with a presentation and end it with an example problem. Next, we'll discuss what embedded C means. Finally, we'll program an embedded program in raw C on a microcontroller.\nThis course will teach you from start to finish how to program in C. Additionally, this course will teach you how to navigate the intimidating world of C programming as it applies to embedded systems. We'll navigate how to read a datasheet, and how to interpret that datasheet, and then use that information to write code for the microcontroller commonly found in the Arduino, the Atmega328p. An Arduino is beneficial to have for the end portion of this course, but not required.\n\n\nWhat You'll Learn:\nHow to Program in C from the ground up\nEmbedded C vs Regular Linux or Windows C\nHow to Interpret a Datasheet\nHow to Compile C for an Embedded Microcontroller Target\nWho Should Take This Course:\nA new programmer who wants to learn C\nA new programmer who wants to learn the difference between system C and embedded C\nAn Arduino hobbyist who wants to take their knowledge to the next level",

This course is partly based on the textbook C How to Program by Deitel and Deitel. C Programming is still a common requirement for Engineering and Computer Science students as it is the language of choice for low-level programming, eg, in embedded systems, OS kernel programming, device drivers and modules programming and  so on. Because C works very closely with the processor, performance-critical applications are mostly written in C and it has become the backbone of modern operating systems, compilers, interpreters, third-party libraries, and databases. In addition, C is a small language that is designed to cost minimal performance overhead which makes it ideal for embedded systems. C is the language of choice for implementing Operating Systems for Windows, Linux and OSX.\nFeatures of this course:\nBeginner friendly\nExercises and solutions explained in detail\nPlenty of practical exercises\nWho this course is for:\nEngineering and Computer Science students\nAnyone interested to learn the fundamental concepts of programming\nLearning Outcomes:\nBy the end of this course, you will be equipped with the basic concepts of programming to further your studies in more advanced topics.\n\n\nEnroll today and I will see you inside!",

This course will teach you the absolute basics of the C programming language and spare you from all the complex topics. This course can be used as a starter for a followup course, already knowing some of the basics.\nThe C programming language is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Anywhere you can see a computer operating system, a C programming language is in use. The reason for this is that C is a powerful programming language because of its flexibility and high performance. It is used to write computer software like Operating Systems, Games, Embedded Systems and etc. It provides a good platform for software designers and developers to design their software application.\nThe most important reason why anyone should learn C programming language is that you will be able to design any type of application using this language. However, C is quite a complex language because it is very low level. In fact, it is very close to machine language. But despite that it is still widely used for example in operating system development and electronic chip programming.",

You will always have up-to-date content for this course at no extra charge.\nWhat is React?\nReact is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.\nWhat is React used for?\nReact is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.\nHow does React work?\nReact encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.\nIs React a framework or library?\nFrameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.\nIs React worth learning?\nYes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.\nIs React hard to learn?\nEvery technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.\nWhat is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?\nReact, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.\nWhy is React so popular?\nThere are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.\nThe instructor helped me whenever I needed it, and I've learned a lot in very little time. Now I can create simple single-page applications, and I fell in love with CodePen and VS Code!\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our content is created/produced as high-quality video/audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nReact JS: Learn React JS From Scratch with Hands-On Projects\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the class!",

You’ll be able to take Outlook by the horns and implement a whole new set of tools to your toolbelt.\nWe’ll see you in the Forums!\nHappy Coding\nDan Strong, ExcelVbaIsFun",

This class has high-quality exercises and their solutions right after the video explanations.\nHere is our agenda:\n0- Why java? What is platform independency? Why it is the most used programming language in professional software development?\n1- Learn programming basics:\nUsing variables, primitive types, mathematical and logical operators.\nControl structures, loops and really high-quality exercises to have hands-on experience.\n2- Learn one dimensional and multidimensional arrays:\nUse this basic data collection and use them inside real-world, fun practices. Find the longest lost series of an NBA team for instance :)\n3- Learn object oriented programming:\nLearn encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction with great examples and exercises. Possibly you wasted lots of time by watching similar unclear explanations so far. It is time to polish the dust of these concepts.\n4- Learn core types and great utility classes of Java.\nHow a professional programmer leverages built-in types and utility classes in real life? StringBuilder, StringBuffer, Date type, String - Date conversions with SimpleDateFormat, Math class, Collections and Arrays class the topics you will learn.\n5- Learn regular expressions.\nExtracting useful data from a string by regular expressions is the greatest feature of all programming languages. But it is the most overlooked one. We don't overlook it. With two great explanation you will learn how to extract data from a URL and you will validate an email address ( by not Googling and copying of course!!!)\n6- Learn data collections.\nEveryone teaches you what is a list, set and map. How to put data and retrieve it. But this is the top of the iceberg. You MUST know where to use them, when to leverage the collections. Included exercises are asked in job interviews!!! Hold tight!!!\n7- Learn file operations\nHow java communicates with files, read text files, binary files or write to them? How the content of the file is processed with data collections? You will learn by great exercises.\nAt this point you may move on Java EE course for further understanding.\n8- Functional programming in Java 8\nUsing ASM interfaces, Function, Predicate, Consumer, Supplier interfaces, lambda expressions.\nUsing streams to process collections in functional style.\nLeveraging multi-cpu cores easily by using parallel streams\n9- Java 8 Date and Time API\n10- Generics\n11- Java and Database Interaction with MySQL\nHave a great experience!!!",

      "description": "TOP RATED, WORLD CLASS TKINTER FUNDAMENTALS COURSE - GUI for Python\nMaster practical Tkinter concepts and fundamentals using python\nMy course provides exactly what the title describes in a simple, practical and relatable way. I help you to grasp the fundamentals of Tkinter with live coding, practical examples, projects and quizzes, moving step by step through beginner and into intermediate concepts - getting you to the point where you are able to confidently create your own GUIs, to apply the foundations of python into real life projects that users can fully interact with.\nWhy you need this course\nComing to grips with Tkinter isn't easy without the right resources. On your learning to create your first GUI can be quite confusing, difficult and frustrating. I've been through the process myself, and with a significant investment of time, energy and learning from my mistakes I have become a proficient Tkinter developer. I want to share all I've learned with my fellow Tkinter aspirers. My inspiration comes from believing that, if taught effectively in a carefully planned and considered way, the vast majority of people will be able to master this important tool of python..that's why I've created this course.\nWhat you will get out of this course\nI will give you straightforward examples, instructions, advice, insights and resources for you to take simple steps to start coding your own programs, solving problems that inspire you and instilling the 'developer's mindset' of problem solving into you.\nI don't just throw you in at the deep end - I provide you with the resources to learn and develop what you need at a pace that works for you and then help you stroll through to the finish line. Studies have shown that to learn effectively from online courses tutorials should last around ten minutes each. Therefore to maximise your learning experience all of the lectures in this course have been created around this amount of time or less.\nMy course integrates all of the aspects required to get you on the road becoming a successful Tkinter developer. I teach and I preach, with live, practical exercises and walkthroughs at the end of each section.\nWhy this price?\nAs a professional AI developer I have over five years in Senior positions in software development and technology entrepreneurship, with extensive experience in tutoring and creating online courses, catering to thousands of students. I've been trained at Cambridge University and the prestigious Pi School of Artificial Intelligence in Rome. Face to face I charge a minimum of $50 per hour for a student. To complete the curriculum that I offer it would cost them over $3000+\nTo reach more people than I could face to face I decided to create this course. As I add more content I intend to raise the price but for now I've decided on this price - the cost of less than three lessons.\nBy paying a small cost for this course I believe you will get your value back, with a lot more by the time you have completed it.\nAsk yourself - how much is mastering Tkinter worth to you?\nHow long will it take?\nAlthough everyone is different, on average it has taken existing students between 4 - 6 weeks to complete the course, whilst developing their skills and knowledge along the way. It's best not to speed through the content, and instead go through a handful of lectures, try out the concepts by coding, yourself, and move on once you feel you've grasped the basics of those lectures.\nWho this is not for\nThis course is not for anyone looking for a one-click fix. Although I provide you with a path walked enough times that it can be a smooth journey it still requires time and effort from you to make it happen. If you're not interested in putting in your energy to truly better yours skills in python GUI then this may not be the right course for you.\nIs there a money back guarantee if I'm not happy?\nAbsolutely. I am confident that my course will bring you more value than you spend on the course. As one of the top featured Udemy Instructors my motto is 'your success is my success'. If within the first 30 days you feel my course is not going to help you to achieve your goals in python GUI programming then you get a no questions asked, full discount.\nWhat materials are included?\nThe majority of my lectures I have chosen to be as video so that you can hear me and see my workings when we're going through each and every area of the course.\nI will be constantly adding more content and resources to the course as time goes by. Keep checking back here if you're not sure right now and feel free to send me a message with any questions or requests you may have.\nSo go ahead and click the 'Enroll' button when you feel ready on your screen.\nI look forward to seeing you in the course.",

Then you'll learn to test your code by building a simple crate with a tested, usable, well-documented API using Cargo & RustDoc. Next, you will work with different forms of code reuse, loops, map, filter and fold to save time and resources & to use your code in a reusable manner in your apps.\nBy end of this course you will be able to avoid code duplication and write clean reusable code,  also you'll be comfortable building various solutions in Rust\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 2 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Learning Rust begins by getting familiar with the basic syntax and concepts of Rust, from writing a Hello World program to defining functions and creating variables. Then you’ll see how to manage toolchains with Rust up and build your first command-line program. Moving on, you’ll explore Rust’s type system to write better code and put it into practice in a simple markup language. You’ll learn to use Rust’s functional programming features to perform a physics simulation and use the Rayon crate to parallelize your computations. Finally, you’ll discover the best practices and test your code by building a simple crate with a tested, usable, well-documented API using Cargo and RustDoc. By the end of the video, you’ll be comfortable building various solutions in Rust. You’ll be able to take advantage of Rust’s powerful type system and a rich ecosystem of libraries, or “crates”, available through the Cargo package manager.\nThe second course, Building Reusable Code with Rust will start with teaching you how to build reusable Rust code so that you can stop copying and pasting the code. Write code that can adapt to many different usages. You will reuse code by using advanced features such as traits, generics, and macros. You will work with different forms of code reuse, loops, map, filter and fold to save time and resources. Achieve higher-level reuse without sacrificing runtime performance. Organize your code into modules and crates to publish them to crates .io. By the end of the course, you will be able to avoid code duplication and write clean reusable code.",

      "description": "Welcome to one of the unique and special Coding Interviews courses.\nThis course is all about algorithmic problem-solving for problems mainly from the Leetcode website. Specifically, the medium level frequent interview problems. The goal of this course is to sharpen your problem-solving skills to aid you in ACEing Coding Interviews from FAANG companies. During the course, you won't only be provided with a problem and its solution, but a series of hints and thinking approaches to tackle the problems.\n\n\nI don't teach data structures or algorithms in this course. You must study these courses from high-quality sources and solve many problems to gain basic problem-solving skills. The problems in this course are of medium level. Without proper background and skills, the materials will be hard to learn.\n\n\nPart 1 content\nPart one covers the data structures:\nArrays: Prefix Sum, Sliding Window (fixed and variable size) 2 Pointers, and Permutations.\nTutorials are provided for these topics only, as they are not covered in DSA courses.\nString\nMatrices\nStack and Priority Queue\nLinked List and Binary Trees\nHash Tables\nThe scope of the topics: Interviews coverage.\nNote: You are expected to solve the implementation problems over these topics during a data structure course. For example, reversing a linked list is a common interview question. I won't cover it. It is mainly an implementation task. The same for the basic binary tree DFS problems. I do cover such questions in my data structure and algorithms course. This course is about problem-solving challenges.\nAlthough the focus of this part is Data Structures, but still your background in Algorithms is needed.\nMajor: Complexity, Recursion and Sorting\nMinor: A few times I refer to: Binary Search, Divide and Conquer and Dynamic Programming\nGenerally, most of the problems require serious algorithmic skills\n\n\nThe course level:\nMost of the problems in this course are Leetcode MEDIUM level, which represent 85-90% of real interview questions.\nTo be more effective, the questions are mainly the most frequent interview questions according to the LeetCode website.\nThis means; in addition to gaining problem-solving skills, you increase the chance of meeting problems you already solved in the interviews!\nWithout proper background & skills ⇒ the course will be hard to learn\n\n\nPrerequisites:\nStrong programming skills & DSA knowledge/skills (from 3 courses)\nA high-quality programming course consisting of:\nGood coverage for programming + many exercises on learned topics\nProper understanding/using for built-in algorithms/DS (e.g. C++ STL / Java Collections)\nOptional: Several projects to be comfortable with long coding\nA high-Quality Data Structure course: good coverage + many exercises\nA high-Quality Algorithms course: good coverage + many exercises\nThis implies: you already solved and coded a lot. It is time to move to medium challenges.\nDon't join this course if you lack basic problem-solving skills\n\n\nThe course programming language\nAll slides codes are based on C++\nMainly C++11. I intend to not use the very modern C++\nMany people don't study after C++11\nIt will be easier for other programming languages to understand the code\nC++ code is very similar to Java and C#.

This course gets straight down to business. It tells you what Ruby is all about, what makes it similar to other languages - and what makes it different. It explains the stuff you really need to know. It won't bog you down by trying to describe every gnarly little corner of the language. It concentrates on the essentials - with no unnecessary padding. If you need to get to grips with Ruby fast, this is the course for you.\nOr maybe you've already learnt the basics of Ruby and you are looking for a quick way to revise your knowledge. With its video tutorials downloadable 'cheat-sheets' and interactive quizzes, Ruby For Programmers focuses on the most important features of Ruby and puts your knowledge to the test.\nThe course instructor Huw Collingbourne is the author of The Book Of Ruby. Huw has already taught over 22,000 people to program on Udemy.\nRuby is a cross-platform, object-oriented language. Ruby can not only be used for writing standalone programs but it can also be used for creating dynamic web sites thanks to web frameworks such as Rails. If you are already an experienced programmer in some other language, or if you've started learning Ruby and you need a clear, simple way to revise your knowledge, Ruby For Programmers is course for you.",

And that is the reason this course has been designed to get the best in you with all practical examples.\nThis course is suitable for students, programmers who are new to Java and want to get a quick understanding of the language and start building applications as early as possible.\nThis course is aimed at teaching maximum concepts in minimum time. There may be times when we want to get a grasp of any programming language in very short time. This course is a perfect for such situations as it requires only 2 hours of your time.\nIn these 2 hours you are going to learn all the core concepts which are commonly used like variables, data-types, conditional statements, looping statements, operators, methods, arrays and even Object-Oriented programming concepts like class, objects, constructors, inheritance, method overloading, method overriding etc and after all this you will also build a project.\nThe best part of this course is the Project(Banking Application) at the end as it covers almost all important concepts which have been taught in this course. So this will be a good refresher for students and will give them a concrete understanding of the concepts which they have learned.\nAt the end of this course students will get a clear idea of the Java language fundamentals and Object-Oriented concepts. Students will be able to build stand-alone Java applications confidently and also implement Object-Oriented concepts in their projects.\nAnd again guys you get all this in just 2 hours. So lets do some coding.\nSome of the reviews on this course:-\n\n\"Most Java courses I have taken would only talk about how to do things, and they would not actually show it. With this course, I am able to workthe same time he is, and I am really grasping the material.\"\n\n\n\n\"it is the best opportunity that i have to develop my java programming , i really appreciate the way the lecture explain each concept , thank you.\"\n\n\n\"Great to quickly know the basics and get started with programming real applications. Great Job!\"\n\n\n\n\"I really like the way he is teaching.He is a good programming teacher I have ever seen.He explained each and everything very clear.I am looking for continution of this beginners course by him.\"\n\n\n\n\"Perfect if you know a thing or two about programming and trying to see how things are done in Java!I also believe it can benefit someone that'spretty new programming!\"",

You came to right place. All this course asks you is 2-3 hours of your life.\nC# is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. C#’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\nThis is the class I wish I had when I was trying to learn C# Programming. I have a unique way of teaching, as I know how it must be overwhelming to learn a very complex programming language. Best part of this course is No prior programming experience is required.\nThis tutorial introduces the student informally to the basic concepts and features of the C# language and system. It helps to have a C# compiler handy for hands-on experience, but I have also provided downloadable lecture notes so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.\nC# is one of the most powerful yet simple to learn programming languages in the world. What makes C# stand out from other programming languages is its simplicity.\nC# is mainly used for Game Development, Web Development and Software projects.\nSo if you want to make a fun app or a ground breaking software’s. This is where you start - Basics of C#.\nI will walk you through everything you need to start writing fun programs. From Basics of C# to all the complex concepts of C#. All that and more in just 3 hours.\nYou will learn by writing working programs. This course will solidify all the basic C# concepts.\nStill not sold?\nHere's What People Are Saying About My Programming Courses:\n\"Excellent Course. Worth every Dollar.\nI always wanted to learn python. Few months back I purchased Ajay's C++ course and I loved it. I was excited to see him release a course on python. The course doesn't deviate from topic like most courses on Python. This course didn't disappoint at all. I am only half way in the course, but I am still able to write small programs. Downloadable lecture notes makes the learning process a lot easier. If you are a beginner like me and want to write fun programs on Python fast, look no further and enroll this course\"\n\"Perfect Course for Beginners at Wonderful Price.\nWell, I was little concerned about enrolling this course as it was just released, but I have to say it beats all the other C++ Courses in the market. The best part is that it’s just 2 hours, the content is straight forward and doesn't waste your time just as it’s said in the promo video. Worth every buck! Will recommend it to all the beginners.\"\n\"Very Good Course for Beginners\nThis course covers all the Basic concepts of C++ in easily understandable and interactive way. The instructor Ajay is also very helpful and replies readily to your queries and doubts. Overall I would strongly recommend this course to you if you are looking for basic knowledge of C++.\"\n\"Excellent Course\nI really enjoyed taking this course. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in C++. It covers all the basics and good tips are given during the course. Ajay certainly knows the subject he teaches here. Looking forward to his next course.\"\n\"Good primer\nI'm brand new to Python, so this course was really just what I needed. I would like it to have been a bit longer, and go a bit deeper, but as a brand new Python coder, I really enjoyed it and learned the basics.\"\nSO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

      "description": "Secure Coding and Design Practice in Java\n\n\n\n\nSecure coding is a way of writing computer programs that makes them less vulnerable to security threats like hacking and viruses or data leaks.\nWhen we write software, we want to make sure it is built in a way that keeps it safe from the attackers who might want to break in and do real bad things, like steal information or cause damage to the application or data.\nOne of the rough truth is that new vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered, which can compromise the security of software systems. This means that even if a software application was secure at one point in time, it may become vulnerable to attack as new weaknesses are identified and exploited by attackers.\nWhat is the way to achieve this?\nThe answer is we have to follow certain guidelines and best practices at every stage of development that help us identify and address potential security risks. By doing this, we can better protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorised access or manipulation of the software by attackers.Also, focussing on applications security and updating the application time to time as per the updating security standards.\nIt's essential to prioritise secure coding practices because most businesses today rely on software to run their operations. Software can either be custom-made specifically for the business or purchased from other companies. Building software can be a time-consuming and costly process, but unfortunately, the security of the software often doesn't receive enough attention\nIt is not part of day to day programming by developers. There are a few challenges that architects and developers face to achieve code security:\nLack of knowledge:\nMany new developers may not have a comprehensive understanding of secure coding practices and may not be aware of the potential vulnerabilities in their code.\nLimited resources:\nSmall teams or individual developers may not have the resources to implement complex security measures or to conduct thorough testing of their code.\nTime constraints: Developers may be under pressure to deliver code quickly, which can lead to shortcuts being taken and security being overlooked.\nEvolving threats:\nThe security landscape is constantly changing, and new threats can emerge quickly. Developers need to stay up-to-date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities to ensure that their code remains secure.\nCompatibility issues:\nSecure coding can sometimes conflict with other requirements, such as compatibility with legacy systems or third-party software, which can make it difficult to implement.\nThese are the challenges faced during the development. The best solution to this is to know the security practices prior to start a new development so that they can be taken in consideration from the very start.This means making sure that all developers understand the basics of secure coding practices and that security is considered throughout the development process Developers should educate themselves on secure coding practices and keep themselves updated with new security vulnerabilities and their solutions.\n\n\nTOC :\n1.

      "description": "Comprehensive ASP.NET MVC is an introduction to Microsoft’s ASP.NET MVC web development framework. Assuming no knowledge of ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC, we will create a data-driven blog engine from scratch. This 14 hour series is all you need to get started quickly with building real, production-ready, web applications using Microsoft’s .NET framework.\nWhy learn ASP.NET MVC?\nASP.NET MVC is one of the most popular web development frameworks today. It is built and maintained by Microsoft, and provides us with a lean, modern environment for making our web development projects a reality. In addition, the tooling support from Visual Studio is second to none.\nFinally, ASP.NET MVC allows us to develop web applications using any .NET language. We will be using the expressive, powerful, and modern language C#. Although there are other web development frameworks available for .NET, ASP.NET MVC is a first class citizen in the .NET ecosystem - giving it a powerful edge over alternatives.\nWhat will we build?\nThis series is organized in a project-focused manner. We will build up a simple blog engine that supports users, roles, posts and tags.\nThe straightforward and well understood nature of a product like this allows us to focus on what matters: ASP.NET MVC. Building a complete, production-ready product from scratch makes our content much more interesting and fluid, and, above all else: practical.\nWhat will you learn in this series?\nThis series goes over the most important features of ASP.NET MVC: routing, areas, asset bundling, controllers, the Razor view engine, data binding and validation. We also will be using the mature and very powerful nHibernate OR/M to access our database; and the Fluent Migrator database migration framework to version our database schema in source control. In this series we also take a look at security issues - from CSRF and XSS attacks, to making sure our errors aren’t displayed to our customers.\nAlthough this is not a frontend web development series, we will be using both jQuery and Bootstrap 3 to substantially speed up our development and provide a modern, sleek, user interface for our product. The foundation we lay can serve as a launching point for your own design needs.\nIf that isn't enough, we also take a look at deployment to a real Windows server. In addition to configuring IIS and showing how to run our migrations to populate its schema - we introduce Web Deploy. Web Deploy is a product that allows us to publish our web application right from inside of Visual Studio (or even a command line tool if you wish to integrate this with your Continuous Integration server). We install Web Deploy on the Windows server, show some common pitfalls and get everything up and running from inside of Visual Studio.\nWhat do you need to follow this series?\nAll code in this series can be written using the free express editions of Visual Studio 2012 or later. The deployment process outlined in this series can be applied to Windows Server 2012 - but can also be used with normal, desktop versions of Windows for development purposes.\nWe will also be using MySQL as our database. In addition, to manage our database, we use the free MySQL Workbench product that is available via the same MySQL installer that includes the database itself. We assume that Visual Studio, MySQL and MySQL workbench are installed on your machine.\nWe also assume an understanding of C# up to basic object orientation. We won’t be using any advanced features of the language, except for our limited use of LINQ to query our database.",

      "description": "Docker has taken the development world by storm in recent years, being the first effective tool that wraps up a piece of software in a complete file system package, installs it on a server, and runs it repeatedly. However, until recently it was difficult to do this with micro-architectures composed of numerous containers that all need to work in conjunction with one another. Enter Docker Compose, the handiest tool to hit the tech world since Docker. Here’s everything you need to know...\nLearn Docker Compose Inside Out\nDefine multi-container application environments\nCreate flexible, customisable environments and networks\nTransform an existing application into a fully Docker-ised environment\nEnhance your Docker experience\nMake Your Docker Experience Even More Stress-Free\nThis Docker Compose online course will make you a DC expert, learning the tool from top to bottom. It has been specifically designed for those that already know Docker, so you’ll skip the baby steps and dive straight in. First you’ll cover the basic features using a sample environment, gaining an understanding of restarts, dependencies, and persisting the database with a volume.\nAfter that you’ll progress to networks. You’ll take an in-depth look at isolating containers, aliases and container names, links, using external networks, and how updates affect networking. Then it’s on to the really good stuff; a section each is dedicated to volumes, logging, the Compose CLI, and ‘Composing Compose’ (don’t worry, it won’t be as complicated as it sounds by the time you get there).  Finally you’ll learn about Compose in Production.\nThe course is organised into logical sections so you can progress at your pace and in your own time. By the end, you’ll apply what you’ve learned to create a large environment for a sample legacy system, using all of the features covered in previous sections. You’ll then have the skills and confidence needed to go forth and create your own flexible application environments with Docker Compose.\nAbout Docker Compose\nDocker Compose is a useful tool from the people at Docker. It makes defining and running application environments made up of multiple Docker containers even easier and more efficient.  Up until now, starting any more than one or two Docker containers was extremely complicated. With Docker Compose, the entire process just got infinitely better.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Python for Everyone: A Hands-On Programming Adventure course by Uplatz.\n\n\nPython is one of the popular high-level, interpreted and general-purpose programming languages that is easy to use, comprehensive and powerful. In 1991, Guido van Rossum developed the Python programming language.\nPython is a widely used dynamic programming language compared to other languages such as Java, Perl, PHP, and Ruby. It is often termed as a scripting language. It provides support for automatic memory management, multiple programming paradigms, and implements the basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). Python is very simple, yet incredibly powerful programming language. You can use it for writing web and desktop apps, scripts, and more. This course teaches you the basics of Python syntax, functions, creating console and web apps, and distribution.\nPython is a strongly-typed procedural language along with support for a huge and broad standard library. The library of Python provides support for many Internet protocols such as FTP, and IMAP. It has a unique syntax, which makes it different from other programming languages like Java, C++, and C. Some other amazing features of Python are as follows:\nOpen source language\nSimple and easy to learn the language\nScalable and portable language\nHigh-level language\nPython has some great applications. It is widely used in the development of frameworks such as Django and Pyramid, and advanced content management systems. Python is an excellent first language for new programmers. It can be used for everything from video games to data visualization to machine learning.\nAlong with being the fastest growing programming language, Python is the language of choice for data science and it is widely used to build web application backends. In this remote course, you will get an in-depth hands-on understanding of Python fundamentals from a beginner to advanced level.

During these lessons I will be guiding you through this course that unlock the main capabilities the new ABAP debugger can offer to you.\n\nBe ahead in the market. This course can differentiate you from others by taking you one step further.\n\nLearn all the capabilities of the New ABAP Debugger and be able to, among others:\nFind programming errors much easier\nEncounter that configuration that needs to be changed but no one can find\nUnderstand the problem with your selection criteria that is preventing your program from running\nSimulate a different program behavior by changing runtime data and\nUnderstand which routine or command is causing that long time a program is taking to finish.\nThe course will start with a bonus package: basic ABAP concepts, because nothing is more frustrating than knowing what the tooling can offer but having no clue of what all those commands do or why they were called in that sequence. ABAP programmers can skip this part and dive into the debugger lessons immediately.\n\n\n\nThe debugger lessons will present an overview of the debugger, at first, and then will deep dive in all of its capabilities, for example:\nCode execution\nBreakpoints\nWatchpoints\nHow to customize the debugger and\nHow to save the current status for future use\nThis course is designed for you. Both members of the functional and development teams will benefit from it. The ABAP introduction will it beginners in a higher level of understanding before the debugger is presented in detail.Start the course now, gain new skills and be ahead in the market.",

      "description": "Software Engineering interviews focus on the coding and software designing skills in an interview. These are fondly known as Algorithm and Design rounds respectively. The Algorithms round check the raw coding skills of a candidate, by the application of Data Structures and Algorithms mostly practiced in school, while the Design round tests the System design skills, which can be High Level Design [HLD] or Low Level Design [LLD].\nLow Level Design is also known as Object Oriented Design [OOD] or Object Oriented Analysis and Design [OOAD]. From interns to Senior Software Engineers, top companies dedicate at least one round in the entire interview process for system design. For candidates having less than 3 years' of experience, Low Level Design plays the most crucial role because these candidates are inexperienced, hence not supposed to have knowledge of High Level Design. Candidates having experience of more than 3 years usually face the system design interviews with a mix of both HLD and LLD.\nThis course Low Level System Design focuses on the low level aspects of the design. The only way to get better at interviews is by practicing lots of similar problems. In this course, based upon my research, a list of most frequently asked questions in interviews is compiled. Not only is this useful for the interviews, but also for general problem solving and application design.\nEvery problem is broken down and discussed in a comprehensive manner:\nMaking the problem statement clear of any ambiguity. Terminologies related to the problem are explained and expectations well laid out.\nClass Diagram construction serves as a road map for coding the problem\nThe coding is done in the most elegant manner such that the users learn to approach the problem top-down. This is important because even if the class diagram is in place, it's imperative to know the sequence of class construction in program, for a smooth experience.\nWherever applicable, the code is optimized further. Trade offs related to optimization are also discussed.\nAt last, test case construction is shown to make the candidate wary about writing good test cases, and their impact on the application.\nAll this is done while following industry best practices. Proper time utilization during the interview is also talked about intermittently, and ways to deal with a situation when the candidate is stuck at a problem for a long time. The coding is done in C++ but the code is language agnostic to a great extent.\nThe course also sports Closed Captions [English Subtitles] for all the videos. They are hand-crafted, not auto-generated. This feature is helpful when the student is having problem with the accent, there's a lot of background noise present, or when you want to make detailed notes from the explanation.\nAfter taking this course, you\nWill be in a better place to face LLD interviews.\nCan participate in design discussions related to such problems\nWrite better code than before\nHave a proper theater to break the problem into pieces and deal with them independently\nGuaranteed Takeaway\nIf you understand all the problems presented in this course, there won't be any fear of solving LLD questions. You'll be asking the right questions about the problem, and will be confident to jab at any design.",

      "description": "Are you tired of checking multiple courses on Python and not found even one which meets your actual requirements?\n\n\nMost beginners study core part of the programming easily but actual programming starts after core programming is finished, since most of real world problems are solved by using programming paradigms such as iteration, recursion, comprehension, object oriented programming etc.\nMost of the preceding topics are heavily influenced by fundamental mathematics, I will try to teach you fundamental mathematics through these programming paradigm such as iteration and recursion through this course.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis course is for you if you want to:\n- build the skills you need to get your first Python programming job\n- learn basic to advance programming paradigm\n- get started with some domain of Python such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography and so on\n- Learn as a self taught programmer who want to freelance\n…then you need a solid foundation in Python programming. And this course is designed to give you those core skills, fast.\nThis course is aimed at complete beginners who have never programmed before, as well as existing programmers who want to increase their career options by learning Python.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn this course, you will get more exercises and challenges than real theory part, because I believe if any beginner programmer want to excel in Python, he or she must write some code following python programming paradigm such as recursion, iteration etc.\nCourse contains above 45 exercises and many more challenges and quizzes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFAQ's|| Must Read before Enrolling:\nIs Python A Good First Programming Language To Learn?\nEven though it has not yet been adopted as a first language by many computer science programs, Python is widely seen by industry experts as a great first programming language when learning to code and its extensive use in SpaceX to automate and handle technologies to launch rockets, Instagram, Google to support their backends and Many companies to support and execute ML and Deep Learning Algorithms; Its undoubtedly No.1 Programming Language to learn.\nFor starters, the syntax of Python is simpler than that of most other major programming languages, with fewer exceptions and special cases. It also tends to use plain English keywords in place of the system of punctuation that has to be memorized in other languages, making it easier to learn to code. Given these conventions, Python code tends to appear as less of a \"jumble\" to newcomers than it does in comparable languages.\nAnother great feature of Python is the ubiquity of its use. While Python is optimized for development on Linux and Unix systems, interpreters are available for just about every major operating system. All implementations of Python are supported by an excellent standard library, which means that new students can very quickly move on to creating actual functional programs that are useful. Additionally, the standard implementation of Python, CPython, is free and open-source.\nWhat Type Of Jobs Are Available To Python Programmers?\nIn the job market, if you observe the trends; Python is often looked like a strong language to support some primary language that is more broadly used like C or Java. But Lately, with the evolution of ML and Deep Learning Algorithms; it is highly demanded skill to have in 2020 and later. There are a variety of jobs that one can get focusing exclusively on Python development, however. Many of these jobs will be in building and improving the internal tools that a company uses to create its finished marketable products, rather than working on the finished product itself.\nOne specific economic sector where the presence of Python programming is particularly strong is the geospatial industry. This is a critical industry that deals with navigational tools such as GPS, radar, and light measurements.\nIf you're interested in web applications, Python is a better choice for development (working with the back-end or server-side) rather than design (creating the actually finished front-end that site visitors interact with). As mentioned previously, Google employed Python for many components of its search engine, and it is quite widely used in the data mining industry.\nFinally, Python can also be used for game development. Some famous examples of games developed either entirely or in large part with Python include EVE Online, Civilization IV, the Battlefield game series, and the Mount & Blade games. The popular development environment Blender is written in Python.\nReady to get started, My PYTHON PROGRAMMER Friend?\nEnroll now using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to creative, advanced Python brilliance. Or, take this course for a free spin using the preview feature, so you know you’re 100% certain this course is for you.\nSee you in the class!\nJust give it a try, you won't regret!!",

      "description": "There are three types of programmers – those who write small programs, those who write big programs and those who write small programs that do big things. The last type of programmers are often considered as experts.\nAlthough, originally programs required hours of long coding to do even the smallest of computation, today one line programs can do so much more than the n number of lines required. The need to break away from the tedious long and complex coding is what resulted in the creation of functional programming languages.\nFunctional programming languages depend on mathematical functions to compute problems and the results of a code are dependent on the arguments put into the function rather than the statements.\nThis is where Clojure, a functional programming language comes into the picture.\nClojure is a functional programming language that is a dialect of Lisp Programming language. The language was designed for Java Virtual Machines (JVMs), Common Language Runtime and JavaScript engines. It uses a programming approach that allows you to write much of the application code as a series of pure functions and is immutable.\nClojure has a macro system and treats code as data, a term that means programming structure of the language is similar to the language’s syntax. The language was created by Rich Hickey because he wanted a language that was a LISP-based functional programming language that was designed for concurrency and was symbiotic with an established platform. So, he created the powerful Clojure programming language!\nAnd we created a course to help users learn this powerful functional language.\nOur Clojure tutorial is a complete course that is designed to teach you not only the conceptual and fundamentals of Clojure but to also help you understand the design behind the language. It will cover all ins and outs of Clojure, including the basics.\nOnce we understand the basics, we will delve further into the language by dissecting small blocks of Clojure code to understand how it functions. Additionally, we will also go into detail about the various features of Clojure such as abstractions, data structures, forms, macros, symbols, functions, vector types, sequences, lists, etc.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Click enroll and let’s start writing small programs that do bigger things!!",

To keep on top of the game and broaden your skill set, picking up a few of these new languages never hurts. Google Go (golang) is the programming language created by one of the largest technology names in the world – Google – so having Go in your arsenal is a surefire way to add to your coding credentials. This course will teach you everything you need to know about Go.\nHands on Programming Training\nLearn Go fundamentals and apply them in real world scenarios\nGet to grip with advanced features like Go Language and Concurrency\nUnderstand and develop your knowledge of programming fundamentals\nBuild up a knowledge foundation for more advanced programming languages\nEverything you Need to Get up and Go!\nThis course has been designed for anyone who is familiar with coding and programming languages, but has not yet turned their hand to Google Go. It's also perfect for beginner programmers who want to diversify their skills by learning a new language. It's not intended for complete beginners learning their first language, although it does make an excellent follow-up course.\nThe course is broken into several different sections which become increasingly more advanced as you progress. Over 41 lectures and 4 hours, you will be continuously challenged but able to move at a comfortable pace (without becoming overwhelmed). It's all about hands on training, so expect to jump right into the action and get coding with real world golang examples.\nAfter you've been introduced to the Go language, you'll get to grips with its individual features, functions, structures and interfaces. You'll then expand your knowledge to elements like polymorphism, encryption and concurrency (among others) before tackling the course project. On completion, you'll be well versed in all things Go and ready to either start using it in real world applications, or move on to another more advanced programming language.\nTools Used\nLiteIDE: Lite IDE is the open source integrated development environment used in conjunction with Go to write code. If you are unable to use LiteIDE for this course, golang is a useful alternative.\nGoogle Go: Go is an open source programming language developed by Google and used in many of their systems (as well as in other applications not associated with Google).

We start off with Inline Assembly, and that is Assembly code wrote inside C/C++. I choose to do so because I want to start simple and then move on to real Assembly.\nI Explain Important Concepts such as Registers, Stack, Memory Access, Jumps, Conditional Jumps.

It will show you how to set up your CI environment, by installing and configuring Jenkins master/nodes, introducing the main parts of the tool, and effectively configuring Jenkins projects to build and test software applications. You will work on improving the quality of your delivery process by implementing an acceptance stage in workflows. You will explore how automation works for database scripts by adding a new stage to your pipeline for database migration. You will move towards improving the quality of your software development workflow by integrating Jenkins with GitHub to automatically build pull requests.\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Effective Jenkins: Getting Started with Continuous Integration, covers key concepts of continuous integration, as well continuous deployment. You will understand the main parts of Jenkins and create different types of Jenkins projects to automate everything that you want. You will finish the first course by looking at a Java web project and creating the necessary steps to build and test it, thereby empowering you to implement it in a real project.\nThe second course, Effective Jenkins: Continuous Delivery with Jenkins Pipeline, covers key concepts of DevOps and delve into Jenkins Pipeline, a set of plugins that provides a toolkit for designing simple-to-complex delivery pipelines as code. To design a production-ready delivery pipeline, you will start by creating a simple pipeline and understanding Jenkins Pipeline terms and its particularities. Next, you will set up Docker to create isolated build environments. To consolidate your learning, you will create a delivery pipeline to build, test, and deploy a Java web project.\nIn the third course, Effective Jenkins: Improving Quality in the Delivery Pipeline with Jenkins, you will improve the quality in your delivery process by implementing an acceptance stage in workflows wherein you will learn different test types and add automated API and UI tests to the pipeline. You will then understand how to automate the execution of database scripts and add a new stage to your pipeline to manage database migrations. You will also learn about branching strategies and how to implement continuous feedback on every feature branch using Jenkins multi-branch. Finally, you will improve the quality of your software development workflows and learn how to integrate Jenkins with GitHub to automatically build pull requests.\nBy the end of this Learning Path, you’ll be thoroughly equipped with the concepts of Jenkins and will be able to configure Jenkins effectively to build, test, and deploy your software.\nMeet Your Expert(s):\nWe have the best work of the following esteemed author(s) to ensure that your learning journey is smooth:\nRodrigo Zacheu Russo is a Certified Jenkins Engineer and has 14+ years of experience in software development with different programming languages and technologies in different countries (Brazil, US, Portugal, Germany, and Austria) and projects in companies ranging from a financial institution to game and e-commerce ventures including Goodgame Studios, and HERE.

      "description": "Hello,\nWelcome to the \"Typescript: Type script & React Typescript from Scratch\" course.\nTypescript course helps you understand Typescript in detail with hands-on Typescript & React Typescript projects\nTypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It introduces additional features like strict type binding (variables are bound to specific data types) to JavaScript and can also be compiled down to Java Script as well. TypeScript, Typescript, Type script, typescript react, react typescript\n\nTypeScript is a programming language that helps developers turn medium-sized JavaScript projects and prototypes into large-scale ones. JavaScript, a widely-used programming language, was designed to be easy to use for developers and non-developers alike. As a result, JavaScript development is difficult to scale up. Microsoft introduced TypeScript to solve this scalability problem. TypeScript is often referred to as JavaScript with type because it allows developers to find errors while writing their code rather than wait until the application is running. And because TypeScript is a syntactical superset of JavaScript, any JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program.\nTypeScript is a superset of typed JavaScript (optional) that can help build and manage large-scale JavaScript projects. It can be considered JavaScript with additional features like strong static typing, compilation, and object-oriented programming.\nTypeScript is broadly used by developers in Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and many more. Apart from these giants, many start-ups are working on TypeScript. TypeScript is having many technical features, some of them are as follows…\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming: TypeScript provides all features of Object-Oriented Programming where you can form objects because TypeScript provides inbuilt support for classes, interfaces, and many more features of OOP. It helps in designing and implementing them with clean and scalable code. This feature of TypeScript separates it from others and it makes the code more readable which helps to easily maintain and alter code.\n\nJavaScript Library: Typescript supports all the JavaScript libraries and you can change your existing JavaScript project into TypeScript by just changing the extension of the file .js to .ts. You can work with Typescript along with React, Vue, and Angular. Typescript is a superset of JavaScript i.e. Typescript includes ES5 version of JavaScript and ES6 version of JavaScript along with interfaces, generics, classes, and many more features.\n\nStatic Typing: Typescript takes the robust code at another level to write scripts which helps in writing and maintaining larger codes especially in the case of scripting which helps in analysis of code. You don’t have to wait till the runtime to find bugs in your code which reduces complications of designing. It promotes dependable refactoring and makes it faster.\n\nDependency Injection: Typescript allows you to create objects outside the class and provide those objects to a class in many different ways. Typescript helps in the creation and binding of the dependent objects outside of the class that need them. This helps a lot in testing.\n\nOther Features: Typescript compiles the code into the version of JavaScript which helps the code to run on all browsers. TypeScript also has Intellisense which is really helpful in giving hints for code. It supports encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and other OOP features. Typescript code is more readable, clean, and scalable. Typescript is a strongly typed language that supports prototypes, dynamic types, and constructor functions. Also, it helps in changing the document using API. The module is another amazing feature of Typescript just like namespaces.\nThis course is for beginners. To be able to take this course, all you need is the basic understanding of JavaScript.\nIn this course, we're going to start with the basics and I'm going to show you how fun it is to build Type Script programs. After you're familiar with the syntax, we're going to move on to more advanced Type script development techniques, such as: working with closures, object-oriented programming, real-time asynchronous development, and decorators.\nYou'll also learn that you're not limited to Angular 2+ or plain JavaScript/ Typescript Projects. A complete Module covers how to use TypeScript with ReactJS to benefit from its Features, there, too.\n\nThis is a beginner-level TypeScript tutorial, however, a knowledge of JavaScript will be very helpful. If you have no exposure to Javascript you should consider taking one of Oak Academy Java Script courses, either before or after this course.\nI tried to tell all complex topics in very detail on the course. I used some diagrams to tell some important topics and created applications.\n\nWhat is Typescript?\nTypeScript is a programming language that helps developers turn medium-sized JavaScript projects and prototypes into large-scale ones. JavaScript, a widely-used programming language, was designed to be easy to use for developers and non-developers alike. As a result, JavaScript development is difficult to scale up. Microsoft introduced typescript react to solve this scalability problem. TypeScript is often referred to as JavaScript with typescript react because it allows developers to find errors while writing their code rather than wait until the application is running. And because TypeScript  is a syntactical superset of JavaScript, any JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program.\n\nWhat is the difference Typescript and Javascript?\nTypescript is a superset of JavaScript. As its name suggests, Type script adds optional static typing to the JavaScript language. JavaScript is a scripting language that allows developers to create dynamic web content. It is known for being fairly easy to use and learn. This makes it a popular programming language for small and medium-scale web projects. Developers use Type script when they need to scale up their JavaScript development. Its language is more powerful and intuitive, allowing developers to find and correct errors during compile time, rather than only during run-time, as with JavaScript. TypeScript is better suited than JavaScript for large applications, but it requires a foundational knowledge of JavaScript to use.\n\nWhat careers use Typescript?\nTypeScript is mainly associated with development careers. Typical job titles for TypeScript developers include senior developer, front end developer, stack developer, and software engineer. Because react typescript and typescript node is a superset of JavaScript, learning react typescript is a great next step for engineers who are already skilled in JavaScript. Programming knowledge is applicable in just about every industry, so developers with an understanding of TypeScript (which implies skill in JavaScript) might work in a wide range of fields building applications for both server-side and client-side execution.\n\n\nIs TypeScript a language or framework?\nTypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.\n\n\nWhich is better JavaScript or TypeScript?\nJavaScript is better suited for small-scale applications, while TypeScript is better for larger applications. TypeScript supports static typing but JavaScript does not. TypeScript supports interfaces but JavaScript does not. TypeScript features prototyping but JavaScript does not.\n\n\nWhy should I learn TypeScript?\nIt supports encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and other OOP features. Typescript code is more readable, clean, and scalable. Typescript is a strongly typed language that supports prototypes, dynamic types, and constructor functions. Also, it helps in changing the document using API.\nDo I need to learn TypeScript for angular?\nYou can write Angular applications in either TypeScript, ES6 or even ES5 JavaScript. However Angular itself is written in TypeScript, most examples on the web are written in TypeScript, most Angular jobs require you to write TypeScript so this book will be teaching in TypeScript.\n\nWhat is TypeScript and why use it?\nTypeScript features, syntax, and keywords in nodejs typescript\nTooling and Framework Options\nHow to create a class\nTypeScript variables and functions in angular typescript\nTypeScript declarations\nTypeScript classes and interfaces\nMuch more...\n\n\nAt the end of the course;\nTypes and how to use them\nHow the TypeScript Compiler works\nES6 Features in TypeScript\nClasses in TypeScript\nInterfaces\nunderstanding typescript\nIn this TypeScript tutorial, you will learn the key concepts and features to get started building applications with TypeScript. Topics that are covered include:\n\nThis course is going to take you from the beginning to a further level.\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nOAK Academy based in London is an online education company.

      "description": "The module encapsulates learning for BASIC Programming skills of Python with source codes explained with an output screen. The programs are executed and coded well with the input screen and explanation to make learning fun for the kids and adults who are keen to learn python in a big bang way.\nThrough participation in this course, students will get an in-depth education in the coding skills of BASIC, which may subsequently be used while working with Python. During this workshop, not only will an overview of the source codes be provided, but participants will also be led through a tour of the output screen. The fact that the programs are well produced and well programmed, in addition to the fact that they come with an input screen and explanation that are designed to make the experience more user-friendly, has the potential to make learning Python in a big bang approach enjoyable not only for children but also for adults who are interested in the subject matter. This is because the programs come with an input screen and explanation that are designed to make the experience more user-friendly. This is due to the fact that the apps come equipped with an input screen that is intended to make the experience easier to navigate and utilize. I would want to take this opportunity to wish everyone the very best of luck in their pursuit of more education, and I hope that you all are successful in accomplishing your objectives. Cheers.",

      "description": "Welcome to the best resource online for learning modern Pydantic, a data validation library that has taken the python community by storm.\nPydantic is was first released in 2018 and has since become one of the most popular python libraries. It is nowadays downloaded more than 130 million times a month, and is used by some of the largest organizations out there, from the tech giants like Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Netflix, to large conglomerates in various other industries, such as Starbucks, JPMorgan Chase. Oh, and yes, even NASA.\nThere's a good reason for this. Pydantic is a powerful library that elegantly solves a very common problem in software development: data validation.\nPydantic's speed, simple declarative syntax, and extensibility make it an indispensable utility in modern python development.\nAnd in this course, you will learn everything you need to know to get started with Pydantic, from the very basics of defining data models, to more advanced topics such as fields with factory defaults, creating custom model-validators, data serialization, and much more.\nThe first part of the course will be purely about pydantic, where we explore it in isolation. You will learn:\n\n\nhow to define data models with pydantic\nhow to compose more complex models from simpler ones via inheritance\nthe foundations of type hinting in python, including enumerations, literals, and other advanced types-\nhow to use pydantic's powerful validation system\nhow to serialize and deserialize data\nhow to extract models to schemas\nhow to validate data against pydantic models\n\n\nThen in the second part of the course we will turn our attention to the Capstone Project, where we will use pydantic to develop and deploy a python web API that allows users to create and vote on polls. This app will use Redis as our durable key-value data store, and will be deployed to production as a serverless function.\nThe Capstone will be developed step by step, in a series of about 30 skill challenges, where you will be asked to incrementally implement small features. This will give you the opportunity to practice what you've learned in the first part of the course, and to:\n\n\nget a practical feel for how Pydantic is used in real-world applications\nlearn about modern API development with python\nunderstand what Redis is and how it can be used as a durable data store\nlearn about virtual environments and dependency management in python\npractice using git and github\nlearn the basics of serverless computing by deploying the API as a serverless function\nThe course will use the latest version of Pydantic, which leverages the power of Rust to achieve blazing fast performance.\nAlso, if you're new to python or haven't used the used the language in a while, there's a full-featured python crash course included as an extra appendix which will get you up to speed in no time.\nI'm very excited to share this with you, and I look forward to seeing you in the course!",

For Windows, Mac and Ubuntu 12.04+ it is complete and should normally work out of the box. For Linux/Unix systems there are a few prerequisites to be setup.\nDisclaimer: I do not claim any rights to the SikuliX language, Sikuli and SikuliX IDE are properties of their respective owners.

Introduction - where we discuss what is clean code and why it's important\n2. Small Functions - I gave small functions an entire section because I think its one of the most important principles of clean code, together with small classes, Single Responsibility Principle and Not crossing Different Levels of Abstraction.\n3. Clean code: Fundamental Principles - I discuss here about fundamental things like method and variables names, parameters, comments and exceptions\n4. Clean code: Advanced Principles - Here I talk about more abstract topics like the difference between an OOP Object and a Data Structure Object, Composition over Inheritance, Symptoms of Bad Code, State, Low Coupling - High Cohesion, Command and Query Separation, Tell Don't Ask, The Law of Demeter and more.\n\nThe course also contains some memes because you can't spell clean code without fun.\nI tried to focus on things you can use every day when programming and stay away from barren theory.\nThere's no point wasting our time with useless knowledge that would just seem like it's helping you as a programmer, but that you will forget in 2 weeks.\nIf that would have been the point, this would be a 10 hours course about programming patterns.\nBut it isn't.\n\nI tried to make the course full of useful information but not too long.\nIf you invest as little as two hours of your life in this course, about the time you would spend watching a movie, you will become a much better developer.",

It begins with an overview of required numerical libraries, such as NumPy and SciPy, and eventually moves on to techniques such as interpolation, curve fitting, and solving systems of differential equations. A heavy emphasis is placed on real world examples; datasets will be examined in lectures, and students will expand on the analysis of these datasets in the 5 thorough course assignments.\nAt the end of this course, you will feel comfortable using python as your preferred programming language in a research setting. In addition (and most importantly) you will have learned to properly interpret output, such as the error on parameters in curve fitting, and what an interpolated data point actually means.\nSome datasets examined include: radioactive particle energy measurements obtained in a crystal detector, photon spectrum in a radiotherapy unit used to treat cancer patients, and photon attenuation data in a block of lead. In the differential equation section, we will look at solving the following systems of equations: the pendulum, projectile motion with friction, the Lotka Volterra equations, and finally (a question that combines most concepts of the course) dark matter evolution throughout the history of the universe.",

It was designed as a multi-paradigm programming language by Microsoft in around 2000 as part of its .NET initiative. The .NET framework and .NET applications are multi-platform applications that you can use with programming languages such as C++, C#, Visual Basic, and COBOL. C# is open-source and was designed to be simple yet modern, flexible yet powerful, and versatile yet easy to learn and program with. Many programming languages in the past were designed for specific purposes. C# was developed with business and enterprise needs in mind. By providing functionality to support modern-day software development such as web applications, mobile, and response app needs, C# supports many features of modern-day programming languages. That includes generics, var types, dynamic programming, asynchronous programming, pattern matching, advanced debugging, and exception handling, to name a few.\nWhat are the advantages of C# over C++?\nThanks to the .NET framework, C# has many advantages over C++. C# is a refined and modernized version of C++. C++ was developed to bring object-orientation to C, an older but widely used language, and C++ became the de-facto language for building applications for Windows as well as infrastructure and low-level applications. Visual Basic was for business applications. What C# does is combine the rapid development capabilities of VB with the power of C++. C# also has many new data types, type-safety, to ensure you do not unknowingly reuse initialized variables. It uses a simplified syntax, a huge improvement over the complex coding often required in C++. C# also removes memory management issues thanks to . NET’s garbage collection scheme. You do not have to reference items for garbage collection; the system can reclaim that memory as required. Finally, you can use C# to interoperate with other languages on the .NET platform, a huge benefit in terms of system interoperability.\nWhy use encapsulation in C#?\nEncapsulation can be used in C# to hide data and program behavior from users. With encapsulation, you can group properties, methods, and other members so that they are treated as a single object. It is a means to prevent the user of a given class from manipulating program objects in ways that were not intended by the designer or developer. Encapsulation hides how a program operates without affecting how it works while still allowing users to service requests for functionality and add or modify internal data or methods to meet changing needs. For example, suppose you have an object called “Patient” that contains patient-related data. In that case, you can use encapsulation to provision patient-specific data to those who need it without exposing all patient data. In addition to information hiding, you can use encapsulation in C# to improve your code's reusability, and it also makes it easier to perform unit testing.\nWhat is C# used for?\nC# is a general-purpose programming language that you can use to build a wide range of programs and applications, such as web applications, Windows applications and game development. In web application development, you can build dynamic websites and apps using .NET or another open-source platform of your choice. Also, since Microsoft created C# for Microsoft, C# is a popular language for building Windows applications. There are rich resources and a vibrant C# community that can support and documentation for applications and programs specific to Microsoft platform architectures, making it easier than ever to develop applications in this space. Finally, C# is a popular language to use in game-building, especially with Unity, a game engine that runs on C++ and C#.\nWhat is a constructor? What is a destructor?\nTo understand constructors and destructors, we need to understand methods. A method is a block of code that contains a series of statements. Programs run by executing methods. A constructor is a special method of a class that is automatically called whenever an instance of a given class is created. A constructor contains the instructions that execute when an object is created. Developers use it to assign specific initial values to the data members of the same class. In C#, you will get a compile-time error if you try to read from an uninitialized variable. You must first initialize your variables by giving them an initial value, which is what the constructor does. On the other hand, destructors are methods used to destroy instances of a class when they are no longer needed. Destructors are called implicitly by the garbage collector in .NET, and as a developer, you have no control regarding when to call the destructor.\nHow do I learn C#?\nAs is true for many skills, you can learn C# by taking Udemy courses, reading documentation, and practicing coding hands-on. There are many resources available for all of the above, including real-time compiler applications that will show you the output of your code as you type it. However, it is best to plan ahead, and you should have an outline of what you need to learn before beginning your journey. The first thing to learn about is what C# is, how and where it is used, and why it was developed. From there, you can learn about data types, variables, keywords, and functions. Once you’ve grasped the basics, you can move on to learning about conditional tests and operators, functions, arguments, object orientation, arrays, strings, classes, methods, structs, debugging, and exception handling.\nWhat is SQL Server?\nSQL Server is a relational database management system or RDBMS created and developed by Microsoft. Designed to store and retrieve data for other software applications using the client-server model-- these applications connect to SQL Server through a network or the Internet with multiple applications using the same data. One SQL Server instance can also manage one or more relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables that can relate to each other. For example, data for business customers get stored in one table relating to another table that stores orders. Applications that connect to Microsoft SQL Server retrieve, store, and delete data using Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL Server is available for Windows and Linux.\nWhat is SQL Server Management Studio?\nSQL Server Management Studio is desktop software designed to connect to Microsoft relational database management systems, including Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Synapse Analytics. SQL Server Management Studio is an integrated database development tool that database architects, database developers, and software engineers can use to access, configure, manage, administer, and develop databases on any one of these database systems. It simplifies database management by providing graphical design tools and rich script editors that allow database developers to visualize an entire database or multiple databases from a single application. SQL Server Management Studio only runs on the Microsoft Windows operating system but can connect to database instances running on either Windows or Linux.\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel our seasoned developers' expertise.\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nIt doesn't need any prior knowledge to learn it and it is easy to understand for beginners.\nThis course starts with the very basics.

It is a very common case - and if it is left for a long time - then it leads to a very complex legacy code after subsequent code extensions.\nWe use refactoring techniques and perform all the changes live. The particitants download the source code and performs all the changes together with the trainer - step by step. In this sample we make use of Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern as goal of our refactoring journey.\nThe journey into Chain of Responsibility allows the attendees to practice code transformations like :\nMerge If Statements\nMerge Nested\nIf Statements\nExtract Methods\nReplace Temp with Query\nMove Methods\nInline Methods\nExtract Class / Extract Delegate\nExtract Interface- Rename Methods & Variables\nThe course ends up with Homework, where the participants can experience the difference between implementing additional requirements within Clean Code and within Legacy Code. This is the difference between skipping and applying Preparatory Refactoring.",

With the right guidance, structured practice, and focus, you can start mastering JavaScript (often called JS) in just one day. This course is designed to prove that you can quickly gain a strong programming foundation if you stay motivated and consistent.\nJavaScript (or java script as beginners sometimes call it) is one of the most in-demand languages in the world. Together with HTML CSS JavaScript, it forms the backbone of modern web development. From interactive websites to powerful apps, JS is everywhere—and now it’s your turn to learn it.\nWhether you are a beginner exploring coding for the first time, a student strengthening your skills, or someone inspired by well-known instructors like Jonas Schmedtmann (Respected), this course will give you the courage and confidence to start building real-world projects in just one day.\nHow This Course Works\nTo make learning simple and engaging, the course is divided into three sessions across one day:\nMorning Session: Environment setup, variables (let, const, and var), input/output, comments, and data types.\nAfternoon Session: Operators, math, strings, and decision-making.\nEvening Session: Loops, arrays, functions, and function overloading.\nThis time-split approach helps you stay focused while mastering one step at a time.\nHands-On Projects Included\nBy the end of the course, you won’t just know JavaScript—you’ll apply it through coding projects:\nSimple Calculator\nTo-Do List Manager\nStudent Grading System\nBasic Voting System\nThese projects are designed to strengthen your coding confidence and prepare you for more advanced challenges.\nWhy Enroll Today?\nThe best way to learn programming is to start now, not later. Every expert once stood where you are today. With practice, persistence, and the foundation you’ll gain here, you’ll be ready to move into advanced JavaScript and even explore popular learning paths like those followed by students of Jonas Schmedtmann.\nThis course will not only give you knowledge—it will give you the courage to code, the motivation to keep practicing, and the confidence to grow as a developer.\nTake action today. Enroll now, and by tomorrow, you’ll already have completed your first step toward becoming a JavaScript developer.\nThank you,\nFaisal Zamir",

      "description": "This course is an introduction to the C and C++ programming language. The C programming language has spurred many language developments since its invention by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s. Many modern programming languages owe their syntax to C. C is still a very popular programming language after over 40 years. C++ is based on C, but extends the language with features such as function templates, namespaces, and (of course) classes.\nIn this course, we'll explore the C and C++ programming language. We'll start with data types of C, then quickly dispel the mystery (and fright) that surrounds C's most powerful element, the pointer. Understanding pointers first allows us to grasp the underlying nature of arrays and structs, parameters passed by reference, and many other things hidden by other languages but exposed in C.\n\nThen we will move to streams in C++ , which simplify input and output a great deal.\nHere's a brief list of what you'll learn:\n\nC Topics :\nData types and operators\nPointers and arrays\nCommand line arguments\nDecisions and loops\nFunctions\nStructures\nThe stack vs. the heap, and dynamic allocation\nC++ Topics :\nPrimitive data types and variables\nHow to create and use namespaces\nBasic I/O in C++ using streams\nFile input and output using streams\nFunction templates - a look at writing generic code\nClasses and objects\nConstructors and Destructors\nInheritance (Single and Multiple)\nIf you've been thinking about learning C and C++, then this course is a good first step.",

Companies building energy analytics platforms, ML systems, and data pipelines desperately need developers who can write Python that scales beyond scripts to enterprise systems. Whether you're modeling complex energy markets, building data science infrastructure, or architecting microservices, these advanced techniques separate senior engineers from junior developers.

You will be able to create data structures such as FIFOs in assembly. You will also be able to create Finite  State Machines such as the Moore Machine using only assembly code.\n\n\nFurthermore, this course teaches you how to navigate the microcontroller reference manual and datasheet to extract the right  information to professionally  build peripheral drivers and firmware. To achieve this goal, no libraries are used in this course, purely ARM Assembly Language. You will be able to write peripheral drivers in assembly-ADC, UART, SYSTICK, GPIO, GPTM.\n\n\nSpecially Designed For People Who Hate Copy/Paste\nListen. If you don’t like “Copy/Paste” you’re not alone. I can’t stand it either. I’d literally rather have a piece of code that I wrote from scratch that doesn’t work than someone else’s working code I copied and pasted.\nAnd that’s why I’ve spent months designing and recording this course in which I show you how to locate every single register used and the meaning of every hexadecimal value written into the register.\n\n\n\n\nREMEMBER : I have no doubt you will love this course. Also it comes with a  FULL money back guarantee for 30 days!  So put simply, you really have nothing to loose and everything to gain.\nSign up and lets start writing some low level code.",

This course offers a unique, hands-on approach to learning Python that goes beyond simply following along with an instructor.\nWhat You’ll Get:\n50 Instructor-Led Projects: Watch as an experienced programmer walks you through the process of building 50 diverse and practical Python applications. Each project is broken down step-by-step, with detailed explanations of the logic and behind every decision.\n50 Independent Projects: After watching the instructor, it's your turn to put what you've learned into practice. You'll receive written project requirements, just like in a professional setting, and build a similar program on your own. This approach ensures that you not only understand the concepts but can apply them independently.\nWhy This Course Stands Out:\nOther courses often require you to replicate what the instructor does in the video, which can be repetitive and unengaging. In this course, you can watch, learn, and then dive into coding with your own project. This method helps you develop real confidence in your programming abilities.\nIs This Course for You?\nThis course is ideal if you already have a basic understanding of Python concepts like variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions. If these fundamentals are still unclear, don’t worry—you’ll see them in action repeatedly and gain a deep understanding by building your own projects.\nBy the end of this course, you'll have built 100 Python projects and gained the experience and confidence to tackle programming challenges on your own.",

But what often isn't clear is what the steps are to becoming a professional developer.\nIt isn't enough to tell someone “Just pick a programming language\" or “Just build an app\". Beginners need more solid guidance, and this course is your starting point and roadmap.\nThis is the first course to take a detailed, insightful behind-the-scenes look at the tech world, and shows how you can join thousands of other people who are ditching their stressful, low paying jobs for well paid programming positions.\nWhat you will learn\nThis course assumes that you have zero knowledge about programming, and we take the “complex\" parts and break them down into smaller chunks that make it easier to digest.\nThe first half of the course discusses topics that lay the groundwork for being a good programmer. We will dive into topics like “What is programming?\" and “Which programming language should I learn first?\"\nIn the second half of the course, you will be learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and seeing how these languages make up the websites you see in your browser. We will focus on making you a highly competent web developer.\nWeb development is a field that is constantly needing programmers. You will be able to take the skills you gain from this course and immediately apply it to the real world.\nIn addition, you will also be learning:\nWhy there are so many programming languages\nHow to approach problems and think like a programmer\nWhat tools and software are needed to develop on your computer\nWhat terms like algorithms, frameworks, and pseudocode are\nCore concepts that are fundamental in any programming language\nHow to know when you are ready to find a job as a programmer\n\n\nSave time, money, and frustration\nThere are endless books, videos, and online tutorials about programming. But none of them actually tell you where you should start.\nThis course will guide you in writing your first line of code. You will see how simple it is, and that all it takes is a willingness to work hard.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding on how to develop websites. You will understand how code translates into the beautiful web pages that you see every day.\nYou will gain skills and knowledge that employers are looking for. You will be able to comfortably explain and understand technical concepts with other developers and hiring managers.",

You will learn programming using relevant sports examples as opposed to rehashed unrelatable exercises.\nThis course is very practical. I’m going to teach you a lot of different concepts right from the start, and you will immediately see how they work in a practice – in real scenarios – because you are programming something from lesson one. Then, we will keep on using and building on these concepts throughout our projects until you become really familiar with them.\nMany other courses take 10-20 videos to go through some of the concepts I introduce in lesson one – and you would be sitting there wondering when you’re going to get to actually program something. With this course, you won’t ever feel that.\nThis course is based on a very successful learning strategy that many experienced programmers encourage, which is to find a project that you enjoy doing, and then learn the concepts you need to complete that project. Then do another project and, learn what you need, and build your knowledge, and so on.\nLearn what you love, love what you do\nSo, if you are ready to invest some time in learning Python – why not enjoy it? It’s a lot easier to learn to program when you’re engaged in the subject matter and working through scenarios that you can picture in real life – and while having fun. So, are you ready to kick-off?

It was designed as a multi-paradigm programming language by Microsoft in around 2000 as part of its .NET initiative. The .NET framework and .NET applications are multi-platform applications that you can use with programming languages such as C++, C#, Visual Basic, and COBOL. C# is open-source and was designed to be simple yet modern, flexible yet powerful and versatile yet easy to learn and program with. Many programming languages in the past were designed for specific purposes. C# was developed with business and enterprise needs in mind. By providing functionality to support modern-day software development such as web applications, mobile, and response app needs, C# supports many features of modern-day programming languages. That includes generics, var types, dynamic programming, asynchronous programming, pattern matching, advanced debugging, and exception handling, to name a few.\nWhat are the advantages of C# over C++?\nThanks to the .NET framework, C# has many advantages over C++. C# is a refined and modernized version of C++. C++ was developed to bring object-orientation to C, an older but widely used language, and C++ became the de-facto language for building applications for Windows as well as infrastructure and low-level applications. Visual Basic was for business applications. What C# does is combine the rapid development capabilities of VB with the power of C++. C# also has many new data types, type-safety, to ensure you do not unknowingly reuse initialized variables. It uses a simplified syntax, a huge improvement over the complex coding often required in C++. C# also removes memory management issues thanks to .NET’s garbage collection scheme. You do not have to reference items for garbage collection; the system can reclaim that memory as required. Finally, you can use C# to interoperate with other languages on the .NET platform, a huge benefit in terms of system interoperability.\nWhy use encapsulation in C#?\nEncapsulation can be used in C# to hide data and program behavior from users. With encapsulation, you can group properties, methods, and other members so that they are treated as a single object. It is a means to prevent the user of a given class from manipulating program objects in ways that were not intended by the designer or developer. Encapsulation hides how a program operates without affecting how it works while still allowing users to service requests for functionality and add or modify internal data or methods to meet changing needs. For example, suppose you have an object called “Patient” that contains patient-related data. In that case, you can use encapsulation to provision patient-specific data to those who need it without exposing all patient data. In addition to information hiding, you can use encapsulation in C# to improve your code's reusability, and it also makes it easier to perform unit testing.\nWhat is C# used for?\nC# is a general-purpose programming language that you can use to build a wide range of programs and applications, such as web applications, Windows applications and game development. In web application development, you can build dynamic websites and apps using .NET or another open-source platform of your choice. Also, since Microsoft created C# for Microsoft, C# is a popular language for building Windows applications. There are rich resources and a vibrant C# community that can support and documentation for applications and programs specific to Microsoft platform architectures, making it easier than ever to develop applications in this space. Finally, C# is a popular language to use in game-building, especially with Unity, a game engine that runs on C++ and C#.\nWhat is a constructor? What is a destructor?\nTo understand constructors and destructors, we need to understand methods. A method is a block of code that contains a series of statements. Programs run by executing methods. A constructor is a special method of a class that is automatically called whenever an instance of a given class is created. A constructor contains the instructions that execute when an object is created. Developers use it to assign specific initial values to the data members of the same class. In C#, you will get a compile-time error if you try to read from an uninitialized variable. You must first initialize your variables by giving them an initial value, which is what the constructor does. On the other hand, destructors are methods used to destroy instances of a class when they are no longer needed. Destructors are called implicitly by the garbage collector in .NET, and as a developer, you have no control regarding when to call the destructor.\nHow do I learn C#?\nAs is true for many skills, you can learn C# by taking Udemy courses, reading documentation, and practicing coding hands-on. There are many resources available for all of the above, including real-time compiler applications that will show you the output of your code as you type it. However, it is best to plan ahead, and you should have an outline of what you need to learn before beginning your journey. The first thing to learn about is what C# is, how and where it is used, and why it was developed. From there, you can learn about data types, variables, keywords, and functions. Once you’ve grasped the basics, you can move on to learning about conditional tests and operators, functions, arguments, object orientation, arrays, strings, classes, methods, structs, debugging, and exception handling.\nWhat is SQL Server?\nSQL Server is a relational database management system or RDBMS created and developed by Microsoft. Designed to store and retrieve data for other software applications using the client-server model-- these applications connect to SQL Server through a network or the Internet with multiple applications using the same data. One SQL Server instance can also manage one or more relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables that can relate to each other. For example, data for business customers get stored in one table relating to another table that stores orders. Applications that connect to Microsoft SQL Server retrieve, store, and delete data using Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL Server is available for Windows and Linux.\nWhat is SQL Server Management Studio?\nSQL Server Management Studio is desktop software designed to connect to Microsoft relational database management systems, including Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Synapse Analytics. SQL Server Management Studio is an integrated database development tool that database architects, database developers, and software engineers can use to access, configure, manage, administer, and develop databases on any one of these database systems. It simplifies database management by providing graphical design tools and rich script editors that allow database developers to visualize an entire database or multiple databases from a single application. SQL Server Management Studio only runs on the Microsoft Windows operating system but can connect to database instances running on either Windows or Linux.\nWhat is .NET?\nAccording to Microsoft, .NET (pronounced dot net) is “a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.” .NET allows you to use “multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.” Applications in .NET can be written using C#, F#, Visual C++, or Visual Basic. There are multiple versions of .NET, such as .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since it’s cross-platform, your code will run natively on any OS that is .NET compatible.\nWhat careers use .NET?\nMost positions offered to .NET programmers involve .NET Development or .NET engineering. But there are numerous applications that come under the umbrella of those two facets of the field. You may specialize in desktop, mobile, web, or cloud-native applications; games; machine learning; microservices; or IoT. You can also specialize in any or all of the programming languages supported by .NET, such as C#, F#, or Visual Basic. Additionally, you may have a broad focus across multiple compatible OS’s or specialize in applications for a single OS.\nIs .NET still used?\n.NET continues to be an open-sourced, cross-platform development platform for multiple applications. For example, it’s used to build web apps and services for Linux, Windows, macOS, and Docker. It’s also used to build native mobile apps for Android, iOS, and Windows, as well as desktop apps for macOS and Windows. Microservices, cloud services, machine learning, game development, and IoT can currently all be developed with .NET. Developers can choose to have a general knowledge of multiple applications across the spectrum or choose to specialize in one specific area of development.\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel our seasoned developers' expertise.\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nIt doesn't need any prior knowledge to learn it and it is easy to understand for beginners.\nThis course starts with the very basics.

      "description": "When you first hear about functional programming you might get the impression that it can only be used in toy examples or for very academic purposes. After all, FP is all about purity and almost every useful thing you can do in a program is impure: http calls, file IO, and so on.\nIn this course I'm going to show you that FP is actually amazing for dealing with effects. By separating program description from execution you will be able to build computations that are easy to compose and reason about, while at the same time keeping all the usefulness of side-effects.\nIn order to do so, we are going to use the amazing Cats Effect library, which provides an IO monad to model our effects, a very rich API to compose them, and a highly-performant runtime to execute them.\nThe course is structured in many small/medium sized sections that focus on one specific topic. At the end of each section there is a final exercise to practice what you learned, and a quiz to help check your recall and understanding of the section.\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to:\n\nWrite and compose computations you want to run, before actually running them.\nDesign an error handling strategy for your application, taking side-effects into consideration.\nIncrease the parallelism and concurrency of your programs without the need to handle low-level details.\nUse and compose resources that need to be released (connections, io streams, etc.) in an elegant manner.\nHandle complex scenarios involving concurent shared state and thread communication by using purely functional primitives.\nHopefully, you will also have some fun along way!",

Programming can be fun as well as challenging.\nIn this beginners course we will be learning to code using four very popular and high in demand programming languages:\n\nJava\nPython\nJavaScript\nC#\n\n\nJava is a general purpose high-level, object-oriented programming language. Java is one of the most commonly used languages for developing  and delivering content on the web. An estimated nine million  Java developers use it and more than three billion mobile phones run it.  Java is an object-oriented language, which means that programmers\ndefine not only the data type of a data structure, but also the  types of functions that can be applied to the data structure.\nPython is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.\nJavaScript is a programming language for the web. It is supported by most web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, internet Explorer, Edge, Opera, etc. Most mobile browsers for smart phones support JavaScript too.\nC# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run on the .NET Framework. You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, distributed components, client-server applications, database applications, and much, much more.\nThe projects we will create are:\nCreating your own Music player with C#\nCreate your own Paint drawing app with C#\nCreate a database driven Login Form with C#\nCreate an Image Upload App with C#\nCreate a word count Tool with Java\nCreate a Percentage Calculator Tool with Java\nCreate a BMI tool with Java\nCreate a Basic calculator with JavaScript\nCreate a Todo App with JavaScript\nCreate an Interactive Quiz App with JavaScript\nCreate a digital clock with Python\nCreate a Times Table Generator with Python",

Instead of providing a solution to the 'view' part of the Model-View-Controller design process, it tackles the client-side application problem as a whole. Whether it's web, mobile, or service applications, Ember works it using the model-view-viewmodel approach and does it flawlessly. If you're a IT professional or just a hobbyist interested in web architecture, UI design, or even testing and administrating, Ember will make your life infinitely easier.\nCreate Ambitious Web Applications\n\n·         Understand how Ember 2 works in web and mobile solutions\n·         Learn how Ember 2 solutions are designed, administered and developed\n·         Code an Ember 2 project with an online IDE\n·         Use Ember's component paradigm, data management library, CLI tool, and more\n·         Implement Ember Add-Ons, routing, authentication, and more\n·         Write and run Unit, Acceptance and Integration tests\n·         Style and Ember app with an Ember Material CSS Library\nLaunch Your Ember 2 Projects Now\nThis Ember 2 online course was designed specifically with web developers who design and build UI/UX solutions in mind. However, the information presented is just as valuable for architects, testers, or product managers. Ideally you'll have some experience in creating web UIs with normal JavaScript tools like jQuery or Bootstrap, as well as programming with an object-oriented or scripting language  and JavaScript development of complete client-side solutions. Ember Experience, on the other hand, is absolutely not necessary.\nThis course will start off by giving you an overview of what Ember is and how and why it works. Then you'll install it and get going with the good stuff! You'll start off with routing, templates and helpers, Ember components and Ember Data, and once you've to grip with the fundamentals you'll begin building your own Ember app.\nYou'll design your app, build it out, create the components and complete the code, and then you'll move on to testing it. But it doesn't stop there; this course also covers more advanced aspects including styling, add-ons and security. By the time you're finished, you'll be more than capable of getting your own Ember projects up and running.\nAbout Ember\nEmber is a free, open-source, JavaScript framework for creating ambitious web applications. It allows web developers and UI/UX developers to create scalable, single-page web apps by incorporating common idioms, reducing code lines with Handlebars-integrated templates, and creating application-specific HTML tags. Websites such as Groupon, Nordstrom and the desktop app Apple Music all use Ember.",

It is the result of my own experience as a trainer in the field of Competitive Programming, teacher, author and (many times) competitor. It is based on the most important theoretical issues and knowledge a student should master. The topics that are discussed stretch from Recursion and its different peculiar applications (Backtracking, Divide and Conquer) to the Branch and Bound method. The course has two different lessons dedicated to the Dynamic Programming Technique, due to the importance this method has.\nThe course contains many well known problems, presents their solutions in a comprehensible way and offers C++ solutions. A clear purpose and objective that the author had in mind was to have neat statements, proper examples, efficient solutions, easy to understand C++ programs. I suppose that the students already have some elementary background in the C++ language, some experience with STL data structures and implemented methods, CodeBlocks Integrated Development Environment, Online Judges .\nEach lesson is followed by some quizzes.\nThe students are advised to try to implement on their own the C++ programs for the problems they encounter in the lessons.\nEvery time when it was possible, I used some pictures, animations, free templates offered by different sites.\nI hope you will enjoy and appreciate this course.",

Did you implemented your own HTTP client or did you ended up using some of the thousand libraries out there? Do you know what your HTTP client is doing in the background?\n\n\nIn this course we're starting from scratch! We're going to remember how a basic HTTP call looks like by digging into the request & response objects. We're going to write a basic HTTP client to perform HTTP requests and then use it in productive applications. What issues do we have? Can we scale our applications by following this approach? Of course not! That's why we're creating an HTTP client library that provides:\nFast, reliable and friction-free HTTP connections.\nSupport for all HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH and more!\nA Concurrency-Safe HTTP client that you can use without worrying about performance.\nContent type management and optimization.\nMocking features out of the box.\nA clean interface in case you want to unit test your code without relying on integration testing features.\nA robust implementation so you won't need any external dependency whatsoever.\nCompletely customizable interface: timeouts, transport layer, custom HTTP client and lots of useful features.\nA library that is PRODUCTION-READY!\nIf you're looking to integrate a 3rd party REST APIs in your code, you'll need to perform an HTTP call to it. Make sure you take a look at this course before even considering alternatives out there that will force you to use different dependencies for running, testing and extending your code! As Robert Pike says: \"A little copying is much better than a little dependency\". In this course we're not only getting rid of the dependencies but we're also getting rid of the copying. We're not using anything more than the Go's standard library to design & develop our own HTTP client.\n\n\nThis client will the baseline for all of the applications we're going to build later, making our business scale and grow as fast as we can Go.\n\n\nTake a look at the preview lessons you have available to have an idea about the structure and content of the course. I know you're going to enjoy it! If you have any doubt, take a look at my other courses and see what my students have to say!\n\n\nSee you on the other side!",

Never fear, we have a detailed video on how to get this downloaded and set up.\nHundreds of lines of source code, and hundreds of lines of comments - just download and open in your IDE!\nA Java course for everyone - accessible yet serious, to take you from absolute beginner to an early intermediate level\nLet’s parse that.\nThis is a Java course for everyone. Whether you are a complete beginner (a liberal arts major, an accountant, doctor, lawyer) or an engineer with some programming experience but looking to learn Java - this course is right for you.\nThe course is accessible because it assumes absolutely no programming knowledge, and quickly builds up using first principles alone\nEven so, this is a serious Java programming class - the gradient is quite steep, and you will go from absolute beginner to an early intermediate level\nThe course is also quirky. The examples are irreverent. Lots of little touches: repetition, zooming out so we remember the big picture, active learning with plenty of quizzes. There’s also a peppy soundtrack, and art - all shown by studies to improve cognition and recall.\nWhat's Covered:\nProgramming Basics: What programming is, and a carefully thought-through tour of the basics of any programming. Installing and setting up an IDE and writing your first program\nThe Object-Oriented Paradigm: Classes, Objects, Interfaces, Inheritance; how an OO mindset differs from a functional or imperative programming mindset; the mechanics of OO - access modifiers, dynamic dispatch, abstract base classes v interfaces. The underlying principles of OO: encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism\nThreading and Concurrency: A deep and thorough study of both old and new ways of doing threading in Java: Runnables, Callables, Threads, processes, Futures, Executors.\nReflection, Annotations: The how, what and why - also the good and bad\nLambda Functions: Functional constructs that have made the crossover into the mainstream of Java - lambda functions, aggregate operators.\nModern Java constructs: Interface default methods; properties and bindings too. Also detailed coverage of Futures and Callables, as well as of Lambda functions, aggregation operators. JavaFX as contrasted with Swing.\nPackages and Jars: The plumbing is important to understand too.\nLanguage Features: Serialisation; why the Cloneable interface sucks; exception handling; the immutability of Strings; the Object base class; primitive and object reference types; pass-by-value and pass-by-object-reference.\nDesign: The MVC Paradigm, Observer and Command Design Patterns.\nSwing: Framework basics; JFrames, JPanels and JComponents; Menus and menu handling; Trees and their nuances; File choosers, buttons, browser controls. A very brief introduction to JavaFX.\nProgramming Drills (code-alongs, with source code included)\nSerious stuff:\nA daily stock quote summariser: scrapes the internet, does some calculations, and outputs a nice, formatted Excel spreadsheet.\nA News Curation app to summarise newspaper articles into a concise email snippet using serious Swing programming\nSimple stuff:\nSupport with choosing a programming environment; downloading and setting up IntelliJ.\nSimple hello-world style programs in functional, imperative and object-oriented paradigms.\nMaps, lists, arrays. Creating, instantiating and using objects, interfaces",

      "description": "This course is an extensive, hands-on program designed to provide a deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Python. This course is perfect for learners aiming to solidify their Python programming skills, with a particular emphasis on OOP principles.\nThe course is structured into several sections, each focusing on different OOP concepts including classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. It covers everything from the basics of creating and using classes, to more advanced topics like inheritance and polymorphism.\nEach section comprises numerous exercises designed to reinforce the concepts learned. The problems vary in difficulty, from simple class creation tasks to complex challenges involving multiple classes and inheritance. Every exercise is followed by a detailed solution, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the application of OOP principles.\nThis course is ideal for Python programmers who want to deepen their understanding of OOP and improve the quality and efficiency of their code. Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer looking to learn OOP in Python, this course offers a valuable learning experience.\n\n\nUnleash the Power of Object-Oriented Magic!\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm widely used in Python and many other languages. In Python, OOP allows developers to organize code into reusable, self-contained objects that encapsulate data and behavior. These objects are created from classes, which serve as blueprints for creating multiple instances.\nThe key concepts of OOP in Python include classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, while objects are instances of classes that can hold data (attributes) and perform actions (methods). Inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, allowing subclasses to inherit and extend the properties of parent classes. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably, enhancing flexibility and code reusability.\nBy using OOP in Python, developers can achieve modularity, abstraction, and code reuse, making it easier to build and maintain complex software systems. OOP facilitates the creation of modular, extensible, and maintainable code, promoting concepts such as encapsulation, separation of concerns, and code organization. Python's support for OOP provides a powerful way to design and implement scalable, efficient, and flexible applications.",

      "description": "If you have ever worked on a real life production application you might have noticed that 70 to 80% of the time, applications are busy doing IO or Input Output.\nIO in the sense : Reading, writing from and to Databases, Files, Disks, calling some APIs etcetera.\nWhy so ? Because Data needs to be persisted somewhere to be used in Future. While an application runs it loads the data in RAM but you know that It's not permanent.\nSo, To make the application perform better, You need to understand three things?\n1. Computing should be done efficiently to save the CPU\n2. Space or RAM should be used effectively and efficiently because that is limited and expensive\nAnd Third and most important thing is\n3. IO should be done in an efficient way.\nWhy am I calling 3rd one most important ? Because if you believe my several years of experience in building large scale production ready applications, Most of the applications spend 70% time doing IO.\nSo In this course what we gonna learn ? We are going to learn Effective Java IO, NIO and NIO2\nAnd what is java way of handling IO?\nLet me quickly brief the agenda of the course to you...\nIn first few sections of the course... we will learn ...\nI/O Basics and classic IO\nIO was introduced in 1996 (Java 1).\nWhich is the classic version.\nIO was pretty popular then, and then modern systems started getting more performant.\nAnd then The next IO upgrade came with java version 4 (2002), which is called NIO.\nTo add support for non-blocking IO for modern operating systems.\nAnd then in 2011, we got new functionalities in Java NIO.\nDon't worry if you are not familiar with NIO or with the non-blocking stuff,\nOr even not familiar to IO. we will discuss everything in this course. We will start with the classic io,\nHere We will talk about file handling, the basic patterns to read and write raw bytes,\nwhich is done using InputStream-Output Stream, we will talk about how we read characters while using classic IO, we have Reader and writers for that.\nAnd we will talk about few more important things from Classic IO,\nWe will learn to read and write structured data, in quite similar fashion to how we do reads and writes in database, for this we will discuss Data streams.\nWe are going to cover Random access File for that.\nThen how to read write a mix of different kinds of data, for example a mix of bytes and characters.\nAfter that we will discuss a very important concept, called serialization-Deserialization, to store state of a java object.\nAnd right after that, we gonna discuss some utility kind of stuff that supports Java IO.\nWhenever I say classic IO, I mean the stuff under io package but when I say Java IO, It includes everything that supports Input-output, whether it is ClassicIO, NIO or NIO2.\nSo, here will see some utility stuff.\nLike how we can improve performance of our code, even if we are not using NIO, for that we will discuss compression techniques. Compression techniques are not io package specific, they are added under the util package in java 7. we can use compression wherever it's needed.\nSo, we will use compressions to enhance the performance while working with IO.\nWe will also discuss few classes which support io and are used in day to day programming.\nSo, that's what we gonna cover under classic IO.\nNext comes NIO.\nWe are not going to start with understanding what NIO is, rather we will first discuss The path utility provided by NIO. It's a utility interface and is used almost everywhere, It's kind of replacement to file utility in today's java.\nThe reason to discuss it earlier is that, before actually starting NIO, we will be familiar with the very basic pattern of Java IO to access the files and to smoothly work with them.\nThen we will jump to NIO,\nHere we will understand what Non-blocking IO is and\nThen we will be all set to understand the APIs under nio.\nWill see how they work.\nAnd then the enhancements and the new stuff that came with nio2.\nAnd all this will come with hands-on Coding. I strongly recommend to program along with me if you want to understand the things better. We are going to write a lot of programs!!\nStill in doubt ? Don't worry the course comes with a 30 days money back guarantee! So if you are not happy you may return the course.\nIf you want to become a Great Java programmer.. this is a must learn stuff for you and I strongly believe after completing the course you will be able to write efficient programs in terms of IO.\nWelcome you again to the Journey see you in the course...",

      "description": "Course description\n\n\nThis course is designed for beginners in programming with a biological background who want to deal with biotechnology data such as DNA, RNA, and protein, or who want to enter the field of bioinformatics.\n\n\nThis course requires you to install Python (this was explained in detail in the first section), and we will also need to install the Integrated Development Environment in order to write codes in it (this was also explained in the first section).\n\n\nAll the Python files in which the codes were written, which you will see in the videos from the beginning to the end of the course, we have provided in a folder that you will download from the first section of the course.\n\n\nI want you to read this well because it will explain many things to you that will help you to continue learning the Python language by clarifying the fruit of each section of the course.\n\n\nIn the first section, you will install Python, then you will know the modes through which you can write the codes, then you will learn the basics of the Python language, such as variables and what is related to them, comments, printing data to the user, and receiving data from the user.\nFrom this part, you will be able to learn how to receive data from the user, how to store the data inside the code, and how to output data to the user.\n\n\nIn the second section, you will learn about data types in Python. The meaning of data types in Python is the form in which Python understands user data. And you will learn about converting from one data type to another.\nOne of the fruits of the first section is storing data in variables. Here you will learn more about the format in which the data will be stored in these variables, and this varies according to the nature of the data that the user will enter. It may be a number, DNA sequence, table, file, and so on.\n\n\nIn the third section, you will learn how to access just one element of data.\nAfter storing the data in a type of Python data, you will be able to delve into the data through Python, so you can access a very small part of the data and thus be able to deal with it however you want.\n\n\nIn the fourth section, you will work with me on simple code. We will rely mostly on the information that we learned in the first three sections, where we will store data in Python, then receive data from the user, then search for it in the stored data, and output information to the user related to the information entered.\n\n\nIn the fifth section, which is extremely important, we will learn operations that can be performed on the entered data and how the data can be updated. We will also put questions or conditions about the data that will give us one of two answers, either true or false.\nThis section will give you the power to make decisions about the data.\n\n\nIn the sixth section, you will learn how to write your decisions in code and help write procedures based on the decisions made.\nThis part is very related to the fifth part, so they must be linked together.\n\n\nIn the seventh section, you will learn how to use loops.\nThese are precisely the ones that a person is unable to perform because they are characterized by repeating a set of commands at the speed of a computer, and therefore they can do complex things that a person cannot do in a short time, and therefore you must understand them well.\n\n\nIn the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh sections, we will learn many functions in Python that manipulate data.\nKnowing many functions enables the programmer to manipulate data, which is reflected in the effectiveness of the extracted information.\n\n\nIn the twelfth section, one of the most important sections in the language in general and in the field of bioinformatics in particular, in which you will learn a new method of input and output, where input and output were functions, but now they are files, which are the biological data storage unit.\nYou will also handle operating system paths within Python.\n\n\nIn the thirteenth section, you will learn how to deal with time and date, and this section may be useful in calculating the time and printing it in the output.\nYou will find, for example, in some programs that contain more than one process, that the time and date are printed for each process.\n\n\nIn the fourteenth section, you will learn how to separate code and put it into structures that only work by calling, which is building your own functions.\nThis is the first way to build the code for the user in a usable form.\n\n\nIn the fifteenth section, you will learn to build scripts and modules that are considered the official output from the codes. That is, once you reach this stage, you can create your codes in modules that can be imported into Python easily.\n\n\nIn the sixteenth section, you will learn to build the package, which is a collection of modules.\nThere will be a project consisting of three modules that will be implemented step by step in front of you, and there will be improvements and error corrections, and therefore you will get good information and experience from this section.\n\n\nIn the end, you will find that the course will teach you information and experiences about how to receive data from the user, how to deal with it, and finally how to output the information that the user wants.\nThis is what you will need to build your code, whether it will be complete applications or some code that deals with data slightly, or contribute to the use of existing Python packages.",

The best way to learn is by doing so you will be doing a lot of coding.  Java  is  a  case-sensitive, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.  One of the reasons Java is so popular is that it is platform independent . You only need to write java code once and then run it on any platform  be it mac, windows or Linux.\nIn this course we will create 10 practical and useful projects step by step. The projects include:  Digital Clock ,Weight Converter, Temperature Converter, Height Converter Random Number Generator, Percentage Calculator ,Word Count Tool Add number  program, Program to determine Leap Year\nThis course  will  guide you through java basics, its core syntax, and the fundamentals of writing strong java code.  I will  show you how to install Java JDK and NetBeans IDE. Netbeans is a  great IDE for developing in java, and then dive into the language itself. Along the way, we will cover topics such as: Declaring and initializing variables with a variety of data types Exploring  Basic Arithmetic operators Troubleshoot Compile errors Controlling flow with conditional code Creating Method Creating Event Handler methods Using Component controls and changing their properties\nIf java is your first step into programming or adding it your existing skillset, these training videos will help you understand the language and use it to build your own great software.",

If the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower.\nProcessor speed − Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.\nMultiple requests − As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.\nTo solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to rescue. Data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly.",

      "description": "Go is a multi-paradigm programming language that has built-in facilities to create concurrent applications. Design Patterns will provide readers with a reference point to software design patterns and CSP concurrency design patterns to help them build applications in a more idiomatic, robust, and convenient way in Go.\nWith this hands-on, practical course, you'll first have a deep dive into understanding the basic data types, structures, linked lists and doubly linked lists in Go. Then, you will learn about graph algorithms such as binary & trees. You will then learn about CSP concurrency patterns used to maintain thousands of servers. Moving further, you will also gain advanced knowledge about classic design patterns to build concise, readable, and maintainable applications & software.\nFinally, you will learn concurrent structures and parallel execution which helps you improve your concepts of Go Concurrency to write concurrent apps & develop some classical design patterns with concurrent structures to maximize parallelism.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 2 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Learning Go Data Structures, and Algorithms will begin by understanding the basic Data types and Structures in Go. Moving forward, you will learn the power of linked lists and doubly linked lists in Go and then learn to implement linear data structures such as stacks and queues. Also, implement binary searches and trees and will explore sorting algorithms in detail. From here, you will learn about graph algorithms and also be introduced to some common data structures used while working with strings. You will learn common techniques and structures used in tasks such as preprocessing, modelling, and transforming data. By the end of this course, you would have mastered functional and reactive implementations of traditional data structures in an easy and efficient manner\nThe second course, Introduction to Go Classical Patterns starts with a brief introduction to Go programming essentials and quickly moves on to explain the idea behind the creation of design patterns and how they appeared in the 90’s as a common \"language\" between developers to solve common tasks in object-oriented programming languages. You will then learn how to apply the 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns in Go and also learn about CSP concurrency patterns, the \"killer feature\" in Go that has helped Google develop software to maintain thousands of servers. With all of this, the book will enable you to understand and apply design patterns in an idiomatic way that will produce concise, readable, and maintainable software.\nThe third course, Go Behavioural Patterns will take you to an advanced level of knowledge about classic design patterns but, as you will see, the design patterns covered here are quite different, partly because of the lack of inheritance in Go, but also because we have different and more optimal ways to solve the same problems. With all this, the course will enable you to understand and apply design patterns in an idiomatic way that will produce concise, readable, and maintainable software.\nThe fourth course, Go Concurrency is on learning about concurrent structures and parallel execution. You will use the majority of Go primitives to write concurrent apps, and we will develop some classical design patterns with concurrent structures to maximize parallelism. Also, you will learn some typical structures with which to develop concurrent apps in Go. You will learn how a classical pattern can become more complex if you need it to work in a concurrent way; however, the idea is to understand Go concurrent primitives so that you know how to write your own concurrent design patterns by using the knowledge taken from the course.\nAbout the Authors:\nGustavo is an experienced software developer and has been writing code since the beginning of the century. He has vast experience working with different languages, including Erlang, JavaScript, and C but with a major interest in Go. He is currently a Technical Leader of a Golang team that builds distributed systems. When he is not coding, you can find him cycling, rock-climbing, and playing guitar in his free time.\nMario Castro Contreras is a software engineer who has specialized in distributed systems and big data solutions. He works as a site reliability engineer, and now he is focused on containerized solutions and apps using most of the Google Cloud suite, especially, Kubernetes. He has wide experience in systems and solutions integration, and he has written many scalable and reliable 12-factor apps using Go and Docker. He has designed big data architectures for financial services and the media, and he has written data processing pipelines using event-driven architectures entirely in Go. He is also very active in the open source community, and you can find him on his GitHub account with the username sayden. In the past, he has also written mobile applications and backends in Java. Mario is passionate about programming languages, and he finds the best balance between fun and productivity in Go; however, recently he enjoys writing in Rust and embedded systems in C. He is also passionate about road cycling and winter sports.",

Reasoning about situations means constructing arguments about them; we want to do this formally, so that the arguments are valid and can be defended rigorously, or executed on a machine.\n\n\nIn order to make arguments rigorous, we need to develop a language in which we can express sentences in such a way that brings out their logical structure. The language we begin with is the language of propositional logic. It is based on propositions, or declarative sentences which one can, in principle, argueas being true or false.\n\n\nThe outline of this course is given as,\nIntroduction to Propositional Logic, Parse tree, valuation of Propositional Logic statements, Model in propositional logic\nHow do we go about constructing a calculus for reasoning about propositions given a certain arrangement of premises. - Natural Rules for Deduction, Examples of Natural Deduction Rules\nDerived Rules for Deduction, Proof by contradiction, Modus Tollens,Law of Excluded middle portion and Double negation elimination\nIntroduction to Predicate Logic, Natural language statements to Predicate logic statements\nParse tree, substitution and Model in First order logic",

By Learning just the basics concepts of Python, you can't make Real time applications therefor, I have covered most of the Advance Level Concepts in depth in this course. As grabbing the main concept behind Advance Topics is not simple therefor, special attention is given to the intuition part of each concept where we gonna understand these concepts with proper animated slides.\nAlso not only understanding these advance concepts are important but to make something real out of it is very important or else there is no reason to learn Advance Programming therefor we will also make real time Advance level Applications in Python using Advance level concepts. We will also learn Machine Learning in Python in depth by covering the Mathematics behind each model as well. Also we will use these Machine Learning Models to make something real out of it.\n\n\nI believe that after taking this course, you gonna feel much more satisfied and comfortable with your programming skill in Python as you will then be a professional programmer who is capable to give any job interview.. Also after taking this course, learning any Advance Level concept in any other language will be 10x more simpler.\n\n\nI wish you very best for the Course.",

      "description": "Learn how to become a Python Programmer!\nPython is one of the most requested skills in software today. Whether you want to get into video game development, web development, data science, machine learning, internet of things or artificial intelligence... Python does it all!\n—\nWelcome to Python for Everybody, the complete Python course for beginners, intermediate and advanced developers.\nThis course is more comprehensive than your standard Python course. Whether you have never programmed before in your entire life, know a little bit, or are an experience Python programmer already... this course have everything for you from beginner to advanced modules.\nThis course will teach you real-world Python.\nAt the end of this course, we won't make a useless Tic-Tac-Toe game... We'll create an Image Recognition Application using modern Python.\nYou will get hands on experience learning Python in this course. There are interactive notebooks where you can test the code I've written and safely experiment with Python... you can even write notes beside your interactive code! Python for Everybody provides these interactive notebooks, quizzes, and code tests to give you the best learning experience possible! It's the perfect way to learn!\n—\nIs this course for you?\nIf you've never written a line of code in your life, or you've written code in another programming language, or you already know some Python.. this course has everything for everybody. That's why it's called Python for Everybody!\nThis course supports Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\n—\nWhy learn Python 3?\nPython is the #3 most popular programming language on Earth. There's no software that Python isn't involved in. Whether you want to get into Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, Video Games, Internet of Things or anything else, Python is the language you'll want to learn. In fact, Python is the only language that can \"do it all\".\nThis course is designed to set you up for success in every Python-related industry.\nIf you are new to programming, Python is the perfect language to learn first. Python is easy to read and write and the learning curve is very low making it the ideal first-language to learn. It's also incredibly powerful! That's why universities around the world are teaching Python.\nIf you're coming in from another language such as C or Java, you'll pick up on Python even easier! Python takes care of all the little things behind the scenes so you can focus on writing clean code that performs well.\n—\nDon't learn Python 2!\nPython 2 is no longer maintained by the Python development team, and there are no more security updates. That means Python 2 is a dead language and everyone should now be using Python 3. (This course uses Python 3.7 and Python 3.8).\nPython 2 was a great programming language, but there's no use in learning it since it's no longer supported at all. That's why this course focuses purely on modern Python.\nWarning: Many other courses will try to teach you old Python 2 programming but it's 90% the same as Python 3 but is no longer supported. It's not worth your time to learn Python 2.\nThat's why this course focuses on Python 3 and uses modern Python 3.7 and Python 3.8.\n—\nWhat will you learn?\nIn this course we'll learn about variables, data structures, conditionals, loops, functions, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), classes, interfaces, the Python 3rd party package ecosystem, virtual environments, decorators, generators, try and except, and unit testing your code. Plus everything between the major learning points.\nThis course covers a wide variety of Python topics, such as:\nInstalling Python (with Windows, Mac and Linux Support)\nCommand Line Basics (with Windows, Mac and Linux Support)\nRunning Python Code\nData Structures and Types including\nStrings\nBooleans\nNumbers\nDictionaries\nLists\nTuples\nSets\nFiles\nPrint Formatting (old and new methods)\nFor and While Loops\nBasic Functions\nAdvanced Functions including:\nScoping\nArgs and Kwargs\nNesting Functions\nLambda Functions\nPython Scope\nCatching and Supporting Errors\nPython Modules and Packages\nObject Oriented Programming including:\nClasses\nAttributes and Custom Methods\nInheritance\nInterfaces\nUsing 3rd Party Code\nPython Best Practices\nUnit Tests\nCode Formatting and Clean Up\n... and much more!!\n—\nThe Final Project\nThroughout this course there are several mini projects such as making a small guessing game. That's a fun way to learn Python, but it's not practical for learning real-world Python. Python for Everybody will teach you real world uses of Python from a real world Python developer.\nThe final project is a machine learning application that can detect objects in photographs such as people, cars, bikes, cats, lamps, and more.

Beginners can appreciate its English-like syntax, and more advanced programmers can appreciate its vast libraries and flexibility. It’s part of the .Net family of languages, and as such, it allows you to program some truly amazing solutions. So, congratulations on choosing to learn this amazing language.\nIt is common experience among programmers that after learning the basics, you realize there is still so much more to learn! And the enthusiasm to learn if often not enough to make the leap from intermediate to more advanced programmer.  You need to practice and work on improving your skills.\nYou see, the bad news is the code fear is real, and it hinders, or even stops your progress. The good news is that you can learn to eliminate it! And all it takes is a little practice and determination. And that’s where this course will help you greatly!\nThe course goes over variety VB .net programming projects. I show you how to put the theory you learned into practice by showing you how to solve each exercise and walking you through all the Why’s and How’s.\nBecause the course covers all exercises from scratch, some of the concepts are repeated across multiple exercises. The course doesn’t follow any particular guideline where each exercise builds up on the previous one, but rather serves as a comprehensive reference, allowing students to skip exercises that present concepts the student is already familiar with.\nWe’ll go on a journey to program intermediate-level solutions using VB .Net techniques and concepts, such as Collections, Databases, OOP, LINQ, and much more.\nYou will learn how to translate the project requirements into a working code. You will learn to use many different programming concepts and pick the right one for your solution. But most of all, you will learn to think like a programmer!\nThis course is all about practice. Therefore, to benefit from this course, you need to be an active student. It doesn't matter if you are self-taught VB .Net programmer or attend a programming course. What matters is the time and effort you are willing to put into learning and practicing your skills.\nThere are no lectures in this course. However, I explain what I am trying to accomplish with each line of code, and touch on common pitfalls, too.\nThis is a course for intermediate level VB .Net programmers who need to put the concepts and theory they learned into practice, and for people who prefer to learn by doing.\nIf that's you, then let's code!",

I encourage all my students to stop procrastination and just \"Eat the Frog\". This course is to get your feet wet by building projects.\nThis course, unlike others, goes hands-on, in-depth, behind the scenes of actual projects, all you need is golang installed on your machine and a basic, running knowledge of golang (atleast having completed the go tour) and everything else will be taken care of.\nFor this course, we will build three awesome real-world projects that you can -\nShow on your resume to get selected in interviews\nUse the base code to create other projects\nBuild better and deeper knowledge of GO\nAnd lastly, show off to your friends :)\nAfter finishing this course, you'll be able to approach building new projects with Golang with a better toolset.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGolang is -\nFast\nExtremely Light\nExtremely Scalable\nVery easy to understand and learn\nSuper easy to debug\nHas built-in concurrency\nGreat frameworks are being created (GO-Fiber is very similar to ExpressJS, but waayyyyyy faster)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt was created by geniuses working at Google and many senior developers are now finding great value by learning GO. Here are some of the benefits -\n1. There is a huge scarcity of quality GO developers in the market, so you can get hired QUICK!\n2. The pay-packages and salaries for GO developers are some of the highest in the world (way higher than NodeJS, React Native developers)\n3. GO has many applications in Web 3.0 world and with Machine Learning and Big Data (to work with large amounts of data you need a technology that has concurrency and parallelism and is also extremely light-weight)\n4. GO is extremely versatile - You can do some serious software engineering with it along with writing low level code like manipulating network requests, hacking etc. So once you know GO, you don't need to learn a whole lot of languages.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstructor\nMy name is Akhil Sharma, and I'll be your instructor in this course. I'm a Founder and CTO at 2 SAAS product companies.\nI have been teaching for quite a while on youtube and have been featured on FreeCodeCamp and I've also mentored various sessions with Scaler (Dev community).\nHaving more than 10+ years of industry experience, I teach cutting-edge technologies with my focus always on helping my students improve their professional proficiencies in languages such as Golang, Python, Rust, Javascript.\nOffline, I mentor many developers - from startups to enterprises.\nWith GO becoming much more than a buzzword out there, I've decided it's time for students to properly learn how to be a Golang Developer!\n---------------------------------\nThis course also comes with:\nLifetime access to all future updates\nA responsive instructor in the Q&A Section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nA 30 Day \"No Questions Asked\" Money Back Guarantee!",

      "description": "The secret to making the big bucks and landing that dream programming job is pretty simple. Pick a few key languages and get really, really good at them. Choosing languages that have a solid foundation and a promising future is also a good idea; and Julia fits that bit perfectly. This relatively new kid on the block (its first release was in 2012) is on the verge of becoming huge, and this online course will help you get one step ahead of everyone else by learning it fast, and learning it now.\nGet Ahead of the Coding Curve\nWrite Julia code to intermediate level\nPerform File IO operations in Julia\nUnderstand Julia fundamentals with real world examples\nLearn one of the most popular new programming languages\n\n\nLearn Julia Fundamentals\n\nThis Julia online course will take you from complete beginner to intermediate. Starting at the very beginning, you will be guided through the installation process and the basic functions and features of Julia will be presented to you. Variables, strings, logical operators, arrays, types, dictionaries, loops, list comprehensions, scope and modules are all covered to give you a thorough footing in the world of Julia.\nThe second half of the course moves into more advanced features. You’ll dive into File IO reading, directories and learn how to write to files before moving on to meta programming, error handling, and various other more complex features of Julia. Each lesson provides download-able code so you don’t miss a trick and can go back over the material at your leisure.\nAnyone who has a handle on basic programming concepts will get through this course with flying colours, as will those who are completely new to Julia and programming in general. You don’t need any previous credentials to begin... in fact, all you need is a computer with an internet connection to be on your way to a glittering programming career.\nAbout Julia\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language mostly used for technical, numerical and statistical computing. It’s also becoming increasingly popular for general-purpose programming, web use and as a specification language. It combines the powerful performance of C with the prototyping of Python.",

Or maybe you’re an experienced C# developer but never really grasped concepts such as inheritance, type substitution, dynamic binding, virtual, abstract, interfaces etc.\nIn this course we go through clear lessons and then apply what we learned in dedicated modules with practical exercises.\n\n\nBuilding the Dungeons of Doom Game\nAs we'll pick up new skills along the way, we will keep adding code to our Dungeons of Doom game – a console application where we put our knowledge into practice. Walk around in a dungeon, pick up objects and fight monsters – all while learning about polymorphism and interfaces…\n\n\n100% Code Compatibility\nThe code in this course is 100% compatible with the latest version of .NET. Any version of Visual Studio (Community, Professional etc.) will work great, but if you're already comfortable in VS Code or Rider, you can certainly keep using that.\n\n\n100% Money-Back Guarantee\nThis course comes with a 30-day full money-back guarantee. Take the course, go through the lectures, do the exercises, and if you're not happy, ask for a refund within 30 days. All your money back, no questions asked.",

      "description": "C# (CSharp) is the most popular programming language in the Microsoft Technology stack. It is a general-purpose language that can be used to write almost anything, from desktop applications, websites, web services to native mobile apps and even games. It is also a powerful, yet elegant language thanks to its well-thought-out design. On top of that, C# keeps getting new features added on a regular basis because it is backed by Microsoft. No wonder why C# is consistently among the most in-demand programming languages around the world for many years. In August 2018, it is at number 5 according to TIOBE and PYPL (websites that keep track of programming languages' popularity).\nSo what is the catch? Although it is an awesome language to learn and  will repay the investment, the learning curve can be steep. Sure, a  person with no programming experience probably can create something  using C# easily (thanks to out-of-the-box templates), but it is not  necessarily done right. Therefore, to help you to properly learn C#, I  have distilled all the most important aspects into this 5.5 hour course,  which I have spent more than 600 hours to create. This is to assure you about the course's quality.\nWhat can you expect from this course?\nExercises! Yes, there will be various exercises including quizzes, coding and even software design exercises to help consolidate and practice what you have learned. The best part? I will keep releasing new exercises on a regular basis. So, you will have access to additional content regularly without any extra cost!\nThis course has the right mix of theory and practice.\nYou can find plenty of practical examples throughout the course.\nYou will find many tips and tricks that I have accumulated  throughout my seven years of programming experience. You can then  immediately apply that to build your own application more easily.\nYou will see how I apply professional programming's best practices to build an application.\nI explain many important concepts in a very detailed manner to  make sure you completely understand what needs to be understood.\nThe course has high-quality production, both video, and audio (you should not take this for granted ;-)).\nIt gets really fun in many places. Let's put it another way: I think this course will make you laugh!\nLast but not least, you can always reach me at tim@codestrengthen.com for any question, feedback and even idea for my next course.\nAfter completing this course, you will have a crystal clear understanding about the fundamentals and important concepts in C#. You can confidently apply  many techniques to create your first simple C# application professionally. If you are worried/challenged/daunted by the vast features of C# before and not sure how to start, I am 100% guarantee that it will come to an end after you finish this course.",

Safety refers in particular to the avoidance of program errors that lead to memory access errors or buffer overflows and thus possibly also to security vulnerabilities. In contrast to other programming languages with automatic memory management, Rust does not use garbage collection for this purpose, but a special type system. Its type safety has been formally proven. (Source: Wikipedia)\nKey features\nNo race conditions\nNo exceptions\nNo memory leaks\nOfficial tools that are included:\nBuild System\nPackage Manager\nCompiler\nUnit Testing\nBenchmarking\nDocumentation Generator\nIs Rust even important to learn?\nRust has taken first place in the annual Stack Overflow survey of developers for six years in a row. The language is just as performant as C++, but at the same time more bug-proof and all the tools a developer needs are included. Even parts of the Linux kernel are already written in Rust!\nThis course consists of the following topics:\nInstalling the tools\nVariables and console\nBasics of features\nMemory management\nGeneric programming\nData structures\nLibraries and tooling\nThreads and channels\nObject orientation\nFurther topics\nSmall programming projects after the chapters\nBecome a professional today, in the technology of tomorrow!\nSee you on the course!",

We also learn about the Boolean operators such as the logical AND & OR. Finally we will learn how to loop through a given set of instructions using the for, while & the do-while loop.\n\n\nSection 4: Arrays & Objects.\nIn this section we will what are arrays and how the array data structures could be created in JavaScript. We will learn the different ways of creating an array, and along with it, we will also learn different array methods which can be used to manipulate data inside of an array. After arrays, we now move on to learn what are objects and how data and methods can be contained inside an object. We will learn how to create, access, manipulate & delete properties inside of a JavaScript object.\n\n\nSection 5: Functional Programming In JavaScript.\nOnce we know enough JavaScript to write basic programs, its now time to learn how to write code in a proper way by creating functions. In this section we will learn how to write modular and well maintained code using functions. We will learn how to define and call functions in JavaScript and the different ways to creating or declaring a function like the modern arrow notation. Along with it we will also learn how to make a function accept arguments and return values. We will also learn about functional scope and lexical scope and learn how it affects the variables defined inside a function.\n\n\nSection 6: JavaScript Document Object Model: DOM & DOM Events.\nThis section covers how to use JavaScript to control the document object model which helps us to manipulate elements on our webpage. We learn how to get access to every element on our webpage by using different methods. Once we have access to these elements we could easily manipulate, create and delete them using different methods provided. After completing this section, we could now manipulate almost any element on our webpage.\n\n\nSection 7: Object Oriented Programming In JavaScript.\nObject oriented programming is another way of writing code just as functional programming is. In this section we will learn how to write JavaScript code the OOP way. We will first understand what object oriented programming actually means, the advantages of using OOP over functional programming and then jump into learning different terminologies and implement them by writing code. We will learn what are classes, how to create them. How to create or derive objects from classes, how to access data and methods form objects etc. Along with it we also learn how to perform inheritance between multiple classes and also cover concepts such as prototypes.\n\n\nSection 8: Front-End Web Development With Vue.\nIn this section we learn the VueJS library right form scratch. We will learn all the basics of the Vue library and learn how these concepts can be put to practice to build interactive interfaces for our websites & web applications. We will learn how different elements on our webpages can be made reactive by attaching them to the data such that they change with  changes in data. We will also learn how to use Vue components to modularize the front end of our application.\n\n\nSection 9: Building A Todo App With Vue & JavaScript .\nNow that we know how to use Vue to power our applications, its now time to put our knowledge into practice. In this section we will build a fully functional Todo List application entirely in Vue which is capable of performing create, read, update & delete operations on data also known as CRUD.\n\n\nSection 10: Building A Calculator App With Vue & JavaScript .\nVue is best suited for SPAs or single page applications. Hence in this section we build a fully functional browser based calculator app that performs operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding percentage etc.\n\n\n\n\nSection 11: Back End Programming With Node & JavaScript.\nThe best part about JavaScript is that you can use it both at the front as well as the back end. As we have already learned how to use JavaScript in the front-end now its time to use it in the back-end. In this section we will learn how to use JavaScript to program servers using NodeJS which is a JavaScript runtime. We will learn what NodeJS is and how it allows us to run JavaScript in the backend. We will lean NodeJS right from the basics such as accessing the file system, reading from and writing to files, creating directories etc. We will also learn how to create our very own server which is capable of handling incoming client request and render dynamic HTML pages as a response. We will also learn Express, which is a NodeJS framework that makes things such as rendering webpages and routing for our web applications easier. We will also cover different templating engines such as EJS & Mustache to create and render HTML templates.\n\n\nSection 12: Integrating MySQL Database With JavaScript Web Apps:\nWhile building web applications, we want the data to persist so that it can later be retrieved. To do so we need our data to be saved in our database. Hence in this section we will learn how to setup database for our Node & Express applications so that the data for our applications persist. We will learn how to connect databases with our JavaScript apps and how to make our app query and manipulate data from the database.\n\n\nSection 13: Building A Chat Application With Socket io & NodeJS.\nIn this section we will learn how multiple clients can be connected to a single server via using sockets. We will learn this by building a chat application which consists of one server and multiple clients. We program the server using NodeJS and  a library called as socket io. Using which we build a server that can broadcast messages received from one client to multiple other.\n\n\nSo let's begin the journey of becoming an expert in JavaScript.\nIn addition to the Udemy 30-day money back guarantee, you have my personal guarantee that you will love what you learn in this course. If you ever have any questions please feel free to message me directly and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible!\n\n\nMake sure to enroll in the course before the price changes.\nTake yourself one step closer towards becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer by clicking the \"take this course button\" now!\nJoin the journey.\nSincerely,\nAshutosh Pawar",

      "description": "Elixir is a programming language used by application developers of all kinds and it is best for building scalable and maintainable applications. There are lot of people that are jumping on board with Elixir because it sort of has elegance.\nElixir is a functional language and it runs on the top of Erlang virtual machine, which implies it is also inherently concurrent and distributed, whereas the syntax is very straight forward, it’s unlike any other functional languages. The emphasizing reasons why people typically get excited is because, it is fun to read and write, and it has lots of built-in features for building reliable systems.\nOur course is designed keeping newbies and freshers in mind, the course separates language into simple bits and pieces that enables you grasp the language easily and furthermore help you to start programming quickly.\nIn this course we are going to start with basics of functional programming which is for example quite different from object oriented programming. We will even dive deep in the basics of Elixir and how it is different from other popular language with all the specifications. How it work with the processes and makes its stand apart.\nIn the next section we will see what is node, tasks, and agents. You will also learn how to work with GenServer i.e. the part of OTP framework that comes from Erlang with the applications in Elixir with all the dependencies. What are supervisors and how they can ensure for the tool runs.\nThat’s not all, you will also see what is Mix tools that comes with Elixir along with the Metaprogramming concepts. We have designed this course for newbies, everything is packed in this course that a developer need.\nWe can say that Elixir is not only a great programming language that allows you to build powerful applications, but also because it has all the goodness provided by Erlang, it has many tools under the belt which makes it very easy for newcomers to built complex systems. You don't need any third party solutions to go through all the processes, or to introduce all the parallel execution of the code, to store your data in the memory, because there is even a separate database management system that is available for Erlang in Elixir.\nWe really encourage you to try Elixir because while alluring this language you will have the possibility to look at the process of programming from a different angle. All these new concepts will allow you to think a bit differently.\nWith our simple to learn course, you won't just take in the nuts and bolts but will advance further to more complex functional programming ideas.\nSo, what are you waiting for?

      "description": "There are many different types of programming styles, such as algorithmic programming, functional programming, and object-oriented programming. And while each style is suited to a different programming language, C# is capable of all three of the above and more. C# was made to encompass the best of several standard programming languages and does an amazing job at it! Most people that code in C#, rarely switch languages, because it is such a versatile and beautiful tool that allows a programmer to connect in every way necessary. The teaching of the course includes all the steps needed to learn standard topics, as would be taught in a college classroom. The course solves standard problems in C#, with attention to general as well as language-specific issues including event-driven programming, inheritance and polymorphism, recursion, file I/O, exception handling, dynamic data structures, testing and debugging, multithreaded programming, and more. This will be a full course in C#, including design patterns.\nThe course begins with a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of programming and builds from there, giving students many, many practice examples to code on their own and learn from for further enhancement and development. Successful students will be able to write correct and complete C# implementations of homework projects. Successful students will also complete exam questions that test use cases and will be able to write any program that is asked by employers when applying for internships or jobs. Good luck!",

      "description": "Hello,\nWelcome to C# in 6 Hours: C# For Complete Beginners Learn C# by Coding course\nMaster the most popular game development language C# Fundamentals with Visual Studio and master C# in 6 hours | C Sharp\nWhether you’re using C# in conjunction with Xamarin Forms to build cross-platform apps, or designing a new video game in Unity with C#, Udemy has a course for you. Udemy hosts top-rated courses on everything from the fundamentals of C# programming to more advanced topics like databases and asynchronous programming.\n\nEven though C# is a language that’s relatively easy to learn and maintain, it isn’t just for beginners. Its scalability and large support community make C# the language of choice for Microsoft app developers and video game developers working with the Unity Engine. Like C++ and Java, C# is a high-level object-oriented programming language. It is generally more efficient than Java and has useful features such as operator overloading. C# is based on C++ but has several advantages over this older language: it is type-safe, more comprehensively object-oriented, and the syntax has been simplified in several important ways. Most importantly, C# interoperates exceptionally well with other languages on the .NET platform. For this reason, C# is a better choice for building applications for .NET.\nWhat is C# ?\nC# (pronounced see-sharp) is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It was designed as a multi-paradigm programming language by Microsoft in around 2000 as part of its .NET initiative. The .NET framework and .NET applications are multi-platform applications that you can use with programming languages such as C++, C#, Visual Basic, and COBOL. C# is open-source and was designed to be simple yet modern, flexible yet powerful and versatile yet easy to learn and program with. Many programming languages in the past were designed for specific purposes. C# was developed with business and enterprise needs in mind. By providing functionality to support modern-day software development such as web applications, mobile, and response app needs, C# supports many features of modern-day programming languages. That includes generics, var types.\n\nWhat are the advantages of c# over C++ ?\nThanks to the .NET framework, C# has many advantages over C++. C# is a refined and modernized version of C++. C++ was developed to bring object-orientation to C, an older but widely used language, and C++ became the de-facto language for building applications for Windows as well as infrastructure and low-level applications. Visual Basic was for business applications. What C# does is combine the rapid development capabilities of VB with the power of C++. C# also has many new data types, type-safety, to ensure you do not unknowingly reuse initialized variables. It uses a simplified syntax, a huge improvement over the complex coding often required in C++. C# also removes memory management issues thanks to .NET’s garbage collection scheme. You do not have to reference items for garbage collection; the system can reclaim that memory as required.\nWhy use encapsulation in C# ?\nEncapsulation can be used in C# to hide data and program behavior from users. With encapsulation, you can group properties, methods, and other members so that they are treated as a single object. It is a means to prevent the user of a given class from manipulating program objects in ways that were not intended by the designer or developer. Encapsulation hides how a program operates without affecting how it works while still allowing users to service requests for functionality and add or modify internal data or methods to meet changing needs. For example, suppose you have an object called “Patient” that contains patient-related data. In that case, you can use encapsulation to provision patient-specific data to those who need it without exposing all patient data. In addition to information hiding, you can use encapsulation in C# to improve your code's reusability.\n\nWhat is C# used for?\nC# is a general-purpose programming language that you can use to build a wide range of programs and applications, such as web applications, Windows applications and game development. In web application development, you can build dynamic websites and apps using .NET or another open-source platform of your choice. Also, since Microsoft created C# for Microsoft, C# is a popular language for building Windows applications. There are rich resources and a vibrant C# community that can support and documentation for applications and programs specific to Microsoft platform architectures, making it easier than ever to develop applications in this space. Finally, C# is a popular language to use in game-building, especially with Unity, a game engine that runs on C++ and C#.\nWhat is a constructor? What is a destructor?\nTo understand constructors and destructors, we need to understand methods. A method is a block of code that contains a series of statements. Programs run by executing methods. A constructor is a special method of a class that is automatically called whenever an instance of a given class is created. A constructor contains the instructions that execute when an object is created. Developers use it to assign specific initial values to the data members of the same class. In C#, you will get a compile-time error if you try to read from an uninitialized variable. You must first initialize your variables by giving them an initial value, which is what the constructor does. On the other hand, destructors are methods used to destroy instances of a class when they are no longer needed. Destructors are called implicitly by the garbage collector in .NET\nHow do I learn C#?\nAs is true for many skills, you can learn C# by taking Udemy courses, reading documentation, and practicing coding hands-on. There are many resources available for all of the above, including real-time compiler applications that will show you the output of your code as you type it. However, it is best to plan ahead, and you should have an outline of what you need to learn before beginning your journey. The first thing to learn about is what C# is, how and where it is used, and why it was developed. From there, you can learn about data types, variables, keywords, and functions. Once you’ve grasped the basics, you can move on to learning about conditional tests and operators, functions, arguments, object orientation, arrays, strings, classes, methods, structs, debugging, and exception handling.\n\nDo you want to learn C# but have no experience at all.  Our C# fundamentals for beginners course is the perfect place for you to start. In this course, we designed C# .NET (pronounced C- see  #-sharp ) course to give you everything you need to become productive with C#.\nCode with C# today!\nEnroll and master fundamentals of C# and programming with .NET framework, because you'll have lots of options waiting in front of you.

Then this course is for you!\nThis course is designed to teach you to program in a more graphical and interactive way. Learn to program in Java with the easy to use Processing development environment. Forget about difficult setups and installations. Just download Processing and run.\nUnlike other courses, we won’t begin learning by outputting text to a console, instead we will draw and animate on the screen right from the first lesson. By forgetting about tedious setups and initializations we can focus more on developing ideas and concepts.\nThe course is designed with the absolute beginner in mind. We start from scratch by looking at the absolute basics and build on from there to more complex topics. The objective is to make the process of learning to code less intimidating. Complex subjects are explained in a simple and visual way. By using images and animations students can grasp concepts better. End of section exercises and their respective solutions allow you to practice what you learn in the lessons.\nWhat about math? We keep the complicated math to a minimum and only introduce it when absolutely necessary. Even when this happens, the main goal or concept of the lesson is not dependent on the math. So even if you don’t want to deal with the math, you can still understand the concepts.\nWith our carefully designed curriculum you get an extensive course that won't take a year to finish. Each lesson will teach you essential concepts without long improvised explanations. Theory is kept to a minimum, only explaining the most important concepts, then is of to implementing it in code. A lot of work has gone into getting the right balance between theory and practice.\nSo if you wish to learn to code in an easy and fun way this is the course for you!",

Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn.\nTkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit and is Python's de-facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from the Tk interface\nTkinter is the de facto way in Python to Graphical User interfaces (GUIs) and is included in all standard Python Distributions.  Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that's built into the Python standard library. In fact, it's the only framework built into the Python standard library.\nTkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\n\nThe GUI (graphical user interface) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based UIs, typed command labels or text navigation.\nPyQt is a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt, implemented as a Python plug-in. PyQt is free software developed by the British firm Riverbank Computing.\nIn this course, we will learn what is the GUI, and Tkinter and how they work. And also how we create a program with GUI in python. For those who want to use Python not only in AI and Data Science, but also to develop a program using Python.\n\n\nAlso in this course, we will learn what is the GUI, PyQT5 and how does it work. And also how we develop a program with python. For those who want to use Python not only in Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) and Data Science or Machine Learning but also develop a program using Python.\nAnd in this course, We will open the door of the Python world and try to move deeper. We will learn fundamental things about Python, step by step. Throughout the course, we will do a variety of exercises to reinforce what we have learned.\nCreating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps −\n\n\nImport the Tkinter module.\nCreate the GUI application main window.\nAdd one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.\nEnter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.\nThis course has suitable for everybody who is interested in Python.\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization.\nSee why millions of people turn to Oak Academy’s real-world experts to learn Python. Learn at your own pace with hands-on exercises and quizzes. Our courses are frequently updated so you’ll always be working from the latest information. This is the training you’ll need to become a professional Python developer.\nTake one of Oak Academy’s range of Python courses and learn how to code using this incredibly useful language. Its simple syntax and readability make Python perfect for Flask, Django, data science, and machine learning. You’ll learn how to build everything from games to sites to apps. Choose from a range of courses that will appeal to both beginners and advanced developers alike.\nAs you all know or have guessed, Python is the most powerful programming language used in data science and artificial intelligence. Everyone is talking about it. This is said everywhere. Python is for data science.\n- But don't we programmers ever wonder?\n- Can we code an application using Python?\n- How can we use GUI in Python?\n- I wonder if we can quickly prepare a user interface?\nIn this course, we will seek answers to these questions with you. First of all, in our course, we will explain the fundamental topics of Python so that those who are new to Python can understand it. These fundamental topics will include the most powerful and important topics of both Python and software development, such as OOP. Then we will try to develop some programs with GUI using Python with you. While doing this, we will learn how to do GUI design in Python. We will also learn how to make database connections in Python.\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\n\n\nWhat is a Tkinter in Python?\nTkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. Tkinter is not the only GuiProgramming toolkit for Python. It is however the most commonly used one.\n\n\nWhat is GUI in Python?\nThe graphical user interface is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based UIs, typed command labels or text navigation.\n\nWhat is the easiest GUI for Python?\nTkinter is one of the most popular GUI libraries in Python. It is one of the first choices for beginners to GUI development because of its simple and easy-to-learn syntax.\n\n\nIs tkinter easy?\nIf your goal is to learn how to create GUIs, tkinter is arguably one of the best toolkits there is to reach that goal. It's simple and easy to learn and can provide a fantastic introduction to concepts you must master in order to create graphical desktop applications.\n\n\nWhy tkinter is used in Python?\nTkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.\n\n\nIs tkinter included in PyCharm?\nThe Tkinter library is built-in with every Python installation, so it's already installed in PyCharm per default. This means that you have to do nothing else but run “ import tkinter ” or “ import tkinter as tk ” in your Python 3 script without installation.\n\n\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\n\n\nWhat is GUI programming?\nGraphical User Interface (GUI), a computer program that enables a person to communicate with a computer through the use of symbols, visual metaphors, and pointing devices.\n\n\nWhy Python is used for GUI?\nPython has a huge number of GUI frameworks (or toolkits) available for it, from TkInter (traditionally bundled with Python, using Tk) to a number of other cross-platform solutions, as well as bindings to platform-specific (also known as \"native\") technologies.\n\n\nWhere is GUI is used?\nThe actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements. Beyond computers, GUIs are used in many handheld mobile devices such as MP3 players, portable media players, gaming devices, smartphones and smaller household, office and industrial controls.\n\n\nWhat is PyQt in Python?\nPyQt is a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt, implemented as a Python plug-in. PyQt is free software developed by the British firm Riverbank Computing.\n\n\nWhy PyQt is used?\nPyQt is widely used for creating large-scale GUI-based programs. It gives programmers the freedom to create GUIs of their choice while also providing a lot of good pre-built designs. PyQT gives you widgets to create complex GUIs.\n\n\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popular.\n\n\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile development.\n\n\nWhat skills or experience should I have before learning Python?\nPython is often taught in college-level classes because it is well-suited to being someone's first programming language. So, while it can be easier to learn Python if you already know Java, JavaScript, or other common languages, it isn't necessary. Before you learn Python, it might be helpful to understand the basics of programming logic, such as \"if/then\" gates, \"while/for\" loops and procedural vs. objective programming. You might also want to understand how applications get built, the difference between frontend and backend programming, and how computers utilize given applications. Udemy has a lot of beginner courses that can help you pick up Python quickly.\n\n\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\n\n\nOur goal is to learn how to write a program using Python at the end of the course. Are you excited? Because I'm excited.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\n\n\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\n\n\nSee you in the \"Python Gui Development with Tkinter Python and Python PyQt5 \" course.\nPython Tkinter & Python Gui - Boost your Tkinter Python skills with hands- on python gui programming desktop application.",

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for building applications across various platforms.  Java is built on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which means it uses objects and classes to structure data and methods. Core concepts include inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. Java eliminates complex features of C++ (like pointers) and includes robust security features, making it suitable for networked environments.\nJava provides strong memory management through its garbage collection mechanism and supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum CPU utilization. Java's robust, secure, and platform-independent nature, combined with its object-oriented approach and comprehensive standard library, make it a powerful language for a wide range of applications, from web development to enterprise solutions.\nJava syntax is clean and easy to understand, which helps beginners grasp programming concepts without getting bogged down by complex syntax. Java is designed around the principles of OOP, which makes it easier for beginners to understand concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. Learning OOP through Java can provide a strong foundation for understanding other object-oriented languages. Java’s extensive standard library provides pre-built classes and methods for a wide range of tasks, from data structures to networking and GUI development.",

When it comes to web app development, having the know-how to create something fully-functioning from start to finish boosts your employability credentials in a big way.  Thankfully, the MEAN Stack is the tool set that allows you to do just that. Want to get involved? Read on...\nLearn a Suite of In-Demand Programming Skills\n·         Understand MEAN Stack and how to use it effectively\n·         Code MEAN projects with an online IDE\n·         Develop MEAN REST APIs with Node and Express\n·         Create top-notch UIs with Angular 2\n·         Gain the skills needed to become a sought after web developer\nBuild Full-Stack Solutions for Mobile and the Web\nThis MEAN Stack online course is designed for any web developer or IT professional who wants to understand and use MEAN Stack for their projects. If you have some experience with an object-oriented/scripting language and JavaScript tools, great. But if you don’t, no worries – we guide you through every part of the process.\nYou’ll gain a solid foundation of knowledge in using the MEAN Stack (that’s MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node JS) for web and mobile development, with hours of instruction and code-alongs to help you through. You’ll study each component individually, learning how to assemble them to provide a highly efficient JavaScript-based development stack.\nThat means setting up an online IDE, developing MEAN REST APIs with Node and Express, programming and configuring with MongoDB, developing rich and functional UIs with Angular, scaffolding a MEAN UI client project, and much more.\nPlus, we make sure your skills are future-proofed by using Angular 2, the much-discussed rewrite of Angular JS that’s guaranteed to set the market on fire in the coming months. By the time you’ve finished this course, you’ll be more than ready to start working on your own MEAN Stack projects.\nWhat is MEAN Stack?\nMEAN Stack is a collection JavaScript-based technologies used for web app development. Namely: MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular 2 and NodeJS. It is a ‘full stack’ development toolkit, from client and server sides to databases. Basically MEAN Stack allows you to create functional, fun and flawless web applications from beginning to end, with one ‘stack’ of tools.",

That enormously powerful feature allowed to build a whole framework built upon it called LINQ or Language Integrated Query. I’ve seen many code bases which avoid using LINQ and rely on old procedural style of programming. If you still feel yourself uncomfortable with LINQ or you want to improve your understanding of LINQ, then this course is for you.  As you might know, LINQ was inspired by functional paradigm and F# in particular. So, this course is not only about LINQ but about the fundamentals of functional programming as well.\nThis course covers:\nThe basics of LINQ: extension methods, the idea of pipelining, IEnumerable, implementing our own extension, query syntax, pitfalls of LINQ operations, how to alter a list\nGenerating data streams: Enumerable class and its main operations, implementing your own extension which generates a stream of data\nFiltering, Ordering, Projecting: Parsing a CSV file, ThenBy, First, Last, Single, TakeWhile, SkipWhile,Any, All, Contains, SequenceEqual, Select and SelectMany\nJoining, Grouping, Aggregating: Join, Group, GroupJoin, Zip, Sum, Average, Min, Max\nConversions: OfType, Cast, ToArray, ToList, ToDictionary, ToLookup, AsEnumerable, AsQueryable\nLINQ to XML: overview, generating XML from a collection, reading XML\nEF and LINQ: Expression Trees, Inserting  into and Reading from a database\nExtendibility in C#: what is functional programming (FP), purity and side effects, extending IDisposable, general-purpose extensions, extending StringBuilder, Primitive Obsession\nIn short, this is a great course, so enroll right now and start learning LINQ and the fundamentals of functional programming.",

First, you will learn about why you may need batch processing, including its benefits and drawbacks. Next, you will explore the foundation of Spring Batch terminology and offerings. Finally, you will follow along in a demonstration of building a full, production-ready Spring Batch job that reads input from a file, processes, and then outputs the information to a database. When you are finished with the course, you should have the basic knowledge needed to start building your own batch jobs using the Spring Batch framework.",
      "target_audience": [
        "First, this course is mainly geared at developers looking to leverage the Spring Batch framework. Again, you'll need to have working knowledge of the Java language and working knowledge of the Spring Framework to get the most out of this course.",
        "Second, this course can be used by architects who are investigating how to prototype Spring Batch for an implementation or who are just looking to learn more about the framework."

He is a Python and Django expert and has been involved in building complex systems since 2006. He loves to simplify and teach programming subjects and share it with others. He first discovered Machine Learning when he was trying to predict the real estate prices in one of the early stage start-ups he was involved in. He failed miserably. Then he discovered a much more practical way to learn Machine Learning that he would like to share with you in this course. It boils down to “Keep it simple!” mantra.",

Python is fully capable of handling automation tasks as well as to further level such as data analysis, web development such as Django or even penetration testing. All starts with basics of python.\nWe will target 3.x version of python, which is entirely new branch of python. Most people are moving towards this branch as it is purely object oriented and have been designed from scratch. According to official statement, python 3 will only be supported in the future and official site will soon discontinue the support for 2.x branch. Everyone is switching to this new python and it’s a right time for you to get started.\nThis course is not a course full of jargons, as we understand that power point and too much high end programming jargon words can make you sleep easily. Course is a full hand on practice with a small touch of fun.\nWe will start from installing python 3 on a MAC and Windows and will at configuring Eclipse. Eclipse is a cross platform IDE that is available for Windows and MAC and helps us by code suggestion while writing code. It’s a professional way of writing code. Further we will explore python data types, conditionals, loops and some keywords like “break” and “continue”. Further we will explore python strings in built functions. Next we will tackle files and learn to create a copy of image file in python. Further, we will move towards Object Oriented and will look at classes, objects, and inheritance.\nFinally, we will handle database and will also talk about saving memory using decorators.\nAll the exercise files are already included with the course.\nThere is separate video to help you to download the exercise files and set them up on your system. This course will be a life changing experience for you. Videos are fun to watch and our special techniques will help you to reach towards the end of the course.\nLet's meet up in the course!",

It helps to write a lot of small reusable functions and simply call them one after the other. With regard to JavaScript, we have following features to our advantage:\n•    Speed\n•    Simplicity\n•    Versatility\n•    Server Load\nIf you're looking forward to building maintainable real-world applications by writing code in the functional way? If yes, this then go for this Learning Path.\nPackt’s Video Learning Path is a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that each video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.\nLet's take a quick look at your learning journey. This Learning Path begins with an introduction to functional programming wherein you will understand the principles of writing functional code along with its benefits and drawbacks. You will learn to write code that is easy to understand, test, and debug using ES6. You will then see how to use currying, partial evaluation, map, reduce, filter, recursion, and other functional programming concepts in ES6. Next, you will learn generator functions and the ES2017 sync-await construct which will help you set up communication with a server via an API during implementation of a web application. As you progress, you will learn lazy evaluation to optimize performance of your web application. Finally, you will implement a web application demonstrating the practical usage of most of the features that you've learned throughout this Learning Path.\nBy the end of this Learning Path, you will have a thorough understanding of functional programming in JavaScript and should be able to build and test your own applications.\nAbout the Author:\nFor this course, we have the best works of this esteemed author:\n\nZsolt Nagy is a web development team lead, mentor, and software engineer living in Berlin, Germany. As a software engineer, Zsolt continuously challenges himself to stick to the highest possible standards when improving his own knowledge.

It’s such a diverse world and there are so many new and exciting (or old and vital) languages that figuring out where to begin can be very bewildering. Guess what? We have the solution. The simple, clean, structured Pascal language is the best way to help you find your programming feet. Its whole reason for existing is to teach good programming practices and standards. What are you waiting for? Get learning!\nTake Your Programming Standards to the Next Level\nCreate, maintain, design and build cross-platform native applications\nWrite code once, compile it, and run it on multiple applications\nLearn best practices and standards across all programming languages\nUnderstand computer programming basics in-depth\nPerfect Pascal, the Right Way\nThis course is designed for complete beginners, so we’ll guide you every step of the way from installation to completing your final project. All you need is a computer, an internet connection, and 500mb of storage space. Once you’ve installed your free software, you’ll start learning about basic coding concepts using Pascal for context, building your own projects along the way.\nEach section of the course is dedicated to a different concept/feature, including math operations, variables and user input, if/else statements, loop structures, string functions, arrays and records, working with files, date and time functions, and creating functions and procedures. You’ll complete a hands-on practical project from start to finish with each section to put what you’ve learned into practice.\nBy the end of this course you will know how to write, build and compile Pascal code with ease. You will be able to create your own native applications and you’ll know how to run them, maintain them, and build them more efficiently. With the knowledge base you’ve gained, you’ll be all set to progress to some of the most powerful and widely used programming languages in the world.\nAbout Pascal\nOne of the oldest languages around, Pascal was published in 1970 with the intention of encouraging best practices using structured programming and data structuring. It is a high-level, imperative and procedural programming language and makes an excellent pre-cursor to C for beginners. It is known for its compatibility, efficiency, fast compilers, and for its simple, clean syntax.",

      "description": "Welcome to the 'Learning Python with Ableton' course!\nIn this course I will teach you how to develop in Python without the need of any prior programming knowledge.\nWe start with the absolute basics, but within the framework of a highly practical approach. What this means is that you'll start to work on useful musical projects right away! Because of this you get to explore and practice with the language syntax without having to go through boring exercises. At the end of the course you'll be very familiar with Python and you should be able to take on any projects, even when they're not related to making music or controlling Ableton! On top of that, you'll gain in-depth knowledge about the Ableton API, how MIDI works, and how you can create music and control musical parameters via code.\n\nThe course is divided into multiple sections, in the first part we will set up our development environment. Here you learn how to install an IDE, the basics of MIDI and some other important knowledge to get started.\nIn the next section we start writing our first Python program, which will already be useful and fun! You learn how functions work, how to send musical events to Ableton, we create a complete song by using Datasets and we'll even learn how to capture Webcam input to send Notes and CC data to Ableton or any other Application.\n\nAfter that, we dive into the mighty Ableton API...\nIn this third section we will explore the LOM (Live Object Model) and we start to get an idea about OOP (Object Oriented Programming). Getting to know Ableton from a developers perspective will allow you to interact with all aspects of the program, the Mixer, the Clips, the Devices and pretty much everything which you can see in the Ableton UI (and even some features hidden to 'regular' users). We will write our first class and make some useful programs to speed up your workflow in Ableton and to come up with new creative ideas.\n\nLastly, we dive into MIDI Remote Scripts, this has been a highly requested section of the course, filled with information never before exposed or documented. This section of the course is the result of working with Remote Scripts and the Ableton Framework for more than 10 years and it will show you how to make a script for your MIDI controller, making it useful for the way you work in Ableton or for your specific Live Performance setup. After this section you don't have to rely anymore on Third party scripts, you can make your controller exactly fit your needs.\n\nI guarantee you that after this course you will be very comfortable with Python and you are able to think about and develop your own (creative) projects. You will also become a true Ableton Live guru with in-depth knowledge about the program itself and how all its components interact. You will end up with a whole set of scripts & tools that are unique to the way you work!\nOn top of that you will be well on your way to getting hired as a Python developer, even if that's something you don't desire ;)\n\nPlease feel free to checkout some of the Free Lessons or ask my any questions!\nHappy {coding with [Ableton]} !\nJor\n\nProgramming Topics\nLoops\nMath & Matplotlib\nSciPy\nFunctions & Classes\nDatasets\nMultithreading\nNumpy\nObject Oriented Programming (OOP)\nPlotting\nWaveforms\nMediapipe\nOpen CV\nTerminal\nServers\nClients\nSockets\nDictionaries & Other data types\nOSC\nRandomization\nContext Managers\nError Handling\nGraphs\nAlgorithms\nAnd much more..",

Only download Visual Studio Community from Microsoft ( It's free ) and start with us step by step.\nAt the end of this course, you will master C#, and you will be ready for any job interview however hard it is.\nC# syntax is highly expressive, yet it's also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++, Java or JavaScript. Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to work productively in C# within a short time.\nC# provides powerful features such as nullable types, delegates, lambda expressions, pattern matching, and safe direct memory access. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance. C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code. Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions make the strongly-typed query a first-class language construct.\nAs an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it's a stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but doesn't support inheritance. C# also provides records, which are class types whose purpose is primarily storing data values.",

      "description": "The constant need for smarter technology that learns and grows with you has become crucial, even when it comes to writing software code. This includes programming languages that understand and learn with you as you continue to write. Scala is one of the most impressive programming languages currently in the market.\nIn order to deal with the shortcomings of Java language and restrictions that did not give the developer to do what he wanted, Scala was invented by Martin Odersky in 2001. According to Scala website, the programming language allows developers to have the best of both worlds – object oriented programming and functional programming.\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language, where every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. Additionally, it is also a functional language, with features such as a general preference of immutability over mutation, first-class functions, and a library with efficient immutable data structures.\nScala source code is expected to be compiled to Java bytecode, allowing the code to run on a Java virtual machine. Additionally, Java libraries can directly be used in Scala coding, and vice versa. Similar to Java, Scala uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. However, it also incorporates aspects of other programming languages such as Standard ML, Haskell and Scheme.\nBecause of its flexible nature, Scala can be used for a wide range of tasks including writing small scripts to building large systems. Currently, it has been successfully incorporated for large mission critical systems by companies such as LinkedIn, Intel and Twitter.\nWith this many benefits, it is no wonder that Scala is currently one of the most demanded programming language that is used for developing. Its flexible nature and its ability to handle large amounts of data in real time, along with being concise and agile is making it a popular choice for open-source and Big Data projects.\nDoes Scala sound like the perfect solution for your developing needs? Well, look no further. All you need is this intensive course to learn all you need to know about Scala. Our course has been designed by experts to teach you not only the functionality of Scala, but also why you should use Scala, its benefits as well as the basic fundamentals. The course will also cover real world examples that can help you actually incorporate Scala in your daily developing.\nWell what are you waiting for? Enroll in this course now and see why a lot of people are shifting from using just Java to Scala for all their programming needs.",

Anonymous methods, Events, and Lambdas will be also covered in the future sections of this course!\nLINQ can make your C# code more powerful, and simpler, because it gives you an easy and concise way to query objects. But in order to use it, you first need to understand how delegates work.\nWhy should you take this course instead of watching Youtube videos about delegates?\nBecause this course will give you an in depth introduction to delegates\nBecause one simple example may not be enough for you to recognize the situation for a delegate to be useful in software development\nBecause instead of declaring one simple example, I'll cover logically built, more realistic examples to make the topic simple for you to learn and understand\nYou will learn how Action<T>, and Func<T, TResult> work, which is inevitable to know for writing LINQ queries\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\n\nYou will learn what a delegate is\nYou will learn how to create and use delegates\nYou will see the difference of direct method invocation and delegate invocation\nYou will see how useful delegates can be through logical examples\nHow to avoid code duplication by using delegates\nHow to invoke multiple methods through delegates\nHow delegate inference can help us to write simpler code\nHow to use Action, Action<T>, Func<T, TResult>\n\n\nWhy should every C# developer be familiar with the concept of delegates?\nDelegates are extremely critical part of the .NET Framework\nMight be the solution for a lot of problems when developing a software\nUsing delegates will allow better code reuse to your software\nYour code can become more flexible and powerful when using C# delegates\nYou will very commonly use delegates, when using events, creating LINQ queries etc.",

The contents are geared towards beginners, but the projects might help someone become familiar with Maya and its libraries.\n\n\nBest way to approach the course:\nFollow the projects in order: The projects are designed to introduce new concepts naturally as they are needed, from the most basic to more complex, and each project will reuse previous knowledge.\nDeep Dives: The deep dives give you a break from the project to delve deeper into a specific topic. They are placed after a concept has been introduced, you might want to watch them immediately after learning the concept but you can also treat them as a reference library to go back to in the future.\nSource Code: Keep a look out for the resources in each lecture, you will have be able to download the files with the source code for a portion of the project.\nVideo Timestamps: Unfortunately this platform doesn't offer timestamps on videos but you will be able to download text files (in resources) with time codes for important points in the lecture.\nQuizzes and Exercises: You will find quizzes and coding exercises after some lectures, these are optional, but a great way to practice.",

Postman and in Real Project\n\nHello,\nWelcome to C# RESTFUL API on Web API Net Core with MsSQL & EF Core\nC# Restful API on Web API Net Core, HTTP, MsSQL, WPF Core with real world Rest API Projects, WPF Core Projects, EF Core\nFinally, our Web API beginning course is ready for you A lot of students want an API course to Use API projects on Net Core Wpf, c#, c# wpf, wpf mvvm, wpf c#, entity framework, c# projects, entity framework core, c# Project, ef core, c sharp, WPF XAML, CSharp\n\nBefore starting, I want to explain that this course is a part of big training I can tell this part is the most important part that we will use in following training in an online ticket project, a web project, and in all mobile versions as well made in Xamarin, Flutter, Java Android, Angular, Node js, React Native, and Vue Native For developers who have no knowledge about the API, I preferred to explain the basics of the API in this section basically However, in the following sections, we will learn to use JSON web tokens and we will apply JSON Web Token in more complex projects\nThis course will give you everything that you will need to start Web API project’s on Net Core Before starting this course, you should know that you need to have basic C# knowledge With this course, you will learn API concepts with Net core and you will make more practice on C# programming And as you know with C# programming you may use Xamarin Forms to build cross-platform mobile apps or design a new video game in Unity\nWe will start our training with answers to what the Web API is Then we will examine the most useful concepts as Rest and SOAP We will learn the differences between SOAP and RESTFul\nIn Net core programming, EF core is very important to make crud SQL operations In this course, you will learn to use EF Core with code first approach on a project that you can use in any project\nAfter EF core, you will meet HTTP concepts or you will get more information about HTTP Concepts For example, you will learn the meaning of HTTP status code that you may always see in any project like 404 status code as not found In this course, you can find all necessary information about the crud operation of API with HTTP methods as Get Post, Put, Delete, or Patch\nPostman is one of the most popular software testing tools which is used for API testing With the help of this tool, developers can easily create, test, share, and document APIs And in my opinion, if you work on APIs, the postman is the best app for you This means in this course you can also learn using Postman\nIn most training trainers prefer to show API results only with the postman But in this course, you will also learn to consume an API This explanation may be too complicated for you Simply, in this course first, we will create an API project as Back-End After that, we will create another project in which we will consume our source as Front-End As you know net framework works only on windows platforms but net core is a cross-platform framework which means with Net core you may use the other platforms This means you can share your API with any projects on any platform\nIn this training, you can also learn to use any API to consume like news API to get global news to your project And in any project, you may see that login with Facebook or Google This means you can learn facebook or google authentication Also, we will learn to consume API projects in a WPF core project\nASP NET is a server-side web application framework that allows web developers to produce dynamic websites and services that are interactive and fast ASP NET code is compiled, making the resulting applications much more efficient compared to those built with scripting languages like PHP\nEven though C# is a language that’s relatively easy to learn and maintain, it isn’t just for beginners Its scalability and large support community make C# the language of choice for Microsoft app developers and video game developers working with the Unity Engine Like C++ and Java, C# is a high-level object-oriented programming language It is generally more efficient than Java and has useful features such as operator overloading C# is based on C++ but has several advantages over this older language: it is type-safe, more comprehensively object-oriented, and the syntax has been simplified in several important ways Most importantly, C# interoperates exceptionally well with other languages on the NET platform For this reason, C# is a better choice for building applications for NET\nWhat you will learn?\nApply the

What is a destructor?\nTo understand constructors and destructors, we need to understand methods A method is a block of code that contains a series of statements Programs run by executing methods A constructor is a special method of a class that is automatically called whenever an instance of a given class is created A constructor contains the instructions that execute when an object is created Developers use it to assign specific initial values to the data members of the same class In C#, you will get a compile-time error if you try to read from an uninitialized variable You must first initialize your variables by giving them an initial value, which is what the constructor does On the other hand, destructors are methods used to destroy instances of a class when they are no longer needed Destructors are called implicitly by the garbage collector in NET, and as a developer, you have no control regarding when to call the destructor\nHow do I learn C#?\nAs is true for many skills, you can learn C# by taking Udemy courses, reading documentation, and practicing coding hands-on There are many resources available for all of the above, including real-time compiler applications that will show you the output of your code as you type it However, it is best to plan ahead, and you should have an outline of what you need to learn before beginning your journey The first thing to learn about is what C# is, how and where it is used, and why it was developed From there, you can learn about data types, variables, keywords, and functions Once you’ve grasped the basics, you can move on to learning about conditional tests and operators, functions, arguments, object orientation, arrays, strings, classes, methods, structs, debugging, and exception handling\nWhat is SQL Server?\nSQL Server is a relational database management system or RDBMS created and developed by Microsoft Designed to store and retrieve data for other software applications using the client-server model-- these applications connect to SQL Server through a network or the Internet with multiple applications using the same data One SQL Server instance can also manage one or more relational databases Relational databases store data in tables that can relate to each other For example, data for business customers get stored in one table relating to another table that stores orders Applications that connect to Microsoft SQL Server retrieve, store, and delete data using Structured Query Language (SQL) SQL Server is available for Windows and Linux\nWhat is SQL Server Management Studio?\nSQL Server Management Studio is desktop software designed to connect to Microsoft relational database management systems, including Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Server Management Studio is an integrated database development tool that database architects, database developers, and software engineers can use to access, configure, manage, administer, and develop databases on any one of these database systems It simplifies database management by providing graphical design tools and rich script editors that allow database developers to visualize an entire database or multiple databases from a single application SQL Server Management Studio only runs on the Microsoft Windows operating system but can connect to database instances running on either Windows or Linux\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching\nWhen you enroll, you will feel our seasoned developers' expertise\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nIt doesn't need any prior knowledge to learn it and it is easy to understand for beginners\nThis course starts with the very basics First, you will learn how to install the tools, some terminology Then the show will start and you will learn everything with hands-on practice I'll also teach you the best practices and shortcuts\nStep-by-Step Way, Simple and Easy With Exercises\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have a firm understanding of the C# and SQL You will have valuable insights on how things work under the hood and you'll also be very confident in the basics of coding and game development, and hungry to learn more The good news is since the Free and popular tools are used you don’t need to buy any tool or application\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now\nC# RESTFUL API and WPF Core with MsSQL & EF Core\nWe offer full support, answering any questions\nSee you in the course!",

Would you like to learn how to make cool looking and insightful charts? If so, you are in the right place.\nLearning how to code in R is an excellent way to start. R is one of the top languages used by data scientists, data analysts, statisticians, etc. The best thing about it is its simplicity.\nR was introduced to me in the summer of 2008 as an intern at a marketing firm; since then, I have been a loyal user. Along with SAS, I use it daily to conduct data analysis and reporting. R is one of my top go-to tools. I start with the basics showing you how I learned it, and then I teach it at a pace comfortable for a beginner.\nWe are living in exciting times, and the future looks bright for those skilled in programming. Industries are using data more and more to make crucial decisions. They need experienced analysts to help design data collection processes and to analyze it. Where do you fit in this picture now and tomorrow? Learning R sets you now and will sustain you for the future.\nR was designed mainly for statisticians or those who did not have a computer science background, hence its intuitiveness. R is a free and open-source programming language. It will not cost you anything to have R installed and running on your computer. R is open-source, meaning that contributors can improve its usability by creating packages. Packages contain functions to help users solve specific problems that R’s founders did not think of. It would be a pleasure to see you grow to become a contributor to R someday.\nAlthough R itself is mighty, it is not the best place to write R codes. We will write R codes (or scripts) in R studio. R studio is a powerful editor for R. You will learn all about it in this course.\nHere are some of the things you will learn in this course:\n1. Download and install R and R studio\n2. The different data structures, such as atomic vectors, lists, data frames, and tibbles. How to create and use them\n3. How to import an excel or a CSV file into R\n4. Create functions\n5. How to execute chunks of code following an if-else logic\n6. Lean R studio short cut keys to increase your efficiency and productivity\n7. How to summarize data\n8. How to transpose data from long format to wide format and backward\n9. How to create powerful easy to read pipelines using purrr and dplyr packages\n10. Introduction to base R plots\n11. Ggplots\n12. And more\nThanks for taking the time to check out my course. I cannot wait to help you get started with R and R studio.

Whether you need to pass your exam, get started with programming, even create advanced distributed data processing programs, you came to the right place.\nMy focus for this course is also to explain the \"why\" while explaining the \"what\" and \"how\". Because most of the courses or documentation don't cover that! But, being a Computer Science graduate and a Software Engineer with 11+ years of experience in programming, I believe I can properly explain the \"why\" when we're writing code, to explain how exactly it works.\nWhy do you need to learn Python?\nIt's one of the most popular programming languages throughout the decade.\nHeavily used for Data Science and Machine Learning domains.\nHeavily used for Cloud Computing such as in AWS and GCP.\nMassively used for Distributed Computing such as in Apache Spark and Apache Beam.\nA trend has already started to write web services and APIs using Python.\nVery easy to learn, write, understand and maintain the code.\nHave improved performance throughout the years.\nHere is a highlight of what we'll cover in this course.\nBasics of Python programming (variables, loops, if-else)\nObject-Oriented Programming\nHow to write optimized code\nError handling\nUsing third-party libraries\nWriting multi-threaded and multi-processed programs\nIntroduce GUI application building with PyQt\nAnd much more!\n(This course was initially made in my native language (Sinhala) and it had quite a lot of positive feedback, and that's why I decided to create a brand new course with much more topics in English for a wider audience.)\n(Sample code is attached to the last video, except a few, of each of the sections when available.)\nSo, why wait? Let's get started!",

      "description": "Python is a multi-domain, interpreted programming language. It is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is often used as a scripting language because of its forgiving syntax and compatibility with a wide variety of different eco-systems. Its flexible syntax enables developers to write short scripts while at the same time, they can use object-oriented concepts to develop very large projects.\nTkinter is the de facto way in Python to create Graphical User interfaces (GUIs) and is included in all standard Python Distributions. In fact, it’s the only framework built into the Python standard library.\nThis Python framework provides an interface to the Tk toolkit and works as a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tk. The Tk toolkit is a cross-platform collection of ‘graphical control elements’, aka widgets, for building application interfaces.\nTkinter module provides Python users with a simple way to create GUI elements using the widgets found in the Tk toolkit. Tk widgets can be used to construct buttons, menus, data fields, etc. in a Python application. Once created, these graphical elements can be associated with or interact with features, functionality, methods, data or even other widgets.\nTkinter provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes used in a GUI application. These controls are commonly called widgets.",

Specifically, this course focuses on the Multi-Armed Bandit problems and the practical hands-on implementation of various algorithmic strategies for balancing between exploration and exploitation. Whenever you desire to consistently make the best choice out of a limited number of options over time, you are dealing with a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and this course teaches you every detail you need to know to be able to build realistic business agents to handle such situations.\nWith very concise explanations, this course teaches you how to confidently translate seemingly scary mathematical formulas into Python code painlessly. We understand that not many of us are technically adept in the subject of mathematics so this course intentionally stays away from maths unless it is necessary. And even when it becomes necessary to talk about mathematics, the approach taken in this course is such that anyone with basic algebra skills can understand and most importantly easily translate the maths into code and build useful intuitions in the process.\nSome of the algorithmic strategies taught in this course are Epsilon Greedy, Softmax Exploration, Optimistic Initialization, Upper Confidence Bounds, and Thompson Sampling. With these tools under your belt, you are adequately equipped to readily build and deploy AI agents that can handle critical business operations under uncertainties.\nTo bridge the gap between theory and application, I've updated this course to include a section where I show how to apply the MAB algorithms in Robotics using the EV3 Mindstorm. I'll soon upload a section that will show how to apply the algorithms taught in this course to optimize advertisements.",

Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in data science , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data.

If you don’t have any previous experience, not a problem!  This course is expertly designed to teach everyone from complete beginners, right through to professionals ( as a refresher).\nWhy Python?\nPython is a general-purpose, high-level and multi-purpose programming language. The best thing about the Python is, it supports a lot of today’s technology including vast libraries for twitter, data mining, scientific calculations, designing, back-end server for websites, engineering simulations, artificial learning, augmented reality and what not! Also, it supports all kinds of App development.\nWhat is data science?\nWe have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science python uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Python data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science using python includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a python for data science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.\nWhat does a data scientist do?\nData Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.\nWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?\nPython for data science is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up.\nHow long does it take to become a data scientist?\nThis answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.\nHow can ı learn data science on my own?\nIt is possible to learn data science projects on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.\nDoes data science require coding?\nThe jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skill set.\nWhat skills should a data scientist know?\nA data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings.\nIs data science a good career?\nThe demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. Data science from scratch is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds.\n\nWhat is python?\nMachine learning python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python bootcamp is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.\nPython vs. R: What is the Difference?\nPython and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in data science , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.\nWhat does it mean that Python is object-oriented?\nPython is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many data analysis programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.\nWhat are the limitations of Python?\nPython is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in machine learning is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.\nHow is Python used?\nPython is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.\nWhat jobs use Python?\nPython is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.\nHow do I learn Python on my own?\nPython has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nPython doesn't need any prior knowledge to learn it and the Python code is easy to understand for beginners.\nWhat you will learn?\nIn this course, we will start from the very beginning and go all the way to programming with hands-on examples.

Step by step, section by section, you’ll build your knowledge of C# with practical projects along the way to put your developing skills into practice. A section each is dedicated to setting up your environment; data types and their uses; variables, expressions and operators; statements and flow control; organisation; classes and structs; inheritance; interfaces, and so much more.\nAll you need to get started is a basic understanding of programming and a familiarity with the concept of object-oriented programming (don’t worry if you don’t have any actual experience). Suitable for beginners and intermediates alike, by the end of this course you’ll have a solid understanding of C#, its strengths and weaknesses, what projects you can use it for, and you’ll be more than ready to start using it in the real world.\nWhat is C#?\nC# is an object-oriented programming language from Microsoft’s C family of languages. It is a hybrid of C and C++ and was designed to improve productivity in web app development. It is used to build a variety of secure client, client-server and database applications, XML web services, distributed components and much more. It runs on the .NET framework and another very popular language was inspired by it; Java.",

      "description": "Whether you are looking to switch your careers and become a full-time programmer, OR you just want to try your hand at building some cool applications or are just seeking to round out your skill set – learning to code in Java will be a pretty good way to go about it.\nProgramming is one of the fastest growing and lucrative profession in today's high-tech age. No wonder, a lot of people are jumping into this profession in droves. But the amazing thing is that industry's appetite to employ more and more engineers is only growing. The demand is way too high to fill this gap. Which is why companies are ready to pay higher and higher salaries and hourly rates for these skills.\n\nDo you want to join the high-tech industry and be part of this IT revolution?\n\nDo you want to go from no previous programming experience - to be a confident programmer who can code in one of the most popular programming languages in the world – Java?\nDo you want to earn high 5-figure or 6-figure salaries as a seasoned software engineer?\nIf your answer is YES – then you have come to the right place.\n\nThis course does not assume any prior programming or coding experience. It has been designed from the ground up – to take you through a spectrum of concepts, terms, and paradigms to give you a solid understanding of what Java programming is all about.\nHands-On Knowledge\n\nWe are a group of coders and programmers ourselves. So we understand the importance of learning by doing. This course is jam-packed with practical demos, homework assignments and a lot of live coding which will help you immensely in grasping these complex topics.\nWe begin by downloading and installing a free programming editor also known as an integrated development environment (IDE). The IDE is called Eclipse and is pretty popular amongst Java programmers.\n\nThen we will go through some basic and foundational concepts of the Java programming language. Many of these concepts also apply to other programming languages.\nAfter these core concepts – we will put things into high gear and talk about control flow statements which can help you write dynamic programs\n\nWe will discuss object-oriented programming and its various pillars. We will introduce you to important OOP concepts like objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and packages. Each discussion will focus on how these concepts relate to the real world, while simultaneously providing an introduction to the syntax of the Java programming language.\nThe added power of OO programming which Java provides gives programmers a huge edge over the relative simplicity of procedural programming. OOP concepts make it easier for programmers to relate the code to the real world objects we see around us. Generally speaking, learning OOP could be very simple and complex at the same time. We strive to explain these essential concepts with the help of simple real world scenarios and exercises.\n\nWhy Java?\n\n\nEver since Java was introduced in 1995 – it has been growing in popularity especially in the enterprise software sector. Over the years, it has been proven to be a mature, robust and very versatile programming platform. The language designers have added tons of features to the language which makes it very efficient and fun to code in Java.\nJava has the advantage of ubiquity. If you program for a living, you're probably going to come across Java sooner or later. Java is showing up in all sorts of places: You can write Java servlets that run on Apache and many other web servers. You can write applets that run in the browsers that most of the world uses. Java programs can run seamlessly on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. In fact, Java is also supported on many embedded and mobile platforms.\n\nJava has a huge community support behind it. From fully functionality IDEs (like the one we will use in this course) – to robust frameworks, the Java open source community has contributed a lot to make the Java ecosystem a very compelling platform to build applications.\n\nThe demand for coders, programmers, and professionals who have experience with Java programming language has been growing steadily over the last few years. The salaries and consulting rates for these skills have also been rising and are only bound to go up as the demand for these skills remains steady or increases.\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nWe have been in the software industry for over TWO DECADES. We have been part of many prestigious projects and startups. Over the course of these years - we have gained a good insight into what makes for flexible, scalable and robust software solutions. We are passionate about sharing all our collective knowledge with you.\n\n\nAre You Ready?\n\n\nAre you ready to get started? In that case, we're guessing you'll want to know what your investment is going to be.\nWell, here you will find real actionable information and education in exchange for your time, willingness to learn and a fraction of the cost you will be able to demand as a cloud engineer or consultants.
