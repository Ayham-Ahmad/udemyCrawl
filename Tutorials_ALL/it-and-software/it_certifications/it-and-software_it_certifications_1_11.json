      "description": "*** Part of the Complete Course: Cisco CCNA to CCNP Transition ***\nWhenever I taught  CCNP in the class-room, I found that Students were confused about some topics or commands that they have studied in the CCNA course (with someone else!), and I had to clarify or re-explain these topics or commands to them. This is because these topics or commands are confusing by their nature, or because the way that they are typically explained to the students. Therefore, the idea of this course came in my mind, which intend to clarify those confusing topics or commands.\nThis course contains two sections:\nWorking with Passwords: which contains thoughts on passwords, understand the meaning of the no service-encryption command, and how to break the type 7 encryption.\nWorking with Telnet: which contains how to work with telnet as source or destination, and how to telnet to a specific port.\nNetwork Attacks Using Features of the IP Protocol: where different network attacks that uses features of the IP protocol are explained, including the IP Smufing attack.\nFor example, when working with passwords: why do we have two ways to configure the enable password? and why both passwords used in these two ways must be different? Also how can we use the question mark as part of the password? Did you ever try to configure a password like that one?\nAnother thing is does the no service password-encryption command disable encryption for current or future passwords? or may be both? And how can we break the type 7 encryption, so the encryption configured by the service password-encryption command?\nAnd for Telnet, we will see multiple ways of working with telnet as both the source and the destination, so how to return back to the original host without disconnecting the connection, how to show incoming connections on the destination and the outgoing connections on the source , and also the multiple ways of clearing these connections on either the source or the destination. Finally, we will see how to telnet to a specific port, so to check if BGP or HTTP are working on the remote host for example.\nAs for the network attacks, the IP Smufing attack was explained and demonstrated practically, which takes advantage of the IP directed broadcast feature, and the ways of mitigating this attack were also explained in practical manner.",

It is a software function provided at a network address over the Web with the service always-on as in the concept of utility computing.\nIn a Web service a Web technology such as HTTP is used for transferring machine-readable file formats such as XML and JSON.\nThe term Web service (WS) is either:\na service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web, or\na server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images).\nIn practice, a web service commonly provides an object-oriented Web-based interface to a database server, utilized for example by another Web server, or by a mobile app, that provides a user interface to the end-user. Many organizations that provide data in formatted HTML pages will also provide that data on their server as XML or JSON, often through a Web service to allow syndication.\nOn this training we will learn how interacting with Avaya IP Office Server or the Avaya OneCloud CPaaS to perform all of your telephony needs is as simple as visiting a website. You will understand how REST is useful when developing with Avaya Products. With so many possibilities and mash-up ideas, the sky is the limit to the things you can do using Avaya IP Office Server Platform and the Avaya OneCloud CPaaS's REST functionalities. Avaya REST API can initiate calls, record phone calls, buy phone numbers, send SMS messages, get detailed information about account activity, create conference calls, and much more! We will learn about all of the capabilities of Avaya RESTfull Web Services can provide.",

This isn’t just another certificate to hang on your wall—it’s a powerful validation of your ability to lead product development, maximize value, and transform ideas into impactful realities in an Agile environment. Recognized worldwide by employers—from innovative startups to giants like Google and Amazon—PSPO I sets you apart as a professional who doesn’t just understand Scrum but can apply it effectively as a Product Owner. Unlike some certifications that you can earn by simply showing up, PSPO I requires you to pass a challenging online exam, proving your practical mastery of Scrum. That’s what makes it so prestigious and rewarding.\nPicture yourself as the driving force behind a successful product, where every decision you make delivers real value to customers and your organization. That’s the journey PSPO I prepares you for.

The PSPO I isn’t handed to you on a silver platter; it’s a challenge that demands dedication, but the payoff is worth every ounce of effort.\nLearning Objectives – What You’ll Gain\nBy pursuing PSPO I, you’ll master critical skills that set the foundation for success as a Product Owner:\nComprehensive Understanding of the Scrum Framework: You’ll dive deep into Scrum’s roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), events (Sprint, Daily Scrum), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog), learning how they work together to drive successful product development.\nMaximizing Product Value: Discover how to identify what truly matters, prioritize features that deliver the most impact, and make data-driven decisions—a must-have skill for any top-tier Product Owner.\nEffective Stakeholder Collaboration: Gain the ability to bridge the gap between customers, business leaders, and development teams, ensuring everyone is aligned on a shared vision and working toward the same goals.\nExpert Product Backlog Management: Master the craft of writing clear user stories, refining backlog items, and ordering priorities based on value and risk, so your team always focuses on what’s most important.\nThese aren’t just theoretical concepts—they’re practical tools you can apply immediately to make a tangible difference in your workplace. With PSPO I, you’re not just preparing for an exam; you’re preparing to lead with confidence.\nExam Format and Passing Score\nThe PSPO I assessment is a true test of your abilities:\nFormat: An online, 60-minute exam featuring 80 multiple-choice questions. These aren’t simple rote-memory questions—they present real-world scenarios that challenge you to think like a Product Owner and apply Scrum principles under pressure.\nPassing Score: You need to score 85% (at least 68 out of 80 questions correct). It’s a high standard, but it ensures that PSPO I holders are genuinely skilled and capable.\nCost: $200 per attempt. There’s no limit on retakes, but with the right preparation, I’m confident you can pass on your first try!\nSixty minutes might sound intense, but don’t worry—with my guidance, you’ll walk into the exam feeling calm, prepared, and ready to tackle every question.\nWhy Choose My Practice Questions?\nI’m not just offering you a set of practice questions—I’m giving you a proven pathway to success.

You’ll study with cutting-edge, relevant content—no outdated fluff here.\nRealistic, Scenario-Based Practice: I’ve designed questions that mirror the exam’s focus on practical application, from tricky backlog prioritization dilemmas to stakeholder negotiation challenges. You’ll train your mind to think like a Product Owner in real-life situations, making the actual exam feel like second nature.\nComprehensive Support for Mastery: My question bank comes with detailed explanations, insider tips, and supplementary resources to reinforce your learning. I’m not just preparing you to pass—I’m equipping you to excel in your career with confidence and skill.\nMy previous students have achieved outstanding pass rates, with many scoring near-perfect marks on their first attempt.

IPv4 had 32-bit addresses and ran out of public addresses in 2011 at the top (IANA) level, then at all five Regional Internet Registries in the next few years. There are now very few IPv4 public addresses available. IPv6 has 128-bit addresses, for 340 trillion, trillion, trillion possible addresses. It eliminates the need for Network Address Translation and RFC 1918 private addresses which have caused numerous problems with the IPv4 Internet. IPv6 was specified in 1995, but major adoption began in 2014.

      "description": "This is an ISTQB® accredited course for the the CTFL (Certified Tester Foundation Level) certification for the latest syllabus! As a bonus, the ISTQB® Agile Extension (CTFL-AT) is included in this course!\n\n\nThis is not a read-out of the syllabi as is the case in many other courses as I do not see that as a proper course. The information from the syllabi is used in this course, mentioned, explained and wherever necessary examples are given in native-level English. Each chapter contains a quiz at the end which contains actual exam questions in order for you to get used to the way questions are asked on the exam. In each chapter we will also solve several questions together to get you used to the way questions are asked in the ISTQB® Exam. This is an important part as both the questions and answers are sometimes formulated to throw you off.\n\n\nThis course has been written to help (aspiring) software testers, developers and other people interested in software testing grasp the basics and fundamentals of software testing. The Foundation Level course is both accredited for V4.0 and I have included the entire Agile Extension course (CTFL-AT) as a bonus. The entire syllabi for CTFL and CTFL-AT are covered and some extra bonus material is also included. All terminology matches the terminology used in the online ISTQB® glossary.\n\n\nBesides getting you ready for the ISTQB®-CTFL exam AND the ISTQB®-CTFL-AT exam with the course, sample exams and tips and tricks, I would really like to teach you about software testing; things that you can use in your day-to-day work.\n\n\nAs you can see on Udemy, there are various courses already on this subject; so why would you take this course?\n1. The course has been written on the latest version (2023 - V4.0) AND and some interesting and valuable subjects from the 2011 and 2018 versions are also included;\n2. The CTFL material is ISTQB® accredited and is the same material as if you would come in and join one of my classroom trainings;\n3. I have included the ENTIRE Agile Extension course (CTFL-AT) course as a bonus;\n3. There are more than 130 questions included in the course that will help you greatly; sample questions are also constantly added;\n4. We will go through questions together in each chapter;\n5. Examples and exercises form a vital aspect of this course;\n6. No false promises about you being a great software tester after you finish this course; however, this course is a very good starting point;\n7. You will learn the basics and should be able to pass the exam without problems in the first go (if you pay attention of course);\n8. Besides getting ready for the exam and most likely passing it on your first attempt, you will get a solid understanding of software testing fundamentals.\n9. There is some overlap between the CTFL and the CTFL-AT Material, so in the Agile Extension course some subjects from the CTFL course are shortly revisited.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or remarks during the course, please post it on the discussion board and I will answer as fast as possible.",

It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.\nTo use Amazon EC2, you simply:\nSelect a pre-configured, templated Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to get up and running immediately. Or create an AMI containing your applications, libraries, data, and associated configuration settings.\nConfigure security and network access on your Amazon EC2 instance.\nChoose which instance type(s) you want, then start, terminate, and monitor as many instances of your AMI as needed, using the web service APIs or the variety of management tools provided.\nDetermine whether you want to run in multiple locations, utilize static IP endpoints, or attach persistent block storage to your instances.\nPay only for the resources that you actually consume, like instance-hours or data transfer.\nEven though EC2 is a foundational topic, it is of great importance as it is used in all the testing and enterprise level deployments.\nThe entire course has been broken down into following 13 sections:-\nIn-Depth Conceptual Understanding of EC2 & its Components - In this section, we go through the main components required to launch our EC2 instances in the AWS cloud.\nBringing All the Pieces Together - Here we  combine all the components together we went through in the previous one, and finally do some real hands-on as we will be launching and connecting to our EC2 instances.\nOn-Demand & Reserved Instances - In this section, we go through two of the EC2 purchasing options - On-Demand and Reserved Instances.\nSavings Plan - We understand how we can make use of Savings Plans to get huge discounts on our compute usage and still get more flexibility compared to Reserved Instances.\nCapacity Reservations - In this section, we understand how we can reserve capacity for our Amazon EC2 instances in a specific AZ, when we need it, for as long as we need it.\nSpot Instances - We understand the relevance of Spot Instances which enable to you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts.\nDedicated Instances & Dedicated Hosts - In this section, we go through the concepts based on Dedicated Instances and Dedicated Hosts.\nElastic IP Addresses (EIPs) - We focus on the advantages of Elastic IP addresses over Public IP addresses.\nElastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) - In this section, we explore various features, attributes and benefits of ENIs.\nElastic Load Balancing (ELB) - We learn the importance of using load balancers in our cloud infrastructure, different types of load balancers, and finally go through some of the advanced concepts.\nIntroduction to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling - We understand the basics of Auto Scaling, and explore its various components and features.\nAmazon EC2 Auto Scaling Deep Dive - Over here, we deep dive into the advanced features and deployments done using Auto Scaling.\nMain Quiz - Test yourself by answering some complex questions based on the topics we have gone through in this course.",

      "description": "Preparing for Java 21 Certification and looking for practice questions to increase your speed and accuracy, then you have come to the right place.  In this Udemy course, I am going to share more than 250+ questions divided into 6 practice tests to prepare you thoroughly for all the exam topics tested in the Java 1Z0-830 exam for Java 21 developers.\nHonestly speaking, this exam is one of the toughest exam I have come across. I have given and passed multiple Java certification starting from SCJP 4 to Java 17 but this one is toughest of them all because of the number of concepts they are testing on a single question.\n\n\nSome questions were really long, like you need to spend one or two minutes to truly understand what's going on, and then you may have 8 to 10 options, which increases the chances of missing any correct option. I mean, there is no way you can solve these questions in a limited time if you have not practiced enough.\n\n\nThat's why the importance of practice questions and mock exams is even greater for 1Z0-830, and I am trying to help with this course.\n\n\nThis is a practice test course to prepare for the Java SE 21 Developer Professional Exam 1Z0-830 in 2025. This practice test course has 5 full-length tests with 50+ questions on each to test your preparation. They are great to build the speed and accuracy required to crack this certification in the first attempt.\nEach practice questions comes with explanation and you can use them to find your strong and weak areas before actual example. Udemy also allows you to see topic where you are scoring high and where you need more practice.\nThe real exam will have 50 questions, and you will have 120 minutes or 2 hours to solve them, which means you will get approximately 2 minutes for each question.\n\n\nIn these 2 minutes, you will not just need to read the question and understand it, but also read all options and understand them as well.\nMany people struggle to do this because of a lack of practice, and that's where these practice tests or mock tests help you, and you really need them if you want to crack 1Z0-830, which is one of the toughest Java certifications so far.\n\n\nYou can guess it from the simple fact that compared to Java 17 Professional Exam 1Z0-829, this certification has more time, 120 minute,s compared to 90 minutes for solving the same number of questions, 50. Why would they give you more time?\nWell, because each question is much longer, lengthy, complex, and has up to 4 to 10 options to choose from.\nBecause of that, even after adding 30 minutes, many people will struggle to solve 34 questions correctly, which is required to pass this exam.\nHere are a few important points about Java SE 21 Professional Exam or OCP 21 with code 1Z0-830\nYou need to solve 50 questions in 120 minutes\nThe passing mark is 68%, which means you need to solve 34 questions correctly\nQuestions are very long,g you may need to scroll to see them fully, which can take a lot of time\nThe number of options has increased; you can have from 4 to 10 options to choose from\nThere is no question from the topic removed from 1Z0-830 compared to 1Z0-829, like JDBC, Secure Coding, and Annotations.\nQuestions are complex and test multiple topics at the same time.\nA few important topics are modules, streams, records, var, pattern matching with switch, and virtual threads\n\n\n\n\nIn order to prepare well for 1Z0-830, I suggest you solve as many questions as possible to build the speed and accuracy required to pass this exam on your first attempt.\nIdeally, you should do them in a quiet place, more like a real exam scenario, and try to finish them within time. This will allow you to judge your preparation level.\nI have also included slightly more than 50 questions in each practice test to push you a bit more, as those last-minute pushes make a big difference. So you will solve more than 50 questions in 120 minutes to prepare better for the exam.\nEach practice test is a full-length test and covers all exam topics, but the focus is given on Java SE 21 new features like Virtual threads and scoped variables, wherever possible.\nYou will find many questions on virtual threads and scoped variables in this test, along with modules, Stream API, Collection API, and other topics.\nSo, look forward to seeing you inside the test.\nIf you have any questions or doubts while doing the test, feel free to message me in Q&A, and I will try my best to answer and help you out.\nAll the best with your 1Z0-830 exam, and I wish you to score 100/100\n\n\nExam Objectives\nHere are all the Exam objectives that will be tested in the exam, and I have tried to cover all of them in these practice questions and mock tests.\n\n\nHandling Date, Time, Text, Numeri,c and Boolean Values\nUse primitives and wrapper classes. Evaluate arithmetic and boolean expressions, using the Math API and by applying precedence rules, type conversions, and casting.\nManipulate text, including text blocks, using String and StringBuilder classes.\nManipulate date, time, duration, period, instant, and time-zone objects, including daylight saving time using Date-Time API.\n\n\nControlling Program Flow\nCreate program flow control constructs including if/else, switch statements and expressions, loops, and break and continue statements.\n\n\nUsing Object-Oriented Concepts in Java\nDeclare and instantiate Java objects, including nested class objects, and explain the object life-cycle, including creation, reassigning references, and garbage collection.\nCreate classes and records, and define and use instance and static fields and methods, constructors, and instance and static initializers.\nImplement overloaded methods, including var-arg methods.\nUnderstand variable scopes, apply encapsulation, and create immutable objects. Use local variable type inference.\nImplement inheritance, including abstract and sealed types as well as record classes. Override methods, including that of the Object class. Implement polymorphism and differentiate between object type and reference type. Perform reference type casting, identify object types using the instanceof operator, and pattern matching with the instanceof operator and the switch construct.\nCreate and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static, and default interface methods.\nCreate and use enum types with fields, methods, and constructors.\n\n\nHandling Exceptions\nHandle exceptions using try/catch/finally, try-with-resources, and multi-catch blocks, including custom exceptions.\n\n\nWorking with Arrays and Collections\nCreate arrays, List, Set, Map and Deque collections, and add, remove, update, retrieve, and sort their elements.\n\n\nWorking with Streams and Lambda Expressions\nUse Java object and primitive Streams, including lambda expressions implementing functional interfaces, to create, filter, transform, process, and sort data.\nPerform decomposition, concatenation, reduction, grouping, and partitioning on sequential and parallel streams.\n\n\nPackaging and Deploying Java Code\nDefine modules and expose module content, including that by reflection, and declare module dependencies, define services, providers, and consumers.\nCompile Java code, create modular and non-modular jars, runtime images, and implement migration to modules using unnamed and automatic modules.\n\n\nManaging Concurrent Code Execution\nCreate both platform and virtual threads. Use both Runnable and Callable objects, manage the thread lifecycle, and use different Executor services and concurrent API to run tasks.\nDevelop thread-safe code, using locking mechanisms and concurrent API.\nProcess Java collections concurrently and utilize parallel streams.\n\n\nUsing Java I/O API\nRead and write console and file data using I/O streams.\nSerialize and deserialize Java objects.\nConstruct, traverse, create, read, and write Path objects and their properties using the java.nio.file API.\n\n\nImplementing Localization\nImplement localization using locales and resource bundles. Parse and format messages, dates, times, and numbers, including currency and percentage values.",

The average CISSP salary in the US is over USD147,000 a year.\n\n\nWhat our other students are saying about my CISSP courses:\nI passed the CISSP with the ISC Book and Thor's lectures and practice questions. Enough said! (Warren, 5-stars)\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. I scored your tests above 75% and real test was bit challenging than them. Thank you Shan (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars)\nOf all the practice tests have paid for this one is the most helpful because it gave precise results so I am able to focus on the week points. I also appreciate how quickly Thor updated the test to reflect the new CAT style exam. (Kim, 5-stars)\nThis is my third course experience and Thor is my third instructor. I gave Thor a 5-star because of his knowledge, his grasp of English language, and his attitude. I love how Thor can explain complicated concepts clearly and make them easy to understand. I love how humble and polite his attitude is. I also like the fact that he is attentive and responsive to my questions. (Jin, 5-stars)\n\n\nAt the end of the test, you will get an explanation for each question and explaining to why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can see the total percentage score for the entire test as well as a weighted percent score for each of the 8 CISSP domains.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\n\nThe questions on these tests have the same domain weight as the real CISSP exam does.\nSecurity and Risk Management – 20 questions\nAsset Security – 13 questions\nSecurity Engineering – 15 questions\nCommunications and Network Security – 15 questions\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) – 16 questions\nSecurity Assessment and Testing – 14 questions\nSecurity Operations – 20 questions\nSoftware Development Security – 12 questions\n\nI recommend students to do 1,500-3,000 easy/mid CISSP practice questions and 1,000-1,500 HARD/COMPLEX CISSP practice questions before the exam.\nI think learning how to balance competing requirements is critical for passing your CISSP exam, I designed these questions to teach you exactly that.\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it. This is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right and answering from an IT Security manager's point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.\nOn hard questions you will score lower. It is normal to score 80%+ on easy/mid questions and 50-60% on hard/complex questions.\nThe point of all questions is to find the gaps in your knowledge, learn how to deconstruct questions, argue WHY the answer you chose is the RIGHT answer in this scenario, making you ready for exam day.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2024 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nYou'll Also Get:\nLifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n30-days no questions asked, money back guarantee.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

You can download them for free.\nWhen can I learn?\nYou can begin immediately and learn anytime 24/7 at your own pace.\nWhat makes this course the best?\nThis the best hands-on course because of two important things:\nYou will learn configurations included on the CCNA exam along with real-world skills actually used by network engineers.\nYou will learn each configuration in a logical order. No random configurations here! We will build a fully functional network together, one step at a time, from beginning to end, in an order just like engineers do on the job.\nEach of the configurations and skills taught in this course fulfill the CCNA exam goals such as configuration of DHCP, static routes, routing protocols, Network Time Protocol, System-Log Server, inter-vlan routing, SSH, ether-channel, remote login, some cable information (types of cabling used), troubleshooting, and much more. This course also includes separate PDF handouts per appropriate sections that also contain the complete configurations to study and practice on your own. This course also fulfills exam goals for the Network+ and portions of the A+ exams.\nFREE book and certification of completion\nThis course also includes a FREE copy of my book On the Command Line. By the way, On the Command Line by J.Diamond is available from amazon, and it includes 100 of the most popular commands and configurations many of which are part of the current CCNA exam track. All command and configurations are listed line-by-line with diagrams and real screen shots.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy the course, and I wish you all the best in your IT career.\nJeff Diamond\nCCNA / FOA CPCT, CFOT",

      "description": "Are you Getting ready for SAA-C03, the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam?  Then you have come to the right place. These practice tests are designed to help you Ace the certification exam.\nThese practice tests have been authored by Abhishek Kumar who has 11 years of experience in the Software Industry and is currently working as an AWS infrastructure consultant in a multinational company. He is AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate and AWS Certified Security Specialist.\nThe questions are of the same level and complexity as in the real AWS certification exam. All the questions have a detailed explanation of the correct and incorrect options. If an answer is correct, an exhaustive explanation is provided along with a diagram. If an option is incorrect, a detailed explanation is provided so that you have a clear understanding of the underlying subject.\nThis course is designed in such a way that you will not need any other further reading material or practice tests to clear the exam. This course extensively covers all the topics of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) exam.\n\nSample Question:\nA company's HTTP application is behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB). The NLB's target group is configured to use an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with multiple EC2 instances that run the web service.\nThe company notices that the NLB is not detecting HTTP errors for the application. These errors require a manual restart of the EC2 instances that run the web service. The company needs to improve the application's availability without writing custom scripts or code.\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?\n\n\nEnable HTTP health checks on the NLB, supplying the URL of the company's application.\nAdd a cron job to the EC2 instances to check the local application's logs once each minute. If HTTP errors are detected the application will restart.\nReplace the NLB with an Application Load Balancer. Enable HTTP health checks by supplying the URL of the company's application. Configure an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances.\nCreate an Amazon Cloud Watch alarm that monitors the UnhealthyHostCount metric for the NLB. Configure an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances when the alarm is in the ALARM state.\n\nExplanation:\nOption A is Incorrect:\nEnabling HTTP health checks on the Network Load Balancer (NLB) by supplying the URL of the company's application would detect any HTTP errors, but it would still require a manual restart of the EC2 instances. The goal is to improve the application's availability without manual intervention.\n\nOption B is Incorrect:\nAdding a cron job to the EC2 instances to check the local application's logs once each minute and restarting the application if HTTP errors are detected would improve the availability of the application, but it would require writing custom scripts or code. This is not in line with the requirement of not writing custom scripts or code.\n\nOption C is Correct:\nThis solution replaces the Network Load Balancer (NLB) with an Application Load Balancer (ALB), which provides more advanced health-checking capabilities for HTTP applications. By enabling HTTP health checks on the ALB and supplying the URL of the company's application, the ALB will automatically detect HTTP errors and take appropriate actions to improve the application's availability. This can be achieved without writing custom scripts or code, which is one of the requirements of the company. It also configures an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances, further improving the application's availability.\n\nOption D is Incorrect:\nCreating an Amazon Cloud Watch alarm that monitors the UnhealthyHostCount metric for the NLB and configuring an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances when the alarm is in the ALARM state would detect HTTP errors, but it would still require a manual replacement of the instances. The goal is to improve the application's availability without manual intervention.\n\n\nGood luck with your AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam and happy learning !!",

Their are thousand of courses on AWS but none teaches the student in a practical project based manner and cover end to end lifecycle of a cloud application. Students spend money after money and pay for courses to get these skills. This course is a complete bootcamp that turns student into AWS Ninja. Say no to buying more and more courses. Every latest aspect of cloud services will be covered in this course. Best part the course will be updated with new content and services for lifetime. So no more searching for a course that cover few AWS services. Join and become an AWS Ninja.\nWhen i started building my own products as part of www.yogafire.guru i found  the limitation of courses that are offered on various websites. As an entrepreneur it was a frustrating experience to buy courses after courses and none covering how to make a product from end to end. This course is an attempt to fill that gap.

      "description": "Master AWS Machine Learning Services and Pass the MLS-C01 Certification Exam\nThis comprehensive course prepares you for the AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty (MLS-C01) certification exam through extensive content covering all essential AWS services. Aligned with the official AWS exam guide, the curriculum addresses all four certification domains: Data Engineering (20%), Exploratory Data Analysis (24%), Modeling (36%), and Machine Learning Implementation & Operations (20%).\nWhat You'll Learn:\nThrough structured lectures combining theory and hands-on demonstrations, you'll master the complete ML lifecycle on AWS. Build data ingestion pipelines using Kinesis, Glue, and EMR. Design feature engineering solutions with proper data preprocessing and transformation techniques. Train and optimize models using SageMaker's built-in algorithms and custom implementations. Deploy production-ready ML solutions with comprehensive security, monitoring, and operational best practices.\nCourse Structure:\nEach AWS service receives dedicated coverage with theoretical explanation followed by practical demonstration. Starting with foundational analytics services (Athena, Redshift, QuickSight), you'll progress through compute options (EC2, Lambda, Batch), containerization (ECS, EKS, Fargate), and dive deep into ML-specific services. The centerpiece SageMaker section covers end-to-end model development, while AI services like Comprehend, Rekognition, Transcribe, and Textract demonstrate pre-built ML capabilities.\nHands-On Learning:\nA significant portion of the course consists of hands-on labs where you'll implement real solutions in the AWS console. Configure VPCs for secure ML environments, set up IAM policies for least-privilege access, implement CloudWatch monitoring for model performance, and build complete ML pipelines from data ingestion to model deployment. Every demonstration uses free-tier eligible services, ensuring you can follow along without significant costs.\nExam Preparation:\nBeyond service knowledge, you'll understand key ML concepts required for certification: hyperparameter optimization, cross-validation, bias-variance tradeoffs, evaluation metrics (AUC-ROC, F1, precision/recall), and model selection criteria. Learn when to use built-in algorithms versus custom models, how to right-size infrastructure for cost optimization, and best practices for MLOps including A/B testing and automated retraining pipelines.\nAdditional Resources:\nThe course includes downloadable PDF slides for offline review, practice questions aligned with exam format, and reference materials for continued learning. Each section builds upon previous knowledge, creating a structured learning path from fundamentals to advanced implementations.\nWho Should Enroll:\nPerfect for data scientists, ML engineers, cloud architects, and developers pursuing AWS ML specialty certification. Whether advancing from AWS ML Associate certification or building on existing ML experience, this course provides both theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed for exam success and real-world implementation.\nStart your journey to becoming an AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialist today.",

The company has a strict requirement that all data placed onto the stream must be encrypted. Additionally, they want to maintain control over key rotation to ensure data security.\nWhich solution best meets the requirements?\nA) Data is automatically encrypted when using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams therefore no further action is required.\nB) Enable encryption and ‘rotate key’ option when creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream.\nC) Use a KMS Customer Master Key to encrypt data on an Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.\nD) A customer should hash the data before placing it onto an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Server-side encryption is a feature in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams that automatically encrypts data before it's at rest by using an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) you specify. Data is encrypted before it's written to the Kinesis stream storage layer, and decrypted after it’s retrieved from storage. As a result, your data is encrypted at rest within the Kinesis Data Streams service. This allows you to meet strict regulatory requirements and enhance the security of your data.\n\n\nDon't leave your future to chance! Invest in your career and become an AWS Certified Data Engineer with our premium DEA-C01 practice exam.

It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension “. php”.\nRasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participating in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler.\nPHP code is executed in the server.\nIt can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, Informix.\nIt is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control user access.\nIt supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.\nOne of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.\nThe thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, PHP codes are executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.\nThe only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support other client-side scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.\n\n\nCourse Highlights:\n140+ MCQ & Answers in PHP with explanations\nEvery MCQ set focuses on specific topic in PHP Subject\nThese topics are chosen from a collection of most authoritative and best books on PHP programming language\nDetail about Test:\nPractice Test 1:  Basic Question. --- 30 MCQ\nPractice Test 2: String and functions --- 30 MCQ\nPractice Test 3: Loops and arrays  --- 30 MCQ\nPractice Test 4: Regex and timestamp. --- 20 MCQ\nPractice Test 5: OOPS and Advanced Concepts --- 30 MCQ",

Scrum is straightforward to understand but very difficult to master. Scrum has been used for managing work on complex products since the early 1990s. Many people think that Scrum is a methodology. It is not. Scrum is a framework.\n\n\n== The Scrum Master ==\nThe Scrum Master helps everybody to understand Scrum values, rules, and theory. It is the person coaching the Scrum Team on how to use the Scrum framework.\nMany people new to Agile and Scrum aspire to become Scrum Masters. A Scrum certification can help show what you have the understanding needed.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between PSM I and PSPO I?\nThe PSPO I certification is relatively similar to another popular certification called PSM I. Even if you have passed the PSM I exam, it does not mean that the PSPO I exam will be the same.\n\nWhile the focus on the PSM I exam has focused on general Scrum rules and the role of the Scrum Master in different situations, the PSPO I exam is more focused on the role of the Product Owner in different circumstances and how the Product Owner can maximize value.\n\n\n\n\n== Frequent questions ==\nIs this UNOFFICIAL course up to date for the 2024 exam?\nYes. This course is constantly being updated and improved. It is valid for the 2024 version of the exam.\n\n\nOn which version of the Scrum Guide is this UNOFFICIAL course based?\nThis UNOFFICIAL course is compliant with the 2020 version of the Scrum Guide.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\nPSM I includes questions from the following Focus Areas as defined in the Professional Scrum Competencies.\nUnderstanding and Applying the Scrum Framework:\nEmpiricism, Scrum Values, Scrum Team, Events, Artifacts, Done\n\n\nDeveloping People and Teams:\nSelf-Managing Teams, Facilitation, Coaching\n\n\nManaging Products with Agility:\nForecasting & Release Planning, Product Value, Product Backlog Management, Stakeholders & Customers\n\nCertification Details PSM I\n$200 USD per attempt\nPassing score: 85%\nTime limit: 60 minutes\nNumber of Questions: 80\nFormat: Multiple Choice, Multiple Answer, True/False\nLanguage: English\nFree Credly digital credential included\n\n________________________________________________\n\nPSPO I includes questions from the following Focus Areas as defined in the Professional Scrum Competencies.\nUnderstanding and Applying the Scrum Framework:\nEmpiricism, Scrum Team, Events, Artifacts, Done\n\n\nDeveloping People and Teams:\nSelf-Managing Teams\n\n\nManaging Products with Agility:\nForecasting & Release Planning, Product Vision, Product Value, Product Backlog Management, Business Strategy, Stakeholders & Customers\n\n\n\n\nCertification Details PSPO I\n$200 USD per attempt\nPassing score: 85%\nTime limit: 60 minutes\nNumber of Questions: 80\nFormat: Multiple Choice, Multiple Answer, True/False\nLanguage:\nEnglish\nFree Credly digital credential included",

The course is only designed for those; willing to practice and work on real environment.  As lots of material on internet based on the theory and not cover practical examples, especially for those bugs, errors that nobody would identify or solve. if you would this course you would be able to work practically or can able to crack the Microsoft certifications easily related to the windows server environment. Course covers the comparison with the older and new versions of the Microsoft Windows Servers; from 2008 to 2022. Windows server 2022 is similar to the 2016, and 2019 however in 2012 there are many technologies ; have the same functionality. Microsoft Windows server certifications like MCSA , MCSE, hybrid Administration etc. demanding practical experience / knowledge to work on practical environment. Therefore, this course covers all of the requirements that need to certify for new beginner. With practical knowledge , the students, learners can easily avail the job related to the IT administration, Network administration or system administration in Windows server environment. After working to Virtualization, you can work easily on Azure environment that the cloud based environment to manage your resources online but it's paid. I hope! you would enjoy the course contents after enrollment because it's took years to design this course! There's no course on this platform that covers all the versions of the Windows server environment but this course does cover so this course is designed for those; want to start or work from beginner to advance/extreme level of the Windows Server Environment. \"A unique content is priceless\"  Thanks",

For this reason I have made this course in order for CCNA students to understand Static routing and both its basic and advanced configuration in depth.\nThis course includes four parts:\nBasic Configuration of Static Routing: which explains Static Routing Using the Next-Hop, Static Routing Using the Local Exit Interface, Configuring default static routes, and how can Loops occur with Static Routing.\nAdvanced Configuration of Static Routing: which explains Load Balancing using Static Routing, Floating Static Routes with IP SLA, Getting Help from HSRP and Verifying the Configuration, Static Routing using DHCP, and Configuring Permanent Static Routes. This part is challenging and has a lot of information!.\nRouting Troubleshooting Lab: In addition to static routing, learn how to troubleshoot dynamic routing protocols like EIGRP and OSPF.\nPractice Test: in order for the students to check their understanding of the concepts and configurations explained in the course.\nThis course moves gradually from basic concepts and configurations to the advanced ones. If you want to learn about the basic concepts and configurations of Static routing  or refresh your your knowledge, then you can watch part 1. If you are already familiar with static routing, you can go directly ant watch part 2 about advanced configuration of static routing.\nI hope that that you will find this course useful, and and that it will help you to understand everything about static Routing!

Communication between Goroutines is managed through what is called channels.\nSending and receiving data through channels is done with simple syntax like  <-  left arrow operator . Golang has got built in support for JSON. JSON is nothing but Java Script Object Notation. Go has so many features like Slice and arrays. Go functions are capable of returning multiple values , unlike most other languages. Go has functions and methods , but Go method is not function. A method can return a receiver which functions are not able to.\nStrictly speaking Go is not an Object oriented language. Because Go does not have the concept of classes.  In spite of that Go is capable of managing polymorphism and data encapsulation etc. This is facilitated through what is called an interface. Go interface is fundamentally different from interfaces in other languages  In short Go is one of the most advanced modern programming languages specifically designed for systems programming in mind.\nThe Map data structure in Go is an elegant and ingenious mechanism for quick retrieval of data based on the the key-value pairs.

      "description": "The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have jointly released ISO/IEC 27001:2022, a standard for information security management systems (ISMS). This standard provides a framework for organizations to manage their sensitive information using a risk management process. Along with ISO 27001, ISO 27002 is closely related as it offers advice for implementing an ISO 27001 ISMS in practice.\nIn October 2022, a revised version of ISO 27001 was released after the release of the updated set of controls of ISO 27002 in February of the same year. These updates reflect the changing landscape of information security and provide organizations with the most up-to-date guidance for protecting their sensitive information.\nIn this course, you will learn why the ISO 27001 standard is one of the most widely used models for creating successful cybersecurity programs. You will discover what it takes to adhere to the standard and obtain certification of compliance. The course will cover the structure of the standard, the certification process, and provide a simple, step-by-step guide for creating an ISO 27001-compliant cybersecurity program as described in clauses four through ten.\nYou will also learn about the updates to ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 and how they affect businesses that have achieved or want to achieve ISO 27001 certification. The course will cover controls for information security, cybersecurity, and privacy protection within the framework of an ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS.\nBy the end of this course, you will have a thorough understanding of the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard and how to implement it within your organization to protect your sensitive information. You will learn about the importance of risk assessment and risk treatment in the implementation process and how to identify and evaluate risks to your organization's information security.\nThe course will also cover the importance of continuous improvement in maintaining an effective ISMS. You will learn about the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle and how it can be applied to your ISMS to ensure that it remains effective over time. The course will also cover the role of internal audits in monitoring and improving your ISMS.\nIn addition to learning about the requirements of the standard, you will also gain practical skills in implementing an ISMS. The course will include hands-on exercises and case studies to help you apply what you have learned to real-world scenarios.\nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard and its implementation. Whether you are new to information security or an experienced professional looking to update your knowledge, this course will provide you with valuable insights and practical skills that you can apply in your organization",

      "description": "Are you aiming to become an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate? Our comprehensive practice test course is designed to help you succeed. This six practice exams course offers 390 unique, high-quality test questions with detailed explanations, ensuring you thoroughly understand all the domains covered in the exam. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional looking to validate your skills, these practice tests will help you identify your strengths and areas for improvement, build your confidence, and increase your chances of passing the certification exam on your first attempt. Prepare effectively and efficiently with our targeted practice questions and detailed explanations, and take a significant step toward achieving your AWS certification goals.\nWe recommend re-taking these practice tests until you consistently score 80% or higher - that’s when you’re ready to take the exam and achieve an excellent score!\n\n\nSample Question:\nYour company’s software engineering group has developed a SaaS-based application. For the software to deploy into production so that your users start using it, you need to set up an EC2 Auto Scaling group by fronting it with an Application Load Balancer. Based on the company policy, you must ensure that each launched EC2 instance of the Auto Scaling group must have licensed security software installed as a scale-out event happens. Which of the following options is correct for this use case?\n\n\nUse EC2 Instance User Data to put the instance into a wait state and install the licensed security software.\nUse EC2 Instance Meta Data to put the instance into a wait state, then install the licensed security software.\nUse the Auto Scaling group scheduled action to put the EC2 instance into a wait instance to install the licensed security software.\nUse the Auto Scaling group Lifecycle hook to put the instance into a wait state to install the licensed security software.\nCorrect answer: Use the Auto Scaling group Lifecycle hook to put the instance into a wait state to install the licensed security software. Using the Auto Scaling group Lifecycle hook to put the instance into a wait state to install the licensed security software is the correct option for this use case. A Lifecycle hook allows you to perform custom actions before an instance is launched or terminated in an Auto Scaling group. By using a Lifecycle hook, you can ensure that the licensed security software is installed on each launched EC2 instance as part of the scale-out event.\n\n\nOverall explanation\nIn this scenario, the requirement is to ensure that each EC2 instance launched by an Auto Scaling group has licensed security software installed before it becomes operational. This can be effectively achieved using Auto Scaling group lifecycle hooks. Here’s a detailed explanation:\nLifecycle Hooks\nLifecycle hooks enable you to perform custom actions as the Auto Scaling group launches or terminates instances. By using lifecycle hooks, you can control what happens when an instance transitions from one state to another.\nHow Lifecycle Hooks Work:\nTransition States: Lifecycle hooks apply during specific transitions. For launching instances, the transition is from Pending to InService.\nWait State: When a lifecycle hook is triggered, the instance enters a wait state (Pending:Wait for launches). This wait state allows you to perform the necessary actions, such as installing software.\nActions During Wait State: You can run a script to install the licensed security software during the wait state.\nCompletion: Once the installation is complete, you signal to the Auto Scaling group that the instance is ready to move to the InService state.\nSteps to Implement Lifecycle Hooks:\nDefine a Lifecycle Hook: Create a lifecycle hook for the Auto Scaling group that triggers when an instance launches.\nInstall Software: Use the lifecycle hook to invoke a script or Lambda function that installs the security software.\nComplete the Lifecycle Action: Signal the completion of the lifecycle hook action to move the instance from Pending:Wait to InService.\n\n\nIncorrect Answer Explanation\nUse EC2 Instance User Data to put the instance into a wait state and install the licensed security software. Using EC2 Instance User Data to put the instance into a wait state and install the licensed security software is not a suitable option for this use case. EC2 Instance User Data is typically used for running scripts or commands during the instance launch process, not for handling scale-out events and installing software.\nUse EC2 Instance Meta Data to put the instance into a wait state, then install the licensed security software. Using EC2 Instance Meta Data to put the instance into a wait state and then install the licensed security software is not the correct approach for this use case. EC2 Instance Meta Data provides information about the instance itself, such as instance type, IP address, etc., and is not used for controlling the instance state or software installation.\nUse the Auto Scaling group scheduled action to put the EC2 instance into a wait instance to install the licensed security software. Using the Auto Scaling group scheduled action to put the EC2 instance into a wait state to install the licensed security software is not the recommended approach for this use case. Scheduled actions are typically used for predefined scaling activities at specific times, not for handling scale-out events and software installation.\n\n\nResources\nAWS Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hooks\nAmazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide\nAWS EC2 Instance Lifecycle",

You  will learn why and how to create and manage a multitenant container database and its regular and application pluggable databases, with storage structures appropriate for the business applications. You practice cold and hot cloning, plugging unplugged pluggable databases in multitenant container databases using various methods.\nYou will also learn how to create common and local users and administer database security to meet your business requirements by using encryption, Database Vault and auditing and you will learn how to create a database deployment in the Cloud.\n\n\nThe multitenant architecture will help bussines to use multiple database in one instance.\nMultitenant Database consolidation is the process of consolidating data from multiple databases into one database on one computer. Starting in Oracle Database 12c, the Oracle Multitenant option enables you to consolidate data and code without altering existing schemas or applications.\nStarting in Oracle Database 21c, a multitenant container database is the only supported architecture. In previous releases, Oracle supported non-container databases (non-CDBs).\n\n\nCDB\nA CDB contains one or more user-created PDBs and application containers.\nAt the physical level, a CDB is a set of files: control file, online redo log files, and data files. The database instance manages the files that make up the CDB.\n\n\nPDBs\nA PDB is a portable collection of schemas, schema objects, and nonschema objects that appears to an application as a separate database.\nAt the physical level, each PDB has its own set of data files that store the data for the PDB. The CDB includes all the data files for the PDBs contained within it, and a set of system data files that store metadata for the CDB itself.",

It is very valuable and a definite requirement in some institutions who have seen the great benefits of using Scrum in their organization.\n\n\nWhat does a CSM do day to day?\n\n\nA CSM keeps the team following Scrum practices, helps remove impediments, host stand-up meetings, etc.\n\n\nHow many hours does a CSM work?\n\n\nA CSM can probably spend 15 hours a week on a project. He can handle more than 1 project at a time.\n\n\nWho gets paid more Scrum Master or project manager?\n\n\nThis depends on the company employing them, and the roles they hold. If they hold only that role, and they work in the same company, they can still have varying indeterminate differences in salary. One can make more than the other. Salary also depends highly on your negotiation skills, and the job market demand.\n\n\nShould I get CSM before PMP?\n\n\nNo. There is no dependency in between these 2 certifications. You can take either one first.\n\n\nCSM and PMP applies to different job roles. CSM is related to the usage of Scrum in a team, while PMP is on project management. If the person has more that one roles, both certifications can benefit him.\n\n\nDo Scrum Masters need a degree?\n\n\nNo. Scrum and degrees has nothing to do with each other. You can become a Scrum Master without a degree.\n\n\n\n\nAll The Best!  We are sure that you will pass!\niTestScrum Team",

Its popularity stems from a variety of compelling reasons, ranging from scalability and portability to automation and resource efficiency.\n\n\nKubernetes excels in managing containerized applications at scale. In today's dynamic computing environments, where applications need to scale up and down rapidly to meet fluctuating demand, Kubernetes provides a robust platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized workloads. Its declarative model allows developers to specify the desired state of their applications, and Kubernetes takes care of ensuring that the actual state matches the desired state, even as conditions change.\n\n\nPortability is another key advantage of Kubernetes. With Kubernetes, developers can build their applications once and then deploy them consistently across a variety of environments, from on-premises data centers to public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. This portability reduces vendor lock-in and enables organizations to adopt a multi-cloud strategy, leveraging the strengths of different cloud providers while avoiding being tied to any one of them.\n\n\nKubernetes fosters a culture of automation, enabling teams to streamline their development and operations workflows. By abstracting away the underlying infrastructure and providing a unified API for managing applications, Kubernetes allows developers to focus on writing code rather than worrying about the nitty-gritty details of deployment and scaling. This automation accelerates the pace of software delivery, enabling organizations to release new features and updates more frequently and reliably.\n\n\nResource efficiency is also a major benefit of Kubernetes. By optimizing resource utilization and packing multiple containers onto each host, Kubernetes helps organizations make the most of their infrastructure investments. Kubernetes can automatically scale applications based on demand, spinning up additional instances when traffic spikes and scaling them down during periods of low activity. This elasticity ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, minimizing waste and reducing operational costs.\n\n\nIn addition to these technical advantages, Kubernetes has a vibrant ecosystem and strong community support. The Kubernetes community is large and active, with thousands of contributors from across the globe working together to improve the platform and develop new features. This collaborative approach has led to rapid innovation and a rich ecosystem of tools and technologies that complement Kubernetes, including monitoring and logging solutions, continuous integration and delivery pipelines, and security and compliance tools.\n\n\nFurthermore, Kubernetes is highly extensible and customizable, allowing organizations to tailor the platform to their specific needs. Whether it's integrating with existing systems and workflows or adding custom functionality through plugins and extensions, Kubernetes provides the flexibility to adapt to a wide range of use cases and requirements.\n\n\nFinally, Kubernetes is future-proof, providing a solid foundation for building cloud-native applications that can scale and evolve with changing business needs. As organizations continue to embrace digital transformation and adopt cloud-native architectures, Kubernetes will play an increasingly central role in enabling these initiatives.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Kubernetes offers a compelling set of features and benefits that make it the platform of choice for container orchestration in today's fast-paced world of software development and deployment. From scalability and portability to automation and resource efficiency, Kubernetes provides the tools and capabilities that organizations need to build, deploy, and manage modern applications at scale. As such, it's no wonder that Kubernetes has become the cornerstone of cloud-native computing and a key enabler of digital innovation.\n\n\nAbout Kubernetes Practice Tests\nYAML and generic Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and Multi-Select Questions (MSQ) based on Kubernetes can be a valuable learning tool for several reasons:\n\n\nApplication of Knowledge: Questions based on YAML files require understanding of Kubernetes object specifications and syntax. By answering these questions, learners can apply their knowledge of Kubernetes concepts in a practical context.\n\n\nTesting Understanding: Questions assess the depth of understanding a learner has about Kubernetes. They can cover various aspects such as pod configurations, service definitions, deployment strategies, and more.\n\n\nImmediate Feedback: Questions provide instant feedback on whether the answer selected is correct or incorrect. This immediate feedback helps learners identify areas of weakness and reinforce understanding.\n\n\nFocus on Key Concepts: Crafting questions requires careful selection of concepts deemed important. By answering these questions, learners can focus on mastering these key concepts essential for working with Kubernetes.\n\n\nCritical Thinking: Well-designed questions can also require critical thinking skills, especially if they include scenarios or require learners to analyze YAML files to identify errors or best practices.\n\n\nEfficiency: Questions can cover a wide range of topics in a relatively short amount of time. This efficiency is particularly useful for learners who want to review their understanding or test their knowledge within a constrained timeframe.\n\n\nEngagement: Questions can be engaging, especially when designed with interesting scenarios or challenges. This engagement can enhance the learning experience and motivate learners to delve deeper into Kubernetes concepts.\n\n\nRetention: Research shows that active recall, which questions promote, enhances retention of information over time. By regularly engaging with questions, learners can reinforce their understanding of Kubernetes concepts and retain knowledge for longer periods.\n\n\nOverall, questions based on Kubernetes serve as a practical and efficient tool for assessing and reinforcing knowledge of Kubernetes concepts, syntax, and best practices.\n\n\nLevel up your Kubernetes skills with our Bonus Jumbo Practice Test, featuring over 100 challenging questions. This test is designed to complement our existing 5 practice tests, providing you with an invaluable opportunity to solidify your knowledge and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nDon't miss this chance to:\n\n\nTest your understanding of core Kubernetes concepts.\nIdentify your strengths and weaknesses.\nBoost your confidence in your Kubernetes abilities.\n\n\nEnroll now!",

CompTIA PenTest+ prepares candidates for the following job roles:\nPenetration tester\nVulnerability tester\nSecurity analyst (II)\nVulnerability assessment analyst\nNetwork security operations\nApplication security vulnerability\nWhat Is on the CompTIA PenTest+ Exam?\nCompTIA PenTest+ is an intermediate-skills level cybersecurity certification that focuses on offensive skills through pen testing and vulnerability assessment.\nSuccessful candidates will have the following skills to:\nPlan and scope penetration tests\nConduct passive reconnaissance\nPerform non-technical tests to gather information\nConduct active reconnaissance\nAnalyze vulnerabilities\nPenetrate networks\nExploit host-based vulnerabilities\nTest applications\nComplete post-exploit tasks\nAnalyze and report penetration test results\nThe CompTIA PenTest+ exam covers the following domains and topics:\nPlanning and Scoping: Explain the importance of planning for an engagement\nInformation Gathering and Vulnerability Identification: Conduct information gathering using appropriate techniques and perform and analyze a vulnerability scan\nAttacks and Exploits: Compare and contrast social engineering attacks\nPenetration Testing Tools: Use NMAP to conduct information gathering exercises\nReporting and Communication: Recommend mitigation strategies for discovered vulnerabilities\n\n\nWho Is CompTIA?\nCompTIA (the Computing Technology Industry Association) is the leading provider of vendor-neutral IT certifications in the world. With more than 2 million IT certifications issued worldwide, CompTIA is dedicated to helping IT professionals lead the charge in our digitally connected world.\nFor more than 20 years, CompTIA has developed training and certification exams for computing support, networking, security, open-source (Linux) development, cloud and mobility. Our regular review and updates of exams ensure that CompTIA certifications continue to address the needs of today’s technology challenges.\n\n\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched. Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack.\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results.\nWhat is Ethical Hacking and what is it used for?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\n\n\nNo prior knowledge is needed!\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now “CompTIA Pentest+ PT0-002 (Ethical Hacking& Pentest) Prep Lab” course.\nCompTIA Pentest+ Certification Prep with Penetration Testing (Pentesting) & Ethical Hacking for certified ethical hacker\n\n\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\nSee you in the course!",

It is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.\nThe key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that meta-data is also treated as data and is used to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.\nFrappe Framework uses Python for the backend. It comes with a simple yet powerful ORM as an abstraction over CRUD operations. The default database is MariaDB. Postgres support is in beta. The basic programing knowledge in Python and JavaScript is required for doing in this course.\nSyllabus cover both server side scripting using python and client side scripting java script.\nThe course start with a quick introduction to frappe frame work, installation of frappe in ubuntu system, frappe desk, doctypes in frappe, different client side scripting server side scripting.\nBasic level knowledge in MySQL is helpful for understanding the data base concepts.",

      "description": "Taking the first steps as you start building a cloud career can seem overwhelming. Adjusting to a cloud-native approach can take time, especially if you are coming from a non-technical background. Gaining familiarity with core technical concepts of cloud computing and the AWS Cloud will give you confidence as you begin your cloud journey. In this training, I discuss critical fundamental concepts which are required for building a solid foundation for your cloud journey.\n\n\nThis course will provide an introduction to fundamentals, which is the first step toward the knowledge needed for your cloud journey. This course is perfect for anyone interested in learning about cloud computing on AWS and the fundamental concepts of cloud.\n\n\nThis is a beginner level introductory course, and it does not assume any prior experience or knowledge of the cloud concepts.\n\n\nIf you’re a beginner looking for a clear starting point to help you build a career or would like to begin learning how to dive deep in the AWS Cloud, this course will help you learn the foundations you need.\n\n\nHere are details of some of the topics covered in this course.\n\n\nDataCenter:\nA data center is a physical location that stores computing machines and their related hardware equipment. It contains the computing infrastructure that IT systems require, such as servers, data storage drives, and network equipment. It is the physical facility that stores any company’s digital data.\n\n\nServer\nA server is a computer or device that manages network resources and provides services to other computers, known as clients. Servers can be physical machines, virtual machines (VMs), or software. They are essential for businesses and organizations that need to store and manage large amounts of data.\n\n\nStorage\nStorage is a process through which digital data is saved within a data storage device by means of computing technology. Storage is a mechanism that enables a computer to retain data, either temporarily or permanently.\n\n\nNetworking Devices\nA network device is a piece of hardware or software that enables communication between a computer and a network, such as the internet. Network devices are essential for establishing and managing networks, and they perform a variety of functions.\n\n\nVirtualization\nVirtualization is a technology that creates a virtual or simulated computing environment from a physical machine. It uses software to mimic the functions of physical hardware, allowing users to create multiple virtual machines (VMs) from a single physical computer or server.\n\n\nDisaster Recovery\nDisaster recovery (DR) is a method for restoring an organization's IT infrastructure and functionality after a disaster, such as a cyber attack, natural disaster, or business disruption.\n\n\nEncryption\nEncryption is a method of protecting data by scrambling it with a mathematical formula so that only authorized people can access it.\n\n\nDNS\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.\n\n\nDHCP\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway.\n\n\nAuthentication\nAuthentication is a process that verifies the identity of a user or device before allowing access to a service or device. It's a key part of cybersecurity, as it helps to prevent unauthorized access to systems.\n\n\nAny many more...",
