Some people think of it as physical therapy for the eyes and brain.\nHere are five ways that vision training enhances your performance in everyday tasks on the job, at play, and in your leisure time.\nBy Improving Your Eyesight and you will Improve your attention, focus, and concentration\nBy improving the connection between your eye tracking and your brain, vision training can help you focus more on what you’re doing. This enhanced ability to focus can help you concentrate more and learn better.\nBy Improving Your Eyesight you will Improve your balance\nAging and vision impairments can impact your balance. Vision training helps improve your body awareness and vision, which can steady your balance and help you prevent falls.\nBy Improving Your eyesight  you will Improve Your Sports performance\nVision, balance, depth perception, peripheral awareness, and hand-eye coordination are all essential to excelling in sports. Vision training helps you optimize your performance by boosting all of the above skills. Vision training is a growing trend in the field of sports performance, helping athletes get an edge over their competitors.\nBy Improving Your eyesight  you will Improve Your  Hand-eye coordination\nHand-eye coordination is important not only in sports but in all areas of your life, including driving, navigating around town, and reading and writing. Hand-eye coordination allows you to handle almost all day-to-day tasks. This skill must be developed as much as possible in order for you to succeed in life, and vision training helps you accomplish that.\nBy Improving Your eyesight  you will Improve Your Reading\nReading and reading comprehension requires the integration of a number of vision and brain skills. If a child or adult has a problem in either area, numerous issues may contribute to this deficiency.\nOne of them is convergence insufficiency, which is the inability of your eyes to work together when looking at nearby objects. This condition makes objects appear blurry and can also result in headaches and difficulty reading. Studies show that office-based vision therapy combined with at-home reinforcement can be an effective treatment for convergence insufficiency.",

      "description": "While no one can tell you with precision what the actual health effects are of exposure to EMF radiation, there are literally thousands of  peer-reviewed scientific studies linking EMF exposure to numerous harmful health effects including infertility, cancer, permanent genetic  damage, sleep disruption and even asthma and obesity in children.\nAs this body of evidence grows, wireless companies continue rolling  out new EMF emitting technologies, leading to an exponential growth in  your exposure to these harmful waves, without any consideration of the  effect on your health.\nBefore the invention of the lightbulb, there was no  human-made EMF on the planet. Then came the lightbulb. Then came the  electrical grid to power the light bulb. Then came radio, home  appliances, television, cordless phones, cell  phones, WiFi. Then bluetooth and other wireless devices. Now it’s  smart meters and 5G. We are literally blanketing the planet with a type  of radiation that didn’t even exist 150 years ago. We’ve created a sea  of electrosmog that humans have not evolved to cope with on a biological and physiological level.\nEvidence of some harmful effects (Quick facts):\n* There is now 10 billion times more radiation in our environment than there was in the 1960s.\n* EMFs radiation adversely affects the blood cells of ALL individuals, whether they feel the effects or not.\n* EMFs radiation damages cell membranes, causing them to leak calcium and create many health issues, such as altered brain function, autism, infertility, EHS, hypocalcaemia, DNA damage, thyroid problems, osteoporosis, endocrine imbalances, early dementia, asthma, neurological disorders and multiple chemical sensitivities.\n* Autism in children is doubling every five years, paralleling the rise of EMR, and there is now a 1-in-50 chance of a child developing or being born with autism in North America.\n* Electromagnetic radiation breaks down the all-important blood–brain barrier, causing the death of neurons, which can result in early dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.\n* Just 5 minutes of Wi-Fi exposure can cause cell mutation, oxidation and rouleaux—all of which are associated with illness and disease.\n* The average cumulative whole-body exposure from a Smart meter at 3 feet is about 100 times more than that from a cell phone.\n\n\nElectromagnetic Fields (EMFs) are everywhere. For example, the visible light is an electromagnetic wave. Then, where is the problem?\nThe problem is that EMFs are most of them invisible and have different wavelenght and some more have energy than others (Low  frequencies have long wavelengths and low photon energy. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and higher photon energy). We are not aware that the devices and appliances that we use everyday at home may be a source of EMFs at a higher level than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggest.\nWhile the earth´s magnetic field has around 7.83Hz, the 4G signal coming off your iphone can oscillate up to 2.7 billion times per second (2.7GHz) and it implies much more impact on our bodies.\nIt is the distance, strength and length of exposure that determines your health risk. With the proper setup of your environment, you will be able to live around without health issues.\nElectrical appliances produce toxic electromagnetic fields (EMFs). These  fields can layer, one upon the other, creating a harmful level of  radiation. That’s why the kitchen is a hotspot for harmful EMFs…but  other rooms are affected, too. The mG exposure at three feet is up to  three mG for a blender, up to four mG for a washing machine, up to six  mG for a hair dryer or a television, and up to 40 mG for a vacuum  cleaner.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that you limit your exposure to 0.5 mG to 2.5 mG. At home under 1mG  is considered safe (because we may expend a lot of time, isn´t it? )\nWhen you are three feet away from a microwave, you are exposed to up to 25 mG.  Didn´t you know? I will give you real measurements in contrast with the recommended limits that EPA suggest.\nEvery EMF frequency is also associated with a  wavelength and an inherent level of quantum energy. The quantum energy  is the energy of the individual light particles known as photons. Low  frequencies have long wavelengths and low photon energy. Higher  frequencies have shorter wavelengths and higher photon energy.\nIn this course I would like to give you a practical educated perception of the EMFs from devices and appliances and you will know how to mitigate or eliminate it. I use an EMF detector for measure the EMFs at home. So you will see as examples the emission from a lot of different devices. No speculation, no jokes... You will see real data to take in consideration a responsibly use of appliances.\nWe will see the real data measured from de EMF meter and we will compare with the \"official\" safe limits.\nWe will measure EMFs from keyboards, screen TV, wifi networks, smartphones, bulb lights, everyday appliances and smart meters.\nEven you will get a document attached to kindly offer to your neighbordhood (in reference to wifi mainly). This is:\n\"Awareness Campaign to Reduce Emfs in Your Neighborhood\".\nIt may help you to reduce the EMFs from your neighborhood that penetrates into your house (wifi waves reach until 330 feets).\nFour specific types of EMFs have been linked with adverse health effects:\n\n\n- Radio frequency (RF).\n- Magnetic Fileds (MF).\n- Electric Fields (EF).\n- Dirty electricity (DE).\n\n\nThese four types of EMFs are emitted by specific sources and can be reduced or avoided using different strategies.\nWe are exposed to a lot of EMF radiation from many human made sources. At levels approximately 10 billion times higher than back in the 1960s.\nYou don´t need to complete the course of Electromagnetic Radiation Specialist and spend thousands of dollars in the course to understand and have a clear perception of strenght of EMFs, where they come from, the standard \"official\" safe limits and how to decrease dramatically the impact in your body.\nMy career is industrial enginering in UPC (Politechnic University of Catalonia) in Barcelone . I am engineer with electronic specialization inside the industrial field.\nI also coursed a postgraduate in Electromagnetic Fields in UPC  (Politechnic University of Catalonia). So I will assess you with scientist practical knowledge.",

I've made it easy for you to make the most informed decisions for your health. All in one place I've compiled and sifted through years of research and studies to bring you the most expansive collection yet easily summarized wealth of information on female reproductive cancers prevention and survival. In this course, you will find the work of years of my own personal research and experience from multiple peer-reviewed sources including medical journals. You will learn about the types of female reproductive cancers, risk factors, the most important recommendations for gynecologic cancer survival, and critical lifestyle changes associated with prevention and diagnosis.\nDo not leave the treatment option up to your doctor. You may be overwhelmed, but ultimately it's you who decide. Taking charge of the decision process empowers you emotionally and physically.\nWelcome to my course, Natural Protocols for Gynecologic Cancers!\nHello, my name is Diana Wright ND, BSN, MBA, AADP-BC, NEA-BC and I want to thank you for considering this course. I have been in the healthcare field for 40 years, first as a Registered Nurse and more recently a board-certified naturopathic doctor.\nI have an internationally-acclaimed, award-winning documentary called The Unbelievable Plight of Mrs. Wright that you can watch to hear my full story but here is a brief summary.\nIn 2012, I was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer, along with cancer throughout my whole abdomen, heart vessels, and brain tumors. I was given the death sentence of eight months to live and options consisting of only three “treatments”: surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Not wanting to give up on my family and my employees, I followed the doctors’ treatment plan. Meanwhile, I read anything about cancer treatments I could get my hands on and changed my lifestyle. An RN friend stumbled across alternative treatments and Dr. Ralf Kleef, an oncologist and naturopath based in Austria at the time.\nAfter a few rounds of chemotherapy and little improvement, I left America and flew to Austria with my husband to get treated with regional hyperthermia, IV Vitamin C, and other natural methods. I came back cancer-free and have been an advocate of natural treatments for cancer ever since. Through obtaining my doctor of naturopathy, I discovered the world of natural, homeopathic treatments for almost every disease and ailment. Naturopathic care is effective, but sometimes you have to get allopathic intervention to buy time for your length of life so you have enough lifespan for naturopathic care to work.",

      "description": "Medical coding happens every time you see a healthcare provider. The healthcare provider reviews your compliant and medical history, makes an expert assessment of what is wrong and how to treat you, and document your visit. That documentation is not only the patient's ongoing record, it's how the healthcare gets paid. Medical coders translate documentation into standardized codes that tell payers about patient's diagnoses, medical necessity for treatment, services, or supplies the patient received etc. Medical coders must be accurate and pay careful attention to even the smallest points of a medical record or insurance claim. Coding each medical procedure without making mistakes is essential, and you will also need to find previous errors in patient records. if you are good at detail- oriented tasks and like hurting down mistakes, you could be a great medical coding and reimbursement specialist.\nIt is even more vital now as the data gathered through medical coding is used to improve healthcare overall. The results are submitted to payers for reimbursement, but the data derived from the codes also are used to determine utilization, manage risk, identify resource use, build actuarial tables, and support public health and actions. The main task of a medical coder is to review clinical statements and assign standard codes using CPT, ICD-10-CM, and HCPCS Level II classification systems. To help promote a smooth coding and billing process, the coder checks the patient's medical records. For most thriving medical practices, one of the secrets to their financial success and overall operations in recent times is accurate medical billing. It is a process that involves the submission of claims to insurance companies for healthcare providers to be rightfull compensated for their services. Even though it was in operation in the past using the paper system a new electronic model has being created to automate the processes with ease accuracy and efficiency.",

It is a standardized exam that is used to evaluate the knowledge and skills of physical therapists who are seeking licensure in the United States. The exam is administered by the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy (FSBPT), which is the organization responsible for overseeing the licensure of physical therapists in the United States. The NPTE is a computer-based exam that consists of 250 multiple-choice questions, and candidates are given 5 hours to complete the exam. The exam covers a wide range of topics related to physical therapy, including patient evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention, and outcomes assessment. Candidates must achieve a passing score that is determined by their state licensing board in order to become licensed as a physical therapist in the United States.\nThe National Physical Therapy Examination is one part of the evaluation process used by licensing authorities. The NPTE is administered by the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy. APTA has no role in exam development, administration, or scoring.\nTaking the national physical therapy exam (NPTE) is an important step toward receiving your physical therapist (PT) or physical therapist assistant (PTA) license.\nQuestions (items) for the NPTE are written by physical therapists and physical therapist assistants representing a broad range of practice settings in all parts of the country.\nBeginning item writers are trained by experienced staff and colleagues to produce high-quality, psychometrically sound multiple-choice test questions that cover the major areas of physical therapy practice reflected in the test content outlines.\nThe items are reviewed by an independent panel of content experts for suitability for inclusion in the examination item bank. Before being used as a scored item on the NPTE, newly written items are pretested as unscored items to gather statistical information. The pretested items that demonstrate good statistical characteristics then become eligible to appear on the scored portion of the NPTE in future years.\n\n\nAfter this course you will be able to examine muscles strength on you patients to evaluate the results of the testing and to define the right treatment for the patients as well.

As a Level 1 Reiki practitioner, you will learn how to naturally heal and balance yourself, your friends, and your family. This modality is simple to learn, yet powerful enough to heal and affect changes in yourself and others. Join us for this certification and begin your journey in the great art of Reiki.\nUsui Reiki is a form of spiritual healing that originated in Japan. It was developed by Mikao Usui in the early 20th century. Reiki practitioners use their hands to transmit healing energy to promote physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. The word \"Reiki\" translates to \"universal life force energy,\" and the practice involves channeling this energy through the practitioner's hands to the recipient. Usui Reiki is based on the belief that an unseen life force energy flows through all living beings, and by balancing and harmonizing this energy, healing can occur.\nReiki I: This is the first and basic level of Usui Reiki certification. In this level, the student learns the history and origin of Reiki, the five principles of Reiki, the 12 hand positions of Reiki, how to perform self-treatments and treatments for others, and how to sense and balance the energy in the body. The student also receives the first Reiki attunement, which is a process of opening and activating the energy channels in the body and connecting them to the source of Reiki. Reiki I certification enables the student to practice Reiki for personal use and for helping friends and family.",

Imagine long, flowing strokes that feel like waves moving across the body, melting away stress while reconnecting the mind, body, and spirit. This is the essence of Lomi Lomi—healing through rhythm, touch, and the aloha spirit.\nIn this course, you’ll do more than just learn about Lomi Lomi—you’ll practice it step by step. From creating a sacred healing space to performing signature full-body sequences, you’ll experience firsthand how intention and technique combine to create powerful results. Picture yourself easing someone’s shoulder tension with ocean-like movements, or helping a client release years of stress with a single flowing sequence—this is the transformation you’ll bring.\nYou’ll also explore the roots of Lomi Lomi in Hawaiian culture, uncovering how the practice was traditionally used for emotional release, spiritual balance, and deep healing. Alongside practical massage training, you’ll learn how to infuse your sessions with breathwork, energy awareness, and the aloha spirit so each massage feels like a sacred ritual, not just a treatment.\nBy the end, you’ll have the confidence, skill, and cultural insight to perform authentic Lomi Lomi massage—whether you’re offering it professionally in a spa, using it to deepen your wellness practice, or simply sharing it with loved ones at home.\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is designed for anyone who wants to touch lives with healing hands:\nMassage Therapists & Bodyworkers – Add a unique, flowing style to your toolkit that clients will remember and request again and again. For example, swap your standard back routine with a full-body Lomi Lomi wave sequence that leaves clients floating out the door.\nWellness Professionals – Yoga teachers, energy healers, spa practitioners—this course lets you create deeper relaxation experiences. Imagine guiding a client through breathwork, then offering a heart-centered Lomi Lomi massage to seal the session.\nHolistic Health Enthusiasts – Interested in alternative healing? Lomi Lomi gives you practical skills to promote relaxation, circulation, and emotional release—perfect for self-care or sharing with loved ones.\nBeginners Curious About Massage – No experience? No problem. We’ll walk you through every movement, stroke, and sequence. You’ll start practising simple arm and shoulder techniques, then gradually build into full flowing routines.\nCultural Explorers – If you’re fascinated by indigenous healing traditions, this course is your window into authentic Hawaiian wisdom and rituals that are rarely taught outside the islands.\nCareer Path\nCompleting this course opens new doors in wellness, massage, and holistic healing. You could:\nOffer Lomi Lomi sessions as a standalone service in spas, wellness centres, or private practice.\nEnrich your current massage or healing work with Lomi Lomi’s unique techniques, helping you stand out in a competitive market.\nUse it to deepen client trust and loyalty, offering not just a massage, but a transformative healing experience.",

It's important when practicing to do so in a way that is both slightly challenging and safe, so if you have issues with balance, only use the standing practice when you have suitable supervision and/or precautions in place.\nThis content is result of many years working with groups of people who are affected by Parkinson's diagnosis and are designed to work at a level that is adaptable and accessible to individual needs.\nThis course has been made possible due to a collaboration between the following organisations:\nQigong Academy - who provided the course material\nCalm Healthy Happy - who have financially supported the project\nDigital Human - for their technical expertise in both design and editing\nSuffolk Yoga - who provided the studio space for the recording\nN.B. This course was developed as a free course and the content is available free of charge through Calm Healthy Happy.

      "description": "Massage is the manipulation of the soft tissues of the body. Massage techniques are usually applied with hands, fingers, elbows, knees, arms, feet or a tool. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person professionally trained to massage was traditionally known as a masseur (male) or masseuse (female), but these headgear are outdated and carry some negative connotations. In the world, the title of massage therapist has been accepted as a business norm for people who are professionally trained to do massage.\nIn professional settings, clients are treated while lying on the massage table, sitting on the massage chair, or lying on a cushion on the floor. In amateur environments, a general purpose surface such as a bed or floor is more common. Water massage and superstructure is done with buyers dipped or floating in a warm water therapy pool.\nIn this course, you will learn the basics and techniques of massage.\nIn this course, you will learn lessons, techniques and comprehensive knowledge of practical and applied massage. The certificate you will receive at the end of this course gives you professional competence and accreditation.\nIn the videos in the course, you will learn about the benefits of massage and see what the techniques demonstrated by your teacher can do. You will enjoy the information we have gathered and developed from thousands of studies and researches about massage and its techniques for centuries while your massage teacher shows you the lessons.\nThe techniques you learn are not just a massage knowledge or lectures for a course, they are psychologically and physiologically necessary information for life. Practicing what you have learned is another valuable issue that you will encounter every day.\nYou can finish this course wherever and whenever you want.\nRemember that you will receive your certificate at the end of the course!\nThis course has been prepared for you with the experience of expert trainers, in an understandable language and with care.\nWhile reviewing the course details, it will be very helpful to take notes of what you see on the screen and what your teacher tells you. The information you will receive in these lessons is explained with examples, especially in a way that you can apply in daily life.\nThis course is suitable for anyone who is an expert, trained, teacher or unfamiliar with the subject.",

Are there any risks to doing eye workouts?\nNo, eye Workouts are natural and non-invasive, just follow the course, but overdoing more than 1 minute per eye training can lead to light discomfort. Pay attention to your body and take breaks when necessary.\n6. What’s the difference between eye strain and spasms?\nEye strain is general fatigue from screen time overuse, while spasms are involuntary muscle contractions, often caused by regular stress or eye strain.\n7.
