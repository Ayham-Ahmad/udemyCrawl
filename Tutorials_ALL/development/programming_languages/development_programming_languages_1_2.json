      "description": "The course will lay out the founding ideas of some of the more advanced C# topics for you in a way that makes them easier to understand.\nThe course is aimed at students that have some coding experience in general and with C# in particular, as well as some Object Oriented Programming experience. Not all topics require OOP knowledge, but it will be easier for you to understand those that do.\nThe topics that we are covering are:\nLINQ - LINQ is kind of a language within the C# language, it has its own syntax, but its very easy and very enjoyable to use. LINQ is used to work on collections like arrays and lists, either to order them, or to extract information from them in many many many different ways. You will learn how apply LINQ filters on base type collections like integers and strings aswell as on collections of custom types that you have created.\nLambda Expressions with LINQ methods - you will finally learn what a Lambda Expression is and how to apply it, in particular we will use it to perform LINQ operations with even less code, and later we will use it with Delegates and Events\nExtension Methods - this is one of the coolest features of C#, they allow you to extend built in types and classes that you have no access to. For example the int[] has no built in method for sorting or reversing, we will learn how to do this!\nGeneric Methods and Classes - this is where things start to get tricky and a little bit complicated, but you should not be scared as I have prepared a couple of well explained examples that will answer all of the questionmarks in your head about Generics. Spoiler alert: we will create our very own List class! :)\nDelegates - the simplest way in which a delegate can be described is, methods as variables, and that is just incredible. How? Well, you will understand soon enough!\nEvents - events are the next piece of the puzzle after Delegates, Events help us keep our code decoupled by creating non-coupled connections between classes\nAsynchronous Programming - asynchronous programming is a complex and frustrating topic, here we will learn how to make code that takes a lot of time to execute run on the background, while our main code continues executing\nThere are tons and tons of tutorials on Youtube and other websites, so why would you have to pay for this course?\nThe answer is very simple, in this course you will get every single lecture systemized in such way, that it ensures smooth transition between the previous and the following topic. Guaranteeing great learning experience.\nThere are no stones left unturned, everything is explained in great detail (but not too much, that would be boring :) )\nThe video lectures in the course are produced with the highest possible audio and video quality. No static noises to disturb you while you watch the videos, no blurry images, everything is crystal clear with crisp audio!",

      "description": "Have you tried to learn Node before? You start a new course, and the instructor has you installing a bunch of libraries before you even know what Node is or how it works. You eventually get stuck and reach out to the instructor, but you get no reply. You then close the course and never open it again.\nSound familiar?\nI created this course to be what I wanted when I was learning Node.\nThe Complete Node.js Developer Course covers the fundamentals of Node before diving deep into great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.\nThe entire course is based around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.\nThe best way to learn Node is by building Node apps.\nFrom the very start you’ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I’ve designed to reinforce what you’ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your own project once you’re done.\nYou’ll be building four projects:\n1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet\n2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs\n3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication\n4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion\nBy the end, you’ll be able to take what you’ve learned and launch your own Node application.\nWhen learning, learn the latest.\nI work to keep this course full of the most up-to-date Node material out there. This course is compatible with the latest Node.js version.\nYou’re getting access to hot-off-the-press features.\nEverything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.\nYou can stop worrying if you're learning the right skills to build an app or land a new job. I've curated all the tech that's essential to building real-world apps. I've mapped out everything in a comprehensive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a few weeks.\nThere’s no better time to learn Node.\nAccording to the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey, Node is in the top ten for back-end popularity and back-end salary, with an average salary of $85k. This means more jobs and more opportunities for you.\nYou might get stuck. But I’m here to help.\nThere’s nothing worse than getting five hours into a course, getting stuck, and not getting the help you need to continue.\nI’m in the Q&A everyday to help you get unstuck. I reply to every question to get you back on track.\nDon’t take my word for it. Check the reviews and see what other students are saying.\n“Any questions people seem to have are answered swiftly, clearly, and often with examples posted on GitHub.

      "description": "If you want to learn to program in Java in far less time than you previously thought possible then read on.\nThe world today is a hectic place.  Most of us have very little spare time. Once we have worked (or studied), slept, spent some time with friends and family there is little time left to think about a career.\nIn order to become a software developer you need programming skills.  But how can you get those skills in the minimum amount of time and still have a life along the way?\nThis course was designed to teach you the essential Java programming skills you need to get your first programming job, or perhaps a promotion to a more senior position.  And to do it in the shortest possible amount of time.\n\nHere is a review written by one of the students in the course.\n\n\"Tim is such a great instructor! He just have that magic in him that makes me understand what he is teaching!\" - Henrik Ferrari\nDo I need to learn 100% of the Java language?\nNo!  To understand how this course can help you, there is a need to understand how programming languages are constructed.  The creators of these languages try and add every single feature they think someone might need, ever.\n\nA large part of the language rarely gets used, and sometimes not at all.  It's the same with software.  If you have used a spreadsheet in the past, I'd lay odds that you use it for basic spreadsheet work, and you rarely, if ever go into some of the advanced functionality.  The basic functions of the spreadsheet are what most people use.\nImagine if you had to learn every feature of the spreadsheet program?  How long would it take, and would most of that information be useful to you?  Especially if you were learning it to get a job and that job only required basic spreadsheet skills.\nSwitching back to programming, if your goal is to get your first programming job, then why not only learn what you need to achieve that goal.  And worry about the other stuff when and if you need it.\nThat's what this course is all about - giving you the skills you need quickly without any fluff or useless information.\nThe course is aimed at complete beginners.\n\nWe assume you have never programmed before in this course and start from scratch and show you step by step how to download and install the tools, through to writing your first programs, and from there we move to more and more of parts of the Java language that you need to understand.\nIf you are already a programmer, you will still find value in this course - It's very common for programmers to want to learn a second or third programming language, and doing so makes you more valuable and opens up career opportunities.\nAs this is a crash course you can get skilled in Java, fast.\nHere is what a student said about another of the instructors courses.\n\n\"This course is AMAZING!!!!   The teaching is thorough with lots of helpful exercises in various formats! The TA responded very quickly to my question! Thank you!\" - Joy Hope\n\nWhat version of Java will I learn?\nAll videos in the course have been recorded using the very latest version.  Java 11.  It's recommended that you follow along with that version, but if you have an older version most of the course should work just fine.\nJava 11 is the version you will want to learn because Oracle have designated it as the LTS version of Java - meaning they will support it for many years to come.  The reason they do this is so large companies can have a particular version of Java employed on the clients sites for years without worrying about new versions of Java crashing previously working programs.\nJava 11 will get updated regularly over this time, but it will remain version 11.   Oracle also have new Java versions coming out six monthly, but as soon as a new version is released, the previous version is no longer supported.\nAs such you should learn Java 11 which gives you the most useful skills for your future employer.\nI heard that you have to pay to use Java 11.\nIt's true that Oracle charging businesses to use Java 11, but students and professional developers alike never need to pay for Java.  It's 100% free.  And even if that ever became a problem in the future, there is the free OpenJDK version of Java that has no restrictions.\nThe bottom line is that you do not need to pay anything to legally use Java 11.\nWhat will you learn in the course?\nYou'll learn the essential Java skills needed to become employable as a Java developer.\nCreating a Java basic program\nAll about the Java compiler\nData Types, Variables, Conditional Processing, Loops, Classes, Operators, Expressions - all the good stuff.\nCheck out the curriculum on this page for a list of what is covered in the course.\nIn the course you will work with a lot of Java example code.  You will start with Java code that was badly written.  You'll see why it's bad, and then as you progress through the course, you will improve it and make the code bug free.\n\nThis approach, along with smaller snippers of code will help you become a programmer as well as think as a programmer.  And as a result you will learn how to get the most out of Java.\nWhat about course updates?\nThe course will get regular updates - We already have a document in the course that outlines what content is still to be added - We envisage it will be around sixteen hours once done.\n\nIt's shorter than that now, but we are adding videos almost every day at the moment.\nThe instructors have built up a good history of updating their courses in the past on Udemy and that will continue in this course.\nWhat about the instructors?\nYour instructors Tim and Goran have a combined 40 years of professional software development experience between them.  They have worked for prestigious  companies such as IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab. Their professional experience means you are learning from true experts with real commercial programming experience.\n\nTim has 18 years experience as a Java developer, and Goran whilst a lot younger than Tim is Oracle Java certified.   You will be working with professional software developers who will be teaching you the right way to code based on years of experience.\n\nWhat's more, there other courses on Udemy have  hundreds of thousands of enrolments and literally tens of thousands of reviews.  They have built up an enviable record of creating best selling and highly rated courses that help people just like you learn to program and move into a programming career.\n\nHere is another comment from a student in one of Tims Udemy courses.\n\"I messaged once a few months ago when finishing you Java course on how it helped me also as a refresher on my c# skills.  Long story short, the owner of the Software Development company I work for now, after seeing my skills by accident, he asked me if I was looking for a job, I said not really but I would be interested in seeing what all was about, he asked for my resume,  set up an interview and he made me a quick test to see how far I was skill-wise and I finished the test with flying colors. He offered me a long term full time job right on the spot with a starting salary superior to what I was doing ($70,000 USD/yr to start and $75,000 USD/yr after six months if everything goes fine), really nice hours and benefits. So now I am coding with a real purpose and what I was doing for free in my free time, now is earning me a living, I've been working there for a month now and it has been great for them and for me. \" - Miguel Lara\nWhat about if you have questions?\nAs if this course wasn’t complete enough, Tim and Goran offer full support, answering any questions you have 7 days a week (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, or not at all).\nThis means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With their hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks.\nStudent Quote: \"In the course there are several challenges, and when in need of a hint; questions asked are replied swift and elaborate. Feels like one-on-one support. It exceeds my expectations!” - Arjo Tibben\n\nThere’s no risk either!\nThis course comes with a full 30 day money-back guarantee. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let the instructors know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.\nYou either end up with Java skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it…\nYou literally can’t lose.\nReady to get started, developer?\nEnrol now using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to a career as a Java Programmer.  You can also check out some of the course using the preview feature on this page, so you’re 100% certain this course is for you.\nSee you on the inside (hurry, the Java class is waiting!)",

      "description": "What is this course about?\nIn a fast-growing world, Python programming is becoming a must-have skill. Whether you want to automate email sending, rename 10 thousand files at once, schedule SMS, auto-start the webcam, create APIs, auto-login to websites, scrape values, and many, other cool programs, this course has it all. In the process of learning to do all those cool programs, you will master Python and will create programs with ease.\nWhat will students learn to automate?\nOne of Python's strongest points is to make our jobs easier and more fun by automating tasks in any area. You will learn to send emails with attachments to hundreds of CSV contacts, automate SMS messages, filter photos from your albums, detect faces in photos and videos, spin up and deploy quick web apps, extract data from websites and PDF files, convert between different file formats, clean text using natural language processing, and many many more. At the end of the course, you will be equipped with a strong set of skills and a good GitHub portfolio.\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is literally for anyone, from data scientists to students to doctors to musicians to new prospective programmers. With Python, you can do things from web scraping to generating music. There is always something that can be done with Python.\nDo I need prior Python knowledge?\nYes. You need to know Python basics that are variables, data types, functions, conditionals, and loops. This course does not cover those because you can find such content easily on YouTube.\nCan we use the apps to build our own GitHub portfolio?\nYes. You can publish the apps in your own GitHub account. However, it is recommended that you first change something from the code or even better, improve the code to make the apps really unique and yours. That will help your learning.\nDo I have to follow the course in the given order?\nNo, you can pick the topics you like and only watch the videos and do the practice activities only for those topics.\nWhat if I get stuck?\nYou will get stuck at some point. Every programmer does. When that happens, we've got your back. You can drop a question in the Q&A, and the instructor or the teaching assistant will answer your questions within the same day. You can also use the chat in the course Discord server to ask questions and chat with fellow students about Python.\nWhat if I don’t like the course?\nThat will likely not happen. But, if it does, you are covered by the Udemy 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can quickly return the course. No questions asked.\nDoes this course cover Python 2 or Python 3?\nPython 3.\nWhat IDE/editor is used in the course?\nWe use the Repl IDE which is becoming a gold standard nowadays due to the share and collaborate features the IDE offers which are especially useful when you are still learning However, you are free to use your favorite IDE.\nDo I need Windows, Mac, or Linux to take the course?\nThe operating system does not matter. You can even use a mobile device since the IDE we are using works in the browser.\nDoes the course expire?\nNo. Once you buy the course, it is yours. You will get all future updates for free as well.",

Loops are major part of programming and without understanding them clearly, it’s almost impossible to be a good programmer. It provides an introduction to different types of loops, how they work and how can we implement them in the language. It technically explains the difference between the different types of loops and in which situation we use a particular type. Nested loops are also explained with examples. Use of break and continue statements can also help in implementing loops according to your requirement.\nThe course is basically designed for C++ Intermediate students who are familiar with some basic concepts like C++ program structure, constants and variables, data types, main function, input and output, operators and decision making statements in the language.\nBy the end of course, I hope you have learnt something really valuable from this course and have fully understood the concepts, how the control is flowing in the programs and in which situation we use a particular loop. By the completion of this course, will be able to implement all types of loops including while loop, do while loop, for loop and can also nest them without any problem.",

There are so many changes in Interfaces, Pattern Matching, Handling Null Reference exceptions, and added some new Operators.\nAll these C# 8 features are must learn and use in your projects. C# 8 Features will help you to write complex logic with minimum code.\nC# Latest Features (C# 8.0)\nInterface:\nInterfaces in C# 8.0 allows us to write member body, static fields, static constructor, constants, access modifiers (public, private, internal, etc) and so many other features.\nNullable Reference Type:\nNullable reference type allows us to avoid Null Reference Exception at the compile time. C# developers can enable/disable the nullable features on project/file levels. If the Nullable reference type is enabled then the compiler will give a warning whenever there are possibilities of a null error.\nSwitch Pattern Matching:\nSwitch pattern matching allows the C# developers to write the switch statement without using the case, or default keywords. This will allow us to focus only on logic rather than unnecessary keywords.\nProperty Pattern Matching\nTuple Pattern Matching:\nTuple pattern matching in C# allows us to write complex logic with very less code. This is easy to write, read and clean code.\nNull-Coalescing Operator:\nNull-Coalescing Operator is a new operator added in C# 8. This Null-Coalescing Operator allows the C# developers to assign the right side expression only if the left-hand side value is null. (Very Useful)\nIndices and Range:\nThere is a new way to get the sequence value from the end instead of array.length-1. And the Range is a new operator. The Range operator is used to get the subsequence from a sequence with start and end boundaries.\nStatic Local Functions",

You will not only understand Python from the ground up, but you’ll also experience how simple, powerful, and practical coding can be.\nLet’s face it—Python is not just “another programming language.” It’s the foundation of today’s most in-demand careers: data science, AI, web development, automation, analytics, and beyond. The problem? Most people try to jump straight into Python with advanced topics, messy editors, and confusing examples. That leads to frustration, confusion, and quitting too soon.\nThat’s where this course steps in.\nWe guide you through Part 1 of your Python journey with crystal-clear explanations, relatable real-world examples, and zero pressure. You'll start with the basics—what Python is, how it runs, and how to install it the right way. Then you’ll move to the building blocks: data types, variables, user inputs, conversions, and f-strings. You’ll also discover how to use operators, lists, and store multiple types of data in one go.\nEvery lesson is short, practical, and focused. This is not a passive theory class. You’ll write real Python code from day one, and every concept is demonstrated in a way that actually sticks.\nYou’ll also avoid the top 3 beginner mistakes:\nYou won’t waste time setting up tools you don’t need.\nYou won’t memorize things blindly—everything has context and logic.\nYou won’t feel lost or intimidated. Each step builds naturally on the last.\nBy the end of this course, you won’t just “know Python”—you’ll actually feel like a Python user. You'll be able to:\nSet up your own coding environment.\nCreate and use variables confidently.\nUnderstand and manipulate data types.\nTake user input and convert it effectively.\nWrite dynamic, readable code using f-strings.\nPerform basic math operations and work with multiple values inside a list.\nAnd the best part? It’s completely free. This isn’t a teaser—it’s a full, valuable course meant to give you momentum.\nStill thinking about it?\nHere’s what happens if you don’t take this course: You’ll keep Googling “how to start learning Python,” bounce from one video to another, and waste weeks trying to make sense of it all.\nBut if you say yes now? You’ll have clarity, direction, and a rock-solid foundation to move on to advanced Python topics, web development, automation, or even AI.\nSo take action.

What are you waiting for, catch it? And be an excellent prepared with all thricky hints for your Progress Review at work , school or University. I absolutely rated with 5 Stars.\"  - Valentin G.\n\"Instructor explained the topic of Inheritance succinctly. It's a good match for me as its a short course which I was able to complete the course on time. And also because there were quizzes covered on important topics. Thank you very much for the lovely course once again Sir. Cheers!\" [Venkataramana N.]\n\"Amazing course & explanations...\" - Kiran N.\n\"Very good, simple, targeted explanations without any extraneous discussion and filler. I highly recommend.\" - Kevin H.\n\"Nice and clear explanations!\" - Ali A.\n\"Good job Sir !\" - Smail A.\n\"explanation is amazing, presentation is good to understand.\" - Yan S.\n\n\nThis is one category (of eleven) from my systematic preparation course for the 1Z0-808 Oracle Java SE 8 Programmer 1 (OCA) exam which I have delivered several times; both in person and online.\nThis Inheritance course is not a notes-based course. As the Oracle exam is based on multiple choice questions (MCQ), this course focuses completely on MCQ using the excellent Enthuware tool. In fact, Enthuware supplement their explanations by referring to my online explanations.\nIn this course, I answer 20 random questions from Enthuware's Inheritance category and use diagrams and code where needed. The diagrams in particular are extremely helpful when explaining Inheritance-related concepts. For example, a UML diagram helps greatly with explaining why a reference of type Car cannot refer to an object of type Vehicle. The other type of diagram I use frequently is the in-memory representation of references referring to objects. Separating these two concepts (references and objects) is critical to answering many MCQ-style questions.\nWhile the course is ideal for those preparing for the 1Z0-808 exam, the topics discussed will benefit anyone trying to understand Inheritance at a deeper level. For example, the following topics are all covered:\nmethod overriding\npolymorphism\ncovariant returns\nwhere the parent method throws exceptions\nmethod overloading\nupcasting and downcasting\nshadowing - both methods and data\nthe reference type determines the methods accessible\nthe default modifiers applied to interface data\nthe types of methods allowed in interfaces\nwhy an abstract class can implement an interface without implementing any of the interfaces' methods\nClassCastExceptions",

(When those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.)\nJavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.\nJavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on — and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.\nJavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).",

A: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It's used for dynamic memory allocation, accessing arrays and strings, and more.\nQ: How does inheritance work in C++? A: Inheritance allows a class (derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (base class), promoting code reusability and polymorphism.\nQ: What is a virtual function? A: A virtual function is a member function declared within a base class and redefined by derived classes. It's used to achieve runtime polymorphism.\nQ: Can constructors be private in C++ and why? A: Yes, constructors can be private, usually in singleton patterns to control object creation.\nQ: What are templates in C++? A: Templates allow functions and classes to operate with generic types, enabling code reusability for any data type.\nQ: What is the difference between 'new' and 'malloc'? A: 'new' initializes objects, calls constructors, and is an operator. 'malloc' only allocates memory, doesn't call constructors, and is a function.\nQ: How does exception handling work in C++? A: Exception handling in C++ is done using try, catch, and throw blocks to handle errors gracefully.\nQ: What is the use of the STL in C++? A: The Standard Template Library (STL) provides a set of common classes and interfaces for data structures and algorithms.\nQ: What is the difference between a structure and a class in C++? A: The primary difference is in access control: class members are private by default, while structure members are public.\nQ: What is a smart pointer and why is it used? A: Smart pointers are template classes that ensure automatic memory management to prevent memory leaks.

Mira lo que dicen:\n\n\n\"Este programa es perfecto, las clases bien explicadas y el profesor transmite animo y muy profesional sobre todo, después de tomar el curso estoy bastante seguro para aprender mas y continuar mi camino en el mundo de la programación y los videojuegos.\" (Ares Xavier Aren)\n\n\n\"Hasta ahora me ha parecido un curso excelente, bastante detallado, pero no me sorprende ya que he tomado otro curso anteriormente con el profe Fede y la verdad aprendes porque aprendes, de los mejores profesores que he visto que realmente se interesa en que te quede claro el tema, en cuanto vi que el profe impartía este tema no dude en comprarlo..\" (Erika Raquel Gutiérrez Aguilar)\n\n\n\"Como un novato quería aprender a programar para poder tener un hobby mas, pero como lo explica este tipo, como lo enseña, como sabe lo que dice, me esta convenciendo de convertirlo en una profesión real\" (Carlos David Villamarin Marrugo)\n\n\nPor qué aprender PYTHON\nPython es uno de los lenguajes más buscados del mundo. Por su sencillez, su ductilidad y su flexibilidad, se ha transformado en el lenguaje favorito. Sus instrucciones son lo más cercanas posible al lenguaje humano, lo cual hace que sea más fácil de aprender, y esto hace que sea ideal para personas que se están iniciando en el mundo de la programación.\nAdemás de sencillo es poderoso: con unas pocas líneas de código puedes realizar tareas que en otros lenguajes de programación ocuparían cientos de líneas, y esto hace que aumente considerablemente tu productividad.\nPor otro lado es uno de los lenguajes de programación más versátiles que existen, y puede ser usado en muchos campos diferentes. Es decir, permite programar desde videojuegos hasta sitios web y aplicaciones móviles.\n\n\nRazones para NO tomar este curso\nA mí no se me ocurren. Pero si quieres tomar el curso SIN RIESGOS, recuerda que cuentas con la garantía de Udemy de devolución del 100% del dinero dentro de los 30 días.

Together we will setup a web server, connect it to a PostgreSQL database server, and let it serve an API to perform CRUD (Create, Read/Retrieve, Update, Delete/Destroy) commands on database entries - the whole thing we build from scratch of course.\nAs a developer of web applications, you can quickly find yourself in a situation on a train ride or a flight where you urgently and quickly need a reliable web server. It must be accessible via an API and be able to execute CRUD commands like Create, Read/Retrieve, Update, and Delete/Destroy database entries. Of course, it should be a reliable and handy solution, which is available on different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows), have short compilation and fast execution times.\nWith the Go programming language from Google, a simple tool is available for creating a development server. In this course you will learn to set up such a web server and put it into operation. Rather, I want to show how Google's programming language can be used to achieve respectable results in the shortest possible time in a real world scenario.\nThe fun of \"ease of programming\" is in the foreground here! So enjoy it, it's free!\n\n\nWhy did Google develop a new programming language?\nIn Google's words, \"Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Programming had become too difficult and the choice of languages was partly to blame. One had to choose either\nefficient compilation,\nefficient execution, or\nease of programming;\nall three were not available in the same mainstream language. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent, Java. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing.\nFinally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.\"\nIn my humble opinion, Go is the best programming language you can learn today. I've worked with a few programming languages since I was introduced to programming through BASIC in the mid-80s, and Go is by far the best-designed language I've ever used.\nNow start your computer and let's have some fun coding a real webserver in Go!",

      "description": "This is the first part of the fundamental training program 'Java from Zero to First Job'.  As it's declared in the course name, it's created for people who want to learn programming from scratch. You need to know how to turn on your computer, no other knowledge is required for this course :) The rest will be covered in lessons.\nBefore starting the creation of this course, our team attentively investigated feedbacks for existing courses on the Udemy platform and tried to focus on the feedbacks for the top-rated courses to understand what can be improved in this course and make it, even more, better from the quality standpoint. After analysis, we understand what will help students to learn Java in a more efficient way. In this course:\n- High concentration of useful material in each lesson\nSometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson.\nThis is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes 10 times as much (sometimes even 20) as the final lesson duration after video editing.\nSo you can be sure, that this ~2 hours training course of Java basics is equivalent or even better to training courses of java basics that are 10 hours long.\nAlso, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when the specific topic will be covered.\nGo and try it yourself! We will appreciate your feedback.\n- Relevant knowledge\nAfter our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!\nThe instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha.\nWith this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT consultants in the world.\n- Sequence of lessons\nAfter the years of teaching offline, and based on the feedback of students who are passing online courses we realized how important the sequence of lessons is while teaching Java. The same issue is with the books where information is completely unstructured what makes things even more complex. For example, how students can learn object-oriented programming from the first lesson if they don't know yet the java syntax basics? Or how the student can implement the home task if he/she doesn't aware of java methods specifics, or doesn't know yet how to read program input?\nSo in this course, you can be sure, that you will not get the home task to implement without having enough information to implement it. The program which is in this course is proven by many students who completed it offline and now work as software engineers in outsourcing companies and as freelancers.\n- Open source code\nWe hide nothing from our students! Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.\n- Free mobile App without limits for our students\nKnowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :) Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes.\nIn this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms)\nThe instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview.\nAlso, only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the curriculum, in this part of the fundamental training program you will learn how to install JDK on your computer, you will learn a lot about IDE where you can write you programs, you will learn Java syntax, primitive types of data, loops, control statements, arrays, operations with primitive and reference types of data, String, different number systems, tips and tricks, practical coding exercises and lots more.\nSo don't wait! Enroll in this FREE training course!\nHope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better! Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever!\nSee you at the lessons! :)",

The course uniquely brings real-word  projects, deep dives into every topic, and constant implementation of the topics we cover. The course will prepare you for the basics of JavaFX at a major company as we will be covering the professional lingo that surrounds Java as well. We will also be using on of the most popular IDEs available, Eclipse. The topics we will cover range from  the basics(nodes, buttons, and panes) to slightly the more complicated (shapes, colors, and property binding). We will be explaining all of the syntax and terminology at the beginning of each lesson, but will always be implementing the concepts throughout the lesson. This means that if you know the terms, but not how to implement them you should still be able to enjoy the course. In addition, we will have extensive case studies that will allow us to tackle real world problems using the ideas we have discussed. The course is structured with the lessons being through, so that we can have an in-depth\ndive into each topic, but not too long as to become boring. At the beginning of every lesson there will be a summary of what we will cover, and any major topics you may want to brush up on.

The essential components of a programming language will be explained and, above all, practiced without going into too much detail.\nAs programming language you will use C# (pronounced: \"see sharp\"), because it is very easy to learn and there are good tools for beginners. As a programming tool you will use the {Coder for C#}, which is very good for getting started.\nBesides the most important topics around the programming language C# such as\nVariables and operators\nConditional statements\nRepeating statements (loops)\nObjects (classes)\nyou will write many simple programs in the exercises. Besides graphical programs (driving a car, drawing a smiley, painting) you will program the game Pong as a continuous exercise. The game was developed in 1972 by the Atari company as a game console. As a vintage game it is very popular again today. The player hits the ball with a bat against a wall in single-game mode.\nTo keep track of the game, a cheat sheet is available for download, where you can look up the most important instructions.\nTo attend this course, you need a computer with the Windows operating system and should be able to use Windows.",

Materially\nYou will not pay any amount to work on Python language, it is open source and free and will remain free for life.\n2. Technically\nYou can program it even if your computer is weak or old.\n3. Easy to read and modify\nIt is very easy to learn and the code can be read and modified easily.\n4-Fast execution\nThe operating system can understand Python code as it is directly implemented without the need for a special compiler to interpret Python commands into commands that the operating system understands as some other programming languages such as Java require.\n5. Work on more than one platform\nThe program that you build with Python works on the most important operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Unix.\n6. Object orientation\nSupports the concept of class, object, encapsulation, genetics, etc.\n7. Multitasking\nPython provides you with multithreading technology that allows you to make your program able to execute multiple commands simultaneously.\n8. Databases\nPython provides interfaces ready to handle the most important databases.\n9. User interface\nApplications with a user interface can be built.\n10. Dealing with other programming languages\nYou can work with other programming languages (such as C, C ++, Java) within your program written primarily in Python.\n11. Other programming languages deal with Python\nMost programming languages support Python handling, meaning they allow you to use Python code in programs written primarily in other programming languages (such as C, C ++, and Java).\n12. Educational curricula\nMany institutes and universities, whether foreign or Arab, are now studying for students.\n•Are you ready to learn Python?\n•If you are a beginner in programming, you should study algorithms immediately before you start studying Python because you need to know the principles of programming before you learn any programming language. Don't worry if you've never learned it because we explained the algorithms from scratch.\nPython is a high-level programming language created by Guido Van Rossum while working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica Research Center in 1986.\n1991 The first version was published to make it accessible to all.\nThis language has been developed and added a lot of features in each new version to this day until it has become one of the most important languages of the era, which can be used to build desktop programs, web applications, games, scripts, etc.\nPython works on all the most important operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Unix, etc. It is one of the most famous programming languages ever.",

      "description": "Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.\n\n\nWhy to Learn Python?\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.\n\n\nPython is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\nPython is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\nPython is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\nPython is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\nPython is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.\n\n\nCharacteristics of Python\nFollowing are important characteristics of Python Programming −\nIt supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.\nIt can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.\nIt provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.\nIt supports automatic garbage collection.\nIt can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.\n\n\nPython is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:\nEasy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.\nEasy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.\nEasy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.\nA broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.\nInteractive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.\nPortable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.\nExtendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.\nDatabases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.\nGUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.\nScalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.",

However, I Perl and Her community is one that has humbled me in the most beneficial ways. The goal of any serious Perl programmer is Mastery - but a mastery that compels them to remain feeling as a child still learning, yet as a caring paternal guide for those  he sees on the same journey. This is my attempt to lead others into this contemplative are of computer programming.\n\n\nThis free course is a full taste of what to expect from the upcoming PAID Perl IRL course, and includes a sneak peak into the list of current lessons. You receive in this free course nearly two hours of coding \"IRL\" using Perl. It also includes an introduction to the programming environment  I am using, how to install Perl modules, and provides examples of efficient workflows that are used by professional Perl programmers all over the world. But even though it is a sample course, you will still learn a lot about Perl and how to work with it efficiently. After this course, you will have a good taste of what the paid course provides; but in the paid course you will get exposure to so much more.

The lessons and examples provided are delivered in a step-by-step, detailed way to ensure mastery of the skills and topics covered.\nCourse Outline\nIntroduction walks through the course goals, approach and the core concepts of Maven.\nAfter that, we breeze through installation of all required tools in the Quick Installation section. The full step-by-step installation process is available in the Bonus sections.\nIn Setup and Getting Help, we cover how to ask for help in Maven. We also download the course working files on GitHub.\nWith the formalities out of the way, we dive into a Maven Quick Start By Example, walking the foundational aspects of Maven using a sample application.\nAfter the basics are covered, we explore Maven Plugins in more detail by customizing our project using them.\nOne of the key aspects of Maven, is how it handles Dependencies. We go deeper by adding dependencies from Maven Central and explore the role of scopes with dependencies in Maven.\nThen we improve our project by Unit Testing -- where we add JUnit tests, deal with (and avoid) testing failures. Finally, the last section of the main part of this course is dedicated to running Maven within Eclipse using the M2Eclipse plugin.\nFinally, we will look at Using Archetypes to jump start Maven projects by using a template system.\nDuring the entire course, we get into a habit of saving our changes periodically using Git source control.\nCourse Features\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.\nOver 2 hours of Screencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated.\nProject files and examples are all available on GitHub.\n\nThis course is fully closed captioned!",

The Scratch platform is designed especially for kids aged 8 to 16. Younger children can also try ScratchJr, a simplified version of Scratch designed for ages 5 to 7.\nWith today’s resources, basic computer programming is now fairly easy to master. Even five-year-olds can pick up the fundamentals of code via the visual block interfaces.\nProgramming is nothing more than telling your computer what to do in a language that the machine understands. Most children understand that, and that’s why it is so easy for them to pick up the skill and start writing functional code in no time.\nNote: The course is intended for purchase by adults.

The course was developed under the strict oversight of Hristo Zhivomirov who is one of the top 50 MATLAB contributors Worldwide (search for his name in Google).\nThe course is structured in a way that is suitable for both beginners and those that already have some experience with MATLAB, there is a lot of information for everyone.\nEverything in our world today can be viewed as some kind of a matrix, and I’m not talking about the Matrix Trilogy. For example\nMeasuring the temperature of a patient every 2 hours, can be represented with a one dimensional matrix, which is also called a vector\nMonochromatic (black and white) image is a two dimensional matrix, the values in each cell in the matrix is representing the gradation of the gray color\nMeasuring temperature in a room for example, rooms are 3D, so we need x, y, z to describe the position at which we take our measurements, and the value is the temperature, that is a three dimensional matrix\nMeasure now the change of that temperature over a period of time and the temperature becomes a fourth dimension\nNow add time in the mix and you get… a fifth dimension!\nActually MATLAB has no restrictions on dimensions, you can work with 4, 5, 6 and more dimensions in a single matrix!\nHow to handle The Matrix: It is not necessary to look for the red pill, like Neo had to – what you actually need is MATLAB, which means MATrix LABoratory contrary to popular belief. MATLAB is a programming language of high level and interactive programming environment that lets you easily implement numeric experiments and methods, allowing you to design algorithms, analyze data and visualize that data in a very, very powerful way.\nYou will learn:\nVariables, everything you need to know about variables in matlab, their types or lack of types, converting between different types, naming conventions, the semicolon operator and more\nBasic Arithmetic Operations in MATLAB, the most important thing in this section of the course are the Brackets and the Order of operations, many beginners get lost when they encounter complex expressions, and you will become a master of those\nRight after that we are diving into deep waters starting with Vectors, you will learn how to think in vectors and perform a variety of different operations on and with vectors. Concatenating vectors, extracting or selecting subvectors, and more\nMatrices are next on the line, but you wont need any pills, because I have you covered, you will learn everything you need to know about working with Matrices in MATLAB and you will also learn a trick in this section that will help you optimize your code and make it run up to 100 times faster!\nData visualization, because, well, whats the point of working with Data if you cant understand it or share it with other people, visualizing data is key in any area of work\nAnd finally we get to the actual MATLAB Programming by utilizing conditional statements, loops and functions to control the flow of your code, write less code, and make your code modular.\nEach section contains a source code file at the end so that you can download and review the code that I have written in the lectures!\nI hope that you will enjoy this course, as much as I did creating it, so lets dive right into it!\nI welcome you to the course!",

I will also present you its most important features, and show you how to combine Spring Boot together with other Spring modules like MVC and Data. During this course, you will prepare a ToDo list application.\nIf you have never used Spring and want to see what it is all about then this course is for you. Besides Spring Boot we will use here a few other modules from Spring but before using any of them I will introduce them to you.\nYou will find here slides with a theory about Spring and also videos from coding. What is very important, in coding videos you will write every single line of code, there will be no situation when suddenly some new code appears in the project. Moreover, after every practical part, you will be able to download source codes for it.\nIn the course, I am using Spring in version 5, Java 8, and my IDE is Eclipse. Before you will start you should have some background knowledge about programming in Java. It would be good if you had some basic knowledge of databases and HTML but it is not necessary.",

      "description": "Learn Assembly Language\n\nThe x86 Adventures series teaches you your computer's language - x86 Assembly Language, from scratch. No prior knowledge is assumed.\n[Part 1] Counting with two digits\nThis is the first chapter of x86 Assembly Adventures. Here we begin with the really basics - How to live in the binary system - A system where instead of 10 digits, we have only two: 0 and 1. If you have ever seen all those zeroes and ones in movies - this is what we are going to learn here.\nDon't worry if you never liked math at school, if you can figure out how to buy stuff at the grocery shop, I assure you that you are going to understand the ideas presented here.\nWe will mainly discuss the following subjects:\nAdding and subtracting numbers in the binary representation.\nConverting between decimal (The \"normal\") numbers, and binary numbers.\nDealing with negative binary numbers.\nAt this part of the course we will not yet see any actual assembly code. We have to learn this first, so please be patient :) . All of the exercises for this part are mostly theoretic. You have to sit down with a pen and paper and think a bit. (But really just a bit). It is very important that you do the exercises, or at least be sure that you know how to answer everything before you move on to the next part.\nWhy learn x86 Assembly Language?\nYou are the kind of person who really likes to know how things work. In this course you are going to get solid understanding on how computer programs work from the inside.\nBecome a better programmer - Knowing how things work down there will help you take better decisions, even as a high level programmer. If you were always wondering what is the stack, or what are those pointers everyone talks about, you came to the right place.\nWrite faster code - When you really want to get the most of your processor, writing in raw Assembly is needed. We are not going to talk about optimizations in this course, however you will get a solid foundations so that you can continue exploring on your own.\nYou want to become a reverse engineer or a security researcher, read the code of viruses or look for software vulnerabilities. As most of the time the original source code will not be available to you, solid understanding of x86 Assembly Language is mandatory.\nCourse structure\nThe course is made of video lectures. A lecture could be from a presentation, or a real world example, showing me doing stuff at the computer.\nAlmost every video lecture is accompanied by some kind of exercise (You will be told during the lecture, don't worry :) ) The exercises are open source. They are attached here as a rar file, however you could also get them on github. (See \"About this course\" video for more information).\nIt is crucial that you complete the exercises. You will learn a lot from the lectures, but it is pretty much a waste of your time and money if you don't do the exercises. (Or at least verify that you know how to do them, if you are more experienced).\n\nCourse tech stack\nNo prior knowledge is assumed for this course, but I do assume some things regarding your system, so make sure that everything here describes you:\nYou are using a Windows operation system. (The course videos use Windows 7). It is recommended to use at least Windows XP.\nYou have an intel x86 processor. (If you don't know what you have then you have x86 processor, trust me).\nFor the tech savvy, some more details about the tools we are going to use in this course:\nAssembly flavour: x86 32 bits protected mode.\nAssembler: The Flat Assembler (FASM)\nDebugger: WinDbg.\nUsing Linux? Most of the exercises were ported to linux, however the videos show me using windows 7. Contact me if you are not sure.",

      "description": "Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language\n\n\nWhy to Learn Python?\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages\n\n\nPython is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\nPython is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP\nPython is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs\nPython is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects\nPython is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games\n\n\nCharacteristics of Python\nFollowing are important characteristics of Python Programming −\nIt supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP\nIt can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications\nIt provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking\nIt supports automatic garbage collection\nIt can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java\n\n\nPython is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:\nEasy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly\nEasy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes\nEasy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain\nA broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh\nInteractive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code\nPortable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms\nExtendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient\nDatabases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases\nGUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix\nScalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting",

Besides that it is practical in your own applications where you deal with network connections or concurrent HTTP requests.\nThe asyncio module was introduced in Python 3.4 and therefore not new per se. However, with Python version 3.7 the API of the asyncio module received quite some changes. These changes allow developers to interact more easily with the event loop.\nDuring this course I will teach you:\nHow to use the new async and await keywords\nAll about the asyncio module\nRun coroutines\nAbout the event loop in Python\nThe differences between asyncio and threading\nAbout Me\nMy name is Koen, it is nice to meet you. Starting out at the age of 15 with iOS development I never lost my interest in Software Development. Currently I mainly keep myself occupied with web development.

      "description": "Unlock the full potential of Python by mastering one of its most essential building blocks—conditional statements. Whether you’re a beginner building a solid foundation or someone who’s followed Parts 1 and 2 of this series, this course is your key to writing smarter, more efficient code.\nIn this free Python course (Part 3), we dive deep into conditions and control flow, the core of decision-making in programming. From understanding why conditions matter to applying nested structures, logical operators, and loops, you'll gain confidence to build dynamic, responsive Python programs.\nConditional statements are what enable programs to make decisions. Whether you're creating a chatbot, writing automation scripts, or designing game logic, conditions power the intelligence behind every action. If you've ever wondered how programs decide what to do next, this is the course that answers that question—clearly and practically.\nWe start with the basics: the if, else, and elif statements. You'll not only learn the syntax but also understand how to apply them in real-world scenarios. From there, you’ll explore nested conditions, logical operators, and their practical uses. You’ll also discover how loops (for and while) can work seamlessly with conditions to create efficient, responsive programs.\nThrough bite-sized lessons and easy-to-follow examples, this course is designed to remove the fear and confusion around conditions and give you hands-on experience in writing clean, logical code.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll:\nWrite code that makes decisions.\nBuild simple programs that respond to user input.\nUse loops and conditions together for better control.\nImplement real-life examples using break, continue, and pass.\nYou’ll also work through basic projects and code demonstrations to reinforce your learning—ensuring you're not just watching, but truly mastering the material.\nIf you skip this course, you’ll likely miss one of the most crucial skills in programming. Without understanding conditions, you’ll struggle to write programs that do more than just run linearly. Your code will remain rigid, inflexible, and limited in capability.\nThis course is not just another tutorial—it’s a transformation. From a beginner who dabbles with syntax to someone who can build dynamic Python applications, you’ll come out with the clarity, confidence, and coding mindset to level up your Python journey.\nBest of all, this course is completely free—making it a perfect gateway for aspiring developers, data analysts, and curious learners to advance their Python skills without any risk.",

      "description": "In this comprehensive course, you will learn everything you need to know about the Hill Climbing algorithm, one of the most important and intuitive algorithms in the field of Artificial Intelligence and optimization. Whether you are a beginner exploring AI search methods or a professional looking to deepen your understanding of local search techniques, this course will guide you step-by-step from the fundamental concepts to more advanced problem-solving strategies.\nHill Climbing is a local search algorithm that uses the idea of incrementally improving a solution until we reach a peak — like climbing a hill until there’s no higher point nearby. This makes it a simple yet powerful method for solving optimization problems, scheduling tasks, and finding solutions where other exhaustive search methods would be too slow or computationally expensive.\nWe begin the course with a gentle introduction to the theory behind Hill Climbing. You’ll understand what local search is, why we use Hill Climbing, and how it differs from other search strategies like A*, breadth-first search, or depth-first search. We’ll break down the main components of the algorithm:\nStates and state space representation\nObjective (or evaluation) function\nNeighboring states and transitions\nStopping conditions\nFrom there, we’ll explore different variants of the Hill Climbing algorithm, such as:\nSimple Hill Climbing\nSteepest-Ascent Hill Climbing\nStochastic Hill Climbing\nRandom-Restart Hill Climbing\nFor each variant, we’ll not only explain the algorithm step-by-step but also implement it together, so you can see exactly how the concepts work in practice.\nA major focus of the course will be on the strengths and weaknesses of Hill Climbing. You will learn about common pitfalls such as:\nGetting stuck in local maxima\nFalling into plateaus where all moves seem equal\nEntering ridges where a small change in direction is needed to improve the solution\nWe’ll then discuss practical techniques to overcome these limitations, such as adding randomness, performing multiple restarts, or combining Hill Climbing with other algorithms.\nThroughout the course, we’ll work on hands-on examples and projects. You will see how Hill Climbing can be applied to real-world problems like:\nFunction optimization\nPuzzle solving (e.g., the 8-Puzzle problem)\nScheduling and resource allocation tasks\nEach coding example will be implemented step-by-step, ensuring that you fully understand the logic behind every line of code.\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nUnderstand the theory and mechanics of the Hill Climbing algorithm\nBe able to implement different Hill Climbing variants from scratch\nKnow when Hill Climbing is a good choice — and when it’s not\nHave the skills to apply Hill Climbing to a variety of real-world optimization problems\nIf you want to master one of the simplest yet most insightful algorithms in AI, and develop problem-solving skills that can be applied to countless domains, this course is for you.\nEnroll now and start climbing towards better solutions!",

Data Scientists are gaining ground with $100k+ salaries. It´s time to switch from soapbox cars (spreadsheet software like Excel) to High Tuned Racing Cars (Pandas)!\nPython is a great platform/environment for Data Science with powerful Tools for Science, Statistics, Finance, and Machine Learning. The Pandas Library is the Heart of Python Data Science. Pandas enables you to import, clean, join/merge/concatenate, manipulate, and deeply understand your Data and finally prepare/process Data for further Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, or Data Presentation. In reality, all of these tasks require a high proficiency in Pandas! Data Scientists typically spend up to 85% of their time manipulating Data in Pandas.\n\n\nData Analysis with Pandas and Python introduces you to the popular Pandas library built on top of the Python programming language.\nPandas is a powerhouse tool that allows you to do anything and everything with colossal data sets -- analyzing, organizing, sorting, filtering, pivoting, aggregating, munging, cleaning, calculating, and more!\nI call it \"Excel on steroids\"!\n\nOver the course of more than 19 hours, I'll take you step-by-step through Pandas, from installation to visualization! We'll cover hundreds of different methods, attributes, features, and functionalities packed away inside this awesome library. We'll dive into tons of different datasets, short and long, broken and pristine, to demonstrate the incredible versatility and efficiency of this package.",

Will recommend it to all the beginners.\"\n\"Very Good Course for Beginners\nThis course covers all the Basic concepts of C++ in easily understandable and interactive way. The instructor Ajay is also very helpful and replies readily to your queries and doubts. Overall I would strongly recommend this course to you if you are looking for basic knowledge of C++.\"\n\"Excellent Course\nI really enjoyed taking this course. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in C++. It covers all the basics and good tips are given during the course. Ajay certainly knows the subject he teaches here. Looking forward to his next course.\"\n\"Good primer\nI'm brand new to Python, so this course was really just what I needed. I would like it to have been a bit longer, and go a bit deeper, but as a brand new Python coder, I really enjoyed it and learned the basics.\"\nSO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

      "description": "In this course, we will explore one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python: classes. Object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm that allows developers to structure their code in a more modular and reusable manner. Understanding classes is essential for writing scalable and maintainable Python applications, as they provide a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate both data and behavior.\nThe course will begin with a conceptual introduction to classes in Python. We will cover essential topics such as defining a class, and understanding the role of attributes and methods. We will also discuss important principles.\nAfter establishing the theoretical foundation, we will proceed with four hands-on coding exercises that demonstrate the practical implementation of classes. These exercises will focus on defining classes, working with instance variables and methods. By the end of the class, students will have a solid understanding of how to create and use classes in Python, preparing them for more advanced OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.\nThis course is designed for students with a basic understanding of Python syntax and functions who want to take their programming skills to the next level by learning object-oriented principles.\nI am looking forward to see you in the class",

It contains around two hours of videos and exercises designed to make you proficient on Go array and slice structures.\nRather than being a primer, it is a didactic sequential approach with short explanations and exercises. By the end of this tutorial series, you’ll have a solid understanding of arrays and slices in Go, enabling you to choose the right data structure for your specific use case.\nUnderstanding Arrays and Slices in Go\nIn Go, arrays and slices are essential data structures that allow you to work with ordered sequences of elements.\nThese collections are particularly useful when dealing with related values.\nHere’s a breakdown of the key differences between arrays and slices:\n\n\nArrays:\nIn Go an array is a fixed-size data structure.\nIts capacity is defined at creation time and cannot be changed afterward.\nOnce you allocate an array’s size, it remains constant.\nArrays are suitable when you know the exact number of elements you need.\\Example: var myArray [5]int creates an integer array with 5 elements.\nSlices:\nA slice is a dynamically resizable data structure.\nUnlike arrays, slices can grow or shrink as needed.\nSlices are built on top of arrays and provide a more flexible way to work with sequences.\nThey are commonly used when the number of elements is not fixed.\nExample: mySlice := []int{1, 2, 3} creates an integer slice.\n\nWhy Use Arrays and Slices?\n\nData Organization: Arrays and slices allow you to group related data together. For instance, you can store a list of temperatures, user IDs, or product prices.\nCode Efficiency: By using arrays and slices, you can perform the same operations on multiple values simultaneously. This leads to cleaner and more concise code.\nFlexibility: Slices adapt to your needs, making them ideal for scenarios where the size may change dynamically.\n\nTutorial Series Contents:\n\n1. Introduction: Understand the basics of arrays and slices.\n2. Declaration and Initialization: Learn how to declare and initialize arrays and slices.\n3. Accessing Elements: Explore methods to access individual elements.\n4. Modifying Elements: Discover how to modify array and slice elements.\n5. Iterating Over Arrays and Slices: Master loops and range-based iteration.\n6. Multidimensional Arrays: Dive into arrays with multiple dimensions.\n7. Built-in Functions: Explore useful functions for working with arrays and slices.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a solid understanding of arrays and slices in Go, enabling you to move forward into other data structures on subsequent volumes.",

We'll start with setting up your local machine python development environment.\nAfter that, we'll make progress and learn the concepts of Python.\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.\nPython is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.\nPython consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.\nCourse Contents\n- Python development environment set up\n- Conditional Statements in Python\n- Loop Controls in Python\n- Number and Strings in Python\n- String  Manipulation in Python.\nThis will give you a basic idea and fundamentals of Python and will kick start your Python learning journey.",

It allows you to provide your team with an ideal mix of features pertaining to both platforms.\nSalesforce users often face the issue of reconciling data between two platforms and switching between them while performing specific activities. Salesforce integration relieves them from this problem and provides them with a centralized platform to work on.\nFor example, Salesforce PayPal integration would allow you to use your Salesforce org as a payment gateway. Similarly, Salesforce Twilio integration would streamline your communication processes with your clients.\nSalesforce Integration Processes\nThere are two major approaches to carry out the process of Salesforce integration – App-based and code-based.\n\n\n· Salesforce Integration Overview\n· Salesforce to Salesforce Integration\n· JSON Format\n· JSON Generator\n· JSON Parser\n· JSON Parser Deserialization\n· Postal Pincode API / Use case\n· Weather Map API Integration / Use case\n· Rest Web Services Overview\n· Creating Web Services\n· Oauth Username password and flow overview\n· Oauth Username password Use case\n· Future Callout with Oauth\n· Email Services",

      "description": "In this course, I will present an executive summary of the Programming in Practice educational path. If we are talking about programming, we must, of course, also talk about programs.  Generally speaking, we can assume that a program is an algorithm implementation. In this context, we may recognize implementation as a process of representing an algorithm using a language dedicated to being used by computers. Diving in computer science as a study of algorithmic processes, computational machines, and computation itself is a good topic for an independent course. Now, let me only stress that it is a discipline that also spans the practical issues of implementing computational systems using software.\nSoftware development needs programming. To improve your programming skills, you have the following options:\nYou may learn the programming language as the principal goal and start programming from scratch. It leads to a theoretical approach, and finally, possible improvements in your knowledge, but not skills.\nUnfortunately, a typical proposal may resemble the following scenario: if you need inheritance, reflection, serialization, dependency injection, inversion of control, etc. just do it... and here you are getting a snippet of a text illustrating how to implement the selected concept. It is like the Twitter style - deep thought expressed as a short text. Unfortunately, it teaches the humility of the teachers but not the skills of the students for sure. Additionally, this approach has a few subsequent drawbacks. By design, the examples are detached from the context. It means that they are not answering a question about someone needing something and what this something means. Additionally, this approach doesn't promote reusability because - intentionally - the examples are tightly coupled with details that exist only in the teacher's mind. Sometimes any simple modification of assumed details causes the code snippet to be useless for practical use cases because it is not self-contained. Concluding, teaching based on snippets promotes simplification. unfortunately, my point is that simplicity was not born by simplification.\nThe next possibility is to engage the full-featured program embedding an example. Unfortunately, it usually has a lot of unimportant details for the topic in concern. It could obscure the pattern and make the behavior hard to understand.\nIn other words, the examples are indispensable to make the learning outcomes practical but to overcome the drawbacks mentioned previously I propose extended examples. By the extended examples, I mean examples that can be executed as independent units. This way, you can observe not only a pattern but also trace the behavior. I believe that it should also improve the reusability of the examples.\n\n\nUsually, unit tests are used to validate the correctness and consistency of a created program. The role of the unit tests included here is significantly different.  They are created with teaching values in mind. By design, they are used to make the examples intelligible and add the possibility to analyze also the behavior of the code patterns presented here. It is my silver bullet that allows diving into code samples behavior based on working examples. As a result of this approach, the examples are not obscured by a bunch of unimportant details needed to execute the examples as a part of a complete program. Of course, the testing and teaching roles cannot be entirely separated. A detailed description of the unit test design and deployment is to be covered by a separate course.\nTo make the code samples intelligible, they must be developed using an appropriate language and maintainable using coupled development tools. To be able to trace behavior, the development environment has to support it. I have assumed that all topics are illustrated using the C# language and opening with the MS Visual Studio design environment to ensure the practical context and provide solid examples. This course lets you get started with C# as a programming language and Visual Studio as an integrated development environment.\nLet me stress again that the main goal of this course is only an introduction to how to get started to create a foundation for the Programming in Practice educational path. Programming in Practice is based on code samples that by design are reusable patterns. But code samples are just text. The text must be maintained in a public repository To promote reusability. To promote separation of concerns it is organized into independent but consistent sections. Today, the code examples address the following application domains.\nExternal Data-Intensive Programming: process data management using external resources - the external data is grouped as streaming, structural, and graphical data.\nAdaptive Programming: language constructs, patterns, and frameworks used at the development and deployment stage to improve the adaptability of the software in the production environment.\nDistributed Programming: all about developing interoperable applications interconnected over the network.\nConcurrent and real-time programming are just examples of the possible directions for the further development of the code samples collected in the repository. The assumption is that the priorities in this respect are encouraged by community feedback.\nI have selected the GitHub repository to maintain the examples. One of the reasons is that it is a perfect platform for collaboration. Generally speaking, three forms of collaboration may be distinguished, namely\n- using the content as is,\n- reporting problems,\n- actively contributing to code improvement\nIndependently, thanks to a very permissive license, the code may be used for other training courses or may be embedded in commercial applications. Finally, the Programming in Practice community could gather researchers, teachers, practitioners, and students working together on further directions of software engineering depending on the current priorities of the community promoting openness and transparency. Consider contributing aimed at improving and expanding the examples offered by this repository. The topic of how to contribute is covered in this course.",

I, personally found Python to be one such language which is easy& efficient enough to learn and apply.Python is a very powerful language and It is easy as well.Some amount of work in our behalf makes us proficient enough in this language.\nWhat amount & how much work we should do with this language.\nHere comes our course comprising 36 coding challenges.\nThese challenges are ranged from basic to advanced level and these will test your metal to solve any problem.\nWhat you need to solve these challenges?\nThe answer is some basic Python stuff & common sense.\nHow to break a particular challenge?\nThe answer is we should take a copy and pen and start writing the pseudo code first. Pseudo code is the code that is basically written to break the challenge. So that its solving approach be known. Once we are aware of the approach, we should reach to our IDE'S and start playing with it in a very calm way. We should check the process by debugging the entire code. Debugging gives us the idea about how& what things are missing or wrongly applied in a particular scenario.\nFinally, we will solve the problem & our programs will be bug free also.\nI am a self taught programmer & I am very passionate about programming.\nI will be trying to add more challenges with every passing week as I love coding  and it has become my passion also.\nOnce again it is good to have you in this journey!\nHappy Coding!",

      "description": "Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.\n\n\nWhy to Learn Python?\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.\n\n\nPython is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\nPython is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\nPython is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\nPython is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\nPython is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.\n\n\nCharacteristics of Python\nFollowing are important characteristics of Python Programming −\nIt supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.\nIt can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.\nIt provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.\nIt supports automatic garbage collection.\nIt can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.\n\n\nPython is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:\nEasy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.\nEasy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.\nEasy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.\nA broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.\nInteractive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.\nPortable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.\nExtendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.\nDatabases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.\nGUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.\nScalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.",

Regardless of what your goal is, wether its to find a job as a developer or not, knowing a little bit of coding can be really handy from time to time.\nAnd C# is a great language to start. Why? Well what I like the most about C# is its structure, its a strong typed language. What does that mean? It means that everything is \"defined\" in C#, which in turn lets you write beautiful code, you will see that at one point writing the code becomes an art, it just looks beautiful when you structure it the correct way.\nLeave the aesthetics, with C# you can create anything, desktop application, websites, Android/iPhone applications, games, anything you can think of, you can create it with C#.\nBy learning to code with C# you will be able to jump quickly into any other language, if you need to at some point. The reason for that is, again, the strongly typed and well created hierarchy in C#, which will basicly teach you everything you need to know about coding in general.\nAll programming languages are pretty much the same, on the basic level the difference is only in the syntax. All of them have variables, loops, arrays etc., so if you think that you will need to jump to another language at some point, do not worry, you will be able to do that with ease. I myself started with C#, then I moved on to a little bit of Java, then a little JavaScript, then a little TypeScript, and if I didn't have the solid foundations that I have with C#, it wouldn't have been that easy!\nThis is why I am able to help you forge the most solid foundations that you may ever get in coding. Just like everything in life, your first exposure to something new is the most crucial one.\nThis course will teach you both the theory and the practice behind coding. You will learn by watching, by doing and mostly by struggling.\nYou will also find numerous examples and projects to practice what we are learning and nothing will be left out. At the end of each section there will be a short quiz that will test you for some of the tricky parts of that section.\nExercises are also provided so that you can try to code on your own, most of them will not be solved in the course, but you will get hints from time to time on how to solve some of the hard ones. And of course you can always ask a question in the QnA section of the course! I will answer within less than 24 hours!\nRemember, there is no such thing as a stupid question, the devil is in the details!\nPlus, you have a 30 days money back guarantee, so if the course does not meet your expectations, you can get your money back, no questions asked!",

In this course, you will learn how to program using Golang, an open-source programming language developed by Google.\nGolang, also known as Go, is a modern programming language designed to make it easy to write efficient, reliable, and scalable software. It has gained popularity in recent years due to its simplicity, speed, and concurrency support. It is used by companies like Google, Uber, Netflix, and Dropbox to build large-scale systems.\nIn this course, you will start by creating your first Golang program, a \"Hello World\" project. You will then learn about variable types in Golang, including integers, floats, strings, and Booleans. You will learn how to declare variables and constants, and how to use them in your programs.\nNext, you will learn how to create functions in Golang. You will learn how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values. You will also learn about loops in Golang, including for loops and while loops, and how to use them to iterate through arrays and other data structures.\nIn addition to loops, you will also learn about logical statements in Golang, including if statements, switch statements, and conditional expressions. These statements allow you to make decisions in your programs based on the values of variables and other conditions.\nFinally, you will apply your knowledge of Golang to a sample project, where you will build a program that uses functions, loops, and logical statements to solve a problem.\nI am excited to guide you through this course and help you learn Golang. By the end of this course, you will have a strong foundation in Golang programming and be ready to take on more advanced Golang projects.\nLet's get started!",

      "description": "Introduction to Scratch:\nScratch is a beginner-friendly visual programming language and online platform developed by MIT to help kids and beginners learn how to code.\nIt uses a block-based programming paradigm, where users create scripts by snapping together blocks that represent code instructions.\nPaint in Scratch:\nScratch allows you to create your own sprites (characters or objects) using the built-in Paint Editor.\nThe Paint Editor provides tools for drawing, painting, and customizing sprites.\nYou can also import images to use as sprites.\nScratch Basics:\nThe Scratch interface consists of a stage (where your sprites perform) and a code area (where you create scripts).\nSprites can be selected from the library, drawn in the Paint Editor, or uploaded.\nYou control sprites by creating scripts using code blocks.\nIntroduction to Motion Blocks:\nScratch provides a range of motion blocks to control the movement of sprites.\nSome basic motion blocks include \"move [ ] steps,\" \"go to [ ], [ ],\" \"glide [ ] seconds to x: [ ] y: [ ],\" and \"turn [ ] degrees.\"\nX and Y Coordinate System:\nIn Scratch, the stage uses an X and Y coordinate system. The (0, 0) point is at the center of the stage.\nPositive X values go to the right, and negative X values go to the left.\nPositive Y values go up, and negative Y values go down.\nDirections:\nIn Scratch, directions are represented in degrees. A sprite can face any direction from 0 to 360 degrees.\n0 degrees is the default, which means the sprite faces right, and 90 degrees means it faces up.\nMotion Exercises: Here are some basic motion exercises in Scratch to help you get started:\nMoving a Sprite:\nUse the \"move [ ] steps\" block to make a sprite move horizontally or vertically.\nCombine it with \"turn [ ] degrees\" to make the sprite move diagonally.\nGoing to a Specific Location:\nUse the \"go to [x], [y]\" block to move a sprite to specific coordinates on the stage.\nGliding:\nThe \"glide [ ] seconds to x: [ ] y: [ ]\" block allows smooth movement of a sprite to a specified location over a set time.\nTurning the Sprite:\nUse the \"turn [ ] degrees\" block to change the direction the sprite is facing.\nBouncing Off the Edges:\nYou can use \"if on edge, bounce\" to make a sprite bounce when it hits the stage's boundary.\nCreating Animated Motion:\nCombine different motion blocks to create animations. For example, make a sprite move in a zigzag pattern or spin in a circle.\nScratch's visual and intuitive nature makes it an excellent platform for beginners to explore and understand programming concepts while having fun creating interactive projects. Motion and direction are fundamental aspects of animating sprites and creating engaging experiences in Scratch.\n\n\nNote: this course is intended for purchase as an adult. Those under 18 may use this course only if a parent or guardian opens their account, handles any enrollments, and manages their account usage.",

      "description": "What is Etherum ?\nEthereum is an open source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts. It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the system’s state changes, along with a cryptocurrency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs.\nThe Ethereum platform enables developers to build powerful decentralized applications with built-in economic functions. While providing high availability, auditability, transparency and neutrality, it also reduces or eliminates censorship, and reduces certain counterparty risks.\n\n\nWhat is a smart contract ?\nThe term smart contract has been used over the years to describe a wide variety of different things. In the 1990s, cryptographer Nick Szabo coined the term and defined it as “a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on the other promises”. Since then, the concept of smart contracts has evolved, especially after the introduction of decentralized blockchain platforms with the invention of Bitcoin in 2009. In the context of Ethereum, the term is actually a bit of a misnomer, given that Ethereum smart contracts are neither smart nor legal contracts, but the term has stuck. In this book, we use the term “smart contract” to refer to immutable computer programs that run deterministically in the context of an Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the Ethereum network protocol, i.e. on the decentralized Ethereum world computer.\n\n\nWhat is a DApp?\nA Decentralized Application, or DApp, is an application which is mostly or entirely decentralized.\nConsider all the possible aspects of an application that may be decentralized:\nFront-end software\nBack-end software (logic)\nData storage\nName resolution\nMessage communications\n\n\nWhat is Web3.js ?\nweb3.js is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote\nethereum node, using a HTTP or IPC connection.\n\n\nYou will learn\ninstallation\nthe big picture\nnetwork\ncreate web3 object\nlocal hosted with ganache\nremote hosted with infura\naccount\ncreate new account\nget account balance\nwallet\nblock chain\nblock inspection\nsubscribe block headers\nsubscribe pending transactions\ncontract\ncreate contract\ncall method\nsub event\ntransaction\ntransaction deploy contract\ntransaction send ether\ntransaction write to smart contract\nBlockchain and Ethereum dapp right now are very hot technical trend.

Like the textbook, the course quickly dives into problem solving and making use of the C++ standard library, including strings, vectors, and lists. The emphasis is on teaching you the parts of C++ that you will most likely need in your day-to-day programming. This course is Part 1 of a planned two-part sequence. Part 1 covers the first seven chapters of Accelerated C++, in particular, Chapters 0 through 6. The course consists of six videos of 50-60 minutes each.\nPart 2 of the course, forthcoming, will cover the second half of Accelerated C++, including how to write your own classes and generic functions.",

But, unless you learn those functional programming features properly, getting used to those becomes a bit confusing. So, in this course, we are going to grasp how to do functional programming in an intuitive and conceptual manner, very rapidly. We'll learn each feature with simple and crisp examples, which'll be very brief but quite informative.\nThis course is actually part I of a two-part course. It covers about Java Lambdas, e.g. lambda expressions, method references, composing lambda expressions etc. The next part, which is coming soon, will be about Streams. You'll find link to that in the resources section of the last lesson.\n\nWe've done some practical exercises in the lessons here, and the links to the source codes are available in the resources section.",

      "description": "This course contains the use of artificial intelligence\nImagine delegating complex refactoring tasks, bug fixes, and feature implementations to an intelligent AI agent, then returning hours later to find polished pull requests waiting for your review. This isn't science fiction—this is the reality of Jules AI coding agent, Google's groundbreaking asynchronous development assistant that's transforming how software gets built.\nWhile traditional AI tools require constant interaction, Jules operates independently, handling comprehensive coding tasks while you focus on high-level architecture and creative problem-solving.\nTransform Your Development Workflow With Google's Most Advanced Coding Agent\nMaster Jules AI and unlock unprecedented productivity gains:\nDelegate complex refactoring tasks across multiple files while maintaining code quality standards\nGenerate comprehensive test suites with near 100% coverage automatically\nImplement complete features from high-level descriptions using Gemini 2.5 Pro reasoning\nFix bugs systematically with intelligent debugging and multi-file change coordination\nUpdate dependencies seamlessly while ensuring backward compatibility across your entire codebase\nCreate polished pull requests with detailed documentation and rationale for every change\nScale concurrent operations up to 60 parallel tasks for enterprise-level automation\nMaster The Future Of Software Development Before Your Competition Does\nThe software development industry stands at a critical inflection point. 85% of enterprises are expected to implement AI agents by the end of 2025, with companies adopting agentic AI reporting 6-10% average revenue increases. The AI coding assistant market, valued at $3.7 billion in 2023, is projected to reach $103.6 billion by 2032—a 44.9% compound annual growth rate. Developers who master asynchronous AI coding now will lead this transformation, while others struggle to adapt to increasingly automated development workflows.\nThe pressure is real: modern development teams face mounting demands for faster delivery, higher code quality, and reduced technical debt. Traditional synchronous AI tools like GitHub Copilot provide helpful suggestions, but they still require constant developer attention and can't handle comprehensive, multi-file changes autonomously. Jules breaks these limitations by operating in secure Google Cloud virtual machines, enabling true task delegation that mirrors working with a skilled junior developer who never gets tired, works 24/7, and consistently follows best practices.\nYou'll master Google's most sophisticated coding agent through hands-on implementation of real-world scenarios. Learn to configure Jules environments for maximum efficiency, craft detailed task specifications that yield optimal results, and integrate asynchronous workflows into existing development processes. Understand the revolutionary critic-augmented generation system that provides adversarial code review before presenting results, ensuring enterprise-grade quality standards.\nAdvanced modules cover enterprise implementation strategies, including multi-agent orchestration where specialized Jules instances collaborate on complex projects, security and compliance considerations for regulated industries, and ROI optimization techniques that demonstrate measurable productivity improvements. You'll discover how to leverage the unique Agents .md documentation system that enables intelligent context awareness, implement custom webhook integrations for CI/CD pipelines, and troubleshoot common challenges that arise during automation scaling.\nThis course is perfect for:\nProfessional developers seeking 40-60% productivity improvements through intelligent automation\nDevelopment team leads implementing AI-assisted workflows in their organizations\nSoftware architects designing systems that leverage autonomous coding agents\nTechnology managers evaluating ROI of AI coding tools for budget planning\nMany developers hesitate to adopt AI coding agents, worried they're too complex to learn or won't integrate with existing workflows. Jules actually simplifies development by handling routine implementation tasks, freeing you to focus on creative problem-solving and architectural decisions. The asynchronous nature means no disruption to your current development environment—Jules works in isolated cloud instances while you continue using familiar tools.\nOthers worry about code quality from AI-generated solutions. Jules incorporates Google's advanced critic functionality that performs adversarial review of every change, identifying subtle bugs, security vulnerabilities, and efficiency improvements before presenting results. This internal review process often produces higher-quality code than time-pressured human developers generate under tight deadlines.\nSome question whether they need another AI tool when they already use GitHub Copilot or similar assistants. Jules operates in a fundamentally different category—rather than providing synchronous suggestions, it handles complete task execution independently. You can literally assign refactoring tasks to Jules, close your laptop, and return to finished pull requests ready for review and deployment.\nEnterprise teams often assume AI coding agents create security risks or compliance issues. Jules operates with privacy by design, running in isolated Google Cloud virtual machines without training on private repositories. The code remains completely isolated within the execution environment, with comprehensive audit trails for corporate governance requirements.\nNeuroscience research reveals why asynchronous task delegation proves so effective for cognitive performance. When developers constantly context-switch between creative design work and mechanical implementation tasks, cognitive overhead reduces both productivity and job satisfaction. Studies show that eliminating routine implementation tasks allows developers to achieve flow states 40% more frequently, leading to breakthrough innovations and higher job satisfaction.\nThe psychological impact extends beyond productivity metrics. Organizations implementing Jules report reduced developer burnout, improved work-life balance, and renewed enthusiasm for challenging technical problems. When mundane coding tasks get automated, human creativity gets unleashed on problems that truly require human insight: user experience optimization, system architecture design, and innovative solution development.\nComplete Course Structure:\nModule 1: Jules AI Foundations - Understanding asynchronous architecture, competitive advantages over synchronous tools, and Gemini 2.5 Pro capabilities that power intelligent reasoning.\nModule 2: Professional Setup & Configuration - Enterprise-grade GitHub integration, pricing optimization strategies, and advanced AGENTS .md implementation for intelligent context awareness.\nModule 3: Advanced Asynchronous Workflows - Mastering task delegation, environment snapshots for accelerated execution, and coordinating up to 60 concurrent operations.\nModule 4: Critic System Mastery - Leveraging adversarial code review, implementing automated quality gates, and customizing review criteria for project-specific requirements.\nModule 5: Enterprise Implementation - Scaling Jules across development teams, measuring productivity improvements, and addressing security and compliance requirements.\nModule 6: Multi-Agent Orchestration - Coordinating specialized Jules instances, integrating with CI/CD pipelines, and building custom automation workflows.\nModule 7: Performance Optimization - Advanced prompt engineering, troubleshooting common issues, and workarounds for technical limitations.\nModule 8: Future-Proofing Your Skills - Preparing for next-generation AI agents, building AI-native development cultures, and leading organizational transformation.\nExclusive Content: 50+ tested prompt library for maximum Jules effectiveness, ROI calculator and business case generator for stakeholder presentations, and insider roadmap analysis with quarterly updates on Jules evolution.\nThis comprehensive masterclass provides everything needed to become a Jules AI expert and transform your development workflow. The future belongs to developers who can effectively collaborate with AI agents while maintaining the creativity and architectural thinking that defines exceptional software engineering.\nEnroll Now and master Google's revolutionary asynchronous coding agent that's transforming software development worldwide.",

Whether you’ve completed the earlier parts of this Python series or you’re jumping in here, this course will transform how you think about structuring your code.\nYou’ll start by understanding why Object-Oriented Programming matters. It’s not just a buzzword—it’s how professional developers build real-world applications, from games to web frameworks, data models to automation tools. You’ll get crystal clear explanations of classes, objects, attributes, and methods, and you’ll build reusable, flexible Python code you’ll be proud of.\nThis course is uniquely structured to take you from foundational knowledge to confident application. You'll begin with the core concepts: what OOP is, why we use it, and how it compares to other programming paradigms. Then, you'll explore the four key principles of OOP—encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—through engaging real-world examples.\nBut we won’t stop at theory. You'll dive into the Evergreen OOP Template—a reusable Python project structure that you can adapt to almost any application. You’ll gain a deep understanding of this template, then learn how to modify and apply it in practical situations.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll not only be able to write clean, modular, and scalable Python code—you’ll also think about software in a new way. You’ll understand how to design programs like a pro, how to reuse code efficiently, and how to build projects that grow with you.\nIf you skip this course, you'll miss out on the opportunity to write professional-grade code, understand how large-scale systems are built, and move beyond basic Python syntax.

But for all these advanced course , this \"Python For Data Science\" course  will be the basement for it.\n\n\n\" 9 main reasons to Learn Python !!! \"\n1. Python’s popularity\nWhen compared to all other programming language, python is extremely simple, easy to learn, interpret and implement. Due to this reason it became very popular and trending programming right now.\n\n\n2. High salary\nThe job demand for python programmers are high. Python engineers have some of the highest salaries in the industry.\nThe average Python developer salary in the US is $110,021 and $123,743 per year according to the survey conducted by Gooroo and Indeed respectively\n\n\n3. Python is used in Data Science\nThere are plenty of Python scientific packages for data visualization, machine learning, natural language processing, complex data analysis and more. All of these factors make Python a great tool for scientific computing and a solid alternative for commercial packages such as MatLab. The most popular libraries and tools for data science are Pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, scikit-learn, Mlpy, NetworkX, Theano, SymPy and TensorFlow\n\n\n4. Python is used in Automation\nIT industries are now moving towards Artificial Intelligence in Automation. So Python with Robot framework combination is the best alternative for Selenium Webdriver with Java as it is easier road map with no programming background.\n\n\n5. Python used with Big Data\nPydoop is a Python interface to Hadoop that allows you to write a MapReduce program in Python and process data present in the HDFS cluster.\nIts features such as a rich HDFS API; a MapReduce API that allows to write pure Python record readers / writers, partitioners and combiners, transparent Avro (de)serialization, and easy installation-free usage.\n\n\n6. Chat Bots\nA chat bot is an artificial intelligence-powered piece of software in a device (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant etc), application, website or other networks that try to gauge consumer’s needs and then assist them to perform a particular task like a commercial transaction, hotel booking, form submission etc.\nNLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) library is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.\n\n\n7. Python in Web Development\nPython has a wide range of frameworks for developing websites. The most popular frameworks are Django, Flask, Web2Py, Turbo Gears, etc. These frameworks are written in Python, so it’s easier to implement and use it for web development.\n\n\n8. Computer Graphics in Python\nPython is largely used to build GUI and desktop applications. The Python Computer Graphics Kit is a generic 3D package that can be useful in any domain where you have to deal with 3D data of any kind, be it for visualization, creating photorealistic images, Virtual Reality or even games\n\n\n9. Game Developer\nPython libraries such as PyGame, Pyglet , PyOpenGL etc. are used to develop 2D, 3D games with easy coding.

This course, Python AsyncIO: Complete Guide to Asynchronous Programming, will walk you through everything you need to know to confidently write efficient, non-blocking Python code — even if you’re new to async programming.\nWe’ll start with the fundamentals of AsyncIO: what it is, why it exists, and how it differs from traditional synchronous code. You’ll learn how the event loop works behind the scenes, and how coroutines, tasks, and async/await syntax fit together to let you write programs that can handle thousands of operations without slowing down.\nTo make these concepts easy to grasp, the course uses clear visual animations that show exactly what happens as your code runs. We’ll explore common mistakes beginners make with await, how to fix them, and how to decide whether AsyncIO, threading, or multiprocessing is the right tool for your use case.\nFinally, we’ll put it all into practice by converting a real-world synchronous Python script into a fully asynchronous version using libraries like asyncio and httpx. You’ll see the performance improvements in action and gain practical skills to apply AsyncIO in your own projects.\nBy the end of this section, you’ll have the knowledge and confidence to write faster, more scalable Python programs using AsyncIO.",

Also, all the concepts learned in this course are applicable in other languages as well.\n\nAbout myself\nI wrote my first line of code 10 years ago when I was in highschool. I quickly got addicted by how easy you could build useful programs using C# and Windows Forms.\n\nI followed the Computer Science University track where I managed to set the ground knowledge for anything related to Software Engineering (Algorithms, Data Structures, Operating Systems, Multithreading, Distributed Computing, Networking, and many other topics), and I finalized this amazing 6-year learning path by getting a Master's Degree in Parallel and Distributed Systems where I built from the ground a custom Kubernetes Gang Scheduler optimised for running Spark Jobs.\n\nCurrently, I'm a Software Engineer focused on high-scale JVM-based development. I build code used by millions of people around the world.\n\n\nWhy I built this course?\nI learned Java from the Internet, trying to build projects, hitting all kinds of issues, searching on StackOverflow (and sometimes asking lots of questions), I wish I would follow an introductory course on that would guide me through those new concepts, instead of trying and failing so many times.\n\nFor that reason, I thought that building a course where I explain the basic concepts of this language, would definitely help other people to save time and avoid going into the same pitfalls that I went through.\n\n\nWhat is the content course?\nThis course is split into multiple chapters, each one exposing a different functionality of this language:\nChapter 1 - Introduction\nIn this chapter we're going to learn why we need programming and what is the role of a programming language in general\nChapter 2 - Java Installation\nWe're going to learn about Java versions, the difference between JDK and JRE\nAnd most importantly, we're going to see how can we install a JDK from official sources\nChapter 3 - First Steps into the Java Programming\nIn this chapter we're going to create our first Java application in IntelliJ Idea and we're going to understand the syntax and structure of the simplest Java program\nChapter 4 - Working with Data in Java\nAny software application needs data in order to do something meaningful for us\nIn this chapter, we're going to see how Java allows us to store and update the information in our programs\nWe're going to learn about data types, operations on text and math functions\nChapter 5 - Working with Control Flow Instructions in Java\nOn the same idea as above, to build some useful applications, we need to add decisioning logic into them.\nWith control flow instructions, we can do that in a very easy way. This is the main focus on this chapter.\nWhat are the requirements for this course?\nA computer with medium specs (we only need to install IntelliJ Idea Community Edition)\nWillingness to learn and an open-mind\nThank you for taking the time to look through this description and I'm looking forward to see you in the first lecture!\nCover Photo by Joshua Aragon on Unsplash",

      "description": "Python is incredibly easy to learn and use for beginners and newcomers in the industry. The language is the most accessible among all the programming languages available because it has simplified syntax that is not complicated at all and gives more emphasis on natural language. Python is quite popular due to its hundreds of different libraries and frameworks that can be used by developers. The Python language is flexible enough to provide developers with ample time to try new experiments. Python experts will not just stop at the usual things, instead, they will try to build new processes, technologies, or applications. This language is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.\nIn the world of programming, Python is known as one of the most popular and fastest-growing programming languages. It can be defined as a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented scripting language, and a general-purpose language. There are various programming languages in the modern IT market space, but only Python has become quite widespread. The syntax in Python, when compared to C++ or Java, allows programmers to do coding in fewer steps. Bigger organizations use it widely because of its multiple programming paradigms. Most developers describe Python as a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. Specialists who are working in different areas of disciplines such as Finance, Insurance use Python for improving performance with the help of automation. Automating all the boring and repetitive activities such as viewing, copying, renaming, uploading files to a server, and downloading websites or parsing data can be done with the help of Python.",

In this FREE course, I hope to give a glimpse into my teaching style and help you begin your journey to mastering Python and computer science!",

Note that no code snippets are included in these explanations, but they provide thorough insights into each topic.\nQuestion 1: Basics of Java Programming\nWhich of the following data types is used to store a sequence of characters in Java?\nint\nfloat\nchar\nString\nExplanation: In Java, the String data type is used to store a sequence of characters. Unlike the primitive char type, which stores a single character, String is a reference type that can hold multiple characters, forming a string of text. The String class provides numerous methods for string manipulation, such as length(), substring(), and indexOf(), making it a powerful tool for handling text data.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts\nWhat is the primary purpose of inheritance in Java?\nTo allow multiple classes to share the same method names\nTo enable a class to acquire properties and methods of another class\nTo create private members in a class\nTo facilitate method overloading\nExplanation: The primary purpose of inheritance in Java is to enable a class (known as the subclass or derived class) to acquire properties and methods from another class (known as the superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, allowing for the creation of more specialized subclasses that extend the functionality of the base class. Inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword, and it supports polymorphism, enabling dynamic method dispatch.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Exception Handling and Error Management\nWhich block is always executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not?\ntry\ncatch\nfinally\nthrow\nExplanation: The finally block in Java is always executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not within the associated try block. This makes it ideal for resource cleanup activities, such as closing file streams or releasing database connections, ensuring that these operations are performed even if an exception occurs. The finally block provides a mechanism to perform necessary cleanup actions that must be executed under all circumstances.\n\n\nQuestion 4: Java Collections Framework\nWhich class is part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store key-value pairs?\nArrayList\nHashSet\nHashMap\nLinkedList\nExplanation: The HashMap class in the Java Collections Framework is used to store key-value pairs. It implements the Map interface and provides efficient methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements based on their keys. HashMap is widely used for implementing associative arrays and dictionaries due to its constant-time performance for basic operations. It allows for null keys and values and provides methods like put(), get(), and remove() to manage key-value pairs effectively.\n\n\nQuestion 5: Multithreading and Concurrency\nWhat is a potential issue when multiple threads try to access shared resources simultaneously?\nDeadlock\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\nAbstraction\nExplanation: When multiple threads try to access shared resources simultaneously without proper synchronization, it can lead to a potential issue known as a deadlock. Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource. To avoid deadlocks, it is essential to use synchronization mechanisms such as synchronized blocks or methods, and to follow best practices like acquiring locks in a consistent order and using timeout-based locking strategies.\n\n\nQuestion 6: Advanced Java Concepts\nWhich feature in Java enables the use of functional programming by allowing the passing of behavior as parameters to methods?\nAnnotations\nGenerics\nLambda Expressions\nReflection\nExplanation: Lambda expressions in Java enable the use of functional programming by allowing the passing of behavior as parameters to methods. Introduced in Java 8, lambda expressions provide a clear and concise way to represent instances of functional interfaces, making it easier to express instances where a function is required. They allow for writing more readable and maintainable code by reducing boilerplate, and they are especially useful in scenarios involving collection processing and concurrent programming.\n\n\nEnroll now in our Java Interview Questions and Practice Tests course and take the first step towards mastering Java programming and acing your next job interview.

This is geared toward the users who are overwhelmed with other python courses trying to cover too much material without first having a solid grasp of core concepts. This course covers basic input, output, and processes. Give you lots of examples and pushes you to complete the project to fully grasp the topics.\nExamples for input include how to capture input from users, how to define data types of user input, and how to assign variables. For the output portion, we will be covering basic output such as print commands, but also the formatting print commands to make the output more meaningful. We will cover the basic processes using common math functions. We will put all of it together with several projects to ensure understanding. We also cover two additional areas conditional statements such as if-statements and error handling through try-except blocks. I keep things really simple so that learners who may feel overwhelmed can take this course and get the basics done without being overwhelmed.\n\n\nThe big takeaway from this course is taking a learner who has very no experience and taking them from knowing nothing and taking them to understand basics inputs, processes, and outputs. Each learner will have several projects that re-enforce your understanding of core concepts.\nKeep in mind this is a free course, and I am limited by Udemy guidelines.",

C# is syntactically similar to Java and is straightforward for users who are familiar with C, C++, or Java.\nWhy C# ?\nC# is common and popular for many other reasons. Few of the following reasons are given:\n· Easy to start: C# is a high-level language so it is closer to other popular programming languages like C, C++, and Java and thus becomes easy to learn for anyone.\n· Widely used for developing desktop and web applications: C# is widely used for developing desktop and web applications. It is one of the most regularly used technical desktop languages. If you want to build Microsoft applications, C# is the way to go.\n· Group: The bigger the community, the more it can build tools and applications. Since C# has a wide population, developments are made to ensure that it remains in the system and does not become extinct.\n· Game Development: C# is commonly used in game development and will continue to dominate. Since C# integrates with Microsoft, it has a wide target audience. C# features such as Automatic Garbage Collection, interfaces, object-oriented programming, and so on make it a common game development language.\nBeginning with C# programming:-\nFinding a Compiler: There are some online IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, GeeksforGeeks, CodeChef, and others, that can be used to run C# programmes without installing anything.\nWindows: Since the C# is developed within .Net framework initiative by Microsoft, it provide various IDEs to run C# programs: Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio Express, Visual Web Developer\nLinux: Mono can be used to run C# programs on Linux.\n\n\nHelp and inspiration?\nNot only do you get a load of practical, useful starting projects in this course, you can also head over to c# more and more examples inspiration, and tips for Programming on the Desktop & Web Application.\nThere’s no better time to learn C#: You made an excellent decision because C# is the most commonly used programming language. This is not hyperbole. Because of its success and development, there are more jobs and opportunities than ever before.\nGet access to fast support if you get stuck: Nothing is more frustrating than being stuck ten hours into a course and not receiving the assistance you need to proceed. Being lost is an inevitable part of the learning process.

Instead of having to deal with an entirely new set of tools in the form of classes, you can use all the same familiar collections and arrays with existing classes. This means that you can take full advantage of LINQ queries with minimal or no modifications to existing code. LINQ is Language-Integrated Query. The data source can be an object (implements the IEnuberable interface, which are standard collections, arrays), an XML document, and a DBSet data set.However, regardless of the data source, LINQ implements the same approach for fetching from that data. In addition, there are many varieties of LINQ:\nLINQ to Objects: Used to work with arrays and collections\nLINQ to Entities: Used when accessing databases through Entity Framework technology\nLINQ to SQL: Data Access Technology in MS SQL Server\nLINQ to XML: Used when working with XML files\nLINQ to DataSet: Used when working with a DataSet object\nParallel LINQ (PLINQ): Used to execute parallel queries\nIn this videos, I want to talk first of all about the first LINQ language varieties.\nThis course contains videos:\nIntroduction\nHow LINQ works\nSorting in LINQ\nFiltering in LINQ\nUnion, Intersection and Difference of Collections in LINQ\nSkip and Take Methods in LINQ\nGrouping in LINQ\nJoin method in LINQ\nConclusion",

      "description": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes as the fundamental building blocks for creating software. Objects are instances of classes, which define the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) that the objects can have. OOP aims to model real-world entities and relationships in a way that is both intuitive and scalable. By encapsulating data and functions together within objects, OOP promotes modularity and code reuse, making it easier to develop, maintain, and extend complex software systems.\nOne of the core principles of OOP is encapsulation, which involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. This concept helps to protect the internal state of the object from outside interference and misuse, allowing changes to be made internally without affecting other parts of the program. Encapsulation is crucial for achieving data hiding and abstraction, enabling developers to focus on the high-level design of their programs without needing to worry about the intricate details of implementation.\nAnother key principle of OOP is inheritance, which allows new classes to be created based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and methods. This promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships, where derived classes can extend or modify the behavior of their parent classes. Polymorphism is another important concept in OOP, enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. This allows for flexibility and the ability to define methods in a way that can operate on objects of different classes, as long as they share a common interface.\nLastly, abstraction is a principle that simplifies complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential characteristics, rather than the specific details. This allows developers to work with higher-level concepts and reduce complexity. Abstraction in OOP is often achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define the structure and behavior that derived classes must implement. Overall, OOP provides a robust framework for developing software that is modular, reusable, and maintainable, reflecting the structure and behavior of real-world entities and relationships.",

If you've ever opened a JPEG, listened to an MP3, watched a MPEG video, or used voice recognition of Alexa or the Shazam app, you've used some variant of the DFT. Its efficient implementation, the Fast Fourier Transform, is considered one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century by the American Institute of Physics and the IEEE Computer Society. Fortunately, the math is very accessible and only involves basic complex numbers and basic trigonometry.\nThis course is a very basic introduction to the Discrete Fourier Transform. We will focus on understanding the math behind the formula and use Python to do some simple applications of the DFT and fully appreciate its utility. . The Python code we are writing is, however, very minimal.

Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today. A survey conducted by industry analyst firm RedMonk found that it was the second-most popular programming language among developers in 2021. Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances. In this course you will master the python basics. So i will start from setting up the environment that you need to run python then i will teach you how you can do coding in python. Python is very easy to learn and an awesome programming language. With this course you will learn practical python programming from scratch.“Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,” says University of Michigan and Coursera instructor Charles R Severance in his book Python for Everybody. “You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem.” So all of the lectures of this course contain hands on practical example without neglecting basics.

      "description": "This is the perfect weekend project for Python beginners looking to create their first Twitter bot!\n\n\nWhat is this course?\nThis course is for python beginners and twitter lovers who are interested in learning how to build a Twitter bot.\nWhile I have found it helpful to read textbooks and watch online tutorials to get a better understanding of the basics for any subject, nothing beats project-based learning. Actually getting your hands dirty and running into real problems that require specific solutions has been my ideal way to learn something new.\nWith that being said, the hardest question typically is, what project should I focus on? From my personal experience, I’ve found it beneficial to focus on something you are passionate about. To find that something, just think of what you frequently pay attention to in your spare time, when no one is paying you...to pay attention to it. For me that is Twitter.\nWe are going with a bot because it will be a fun project to group together various ideas we want to learn, such as APIs, python, and Twitter.\n\n\nPower of python\nI’ve been hooked on it ever since I took the class Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. It is undoubtedly a popular programming language so I think it will be beneficial for many years to come.\nThis class is not meant to be an introduction to programming or python, so my assumption is that you understand some basics. This class is geared more towards helping you apply Python programming to an actual project to help you better retain information while having fun within the process.\n\n\nPower of Twitter\nI must admit. I am addicted to Twitter. Now before you scorn me, understand that I think it is truly a magical place. One of my favorite Twitter follows, Nikhil Krishnan, has a great presentation about Why Twitter is Dope. In it he basically highlights these reasons which I think get at the root of why I love Twitter so much.\nYou get to discover people with mutual interests. This can include any age!\nMaking friends is geo agnostic. You can connect with people all over the world at anytime.\nYou can also access the smartest people in the world. I get to follow Elon Musk!\nTwitter is the idea marketplace at it’s finest. If you are wrong, you will quickly learn why that is.\nYou get to follow people and not brands. People are brands essentially but atleast its more authentic.\nIt’s quality over quantity. A few good tweets is infinitely better than a million double taps.\nIt’s a conversation with an incredibly tight feedback loop.\n\n\nPower of APIs\nAPIs are how software talks with other software. We can use APIs to build apps that add new services on top of the platforms or data from the platforms. This essentially provides a new experience for users via a layer of abstraction.\nKate Bae says APIs are “how to unleash data in new ways.” For our purposes, that means creating a bot that retweets an accounts likes. Most platforms, like Slack and Shopify, have public APIs with the hopes that devs build on them to build more value and create lock in.\nBasically all of the major social media networks have APIs. They control them in different ways and prevent you from doing certain things while at the same time encouraging you to do other things to make a good user experience with the already public data. We will be using Twitters API for this project. You may not realize it but every time you use your phone, you’re using an API.\n\n\nWhat You'll Learn\nAfter you make it through the entirety of the course, you will walk away knowing how to do the following:\nSetting up a virtual environment for your code\nSigning up as a Twitter developer\nHow to Use Tweepy to call the Twitter API\nBuilding a Bot that Retweets our Likes\nDeploying a Bot using either AWS or Render\nPlease note this course requires MacOS. I do not have in-depth installation and setup instructions for Windows users.",

Racket is a mature LGPL project that’s actively developed and maintained. Racket’s crown jewel is its macro system, which lets you freely extend the language. Racket consists of extensive standard library that gets your projects off the ground quickly. Racket runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Develop on one; deploy to all three.\n\nRacket (formerly PLT Scheme) is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation.The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.\nRacket's core language includes macros, modules, lexical closures, tail calls, delimited continuations, parameters (fluid variables), software contracts, green and OS threads, and more. The language also comes with primitives, such as eventspaces and custodians, which control resource management and enables the language to act like an operating system for loading and managing other programs. Further extensions to the language are created with the powerful macro system, which together with the module system and custom parsers can control all aspects of a language. Unlike programming languages that lack macro systems, most language constructs in Racket are written on top of the base language using macros. These include a mixin class system, a component (or module) system as expressive as ML's, and pattern matching.\nThe feature that distinguishes Racket from other languages in the Lisp family is its integrated language extensibility. Racket's extensibility features are built into the module system to allow context-sensitive and module-level control over syntax\nIn this course we use DrRacket IDE , which is a graphical environment for developing programs using the Racket programming languages. DrRacket (formerly DrScheme) is widely used among introductory Computer Science courses that teach Scheme or Racket and is lauded for its simplicity and appeal to beginner programmers. The IDE was originally built for use with the TeachScheme! project (now ProgramByDesign), an outreach effort by Northeastern University and a number of affiliated universities for attracting high school students to computer science courses at the college level. It is the fastest way to get a sense of what the language and system feels like, even if you eventually use Racket with Emacs, vi, or some other editor.\nCurious why Functional Programming is on the Rise? Do you wish there was a better option than JavaScript? Would you like to learn Elm or Functional Programming in general, but short on time?\nIf you answered yes, then this course is for you.\nElm is very approachable, and is the best language to learn functional programming.\nElm is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript and runs in the browser. It is designed to be fun and friendly to use. Indeed, Elm upends the notion that functional programming is only accessible to mad scientists and academics. With its clean and readable syntax, world-class tooling, and friendly compiler, Elm is truly a delightful language.\nThe Elm Architecture helps you create complex, modular web apps with code that stays easy to maintain as you add features. Toss in great performance, no runtime exceptions, and JavaScript interop, and you've got a super-charged way to produce reliable, scalable, and maintainable web apps!\nBut what we love most about Elm is that you can actually build practical stuff with it quickly, which is exactly what we do in this course.\nElm compiles to JavaScript, so trying out Elm is easy. Convert a small part of your app to Elm and embed it in JS. No full rewrites, no huge time investment.\nUnlike hand-written JavaScript, Elm code does not produce runtime exceptions in practice. Instead, Elm uses type inference to detect problems during compilation and give friendly hints. This way problems never make it to your users. There are several examples where companies are running applications on thousands of lines of Elm, and even after more than a year in production, it still has not produced a single runtime exception anywhere.\nElm has its own virtual DOM implementation, designed for simplicity and speed. All values are immutable in Elm, and the benchmarks show that this helps us generate particularly fast JavaScript code.\nAs Elm compiles to JavaScript, you can really use it to build very complicated single page applications. Eventually it’s possible to interface with other JavaScript code when necessary.  With Elm, cost savings are enormous. Elm component architecture allows problems to be solved encapsulated. No more side-effects. No more pages and page scripts. No more untraceable bugs because of changing pages.\nWhy should you consider using Elm?\nElm offers many benefits over JavaScript, which you’ll see in this course.\nBenefits such as:\n- Zero Runtime Exceptions\n- Simplified Debugging\n- Easy Refactoring\n- Helpful Type System & Compiler\n- Improved Productivity\n- Inherently testable code\n- Enforced Semantic Versioning\n- and many more...\nCan we ask a favor? Lot of efforts have gone into creating this course, and new videos would be continuously added. We would be very grateful if you would help spread the word about this course. Thanks!",

This course is created in a beginner friendly style, so that anyone can start learning Java, even if he/she doesn't have any prior coding experience. Never you will face any dull moment in this course. And finally we all must accept that coding is something that can be mastered only by practice. For this I have provided a practice resource at the last lecture of the last section. So, enjoy this journey of coding. In case you find any difficulty understanding the topics, you can contact me on Udemy, or send an email to my personal email id, or you can call me.\nMany of the online courses that are present on the internet are created by big educational firms for getting revenue. They have huge PR individuals, course creators and promoters that have to be paid. This is why the courses are priced so high. But we must understand that not every student is fortunate enough to be able to enroll to these expensive courses. Knowledge is something that should be free. This course is created for this purpose only. Though this is a paid course but the price is kept at a very minimal. Another problem that I have tried to address is that students must have a job ready approach while taking the course. So, most of the practice  problems are taken from job hackathons and tech challenges. I hope you will appreciate my efforts. Thank you.",

For now, it's one of the coolest data models that developers use to work with app databases. And I want also to say that in practice GraphQL is more useful that RESTful API. The reason for that - is that when you build requests for GraphQL you type all fields that you want to get in requests and also you make requests only to the one entry point. If you want to learn more about how it works - I recommend checking my course?\nSo what are we gonna learn in this course? Here are some main these of the course:\nHow to build GraphQL requests\nHow to save data in the database by using GraphQL\nHow to work with MongoDB and GraphQL\nBuild a js-app that will make all requests to the GraphQL server\nThat's not all that are we gonna do in this course?

Together we will use the basics of programming and build the classic guessing game \"Hangman\" for the terminal - from scratch of course.\nAt the end of my latest programming course \"Learn Programming in Go (golang): A Rich Guide for Beginners\" I suggest my students to start using Google's programming language Go just by creating a simple \"Hangman\" game for the terminal. With this simple project I redeem the promise to myself to show you how easy it is to start coding with Go.\nThis project doesn't even have to show off with \"fancy\" features like to extensive use of slices, concurrency or complex structs that Go has to offer. Rather, I want to show how Google's programming language can be used to achieve respectable results in the shortest possible time.\nThe fun of \"ease of programming\" is in the foreground here! So enjoy it, it's free!\n\n\nWhy did Google develop a new programming language?\nIn Google's words, \"Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Programming had become too difficult and the choice of languages was partly to blame. One had to choose either\nefficient compilation,\nefficient execution, or\nease of programming;\nall three were not available in the same mainstream language. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent, Java. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing.\nFinally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.\"\nIn my humble opinion, Go is the best programming language you can learn today. I've worked with a few programming languages since I was introduced to programming through BASIC in the mid-80s, and Go is by far the best-designed language I've ever used.\nNow start your computer and let's have some fun coding \"Hangman\"!",

All you need is a device with an IDE or platform suitable for Python programming downloaded and your attention.\nI will guide you through this project, show you the basic structure of the programs, and show you how to create a simple version of the game in a step-by-step tutorial. However, this is also a very flexible and customizable project — you can choose to make it as simple or complex as you'd like, add as many levels as you'd like, choose the theme, and customize it in many different ways. This is one of the things I love about this project — everyone can easily customize it to make it their own unique project, but it is still easy to follow.\nAnother advantage of this specific project is that not only is it perfect for beginners, but also programmers of all skill levels can have fun with it, as they can add their own complex touches to it.",

      "description": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an intelligent optimization algorithm based on the Swarm Intelligence. It is based on a simple mathematical model, developed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995, to describe the social behavior of birds and fish. The model relies mostly on the basic principles of self-organization which is used to describe the dynamics of complex systems. PSO utilizes a very simplified model of social behavior to solve the optimization problems, in a cooperative and intelligent framework. PSO is one of the most useful and famous metaheuristics and it is successfully applied to various optimization problems.\nIn this video tutorial, implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in MATLAB is discussed in detail. In the first part, theoretical foundations of PSO is briefly reviewed. Next, PSO is implemented line-by-line and from scratch, and every line of code is described in detail. The instructor of this course is Dr. S. Mostapha Kalami Heris, Control and Systems Engineering PhD and member of Yarpiz Team.\nAfter watching this video tutorial, you will be able to know what is PSO, and how it works, and how you can use it to solve your own optimization problems. Also, you will learn how to implement PSO in MATLAB programming language. If you are familiar with other programming languages, it is easy to translate the MATLAB code and rewrite the PSO code in those languages.",

It is now an implementation of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), though it originally arose as a sibling, both being influenced by HyperTalk.\nActionScript is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash Player platform, used on Web pages in the form of embedded SWF files.\nActionScript started as an object-oriented programming language for Macromedia's Flash authoring tool, later developed by Adobe Systems as Adobe Flash. The first three versions of the Flash authoring tool provided limited interactivity features. Early Flash developers could attach a simple command, called an \"action\", to a button or a frame. The set of actions was basic navigation controls, with commands such as \"play\", \"stop\", \"getURL\", and \"gotoAndPlay\". It enables interactivity, data handling, and much more in Flash, Flex, and AIR content and applications. ActionScript executes in the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM), which is part of Flash Player and AIR.\nToday, ActionScript is suitable for desktop and mobile development through Adobe AIR, use in some database applications, and in basic robotics, as with the Make Controller Kit. Flash libraries can be used with the XML capabilities of the browser to render rich content in the browser. This technology is known as Asynchronous Flash and XML, much like AJAX. Adobe offers its Flex product line to meet the demand for rich web applications built on the Flash runtime, with behaviors and programming done in ActionScript.",
