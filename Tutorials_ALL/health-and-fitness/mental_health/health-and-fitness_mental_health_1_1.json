Easily absorbable, excellent content. \" --L. Smith, CYP Counsellor\nMyself and my daughter have ADHD. Highly recommended! I do think that this content should be implemented within parliamentary scenario to help understand many issues of youth today.\" --Mum of an ADHD son\n\n\nIntroduction\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a medical condition that is on the increase in civilised societies today. The strain of maintaining focus and the struggle to sit still makes this condition a real challenge, not only to the person who has it, but also to parents, carers and teachers as well as employers, friends and other family members.\nAnxious ADHD is a type of ADHD that has all the symptoms of the classic ADHD (inattentive, disorganised, distractible, restless, hyperactive and impulsive) in conjunction with many other symptoms of high anxiety (tension, nervousness and predicting the worst) and other physical stress symptoms such as gastrointestinal symptoms and headaches. This type of ADHD may or may not be hyperactive.\nIronically, the harder those with ADHD and anxious ADHD try to concentrate, the worst things can become. This is because as the person tries to focus, the regions of the brain involved with concentration, focus and followthrough actually shut down, instead of turn on.\nThe good news is that ADHD and its anxious symptoms can be effectively treated. Happily, effective treatment does not change the personality of the person with ADHD; it simply removes the barriers that are hindering them from accessing their unique talents and abilities.\nUnfortunately, however, less than half of those with ADHD are being treated while many remained undiagnosed. If left untreated or ineffectively treated, ADHD can become a serious societal problem.\nIn the last two and a half years, I have met and spoken to over 13,000 people in a variety of conference and workshop settings, including for educational institutions, non-for-profit groups, private organisations and the general public.\nMeeting with attendees from all walks of life have led me to realise how common and widespread ADHD and anxious ADHD is today. My own research on the subject has also given me many reasons to believe that much can be done to help bring more understanding to people with ADHD, as well as their parents and caregivers. Indeed, not only understanding, but effective treatment to help manage the condition.\nYou are the inspiration for this workshop. Among the insights into the condition, you will find ideas and recommendations to help transform anxiety in ADHD.\nMy hope is that you find the contents of this event both helpful and life changing.\nYours sincerely,\nWale Oladipo\nLead Trainer & Director, MindBody Breakthrough",

The course is designed to show learners how to apply psychological wisdom to their own real-life scenarios.

The curriculum is designed to equip learners with actionable strategies to facilitate their personal growth journey and achieve optimal mental wellness.\n\n\nSome of the key concepts covered in this course include:\n-  Understanding the cognitive processes that underpin perception & decision making\n-  The relationship between self-knowledge, self-identification, and mental wellbeing\n-  How to restructure cognitive distortions to cultivate a more positive outlook on life\n-  The role of maturation and responsibility in enabling personal growth and resilience\n-  Setting personal & professional goals while overcoming various cognitive barriers\n-  Practical approaches to modify behaviors that aid well-being and personal growth\n-  Disciplines for building resilience and coping with negative experiences or challenges\n-  Developing and leveraging emotional intelligence in your interpersonal relationships\n-  Understanding the cognitive processes that underpin perception and decision making\n-  Applying cognitive-behavioral strategies to alter and replace negative thinking habits\n\n\nCompleting this CBT Practitioner training will provide you with knowledge and insights that can be applied to your personal life, professional career, or used to support others in their journey towards mental wellness.

They will learn how to move beyond merely agreeing or disagreeing with theory, and instead reflect upon it to evaluate the value of its presence in the history of the field.\nThe wisdom, skills and knowledge you'll gain through this training are not just theoretical – they are practical and applicable to the real-life situations you'll encounter day-to-day. Throughout this training you will naturally develop a deeper knowledge of yourself, and consequentially increase your ability to build strong relationships, overcome career life and daily struggles.\nAll of our training materials are in HD video, accompanied by an MP3 version of the course, and supplemented with PDF resources to enhance your learning experience.

They don't address the root cause of depression.\nQi Gong for Depression empowers you to address the root of your problems. Through deep breathing, gentle stretches, and flowing movements, master teacher Lee Holden teaches students how to transform depression into inspiration and inner peace - without taking harmful medications.\nYou will learn\n• A practical, straightforward qi gong routine to release stress, malaise, and \"the blues\" so you can free yourself from negative thoughts and feelings of self-blame for good.\n• To activate your life-force energy (qi) for emotional balance and reconnect to your inner fire, which rekindles your motivation to get things done.\n• To stop the \"negative thought spiral\" with natural, easy-to-follow, meditative movements so you can connect with the people you love.\n• How to calm your body so you can get a good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed with abundant energy throughout your day.\n\n\nQigong Master Lee Holden studied with Master Mantak Chia, worked on staff with Deepak Chopra, and later attended Five Branches University in Santa Cruz earning a degree as doctor of Chinese medicine, and is now owner of the Santa Cruz Chi Institute.\nExecutive Producer: Lee Holden, Ben Cox\nDirector: Daniel Todd Villegas\nEditor: Daniel Todd Villegas\nVideography: Teresa Chu\nDVD Authoring/Streaming: Ocean Silver\nMusic: Dean Evenson\nPackage Design: Axie Breen\nPhotos: Daniel Todd Villegas\n2020 Lee Holden\nMany more streaming titles available from the YMAA website.

Chinese medicine alone offers over 2000 years of field testing in the treatment and understanding of depression, anxiety and stress.\nThis course has been designed to gently guide you through a step-by-step process to help clear your depression, layer by layer.\nWhat makes this approach unique is that we acknowledge and work with the 3 dimensions of the human being.\nWe understand that -\nDEPRESSION IS NOT JUST A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE IN THE BRAIN\nThere is more to it than that.\nIt is occurring on the subtle realms of \"Qi\" or life force energy. Depression and stress is strongly associated with the health and flow of one's \"Qi\". When the \"Qi\" in the body and mind is stressed or stagnated for extended periods, it manifests as depression, anxiety and eventually physical disease.\n\n\nWhen we address and smooth out the flow of this Qi, depression and anxiety tends to dissolve, naturally. This is what this course is about.\nThis \"Qi\" that we all have, operates and helps to govern the 3 level of the human being.\n1. The physical body\n2. The mental / emotional body\n3. The spiritual body\nIn this course, we approach all 3 layers, one by one clearing and cleaning up the Qi as we go.  This course offers a refreshing, unique and effective approach to treating depression.   Reviews & Testimonials:\n\n\n\"Clear, easy to understand, great lectures in small chunks. Thank you very much. Great value for money!\"\n- Max Kitching\n“Top notch course! I am extremely happy with the results. I can totally see the difference in just a few days! It’s awesome.”\n~ Cynthia B\n\n\nIf you're ready to consider a new way to approach it, then this is the course for you.\nResults from taking this course can vary and are largely dependent on the individual and the depth of their depression.\nHowever, if you were to follow the instructions, it is possible to clear your (mild to moderate depression) depression naturally, and keep it off, within 3 months!\n\n\nBy the end of the course you will:\n- Feel physically fitter and stronger\n- Be able to breathe with greater ease\n- Sleep more easily\n- Have a greater sense of purpose and direction in life\n- Feel smarter and more intellectually stimulated\n- And much more!\nThis course is not just about treatment, but also maintaining and managing ones ongoing psychological state so that you are better equipped to deal with any future feelings of depression.\n\n\n*Medical Disclaimer: The information in this course is not intended to replace advice from your medical doctor.",

      "description": "Life Coaching’s popularity has been and continues to be on the rise. The world is in need of Highly effective Coaches. If you could choose the best of the best modalities which one would it be? NLP? CBT? EFT? RBT? DBT? Some traditional SMART or TIGER Life Coach? All of these and others do wonderful things. Selecting these as your Method of helping if performed properly can help potential clients. Truth is these have helped many people including the instructor of ACT Complete Life Coaching Certificate Advance to Expert course. However after using NLP, CBT and most these listed above none of them completely did what was expected. We expect sustainable lasting results. Not temporary, topic related fixes. People want to understand their mind, how to resolve their most pressing issues and…HOW TO DEAL WITH UNKNOWN or FUTURE issues ON THEIR OWN, Without, the aid of more Life Coaching.\nACT is the most effective, best of the best, better than the rest modality. Help your clients get what they want in life faster with more enriching and satisfying experiences. Help them & teach them How to get there more efficiently with the greatest in sustainability possible. ACT is a ACTion based modality. It requires effort. And it is a top to bottom and a bottom to top complete mind mastery Discipline.\nLife teaches us to set unknowing Emotional Goals mostly done subconsciously witnessed by our behavior. Most modalities help us set realistic goals based on action. And when we feel certain ways that keep us from doing what is needed to help us achieve the steps required to ultimately hit our goals, most modalities teach us coping or reprogramming techniques to help us mitigate the pain that delay or stop our progress. These Emotional Control Strategies work but not as well as we’d like because they are temporary fixes. So the next time you need help you call your Life coach. ACT is a next level up type of modality. ACT is a more permanent mind mastery method. Imagine the business you’ll get from word of mouth by helping your client become a mind master sustainably inter-independent with the ability to resolve challenges and thrive in life. That’s Empowerment Maximus! ACT gives that power to you as a Life Coach to give to your clients.\nAll modalities are helpful, some more than others. It depends on each individual. Honestly it comes down to willingness. If you are willing to change and apply a modality you will get results. Some results are better than others. This is where ACT separates itself from the others. ACT is different in the areas of Feelings and Emotions. This two areas of our life represent the foundation of our human experience. Emotions and Feelings are like accelerators and brakes. Thinking and thoughts are like roads and maps. Humans are like vehicles moving towards or away what we want or don’t want. NLP, CBT and the traditional Life Coaching frameworks are super at focusing on the roads and maps of your life. However, they are somewhat dismissive and disingenuous with feelings and emotions. They don’t pay the needed attention to the vehicle and its engine of life. Experience, Emotions, Feelings, Thoughts, Thinking methods, sensations, impulses, urges and memories. These all make up the vehicle. Most modalities focus on thinking and thoughts to create feelings. So this is where these modalities focus their intervention and change work. However, Feelings also creates thinking and thoughts and this is where ACT jumps in with both feet. In fact ACT does both. It is a Thinking and Feeling modification strategy system. ACT enables you to become fully empowered. ACT frees you from the hiccups of growth. Often leading to relapse that sends you to additional therapy and coaching. ACT taps into the raw levels of motivation… “your emotions”. With a sound thinking strategy and well-tuned emotions, the speed of moving from “A” to “B” in life increases with richness and experiential depth that other modalities do not provide.\nUse this evidence based modality by itself or with other modalities and get what you want in life faster and with the greatest of sustainability possible.\nInside  ACT Complete Life Coaching Certificate Advance to Expert you will learn:\nDetails of ACT Frameworks called the Hexaflex, the Triflex.\nWhat, How & Why of each point of each Framework\nAll things to consider, Niches, Style, Legal Issues, Sessions V Packages, Business Model & choices\nBefore, during and after session. Preparation, Notes, Followup\nDemonstration, Coach Rachel, Client Eddie Step by Step.\nFirst three sessions demonstration and breakdown\nParaphrasing, reframing, questioning techniques\nDozens of Defusion, Values, Acceptance techniques\nHow to use the dozens of Worksheets available\nPlug and play method of study. Start helping people right away.\nand so much more\nACT Complete Life Coaching Certificate Advance to Expert will keep you engaged.

Trauma can affect individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and life circumstances. It may stem from a single event or a series of ongoing experiences and often involves a threat to one’s physical or emotional well-being—triggering intense feelings of fear, helplessness, and loss of control.\nTraumatic experiences can profoundly influence how individuals view themselves, others, and the world around them. These experiences may disrupt biological, cognitive, and emotional functioning, impacting identity, relationships, and social engagement.\nAs healthcare and human services providers, it is essential to adopt approaches grounded in the principles of Trauma-Informed Care (TIC). This course will introduce you to the core concepts and guiding principles of TIC. You will be encouraged to reflect deeply, build your awareness, and elevate your care practices to better support those impacted by trauma.\nUpon completion of this course you will:\nBe able to define trauma\nRecognize various types of trauma\nUnderstand trauma’s impact on mental and physical health\nUnderstand the Adverse Child Experiences (ACE) Study\nDescribe and understand principles & tenets of Trauma-Informed Care\nRecognize the importance of responding to trauma disclosures appropriately\nUnderstand the importance of managing vicarious trauma and compassion fatigue\nRecognize trauma’s impact on society",

Psychosomatic Medicine (PM) is an interdisciplinary study that analyzes the human organism as a structured and interrelated unity where the biological and psychological systems influence each other reciprocally. PM may provide an answer to this crisis in mainstream medicine.\nThis vision serves as the foundation for new integrated methods to prevention and therapy while also outlining the possibilities of transcending the historical and philosophical oppositions between mind and body as well as medicine and psychology.\nThe goal of Psychosomatics is to apply medical and psychological knowledge to the treatment of many disorders, including allergic, immune, autoimmune, rheumatic, neoplastic, endocrine, cardiovascular, and mental pathology.\nPM is a very useful tool in the practice of all holistic therapists.\nThe course is directed at complementary or conventional therapists, psychologists, biologists, or individuals with a strong desire to implement change in their lives.\nDuring this course you will learn step by step how to incorporate Psychosomatic Medicine in existing therapy models. During the cycle of lectures and video classes you will be presented with several practical cases with an interactive modality of learning.\nThe complete cycle of online sessions consists of 4 modules plus a final assessment without limits of time.\nThe Certificate of attendance allows you to apply the acquired knowledge and professional skills in your existing field of study/work.

      "description": "Trauma Competency for the 21st Century teaches cutting-edge interventions and protocols that clinicians can immediately implement to augment their work treating survivors of trauma. This training teaches and clarifies skills drawn from recent research that evolves treatment beyond the antiquated notions and practice of the 20th Century into simple principles and practices that rapidly resolves the effects of traumatic stress.\nDeeply rooted in the science and with an eye to the art of treating traumatic stress, Dr. Gentry will stimulate participants with both principles and techniques for rapidly and safely accelerating treatment with clients who suffer from traumatic stress. The two-day symposium provides mental health professionals with unique training grounded in scientific literature and evidence-based practice but without demanding that clients undergo any particular treatment protocol.\nInstead, this training teaches clinicians to implement an “active ingredient” approach that extracts and catalyzes each of the common elements of all effective trauma treatments into a set of stages called The Empowerment and Resilience Structure (Gentry, Baranowsky and Rhoton, 2017). This structure firmly establishes a clear pathway for rapidly, effectively and safely resolving the symptoms of traumatic stress that breaks with much of the archaic treatment approaches that are presently utilized to treat trauma.\nThe Empowerment and Resilience Treatment Structure for Traumatic Stress (Gentry and Rhoton, in press) utilizes four stages to navigate the treatment for those survivors suffering symptoms of posttraumatic stress. These are (1) Preparation and Relationship Building; (2) Cognitive Restructuring and Self-regulation; (3) Desensitization and Integration; and (4) Posttraumatic Growth and Resilience. Included in these stages and taught throughout the two days are the factors that current researchers have identified as effective in therapy with trauma survivors and include: Feedback-driven treatment to build, maintain and enhance therapeutic relationships; motivational interviewing and polyvagal aspects to develop and enhance positive expectancy; psychoeducation and cognitive restructuring to facilitate self-compassion and engagement; interoception and acute relaxation to teach and coach survivors to self-regulate and interrupt their threat response; reciprocal inhibition to facilitate in vivo exposure (instead of the 20th Century focus upon imaginal) exposure to rapidly desensitize and integrate trauma memories, lessen symptoms and improve quality of life; and Forward-Facing ™ Trauma Therapy to stimulate post-traumatic growth and to heal the moral wounds of trauma survivors. This workshop trains the clinician to competency in trauma treatment by engaging generic skills, that do not require the professional to learn and master any particular model of trauma treatment but does, however, accommodate and make an excellent delivery platform for those clinicians who come to the training already trained in one of these protocols (e.g., EMDR. CPT, PE, SE, etc).\nFor those that do not have training in of these evidence-based models, this two-day workshop also provides instruction in a narrative exposure technique (Baranowsky and Gentry, 2015) to safely and successfully resolve Criterion B (Intrusion) symptoms of flashbacks and nightmares using a five-narrative approach to desensitization and integration.\nWhile this training is science and evidence-based, it is delivered by a clinician that has over 35 years of experience in treating traumatic stress. Dr. Gentry shares lessons from many of his mistakes and helps clinicians avoid many of the common pitfalls that beleaguer clinicians early in their career of treating traumatic stress.",

      "description": "This course teaches dementia caregivers about the Montessori method of dementia care which is based on Dr. Maria Montessori’s work in early childhood education. In this course we will learn about the 10 Montessori principles of dementia care: independence, choice, being error free, adaptation, demonstration, procedural memory, familiar materials, meaningful activities, sequencing, and simple-to-complex. We will learn how to apply the Montessori principles in any caregiving setting and that the principles are interdependent. We will learn how to communicate more effectively with the person we are caring for and how to engage them in recreational and personal care activities. Caregivers will learn about the importance of self care and ways to mitigate the challenges of caregiving.\nThe Montessori method of dementia care has many benefits for both caregivers and the people they are caring for.

This course is not for the faint of heart; it will challenge what you think you know about why you use food the way you do!\n\nWe are going to be working through the topic of emotional overeating from the perspective of self-compassion, body kindness, and emotional agility. Most people believe that if they are emotionally eating, they are approaching food in the wrong way.\nWhile food may play a role, we are much more influenced by how we learned to be with our emotions; the beliefs we have about ourselves; and the conditioning we have received from the culture at large and our families of origin regarding our bodies.\nIn this course, you will practice making choices that align with who and how you want to be-- not who you have been told you need to be or \"should\" be.\nWe will also be diving into the topic of acceptance.\nThe first step to change is acceptance, so if you can't say \"yes,\" we have some work to do!\nWe'll work together so that you can understand what's underneath the criticism and build your skills to approach yourself with greater trust, confidence, and a growth mindset!\nThis course includes a Certificate of Completion once requested and verified!",

        "This course is not for the faint of heart. It is for those who desire to begin living with heart. In a society where we are constantly bombarded by messages about how we should look, what we should weigh, what we should or should not eat, what we should or should not wear, how we should or should not exercise…is it a surprise that we find ourselves living by other people’s rules, adopting other people’s goals, and measuring our worth by other people’s metrics?!",
        "When I made the commitment to change my relationship with myself, my relationship with food changed as well. I didn’t make that commitment with weight in mind either. That was the very problem I needed to solve! I was fixated on a number representing my worth. No, it was about learning how to trust myself, how to listen to my own needs, how to speak up and speak to myself with kindness and compassion, how to honor whatever emotion would arise and view it as valid and necessary, and how to live in accordance with my values (and it took work and reflection to understand them!) rather than society’s, my family’s, my friend’s, and those I was surrounded by. And here’s the deal—I’m still learning. It doesn’t end. Each day, I ask myself if I’m being who I want to be, if I’m living with integrity, if I’m living with my heart open, if my thoughts are expansive and loving, kind, and compassionate, and if I can lie down at night proud of the relationship I’m cultivating with myself.

      "description": "This course is for practitioners wanting an in depth understanding of brief psychodynamic therapy. In particular, the course will help practitioners develop a deeper understanding of the framework and techniques used in briefer and more targeted forms of psychodynamic therapy. While psychoanalytic therapy typically takes years of training to become proficient, this course is designed to allow mental health practitioners to begin to use psychodynamic interventions immediately in their own work. Practitioners may wish to utilises the techniques as an adjunct to their existing therapy technique or utilise the information provided in this course as a framework for their therapy.\nThe course draws on the intensive short term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP) and related brief psychodynamic therapy frameworks. ISTDP packages the models, ideas, and tools used in other psychodynamic therapies in a structured and ready to implement format. Importantly, practitioners can use the techniques from this course in long term and non-intensive therapy or used it in an intensive way to achieve progress in very short time frames.\nThe course begins with an introduction to the evidence base for the therapy and the general framework for sessions. Following this, it covers theoretical models of psychodynamic therapy (Freudian and Malan) which underlie many of the techniques covered in the course, emotions and impulses which typically underly suffering, anxiety systems which trigger psychological defences (isolation of affect, repressive, and fragility), the relationship between depression and anxiety systems, and specific psychological defences therapists routinely observe in session (tactical, repressive, regressive, and character defences).\nThe course contains technical information suitable for mental health practitioners who are looking for continued professional development. The course contains a series of quizzes to assess understanding of the course materials and will provide resources participants to download and retain after completion of the course.",

      "description": "Mental breakdown, in the form of “bipolar” or “psychotic” episodes, may often be experienced as having aspects of “breakthrough.” Even amidst severe distress and disruption, attempts at deep healing may be detected. Many avoid discussing this for fear of “romanticizing” disturbed states, but such reluctance can lead to “awfulizing” experiences instead and can impair engagement in treatment and reduce its effectiveness.\nResearch suggests that in the US, approximately 25-39% of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and 15-22% of those diagnosed with mania/bipolar disorder have beliefs that mental health professionals call \"religious delusions.\" But when people are told that their experiences and beliefs have no value and are simply due to an illness, they tend to either fight back and defend their perspectives in a rigid way, or they shift to attempting complete suppression of what they now see as their “sick” perspectives and experience. Unfortunately, neither of these two reactions have been found likely to lead to lead to recovery.\nIf reality, and our brains, were simple, then simplistic approaches to mental health would probably succeed more frequently.\nThis course is designed for people who are open to considering more complex possibilities. What if it’s often not possible to clearly distinguish dangerous and unhelpful states of mind from states that may be spiritually significant and helpful, or part of an attempt to heal from past traumas? Is there a way to approach these questions in a less black and white way, helping people to find their own answers, and/or ways of living with questions that don’t seem to have answers? Might that work better than trying to impose dominant cultural viewpoints and ways of being organized, which themselves may be flawed?\nWhatever your spiritual perspective may be, or even if you see yourself as definitely non-spiritual, you can learn to acknowledge that there are deep questions about human existence that are often seen as spiritual, and to recognize the ways mental and emotional crisis often involves confusion around these questions. Then, with that awareness in mind, you can learn how to support people to possibly find their own way to shift from distress and confusion to deep healing and integration.\nThe course will take 6 hours to complete.",

      "description": "Understanding and Treating Depression is a course for counsellors, hypnotherapists, and other professionals working with clients who may have depression. The course can also be taken by those interested in gaining a greater understanding about depression for personal development or learning.\nThe course is taught by Dan Jones, who has worked as a depression and anxiety specialist since 2001 and teaches therapists to treat depression and anxiety disorders, prior to this Dan worked in psychiatric care homes.\nThis understanding and treating depression course also contains a 54-page PDF of extensive course notes and a PDF document of links to articles to supplement your learning and a list of recommended reading.\nDepression is the predominant mental health problem worldwide. In the UK in 2014 one in five people over 16 showed symptoms of anxiety or depression, so it is very common among the general population and there is more prevalence with clients in therapy who perhaps are presenting with something other than depression as their reason for seeking support.\nOn this course you will learn:\n• What depression is and the symptoms of depression\n• What causes and maintains depression\n• How to treat depression\nThe course is structured to give you an understanding of what depression is and depression symptoms before covering causes of depression which includes the cycle of depression, the depressive attributional style, worrying, and sleep and depression. Then the course progresses into the nature of depression as a deep trance state and how it isn't the things that happen to people that causes depression, but rather their response to the world around them that leads to depression, then the role of stress in relation to depression is explored. These understandings pave the way to be able to understand how to help clients quickly move on from depression and how to help them reduce the chances of having periods of depression in the future.\nOne of the first paradigms explored is the idea that rather than depression being a problem it is actually a solution or a signal for the client, and to tackle the depression you need to know what it is a signal or solution for and address that. The course looks at some of the myths around depression treatment, like clients having to feel worse before they get better, that anti-depressants are a good solution for long-term treatment of depression, and that depression is a biological illness.\nBefore getting into what you can do to treat depression there is an overview of the main drugs used in depression treatment. It is common for clients to assume therapists know about the drugs they have been prescribed, so it is helpful to have a basic understanding of this, Then the course moves into how to lift depression, how I structure a therapy session when working with depression clients, what information I look for from the client, how I gather that information, what information is needed from a client to help them move on from being depressed and how I help clients to carry changes forward into their life beyond the therapy session.\nTo end the course diet, nutrition and exercise are covered as well as two topics I rarely see on other courses, safeguarding your client, as there is an increased risk of suicide among depressed clients, and there maybe risk of harm to others, and safeguarding yourself, it can be an emotional and difficult role working with depressed clients, especially if they commit suicide or threaten to, or if they have been revealing very emotional information to you, so it is important to know how to look after yourself.\nThere is also a Sussex Hypnotherapy Centre certificate of completion in addition to the Udemy certificate of completion.",

      "description": "This course serves as a comprehensive overview of the central theories and practices of contemporary Existential Therapy (ET).\nIt is ideal for anyone working in the mental health sector and is especially valuable to qualified:\npsychotherapists\ncounsellors\npsychiatrists\nclinical psychologists\nlife coaches and pastoral workers.\nAs well as those training towards such professions.\nWhilst the course may also of interest to non-professionals with a personal interest in psychology and philosophy: specialist academic language is used throughout the course and it is pitched at a postgraduate level; it is mainly intended for mental health professionals and refers to therapeutic techniques and strategies throughout.\n\n\n\n\nThe Goals of Existential Therapy\nExistential therapies have different goals to more conventional approaches to mental health, principle goals include:\nHelping people to live more authentic lives and avoid various forms of inauthentic behaviour\nMaximising autonomy and freedom by encouraging people to assume responsibility for their choices (and their lives)\nHelping people to find (or construct) a sense of meaning, purpose and value in life\nCultivating wisdom and the pursuit of philosophical truth: overcoming self-deception and harmful delusions\nHelping people to face reality and certain \"existential givens\" (such as death/mortality) so that they can live more full and engaged lives\nExistential therapies are firmly rooted in existential philosophy and often draw on the ideas of prominent existential philosophers such as Kierkegaard, Buber, Nietzsche & Sartre - most of whom were writing in a time where the distinction between philosophy and psychology was less rigid than it is today. Likewise, existential therapies tend to be heavily influenced by phenomenology and phenomenological philosophers (such as Hegel and Heidegger) .\nDue to this influence of phenomenology existential therapies tend to emphasise subjectivity and inter-subjectivity; the nature and significance of phenomenology are something explored in this course. Helping people to reconnect with the subjective nature of their lives (instead of viewing themselves as passive objects or labels or in terms of overly reductionist biographical narratives) is both an important goal and a central method of many approaches to existential therapy.\nFurthermore, these approaches to therapy emphasise the role of will, choice, and volition in the challenges (and sometimes symptoms) that present in the lives of patients/clients and in the therapeutic process: they are, in part, a reaction to overly-deterministic and reductionist accounts of human behaviour and psychology.\nIn truth, there is no single 'Existential Therapy' but multiple 'existential therapies' - different branches of therapy and psychotherapy that are informed by different existential philosophers and existential psychologists: the course covers the three most prominent existentially-orientated approaches to therapy and psychotherapy:\nLogotherapy\nExistential-Humanistic Therapy\nExistential Phenomenological Therapy (and 'The British School')\nIt also takes an in-depth look at the model of existential psychotherapy developed by Irvin Yalom and explores more recent developments in the field: Existential-Positive Psychology, Positive Psychology 2.0, and potential avenues for integrating existential therapy with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)\n\n\n\n\nThe Aims of The Course\n\n\nThis course focuses on outlining, describing and explaining the central concepts, theories and practices of Existential Therapy: it does not pretend to present a particularly critical or evaluative analysis, it does not explore the evidential basis of existential therapy nor does it attempt to 'sell you' Existential Therapy. Critical appraisal of the value of existential therapy is something I will leave to you.\nWhat I can promise, however, is that you will have a firm grasp of Existential Therapy by the end of this course as well as some new, existentially-informed, therapeutic techniques to experiment with in your practice as a mental health professional. Moreover, I can promise you that the course is well-researched and that I have done my utmost to do this fascinating and unique approach to therapy justice and to represent it both fairly and comprehensively.\nAside from my hope that this course will enhance your practice as a therapist and bring great benefit to those with whom you work, it is also my hope that you will find the concepts and theories of the course personally relevant, engaging, and perhaps even challenging!\nFinally: one of my aims is to offer good value - this desire is borne partly out of my own frustration at how expensive high-quality training is for counsellors and psychotherapists and how limited exposure to these theories and ideas is as a result. This course is a fraction of the price of more established training courses for Existential Therapy and my ambition is not only to match those courses but to surpass them in quality.\n\n\n\n\nImportant Information & Considerations\n\n\nThe course includes twenty video-learning sessions*. Aside from containing in-depth explanations of Existential Therapy these sessions also include various learning and reflection activities that you should engage in if you hope to maximise your learning.\n\nIncluded in the course is a printable workbook** that features learning and reflection tasks: this workbook should be printed off and either bound as a booklet or kept together in a file prior to beginning the first learning session. Every learning-session has its own double-sided worksheet (as a section of the workbook) and engaging with these worksheets and learning activities is something expected of students who wish to get the most out of this course.\n\nThis course asks that you utilise an 'active learning' approach and, in true existential fashion, asks that you take responsibility for getting the most out of it. If you are looking for a course in which you passively absorb information - as if listening to an audio book - this course is not for you! Likewise: if you cannot print the workbook/worksheets because you do not have access to a printer - that will be an obstacle to learning.\n\nEach learning session also includes additional links to relevant external resources such as articles and videos: these are intended to support your learning and taking the time to explore these additional resources will help you to perfect your expertise in existential approaches to therapy.\n\nMy intention is to create expertise: this means it is heavy on theory and doesn't 'pull any punches' when it comes to detailed exploration of complicated ideas and concepts. It is not a 'dumbed-down' course and aims to be intellectually and academically rigorous and challenging.\n\nThose who complete the video learning-sessions will receive a certificate of completion automatically from Udemy: an 'Advanced Certificate in Existential Therapy, Psychotherapy & Counselling' can also be claimed (at no additional cost) by students who successfully complete the course and additional assessment tasks (outlined in the aforementioned printable workbook). At the time of release (July, 2020) the Advanced Certificate is not formally accredited though it is my intention to remedy this in due course.\n\n\n*If the course is sufficiently popular and well-received, I intend to expand upon it and add new learning sessions over time.\n**The printable workbook is attached to Lecture 1, once registered you should download it there.",

      "description": "This series of classes teaches survivors of abuse and concerned loved ones about abusive personalities, targets of abuse, abusive relationships and life in recovery from abuse. SNAP educational program of recovery helps empathic survivors of abuse fine tune and connect with their empathic nature in order to preserve, harness and protect the very things abusers seek to destroy.\n\n\nMandy Friedman, LPCC-S, CCDVC, CCTP-II is a licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC), a clinically certified domestic violence counselor (CCDVC), a certified domestic violence specialist-I (CDVS-I), a certified clinical mental health counselor (CCMHC) and a clinically certified trauma professional, level 2 (CCTP-II). In her private practice, Clermont Mental Health, Mandy specializes in treating survivors of abuse. She is also familiar with the role of addiction and substance abuse in abusive relationships. Mandy’s clients are often in need of trauma-informed care as part of their recovery. This has led her to specialize on the topic of Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD). To help her clients, Mandy utilizes mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing, narrative therapy, psychoeducation and Polyvagal Theory.\n\n\nA Note from the Instructor:\n\"My interest in learning about exploitative personalities began as I was trying to make sense of experiences I was having in my personal life. Then, as a mental health counselor, I began connecting dots in therapy sessions as clients worked to overcome painful experiences from their past. A large percentage of clients come to therapy to address anxiety, depression, unhealthy behaviors, difficulty with relationships, problematic patterns of decision making and low self-esteem. As I assessed for instances of trauma in the client’s past, I found that some clients dealing with such symptoms had experienced punctuated trauma at some point in their lives. At the same time, many clients had experienced years of ongoing, normalized abuse and repeated trauma.\nOur initial views of trauma within the field of mental health do not include the more common, complex version of trauma. Out of necessity for treating this glaringly obvious issue, professionals are starting to categorize complex trauma even though it has yet to be entered into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5-TR). As we get to know our clients, we find that many of them have experienced trauma in the form of a single, punctuated event. These single events would include things like combat, natural disaster, sudden death of a loved one, sexual assault,  witnessing a death or violence, car accidents, loss of a child, severe injury or any perceived near death experience.\nIn my practice, the majority of trauma presented in session is endured over long periods of time and inflicted by those who were supposed to be sources of love and protection. These clients have an imprint of trauma that was reinforced by repeated traumatization over the course of time. To make matters worse, they also have pronounced experiences of betrayal and abandonment. In addition to the perpetrator, there were other trusted adults who failed to protect and/ or compounded the impact through blame, humiliation or apathy.  This is complex trauma indeed.\nThe more common sources of trauma do not come at the hands of a stranger. The more common types of trauma do not come swiftly as a freak, chance disaster. Instead, trauma happens when we cross paths with or are born into the lives of toxic and abusive people. This type of trauma happens through sexual assault or molestation usually perpetrated by a trusted adult. Or, a husband or wife who uses psychological warfare to coercively control and manipulate their partner. Complex trauma comes in the form of a narcissistic parent whose child is permanently imprinted with the belief, “I am a failure, I will never be good at anything.” The trauma my clients deal with comes in the form of ongoing verbal, emotional and psychological abuse.\nBut who inflicted the abuse? Where did this abuse originate? These are the questions I sought to answer. Is the presence of a narcissist or someone with sociopathic traits an unspoken common denominator in this equation? It is common knowledge that abused people abuse people. To answer these questions, I started learning about personalities that inflict abuse. I wasn’t satisfied in knowing how abuse affects humans over the course of their life. I had to understand how the abuse happened in the first place. Who are the abusers? How do they choose their targets? What is it about the abuser that makes the target stay? Since I began developing this area of focus, I’ve been able to help my clients understand “why” these horrible things happened to them and “how” the abuser was able to keep a mental and emotional hold over them. It is important to say that this knowledge is not a “cure” for trauma and does not replace the specific ways we need to process trauma. However, this knowledge does fill in the gaps and answer many questions that plague targets of abuse. Most importantly, it helps them to identify any toxic and unhealthy presences in their current life. They are able to identify and steer away from abusive individuals.\nThis is empowering for people who feel doomed to “always choose the wrong partner” or believe that they are “weak” or somehow innately broken. Instead, they see that their most precious human qualities were used against them as weapons. They also see that by denying themselves those qualities, they are allowing the abuse to continue. My program of recovery helps empathic survivors of abuse fine tune and connect with their empathic nature in order to preserve, harness and protect the very things abusers seek to destroy.\"",

      "description": "Your internal world matches your external world, and until you make the unconscious conscious, it will rule your life and you will call it fate. This is my all time favorite quote by Carl Jung meaning that, there are undertone energies within you, within your subconscious that are causing you to manifest a particular type of love, particular types of people. The under current that is attracting these patterns of people are controlled by your inner child, the child within you that first sponged in the techniques on what love looks like from your caregivers and parents.\n\n\nThe law of attraction doesn’t work unless you reprogram the self limiting beliefs that are unconsciously inhibiting you from receiving what you want. For example, you could say,\nI want love, bring me a deep loving relationship.” “However your inner child still believes you are not worthy of love, and real love doesn’t exist.” You are not fully aligned in your manifesting. Your conscious mind is saying yes, bring me love, and your inner child is saying, I’ve learned from my caregivers, I am not worthy of love. Your inner child’s voice is the loudest. Even if you fully want love, your conscious mind is not aligned with your unconscious mind. Your deepest fears and self limiting beliefs are still running a muck in the undercurrents of your psyche.\n\n\nImagine that you are a computer. When you were first programmed to understand how to love, you were programmed as a child, and you were programmed by your caregivers or parents. Let’s say you were programmed to believe, real healthy love doesn’t exist. Maybe you grew up in a household where your parents fought constantly, love looked like a war zone to your innocent childlike eyes. As you get older and experience more life, your programming does not change. Your computer itself gets more mature and advanced, however you are still running off the old programming you received as a child. “Real, healthy love doesn’t exist.” Consequently, your programming continues to manifest situations where you are proven time and time again, real healthy love doesn’t exist. As you continue to manifest the same situation of failed, unhealthy relationships within different people, you are sure that what you were programmed as a child is true. But it’s not true. You have the power to let go of that self limiting belief, and reprogram your mind. You have the power to shift the programs and beliefs you learned as a child. You have the power to change your life. And this course is going to teach you how to do just that.\n\n\nThis course will walk you through the process of re-framing, re-parenting, and reprogramming your love life. I could tell you all day that you deserve to be loved and you are worthy, but if your inner child is still abiding by the self-limiting beliefs you learned as a child, it’s going through one ear and out the other. In this course, we will tap into your inner child, your wounded child, your shadow self. We will dig deep and pull forward the self limiting beliefs that are silently running your life.\n\n\nWe have to get to the root of the seeds that were planted deep within your inner child. Acknowledge first that they are even there. Decide if you want them to be there. If not, de-root them, and plant new seeds, new beliefs that will grow you an entirely new reality. A new reality where your inner child and your conscious mind is in full alignment. Because when you have full alignment, the universe will put all of its infinite power and wisdom behind you to manifest exactly what you want.\n\n\nDon’t give up on love. It exists, and it exists within the new reality we are about to create. And although a part of you may not believe what I am saying right now. You will when you see the results of the course, and how reprogramming and re-parenting will change your love life in the most beautiful and unexpected ways.",

      "description": "Full Body Massage Certification Course\nWelcome to the Complete Full Body Massage Certification Course – your step-by-step guide to mastering professional massage techniques and building a successful career in massage therapy. Whether you're a complete beginner or a wellness professional looking to expand your skills, this course is designed to teach you everything you need to know about full body massage. With hands-on demonstrations and in-depth explanations, you’ll learn how to deliver effective, relaxing, and therapeutic massages to clients of all needs.\nIn this course, you’ll explore the art and science of massage therapy, starting with foundational techniques and moving toward more advanced practices. You’ll learn how to apply these techniques to different parts of the body to create a harmonious and deeply relaxing experience. Each module is designed to build your confidence and precision, ensuring that you can provide an excellent massage from day one.\nNext, we dive into deep tissue massage, a popular modality known for its ability to release chronic muscle tension and pain. You’ll learn how to safely and effectively access deeper layers of muscle and fascia, using techniques that promote healing and mobility. Deep tissue massage can be intense, but with the guidance provided, you’ll understand how to adjust pressure and focus based on the client’s needs. Understanding anatomy is crucial in massage therapy, and this course will give you the knowledge to target specific muscles and joints. By learning the structure of the body, you’ll be able to perform more effective massages, tailoring each session to the client’s unique needs. This will allow you to help clients with pain management, injury recovery, and overall relaxation with a deeper understanding of the body’s mechanics.\nMassage is the practice of applying structured or unstructured pressure, tension, or vibration to the muscles, connective tissues, tendons, and ligaments of the body. This technique is primarily used for therapeutic purposes, providing relief from pain, stress, and tension. Massage involves a variety of strokes and manipulations designed to stimulate circulation, promote relaxation, and enhance overall well-being. Whether it's a gentle touch or deep pressure, massage offers a holistic approach to health by addressing both the body and mind. It has become an essential component in wellness programs, helping individuals manage chronic conditions, alleviate discomfort, and improve flexibility.\nThe origins of massage can be traced back thousands of years across various cultures. The earliest known references to massage date back to ancient China around 2700 BCE, where it was a key practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Around the same time, massage was also being used in India as part of Ayurveda, a holistic healing system. The Greeks and Romans incorporated massage into their health routines, particularly for athletes. In fact, the Greek physician Hippocrates, known as the father of modern medicine, wrote about the benefits of “rubbing” in medical treatments. Throughout history, massage has evolved, taking inspiration from different cultures and philosophies, but its core purpose—promoting health and relaxation—has remained consistent.\nMassage offers a wide array of physical, mental, and emotional benefits. On a physical level, massage helps improve blood circulation, reduce muscle tension, and enhance flexibility. It is particularly beneficial for people dealing with muscle pain, injuries, or stiffness. Massage promotes the release of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers, which can alleviate chronic pain conditions. Moreover, therapeutic massage can accelerate recovery from physical exertion and reduce inflammation, making it ideal for athletes or individuals recovering from surgery or injury.\nIn addition to its physical benefits, massage plays a significant role in improving mental and emotional health. Regular massage sessions can reduce levels of stress hormones like cortisol, helping clients achieve a state of deep relaxation. This reduction in stress can also aid in improving sleep patterns and reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. For many, massage provides a safe, comforting touch that fosters emotional well-being, helping to combat feelings of isolation or emotional imbalance. The mind-body connection in massage is powerful, allowing people to feel more centered and balanced in their daily lives.\nToday, massage is recognized as a critical component of holistic health and wellness practices. From luxury spas to physical therapy clinics, massage has become a go-to treatment for enhancing physical performance, managing stress, and improving quality of life. Various forms of massage—Swedish, deep tissue, hot stone, sports massage, and more—offer clients tailored experiences based on their specific needs. In modern healthcare, massage is increasingly integrated into wellness programs aimed at treating both chronic and acute conditions. With its rich history and proven benefits, massage continues to evolve as a therapeutic tool, providing relaxation and healing for people around the world.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll be ready to confidently offer full body massages, either as part of a spa team or as a freelance therapist. You’ll earn a certification upon completion, giving you the credentials to start or advance your career in massage therapy. Join us in this comprehensive course and start your journey toward helping others achieve relaxation, healing, and overall wellness through the power of massage",

This exciting course is led by award-winning psychotherapist, international speaker, and human guinea pig Alina Kislenko MA RP, who has ADHD & ASD herself and who specializes in it at The ADHD & Spectrum Centre.  Though often seen as a curse, ADHD can be a HUGE gift that comes with, wait for it, SUPERPOWERS. And not dinky ones that aren't real, but serious powers of hyperfocus and specialization that explains why ADHDers are the industry leaders in SO MANY fields, from the Olympics (Michael Phelps & Simone Biles) to hollywood (Will Smith & Mary-Kate Olsen) to entrepreneurialism (Sir Richard Branson & Charles Schwab). In this course, you'll unleash those powers and entirely change your relationship with your ADHD, your brain, and, not exaggerating, your life in general!\nThis is not your usual ADHD class. Sure, you'll learn cool bits about your brain and some tips and tricks on how to work with your learning needs, but, above all else, this is a lifestyle design course with ADHD always front of mind. Because one of the biggest elements that research shows makes or breaks an ADHDer is their environment, from their love life, to their friends, to their work, to their home. EVERYTHING needs to be on purpose, with everything from how you process info, to how often you hang out with people, to the colours you paint your walls - you need to find your own unique way of doing everything so that your ADHD superpowers can break through all the monotony that keeps your abilities typing you in knots.\nPeople with ADHD were born to be great! This course helps you build yourself, your self-esteem, and your world to be so ADHD friendly that your life will FINALLY be filled with ease, success, meeting your potential, self-pride, and fulfilment (yeah, that stuff isn't just for other people anymore). No more living like a chicken with your head cut off for you, running from emergency to emergency, this course opens a portal to a completely unique way of life that is completely compatible with your unique brain wiring.\nThis course is the product of Alina's decade of obsessive research on understanding her own (and her clients') ADHD. So instead of having to lose a decade of your life stuck in the deepest, weirdest parts of the internet and being a human guinea pig to get all this knowledge (like Alina did), you get it all in this course, and only in 30 days!\nAlso, meds are great for ADHD, and you should talk to your doctor about them if they're right for you, but this course specifically focuses on research-backed, non-medicinal methods of managing your neurochemistry, behaviours, emotions, and energy.\nAnd don't forget to check out my other udemy ADHD course sharing strategies for focus and motivation, called \"Focus & Motivation Strategies...That ACTUALLY Work!\". This course focuses more on lifestyle design while that one is great for people seeking to focus better (such as students) and cue their motivation at will.\n\nWoo! Let's get started!\n\nP.S. Here's a guy who's figured things out:\n“If someone told me you could be normal or you could continue to have your ADHD, I would take ADHD,”\n- JetBlue Airways founder David Neeleman\nWith this course, you'll figure your ADHD out too!",

The course is aimed at children with a range of ages from being young to teenagers.\nWithout a doubt, children experience a great many emotional issues and difficult experiences as adults but of course, lack the emotional intelligence to know how to deal with them and these, experiences, can become compounded and manifest into serious symptoms. As children grow up, some difficult behaviours or belief systems can have a detrimental impact on their lives and, some difficulties can become triggers which affect them later in life. Low self-esteem and lack of confidence often start in childhood.\nThe childhood era is akin to a fertile seed bed and it makes sense that if we do not tend to it and care for it properly, then we are allowing the weeds (in the shape of thoughts and unwanted actions) to emerge. Please note there is a small admin fee payable of £15 to have Karen's certificate, details are in the course.\nWith this course, you will learn:\nIntroduction to Hypnotherapy for Children Diploma\nHypnotherapy for Children Training Manual\nChildren & Hypnosis\nLack of Confidence in Children\nBet wetting\nAnxiety & Stress\nBullying\nMindfulness and Children\nBringing It All Together\nFinal Summary\nAccreditation\nAnd much more!\nAll courses are accredited by CTAA - Complementary Therapists Accredited Association.",

This knowledge will have a real positive effect on my practice. It was both fascinating and informative and I will definitely recommend the course to other professionals and individuals. Jackie C, Psychotherapist\nWell presented, emphasis on compassionate approach whilst describing science. It’s hard to present complex neuropathology and incorporate the psychological elements. I would highly recommend this course, really good content and value for money. Karen D., Advanced Clinical Practitioner.\nI liked the presenter’s manner, very knowledgeable but also very approachable. I will be sharing key points with my team who work in gambling education. Christina D., Project Development Officer, Scottish Gambling Education Hub\nI found it really interesting and educational. I am a Family Recovery coach and work with the loved ones of addicts. I nurture them to prioritise their self-care by creating bespoke copying strategies as well as learning about addiction and how to support the addicted loved one in the right way. The families become addicted to the addicts’ emotions and behaviours without realising it, so the models you went through today also relate to the recovery journey of the Families. It's virtually a mirror image. Linda E.\nThank you so much for today’s course, I found it really informative and it has helped me to reconnect to the need for compassion, understanding and support in working with traumatised and abused clients. It has also allowed me some much needed self compassion. Fiona S.",

That is, inflammation from infections and poor diets or lifestyle habits. A decline and shortage of key nutrients as well as fewer hormones and a deficit of molecules that protect our brains. And, finally, toxic substances such as metals or biotoxins (i.e., poisons produced by microbes) from molds or contract with poisons in the environment.\nLearn about the latest research on preventing and reversing cognitive decline. Learn about genetic predispositions. You can reverse even these influences, if you act early and take an aggressive stand against the changes. We will learn about the RECODE schema developed at UCLA. Memory issues are not inevitable. We will delve into the specific techniques and lifestyle strategies that researchers at a major research university are using to reverse early to mid-stage memory loss.\nTake a cognitive assessment test to determine the status of your own memory. This test is known as MOCA or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment instrument. It enables you to: use your working memory to work through simple math challenges as well as recall common objects, verbal statements and to copy images. You will also work through alphabetical reversals, recall words with specific letter prompts and information about the current date and time. The entire assessment can be completed in as little as 15-20 minutes. There's an adjustment for one's level of education and a scale for determining where you score relative to the danger zone of true memory deficits. Get your results and know where you stand.\nThere's also information about the effects of stress (due to unemployment, divorce, family changes and sleep loss) as well as insulin resistance, metabolics and lack of activity on our capacity to recall information and data. Understand the various sorts of examinations (e.g., DNA tests) that can be undertaken to evaluate your performance across a range of areas.",

I loved the way you used 3 different diagrams to explain it – I think it will help me to remember. Sara S., CAMHS Psychotherapist\nI have found it very informative and very interesting. Wale made the subject very easy to understand and I appreciated the way he explained the processes of the states. I do not have a scientific mind but could understand the scientific part of the course. Carole D.\nThis is the second training course that I have attended now and both have been excellent. The last one was Anxiety and the Brain and the two dovetail together so well....I will definitely be recommending you to other therapists. Allison C., Therapist\nThank you so much, I have found the Polyvagal Theory training excellent, as are all of your courses, can't wait until we can attend in person. Lynn P.\nThanks so much for this, it is really helpful for my own healing and for my clients. The whole session as a really great introduction to the polyvagal theory. Juanita D.\nGreat session. I first learnt a little about polyvagal from a previous course you ran (2 years ago) and have been interested ever since. This course was succinct and super informative. Love some of the practical exercises to reset the vagus nerve. I will be using those. Hannah S.\nI found this very useful and informative on both a professional and personal level. The course provided lots of ‘confirmation’ moments and new insights for me as a professional and a parent to an adopted child diagnosed with ASD and social anxiety disorder. I have attended quite a few of your courses and I always enjoy them and find that you explain things really clearly that are easy to understand and grasp. I also love how all of the courses interlink. Thank you for your sharing your knowledge it is greatly appreciated. Diane M.\nI was blown away, and this was not only accessible, but thorough, calming , intelligent and not gimmicky. It was pitched perfectly for my needs. Dawn H. Carer / therapeutic parent of child with RAD\nThis was very informative in a straight forward way, it was easy to follow for someone with not so much knowledge of the subject. Just the right amount of information leaving us wanting to learn more. Emily A. Therapist\nI really like how accessible your courses are, they are affordable and the 2 hour course is a great time for me to fit into my week. Heather D., Counsellor\nGolden information and techniques for coping with Autism and emotional regulation taught by the incredible Wale who teaches with clarity and groundedness. It was incredibly informative and explained neurological terms and processes in detail but without the technical terminology that I’m not yet familiar with.

      "description": "We are the World’s number one provider of Self Development and Arts Therapy Courses, with more than 180,000 students in 192 countries.\nThis course is the perfect choice for both individuals and professional therapists looking to expand and enhance their repertoire and portfolio. Although the course alone won’t qualify you as a therapist, many of my students that are considering a career in coaching, take the course so they can advertise themselves as a professional coach that uses cutting edge Rational Emotive Behavioural Therapy techniques.\nThe Modern Effective therapy System\nR.E.B.T or Rational Emotive Behavioural Therapy to give it its full name, is a modern effective therapy system that was originally thought up by Albert Ellis during the 1950’s.\nR.E.B.T is sometimes referred to as “rational emotive therapy” or simpler still, as “rational therapy”.\nR.E.B.T, is a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), that is focused on helping clients change irrational beliefs, and is one of a very few therapies in psychology that has evidence in support of its effectiveness.\nR.E.B.T is known as the rational therapy, because at its core, this most modern of therapies is all about understanding how we make sense of our emotions.\nEverything we feel and everything we do, involves emotions, so Ellis developed this action orientated approach to psychotherapy, which produces results by helping clients manage their emotions, their cognitions and their behaviours.\nThis most wonderful and modern of therapies, teaches us that it’s not events, or things that upset and disturb us, but rather how we view these events, or things.  In essence, how a person thinks, influences their feelings.\nWhen a person believes illogical and irrational beliefs about themselves, others, and the world, psychological problems and mental distress will often be the result.\nThe goal of REBT is to help people alter these negative thinking patterns and irrational, illogical beliefs, in order to overcome any resulting psychological problems.\nI have created this course, in such a way that everybody can benefit from this amazing therapy approach.  No special knowledge of psychology or therapy is needed, as the course has been written for beginners.\nAn open mind and a willingness to rethink the way in which you view yourself, others and the world is all that is required for you to gain maximum benefit of the REBT Model.\nREBT can be effective for a long list of disorders and issues, with a good body of evidence supporting its effectiveness for each one.\nThese include:\nDepression\nVarious forms of anxiety, especially social anxiety\nPTSD\nPhobias\nPanic attacks\nEating disorders\nAll types of addictions\nProblems related to impulse control\nProblems related to emotional control\nPersonality disorders\nAnger management\nPain management\nStress management\nCoping with health or disability problems\nChild behavioural issues\nFamily relationship issues\nIssues specific to couples\nPersonal growth, life goal issues, performance at work issues\nAs you can see, REBT is a versatile approach, helping people with a wide range of psychological and life issues.\nIncluded in the course, you’ll find a number of resources to help you apply the principles of REBT easily and effectively.\nAs with all of my courses, you’ll be able to benefit from full support from myself 7 days a week.  I always get back to my students the very same day, and more often than not, within a couple of hours (depending on your time zone!)\nThe Syllabus contains:\nWhat is REBT\nHappiness Self Assessment\nWhat do I need to benefit from REBT\nWhat can REBT treat\nWhy you need REBT\nUsing REBT as a Self Help Model\nHow does REBT differ from other therapies\nWhat are the similarities of REBT with CBT\nHow does it differ from CBT\nWhat is the ABCDE Model\n\"A\" Exploring \"Activating Event\"\n\"B\" Your \"Belief Systems\"\nExploring the C in REBT \"Consequences\"\nExploring the D in REBT \"Disputing\"\n\"E\" Looking at the \"Effects\" in REBT\nThe three Basic Musts\nType 1 Sub-Beliefs\nType 2 Sub-Beliefs\nType 3 Sub-Beliefs\nA whole section devoted to case studies and examples\nThe three types of acceptance and the three core beliefs\nHow to inspect your own beliefs\nPositive Thinking and positive self talk\nAlternative healthier thinking\nPlus a whole section devoted to resources, templates and worksheets!\nConclusion",

      "description": "This Introduction to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) training blends two of today's popular fields of psychology to emphasise the ability of all people to achieve mental health and wellness. Unlike traditional psychiatry, that focus on human pathology, this course offers a positive framework for leveraging cognition to make positive life changes.\nStudents will dive into a thought-provoking curriculum that covers essential life topics such as self-awareness, personality, the human identity, timeless life wisdom, and interpersonal skills. The course is crafted to help learners apply psychological insights to real-life situations, ensuring they gain practical, experiential understanding rather than just theoretical knowledge.\nStudents will explore multiple cognitive and behavioral models, to understand themselves first, before seeking to understand others.

      "description": "Forward-Facing®\nTrauma Therapy: Healing the Moral Wound\nCONSULTING SERVICES FOR HEALTH & WELLNESS\n\n\nWhat you'll learn\nForward-Facing® Trauma Therapy is a 21st Century psychotherapeutic approach to healing the negative effects of trauma and painful past experiences. It was designed as an alternative to current models of treatment that focus upon memory retrieval and processing as the primary method for resolving traumatic stress, FFTT, instead, has utilized a present day in vivo (“in life”) approach that provides desensitization and integration of trauma memories while confronting situations here in the present. This method and course will teach licensed mental health and healthcare professionals to implement FFTT into their practice and a potent ancillary to traditional psychotherapy. However, over the past several years, FFTT has emerged as a method that does not require psychotherapeutic skills or licensure to effectively implement its healing capacity. You will learn how to engage anyone who is struggling with any stress-related issue in a p[process that teaches them the skills to resolve distress and begin a Couse of effective living. This is achieved by teaching clients to self-regulate their own autonomic nervous system and interrupting the involuntary physical and cognitive engagement of the threat response where there is little or no danger. As survivors begin to master these skills of self-regulation—through the aide of an effective consultant or coach (not necessarily a licensed health professional)—they significantly lessen their distress; restore comfort in their bodies; improve cognitive and motor functioning; and optimize their lives. The very exciting thing about FFTT, which the student of this course will learn, is how when people live in chronically dysregulated autonomic nervous systems then they frequently breach their intention and integrity (i.e., “moral wounding). By helping clients develop the capacity for self-regulation and assisting them with clarifying and articulating their intentions (e.g, mission and code-of-honor), they are able to utilize the Forward-Facing™ skills to increasingly and effectively practice principle-based intentional living. The skills required to live in this way are the same skills that resolve stress-related problems.\n\n\nStudents completing this course will be equipped to immediately implement Forward-Facing™ skills and principles in their work with clients and patients in either a psychotherapeutic or coaching/consulting context.\n\n\nRequirements\nWhile FFTT was originally developed and utilized a psychotherapeutic approach implemented by qualified psychotherapists, these principles and practices are also deliverable in a non-clinical coaching or consultation approach. Anyone interested in learning how to lessen stress, improve resilience, enhance performance (cognitive and motor) and optimize personal/professional life is welcome to engage this course. There are no prerequisites.\nDescription\nIn Forward-Facing Trauma Therapy (FFTT) presented by Dr. Eric Gentry, PhD, LMHC, the participant will take a journey from hardship to healing. FFTT begins by exploring some of the common myths and misconceptions about the causes and meaning of stress and will examine the destruction it can wreak on our bodies, our minds, our spirits, and our relationships. FFTT is designed to discover the triggers that can lead us to act reflexively in ways that we deeply regret afterwards. FFTT will encourage participants to consider what it means to live an intentional life and how cultivating the skill of interoception, or “bodifulness,” can help us achieve this essential goal. Along the way, Dr. Gentry will share some inspiring stories about women and men he has known who successfully put these lessons into practice; vanquishing stress, regaining their resilience, and finding new joy, optimization, and fulfillment in their lives.\n\n\nObjectives:\n1. Discover the “active ingredients”/common elements for treating posttraumatic stress advocated as best practice for treatment of PTSD by leading agencies and organizations\n2. Employ a staged “active ingredient/”common elements” approach to evidence-based practice for treating survivors of trauma. This is contrasted with current practice of utilizing only EBT model-driven approaches.\n3. Conceptualize, articulate and utilize specific evidence-based treatment tasks within each of the (dynamic elements/active ingredients) of treatment that resolve symptoms of posttraumatic stress.\n4. Learn and employ the Empowerment & Resilience Treatment Structure (Gentry, Baranowsky & Rhoton, 2017) for delivery of treatment with trauma survivors.\n5. Efficiently and effectively facilitate resolution and healing of posttraumatic conditions.\n6. Learn specific psychoeducation and cognitive restructuring techniques for maximizing engagement and participation in early treatment.\n\n\nCredentialing: Participants who successfully complete this course are eligible to pursue credentialing as a Registered Forward-Facing® Practitioner.",

      "description": "Follow along as Tobias explains how he healed his Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Attacks & Depression through healthy diet and lifestyle choices. An essential course for anyone going through similar issues and wishing to overcome them. Watch the video for more information.\n\nAnxiety has to be the worst feeling in the world. You know, the feeling that something terrible is just about to happen. The feeling that doomsday is upon us.\n\nThe feeling something is going to fall from the sky and kill you, or your building is going to collapse, or someone is just about to step out from that alley and rob or stab you. The feeling everyone is watching and judging you, or you're about to get fired, or no one likes you and they are all laughing behind your back.\nThe feeling of never being able to relax. Ever. Yes, I know the feeling well.\nHave you ever had a panic attack in a public place? I remember my first one; I was on the bus going home from work and it hit me. I don't know where it came from, but I felt like I was about to leave this world. Yes, I became totally convinced I was dying. I couldn't get off the bus and I couldn't escape from that situation. It was one of the worst moments of my life. Since then, I've had panic attacks at work, in restaurants and on airplanes.\nI remember a time when I felt so depressed I didn't want to leave my bedroom and it took me an hour and a half just to get out of bed in the morning. I contemplated ending my life several times.I hated myself and hated my life, even when I was on heavy antidepressants. At the end, I was on 5x the dosage I started on. Nothing seemed to work for me.\nIf you've previously searched for help with anxiety, you have probably come across a myriad of confusing and contradictory advice from people who've never even been through anxiety or depression themselves. I have been clinically diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and depression. I am now no longer on antidepressant medication, this is not just my opinion but the assessment of a medical doctor. I can honestly say I am now 100% mentally healthy.  I am sharing my story because the traditional way of years of therapy and loads of prescription drugs didn't do a great job at healing these conditions for me.\n\nThat might be the reason you’re here.\nIf anxiety, depression or panic attacks have ever caused you a problem, then you might be glad to learn how I got over it. What healed me was a lifestyle change, respecting myself and becoming more aware of what I was putting into my body and how I was treating my body. Allow me to share everything that worked for me in this course\nAllow me to share everything that worked for me in this course.\nIn This Course, You Will Learn:\nTo relieve anxiety & depression in weeks, not years.\nHow to feel comfortable and safe in the world ALL THE TIME!\nThe 10 min a day practice that is scientifically proven to lower anxiety & depression.\nThe link between exercising & anxiety.\n5 things you don't even realize you're doing that contribute to your anxiety.\nThe real reason depression & anxiety is so hard to recover from.\nWhy this everyday drink is contributing to your anxiety symptoms\nRemove your emotional baggage to free yourself from anxiety\nAnd much more... After this course you'll know exactly what you can do today to help you overcome anxiety, depression & panic attacks and start getting results within one week!\nI have since gone on to teach this material to over 500 others both online and in my one-on-one coaching sessions! I am giving you the exact same information I give my 1-on-1 clients for free! You don't have to live your life with anxiety. I urge you to take action towards your happiness today.\nI am giving this info away free as I know how anxiety feels and want to do my part in helping share what I have learned.",

      "description": "Mindfulness is a transformative practice that involves deliberately focusing your attention on the present moment without judgment. It empowers individuals to observe their thoughts, emotions, and sensations as they arise, fostering self-awareness and emotional regulation.\nBy fostering self-awareness and promoting non-judgmental acceptance of one's thoughts and emotions, mindfulness can reduce stress, enhance emotional resilience, improve focus, and promote better relationships. It has the potential to boost overall mental health, leading to a greater sense of calm, clarity, and contentment in daily life.\nMoreover, studies have suggested that mindfulness can also have a positive impact on physical health, potentially lowering blood pressure, improving sleep quality, and even boosting the immune system. These benefits, among others, make mindfulness a valuable tool for those seeking to enhance their quality of life.\nIn our Mindfulness Teacher Training course, you'll gain the knowledge and skills to not only experience these benefits for yourself but also to guide others on their journey towards a more balanced and harmonious life through the practice of mindfulness.\nYou will learn:\nGain a comprehensive understanding of mindfulness theory, including the core principles, mechanisms of action, and the distinction between state and trait mindfulness.\nExplore various approaches to mindfulness, from its historical development to contemporary applications in therapies like MBSR, MBCT, ACT, DBT, and more.\nDevelop essential mindfulness techniques such as focusing, noticing, detaching, and labelling to effectively practice mindfulness in daily life.\nDiscover the wide range of applications for mindfulness, including its use in managing conditions like depression, anxiety, pain, weight, addiction, and even enhancing focus, sports performance, and quality of sleep.\nLearn how to teach mindfulness, including the foundational elements, coaching strategies, and common misconceptions, whether in clinical settings, in-person, or online.\nUnderstand the safety considerations associated with mindfulness practices and how to address adverse events and risks effectively.\nExplore various career pathways related to mindfulness and the diverse population groups for which mindfulness practices can be tailored, from children to older adults and those with mental illness.\nAccess example mindfulness practices and transcripts to apply and reinforce your learning.\nThe course is thoughtfully designed, featuring video lectures, downloadable resources, quizzes, practical exercises, and a comprehensive course handbook. Each module is assessed by a multiple-choice exam. By the end of the course, you'll earn a certificate accredited by the International Association of Therapists. If you wish to become a registered member of BAMBA you will require further training.\nThis course takes a deep dive into mindfulness. If you would prefer a broader course on meditation, you may wish to consider our Meditation Teacher Training course instead. It won't cover anywhere near as much detail but will explore a range of meditation techniques as well as the historical context. Both courses complement each other and all of the lessons are individual to each course.",

Do not RUSH the course. Ideally you would watch a lecture, try the art therapy exercise, consider your thoughts during the process and then post in the Q/A. Reflective questions are often supplied with the exercise.\nAlso make sure you often check the Educational Announcements.\nNote: A new section was added in December 2022 explaining what could be done with the course + your own Art work + the comments of others + reflections.",

      "description": "Ancient traditions are coming back in a big way. They are timeless, and deal with the human condition very sympathetically.\nIslamic psychology is surprisingly related in its origins to modern psychology and medicine. In fact, the world's first psychiatric hospital was founded in medieval times by a doctor called Al-Razi, and many of its treatments would be recognised in a modern setting, including counselling, exercise, meditation and so on.\nIn this course, which is the first and only of its kind on Udemy, Islam meets modern science in describing the essence of mental health and real-world contentment across all areas of life. Gain a full understanding of how your mind works. Increase your mental wellbeing using the concept of Tharwatul Qalb, or Mental Wealth, which cuts across all aspects of mental health, from illness right through to exceptional performance and noble conduct (Akhlaaq). Understand the emotions (Nafs), Intellect (Aql), and the Highest self or True self (Qalb).\nDr TK Harris is a retired neuropsychiatrist who trained in medicine in Oxford and went on to work in a clinical career for 20 years at the highest level- consultant neuropsychiatrist. A long time friend of Mufti Menk, he began writing groundbreaking books that combined Islamic and secular (academic) psychology. He has published seven books so far, three of which were Amazon best sellers in the Islamic Books category.\nThis course takes the mystery out of the mind, and gives the learner the tools needed to understand it clearly. We will cover a very relevant, working model of psychology and mental health that can be used to help oneself or others. Suitable for learners at all levels, from the lay person up to academic students and professionals who want to broaden their understanding and discover some genuinely useful tools that can be applied in any situation.",

      "description": "PTSD - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - is more pervasive in todays world than many might think. The experience of trauma is more than just a 'fright' and comes from an individuals coping mechanisms being overwhelmed. Bullying, assaults, muggings, accidents, financial difficulties and natural disasters outside of a persons control can all leave deep psychological scars. This course teaches scientifically based, highly effective ways to deal with PTSD.\nThis course is based on the Treating Trauma & PTSD course I run at the Christchurch Mental Health Education Resource Centre, an organisation that provides support and training for coaches, therapists, social workers, counsellors and the like, as part of their professional development.\nGiven that, this course is aimed at that demographic – people in the helping/supporting and counselling professions. If that’s you, or you’re in the process of becoming involved in the helping professions, this course will be invaluable. It’ll give you real skills that make a real difference – and fast!\nThis course teaches techniques and strategies for dealing with current stress; and a powerful process for dealing with PTSD. We will look at the process background and individual elements and go deep on why it works and then, most importantly the 'how to do it'.\nSo if you want fast, powerful and effective ways to help your clients, patients, friends (and even yourself) deal with trauma, this is the course for you.\nI believe this is the most effective way of treating trauma. Not only does the research confirm this, but I have used this process for many years with countless severely traumatised clients -- with remarkable success.\nThrough this course you will learn the individual elements that make it so effective. By understanding this in depth you will be able to confidently apply the technique yourself.\nWhat people are saying:\n“Outstanding! I am confident that I will be able to apply all the techniques taught in this course in both my personal and professional life! I have already told some of my friends. Thank you! A+++”\n“It was well narrated, defined and understandable. Subject was discussed effectively. Worthy. Best Wishes !!!!!”\n“I really appreciate the efficient pacing of objective and factual information presented so that every minute is of great value.”\n“I had heard about this process from a professor during my master's, but now (at the end of my program) and just looking into training for myself. Dr. Alan explains the purpose and function of the process, and each piece of information is broken down an easily digestible way. I took notes along to way and I found this helped me to learn enough to, at least a novice level, explain the process of memory consolidation and the way that the the technique works. I would love another course on this, Alan...I have so many questions! Thank you.”\n“Well explained, GREAT POWERFUL TECHNIQUES”\n“This is perfect for my needs: to understand trauma and how to identify effects along with strategies to work with current trauma.”\n“Very to the point, informative and clear.”\n“It was a good course for me and very helpful.”\n“I learned a lot. Thank you”\n“Very informative”\n“The technique was powerful. Everything was broken down into steps so that you could grasp the concepts.”\n“It was a very interesting course. I am excited to try it on some of my PTSD clients for whom CBT hasn't been very effective.”\n“Excellent...brief and informative!”\n“This is an advanced neuro-linguistic pattern overview with script and demonstration. Good stuff!”\n“Will help me with my research to submit category changes to the next edition of the DSM.”\n“Yes this is very much in line with the work I am doing - providing healing tools for people looking to live their best lives.”\n\"Clear concise information, with examples of introduction to client work and interventions. A good balance of theory and practice. I will recommend and also look forward to future courses like such. Excellent\".",

      "description": "Health Psychology is an expansive field that explores the intricate relationship between psychological, behavioural, and cultural processes and how they influence health, illness, and healthcare. As we move deeper into the 21st century, the field of health psychology has gained substantial importance, with studies showing that psychological and behavioural factors can account for a significant portion of health outcomes. In fact, research indicates that around 40% of premature deaths in the United States are linked to behaviours such as smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption—behaviours that health psychologists work to understand and change. As the healthcare system shifts toward prevention and holistic care, health psychology is becoming an essential component in achieving better health outcomes for individuals and populations alike.\nAt its core, health psychology focuses on understanding how psychological factors—such as thoughts, emotions, and beliefs—affect our physical health. These psychological factors can have a profound impact on our wellbeing. For instance, chronic stress has been shown to affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates the body’s stress response. Prolonged activation of this system due to stress can lead to a variety of health issues, including cardiovascular disease, immune system suppression, and mental health disorders like anxiety and depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals who experience chronic stress are at a significantly higher risk of developing these health conditions, with one study suggesting that stress-related illnesses account for about 60% of doctor visits.\nBehavioural factors are another area of focus within health psychology. The connection between behaviours and health is profound. Health behaviours such as smoking, poor nutrition, and lack of physical activity are all well-established risk factors for chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. In fact, smoking alone is responsible for nearly 480,000 deaths annually in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the field of health psychology also studies how positive behaviours—such as exercise, healthy eating, and regular medical checkups—can improve health outcomes. It has been found that regular physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic diseases by up to 30% and can add up to 7 years to your life. Health psychologists work to help individuals adopt these beneficial behaviours and sustain them over the long term.\nIn understanding the complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors, health psychologists use a biopsychosocial model. This approach suggests that health cannot be understood purely from a biological perspective (e.g., a virus, a tumour, or genetics) but also involves psychological factors (such as beliefs, attitudes, and stress levels) and social factors (such as socioeconomic status, culture, and family dynamics). This model offers a more comprehensive view of health, recognizing that personal and societal influences play an integral role in both the development and management of illness.\nCultural and social factors are also pivotal in health psychology. Socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, and social networks significantly shape health outcomes. For example, individuals from lower SES backgrounds are at an increased risk for a range of health issues, from mental health disorders to chronic conditions. Studies show that those with a lower SES often have limited access to healthcare, nutritious food, and opportunities for physical activity. Furthermore, health psychologists examine how cultural beliefs impact the way individuals approach health and illness. For example, certain cultures may have different attitudes toward seeking medical help or following health advice, which can impact their overall health outcomes.\nBy understanding these psychological, behavioural, and social influences, health psychologists can work both directly with individual patients and indirectly in large-scale public health efforts. For instance, they may assist patients in coping with chronic illnesses like diabetes or cancer by helping them change harmful behaviours, adopt healthier lifestyles, and manage the stress that often accompanies illness. This personalised approach helps individuals manage their conditions more effectively, resulting in improved health outcomes.\nHealth psychologists also play a vital role in public health campaigns aimed at preventing illness and promoting healthier behaviours on a large scale. Whether it's anti-smoking campaigns, obesity prevention programs, or efforts to reduce alcohol consumption, health psychologists are at the forefront of developing strategies to encourage positive behaviour changes in populations. One landmark example is the tobacco control movement, where research into smoking behaviour led to policy changes, such as smoke-free public spaces, graphic warning labels on cigarette packages, and restrictions on tobacco advertising—all of which have contributed to a dramatic decline in smoking rates worldwide.\nAnother important aspect of health psychology is training and educating other healthcare professionals to apply psychological principles in their practice. For example, physicians, nurses, and therapists often work alongside health psychologists to ensure they consider the psychological and behavioural aspects of a patient’s condition. This collaboration helps to improve the patient experience and leads to better outcomes, as healthcare providers gain a more holistic understanding of the factors that impact patient health.\nHealth psychologists also contribute significantly to medical education and research. By teaching in universities and conducting research in academic settings, they help advance the field, ensuring that new and effective techniques are developed to address the psychological aspects of health. They also engage in research that explores the links between mental health and physical health, contributing to the growing understanding of how factors like stress, cognitive function, and emotion regulation influence overall health.\nThe career opportunities for health psychologists are diverse. They work in a range of settings, from hospitals and medical clinics—where they may be part of a multidisciplinary team—to public health departments, where they lead efforts to reduce health disparities and encourage healthier lifestyles. Many also find roles in research institutions, where they study the effectiveness of different behavioural interventions and health programs. Additionally, some health psychologists work in the corporate world, designing employee wellness programs to reduce stress and improve productivity.\nOverall, health psychology is an incredibly dynamic and impactful field that plays a critical role in improving both individual health and public health. With an emphasis on the biopsychosocial model, health psychologists help individuals navigate the complexities of illness and wellness, while also shaping large-scale health interventions that improve the wellbeing of entire populations. By addressing the psychological, behavioural, and social aspects of health, health psychologists work towards a future where better health is not just a possibility, but a reality for everyone.",

      "description": "INTERNATIONALLY CERTIFIED & ACCREDITED\nIn the United States, Parents and their adult children have twice as much conflict than in other countries around the world, compared to places like Spain and Norway, etc. It is an interesting finding that has to do with the way we raise our children, the rise of concentrated individualism, and the type of individualism that is practiced culturally.\nTechnology also has a place in this discussion as it has shaped the way in which we communicate with one another and especially the way in which Xennials, Millennials, Generation Y, Z, respond to Gen X and Boomers. The gap has become so wide, and many parents are completely blindsided, or else see the conflict coming slowly, like a train wreck, and have no idea what is happening in-order-to stop it. It is very common for adult children to say that parents \"know exactly what they did or a doing,\" however, in many cases, they literally don't because the rules of parenting and engagement have changed so drastically, as has the child themselves, from the respect and entitlements a parent once cherished and could reply on. While estrangement benefits the adult child who feels they must abandon the parent to find themselves, the parent has nothing to gain but pain and sadness.\nIn this course we detangle the personal pain and suffering, from the changes in society and the nuclear family, and address the changes parents need to make, how to understand the nuances of estrangement with adult children and how to attempt to learn and meet the needs of the adult child to repair the relationship.\nThis course asks parents to be open and look within in, something I am convinced that bulk of you are already well on your way to doing, which is why you found your way to this course, while also examining the adult child's behavior and what you are not responsible for.\nThis course is also highly recommended for Healers, Counsellors, Therapists and Ministers to assist your own clients or patients with this very difficult issue of estrangement that is on the rise.\nThis course is not only an examination of personal growth in relationships and the ever-changing dynamics, but more importantly, gives parents tools to learn to be happy again, and through all this soul searching and trying to understand, find a greater love than they had at the beginning of this journey. That is, a greater love for themselves as more than the role of parent and the ability to be happy again despite the estrangement from an adult child. Whether there is a short-term or a long-term absence from an adult child, a parent has the right to be happy and move on (as well as the adult child) to pursue happiness and joy afforded to us all. Some things are fixable and at other times they are not. Finding a greater love for self which allows you to remove the guilt, shame and embarrassment parents silently suffer, and going on to live a beautiful life is the end goal.\nThe world has changed, our children with it, and now we must catch up to understand how to navigate through the web of family estrangement. There is so much covered in this course. Please see the course syllabus for topics and I hope to see you in class!\nFor those of you who are new, welcome, for those of you who are students already of POBA, welcome back!\nPOBA is accredited through the International Association of Therapists, has over 15K online students worldwide and is in 154 Countries and 47 Languages.\nSee you in class!

      "description": "Welcome to \"Mastering ACT: A Comprehensive Guide to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,\" a meticulously designed course that provides a deep dive into the principles, techniques, and applications of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Whether you are a mental health professional seeking to expand your therapeutic repertoire, a student of psychology, or someone interested in personal growth, this course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to apply ACT effectively in various settings.\nSection 1: Introduction to ACT\nThe journey begins with a robust introduction to ACT, laying a strong foundation for understanding its core principles and philosophical roots. In Lesson 1, we explore \"What is ACT?\" covering its definition, development, and the six core processes that form its backbone. You’ll gain insight into how ACT has evolved and its unique approach to fostering psychological flexibility.\nIn Lesson 2, we delve into the \"Theoretical Foundations\" of ACT, focusing on Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and the role of functional contextualism. These concepts are crucial for understanding the scientific basis of ACT and how it operates within a broader psychological framework.\nSection 2: ACT Skills and Techniques\nBuilding on the foundational knowledge, Section 2 dives into the specific skills and techniques used in ACT therapy. Lesson 6 focuses on \"Cognitive Defusion,\" offering practical techniques and exercises to help clients detach from unhelpful thoughts. Lesson 7, \"Exploring Self as Context,\" introduces this pivotal concept and provides exercises to facilitate a more flexible self-identity.\nAcceptance is a cornerstone of ACT, and Lesson 8, \"Acceptance Techniques,\" teaches how to help clients embrace their feelings rather than resist them, using role plays and scenarios. In Lesson 9, \"Values Identification,\" you’ll learn methods to help clients identify and clarify what truly matters to them, paving the way for meaningful action. Finally, in Lesson 10, \"Committed Action,\" we guide you through setting goals and following through with value-based planning.\nSection 3: ACT in Practice\nSection 3 is where theory meets practice. Lesson 11, \"ACT for Anxiety,\" provides strategies for understanding and intervening in anxiety through the ACT lens. Lesson 12, \"ACT for Depression,\" explores workshops and case discussions to manage depressive symptoms. Lesson 13, \"ACT with Children and Adolescents,\" offers adaptations of ACT techniques for younger clients, complete with case studies and exercises.\nGroup therapy is another powerful application of ACT. In Lesson 14, \"Group Therapy and ACT,\" we explore the dynamics of conducting ACT in group settings, along with practical exercises and activities. Lesson 15, \"Handling Resistance in Therapy,\" equips you with techniques to identify and engage resistant clients effectively.\nSection 4: Advanced Applications and Ongoing Learning\nThe final section delves into advanced applications and continuous learning avenues. Lesson 16, \"Integration with Other Therapies,\" discusses how ACT complements other therapeutic approaches, enriched by case studies of integrated sessions. Lesson 17, \"Measuring Outcomes in ACT,\" covers tools and methods for evaluating progress and interpreting outcome data.\nEthics are paramount in therapy. Lesson 18, \"Ethical Considerations in ACT,\" addresses ethical dilemmas specific to ACT through hypothetical scenarios and discussions. Lesson 19, \"Supervision and Training in ACT,\" highlights the importance of supervision, providing guidance on finding quality supervision and making the most of it.\nConcluding the course, Lesson 20, \"Future of ACT,\" explores current research, emerging trends, and how to stay updated with the latest developments in ACT practice.\nJoin us on this transformative journey and master the art and science of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Enroll now to enhance your therapeutic skills, empower your clients, and foster a deeper understanding of psychological flexibility and well-being.",

Loved the psychology part of it especially. Will check out your other courses. Great work, thanks so much!”\nThis course deals with a very specific type of complex trauma – one that involves the victim having had a close relationship with the perpetrator/s of the trauma.\nAnd importantly, the course teaches you a very powerful brief intervention technique for healing such traumas (and other related issues as well); the re-imprinting process that has its foundational theories based in developmental psychology.\nFor clarity, this is NOT EFT re-imprinting. The technique can also be used in the broader sense to improve relationships in general that have been damaged through misunderstandings, arguments, squabbles and the like, to create better understanding between people, and even repair relationships\nSo why would you do this course? Either because you are therapist and you want to help people overcome complex family or relationship trauma. Or because you've been through trauma yourself and you are seeking for understanding, insight and resolution to your personal issues. However if this latter reason is the case, you need to be guided through this technique by a competent therapist. The course will however help you to understand any personal traumas that you have experienced and perhaps gain a little more peace of mind\nIn this course I will unpack many of the causes of relationship trauma as well as the psychologies and the psychological mechanisms driving them. This will give you a deep understanding of how to use and adapt therapeutic process taught for best effect. In my own practice I've found that this technique has quite significant healing impact on the client’s whole life.\nI will explain the re-imprinting process in depth and there is also a live client demonstration.",

      "description": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a contemporary and evidence-based form of cognitive behavioural therapy that offers a unique approach to enhancing psychological wellbeing. In this introductory course, you will learn about the core concepts, theories and skills used in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.\nAt its core, ACT harnesses the power of mindfulness-based techniques to help individuals build essential skills in psychological flexibility. Unlike traditional therapies that primarily focus on symptom reduction, ACT places a profound emphasis on empowering individuals to make meaningful life changes and live in accordance with their values and aspirations.\nThis therapeutic model is founded on the idea that, by accepting their thoughts and emotions without judgment, individuals can cultivate the capacity to respond to life's challenges in more adaptive and constructive ways. ACT provides a practical framework for individuals to build resilience, identify their values, and commit to actions that lead to a more purposeful and fulfilling life.\nACT is a transdiagnostic approach that has gained recognition and recommendation from respected global health and psychological organisations including the World Health Organisation, NHS and American Psychological Association.\nThis course is an invaluable gateway to comprehending the core principles of ACT and its practical application. It is a foundational resource for psychotherapists and mental health professionals interested in exploring ACT, as well as individuals aspiring to apply ACT principles to enhance their own wellbeing.\nThroughout the course, you will delve into the theoretical foundations, practical techniques, and the underlying principles of ACT, which include:\nA comprehensive understanding of what ACT is and the theoretical framework it is built upon.\nAn exploration of the limitations of traditional therapeutic methods, including traditional CBT, and why ACT offers an alternative path.\nA detailed examination of the six processes of psychological flexibility, the cornerstone of ACT.\nA step-by-step guide to the delivery of ACT, providing you with practical insights into its application.\nInsights into building a robust therapeutic alliance, a pivotal component of ACT's success.\nThe course is thoughtfully designed, featuring video lectures, downloadable resources, quizzes, practical exercises, and a comprehensive course handbook. The practical exercises give you a chance to try out ACT techniques on yourself and finish the course with a variety of skills for building psychological flexibility.\nOn competition of the course, you will earn a certificate accredited by the International Association of Therapists. If you wish to become a registered member of the BABCP you will require further training.\nNo prior knowledge of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is required for this course. You do not need a background in cognitive behavioural therapy or mindfulness, although having one may aid understanding. All concepts will be explained from the ground up.",

      "description": "Food and eating can be a massive issue for autistic individuals. Many things, such as sensory issues and anxiety, can lead to a person having a very restricted diet. So what can you do to help your autistic children with eating difficulties?\n\n\nMy name is Loren Snow, and I'm an autistic public speaker and trainer.\nI've taught thousands of parents of autistic children over the years and have worked with many organisations from schools to The National Autistic Society and NHS England. I see many businesses confused about how to help, parents lost on what to believe, and autistic people struggling to understand themselves. So what better place to learn about autism than directly from an autistic person like myself!\n\n\nIn this course, we'll cover many reasons your autistic child might have difficulty eating and around food. We'll also look at many simple strategies you can start straight away that should help.\nI'll share with you my extensive knowledge about:\nSensory sensitivities and their role in eating problems\nHow the need for control impacts eating in autism\nConditions that can cause eating difficulties\nMental health and wellbeing's role in eating\nStrategies that work to help your child\n\n\nLet's face it, autism can seem complicated; it can be confusing and feel like there's a lot to learn. So if you're struggling with your child under or over-eating and feel helpless, then this is the perfect introduction course for you.",

      "description": "We are top Udemy instructors in the personal development category. Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\nThe course also has a thriving Facebook networking group.\nIf you are or want to be a LIFE COACH, we have a Life Coach Certification version of this course available, which you can enroll in instead.\nMaster Your Mindset with REBT!\nDo you have goals and dreams but feel like there’s always an obstacle standing in your way?\nDo you ever feel torn between doing what you really want and doing what you believe you “should” do?\nDo you ever experience social anxiety or worrying about what others will think?\nDo you ever feel overwhelmed with stress, worry, and fear of uncertainty?\nDo you beat yourself up for your mistakes or flaws or suffer from feelings of guilt, shame, or unworthiness?\nAre you tired of feeling unfulfilled and wish you were happier in your everyday life?\nIf you can relate to any of these things, you are not alone.\nNothing feels worst than not living up to your potential… especially if you want it deeply but it feel like life keeps getting in your way.\nThis course isn’t about how to force the world or other people to meet your needs and support your mission in life. That will never work. This course is about showing you how to TAKE BACK YOUR POWER and finally feel in control of your destiny!\nThe truth that you were probably never told is that you are the owner of the most powerful machine on the planet—the human mind—and that means you have a super power! You have the ability to feel happiness, no matter what is happening around you. You have the ability to learn and change ANYTHING you want about yourself. You have the ability to create the life you truly want, yes, even if right now it seems impossible.\nYou’ve just never been taught how to use this power!\nThis course is like a human mind owner’s manual!\nIt teaches you how your mind works, including the #1 most important thing you could ever understand about yourself, which is that your thoughts are what create your emotions.\nThat’s right, even thought it seems like the situations or people around you are causing you to feel a certain way, the truth is that it is what you THINK about it that causes your emotion.\nKnowing this puts the power in your hands because through this course you can learn how to CHOOSE YOUR THOUGHTS, and by doing so you can control your emotions.\nSo, here’s the bad news… this superpower you have, this human mind, it’s flawed. Your thinking has the power to transform your life! But, without training, the human mind is extremely IRRATIONAL.\nIn our brain’s quest to interpret our world and keep us safe it misinterprets what’s happening, it makes false judgments, and it demands unreasonable things from ourselves, others, and life. Plus, after years of living around dysfunctional people we pick up their faulty belief systems.\nAnd that’s why this course is so important! Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy is the foundation of modern psychology. The insights and techniques of REBT have unlocked human potential in the last century and are what ultimately differentiates those who are successful from those who are not.\nREBT will teach you how to rewire those faulty belief systems and stop sabotaging yourself with irrational thinking. It won’t just teach you how to use positive thinking to feel better in the moment, it will teach you how to identify the root cause of your emotional pain and rip it out!\nREBT will teach you how to avoid the ultimate form of failure, which is to achieve success in your life but still feel unfulfilled.\nIf you already enrolled in our popular CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) course, REBT is the foundation of CBT and digs even deeper into the root beliefs that are the problem! You’re going to LOVE this! In other word REBT takes what you may know about CBT to a whole new level.\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.\n\n\n\n\nSo who are we?\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera. We’ve been studying, mastering, and teaching about the power of the mind for almost 20 years. We’re entrepreneurs and coaches and we’ve worked with over 800,000+ students, coaches and businesses from 200 countries. Everything we have ever taught or created has had these principles a its core. Our courses are all based on our educational background in psychology and education, as well as my background as a psychology instructor, my Master’s in Counseling and my research on happiness for my dissertation for my PH.D. in Psychology.\nThe key to transforming your life is to unlock the power of your mind. We look forward to transforming with you in the course.\n\n\nCourse Outline:\n\n\nSection 1: Introduction\nLecture 1: Introduction to the Psychology of REBT\nLecture 2: What is REBT?\nLecture 3: REBT, A Psychology Human Empowerment Story\nLecture 4: History of the Psychology of REBT\nLecture 5: Differences Between REBT and CBT\nLecture 6: Tips for How to Make the Most Out of This Course\nLecture 7: IMPORTANT COURSE DOCUMENTS!\nSection 2: Irrational Thinking: How the Mind Works\nLecture 8: Why We Think, Feel & Act How We Do\nLecture 9: We ALL Think Irrationally, Including YOU!\nLecture 10: RATIONAL: Irrational vs Rational Beliefs\nLecture 11: EMOTIVE: Unhealthy vs Healthy Negative Emotions\nLecture 12: BEHAVIORAL: Unconstructive vs Constructive Behavior\nLecture 13: Intellectual vs Emotive Understanding\nLecture 14:3 Levels of Thinking\n\n\nSection 3: Irrational Beliefs and Emotional Disturbances\n\nLecture 15: Playing by the Rules: 3 Core Beliefs\nLecture 16:2 Types of Emotional Disturbances\nLecture 17: Evaluative Thinking: 4 Dysfunctional Ways We Assign Meaning\nLecture 18: Must #1: Approval (I must be approved of by others to be worthy.)\nLecture 19: Must #2: Judgment (Others must do “the right thing” and meet my expectations)\nLecture 20: Must #3: Comfort (Life must be easy, without discomfort or inconvenience.)\n\n\nSection 4: Using REBT to Change Irrational Beliefs\nLecture 21: ABCDEF—The REBT Process for Changing Irrational Beliefs\nLecture 22: Identify Problem Areas\nLecture 23: Psychology of REBT: A-Activating Event\nLecture 24: Psychology of REBT: B-Beliefs\nLecture 25: Psychology of REBT: C-Consequences\nLecture 26: Psychology of REBT: D-Disputing, Part 1\nLecture 27: Psychology of REBT: D-Disputing, Part 2\nLecture 28: Psychology of REBT: E-New Effects\nLecture 29: Psychology of REBT: F-Further Action\n\n\nSection 5: Step 1 (A, B & C): Identifying Activating Events, Beliefs & Consequences\nLecture 30: Psychology of Recognizing Emotional Disturbances (REBT and CBT Techniques)\n\n\nSection 6: Step 2 (D): Disputing Irrational Thinking and Beliefs\nLecture 31: Psychology of Unconditional Acceptance\nLecture 32: Banish Approval-Seeking and Say No to SHOULD\nLecture 33: REBT and CBT Techniques: Socratic Questioning\nSection 7: Step 3 (D): Changing Your Perspective (Interference)\nLecture 34: Psychology of The Power of Perspective (REBT and CBT Techniques)\nLecture 35: Psychology of Reframing Negative Situations (REBT and CBT Techniques)\nLecture 36: Psychology of Positive Thinking and Affirmations (REBT and CBT Techniques)\nSection 8: Step 4 (D): Changing the Meaning You Assign (Evaluations)\nLecture 37: Psychology of Changing Your Evaluative Thinking\nLecture 38: Psychology of Turning Demands into Preferences\nLecture 39: Psychology of Embracing Uncertainty\nLecture 40: REBT and CBT Techniques: Psychology of Decatastrophizing (Overcome Worry)\n\n\nSection 9: Step 5 (D): Changing Underlying Beliefs\nLecture 41: Challenging Irrational Core Beliefs\nLecture 42: Changing Negative Beliefs into Positive Ones\nSection 11: Step 6 (E & F): Deterring the Desired Effect, Taking Action & Creating Change\nLecture 43: Identifying What You Really Want\nLecture 44: Pain Pleasure Principle\nLecture 45: Exposure Techniques\n\n\nSection 11: Next Steps\nLecture 46: Conclusion and Next Steps\nCopyright Transformation Services, Inc.

Although the course alone won’t qualify you as a therapist, many of my students that are considering a career in coaching, take the course so they can advertise themselves as a professional coach that uses cutting edge Cognitive Behavioural Therapy techniques.\nCBT, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Depression, Anxiety, Phobias and Panic Attacks\nDo you suffer from depression, anxiety, phobias or panic attacks? Many of us do to some degree or another. If so, this course on CBT for depression, anxiety and phobias is exactly what you’re looking for. CBT or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is an innovative and effective approach to psychotherapy that has helped millions of people around the world manage and overcome a wide range of issues related to unwanted thoughts, feelings and behaviours.\n\nOne of the most defining features of CBT is its focus on teaching people to be their own therapists. The idea is not to make you dependent on years of therapy, but to teach you practical strategies and methods that you can use to deal with current problems right now, as well as to handle any future issues.\nDepression, anxiety and phobias are some of the most common mental issues that people face in everyday life, and CBT can provide you with solutions to these problems immediately. In this course we’ll look at each of these in turn and outline strategies and methods you can use in order take control of your own mental health.\nHere we’re offering a way for you to take charge of where your life is going. A way to be aware of the big and small things that happen in your life from minute to minute and day to day. We’ll address negative thought patterns, which will eliminate negative feelings and destructive behavioural patterns. CBT can provide you with solutions to anxiety, phobias, panic attacks and more, producing tangible results in a very short space of time.\nHow this will work in practice is that we will take a look at each type of issue. First depression, then anxiety and finally phobias. After ensuring that what issue actually involves has been made clear, we’ll look at under what circumstances each issue would qualify as something that needs serious attention. As a last step we’ll go over the aspects of CBT that you can apply all by yourself, without the need for external support or guidance.\nCBT really is an amazing versatile model that can be applied to an array of problematic symptoms, producing positive results for you, right now. Don’t suffer a moment longer, take this course and discover the magic of CBT.

      "description": "In this course, you will learn:\nHow to treat phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, and trauma that underlies many other psychological problems (like: depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and addictions) with the Rewind Technique.\nWhat causes phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder\nHow to handle challenges you may face with clients\nThe principles behind the Rewind Technique and how to effectively deliver the technique\nHow to get creative with those principles so that you can create your own versions of the technique, like creating stories around the technique\nWhat other issues the Rewind Technique works well for treating\nTo aid your learning there are additional notes and I have included 12 of my self-hypnosis PTSD and phobia treatment mp3’s that you can use yourself or listen to as examples of using the Rewind Technique to treat different phobias and PTSD.\nThe tracks are:\nFear of enclosed spaces\nFear of flying\nFear of going outside your home\nFear of needles\nFear of open spaces\nFear of puppets\nFear of rats\nFear of vomiting\nGeneric phobia cure\nFear of spiders\nFear of snakes\nPTSD treatment for soldiers\nThis course includes five practice exercises and five quizzes to help test and embed your knowledge.\nThe Rewind Technique is an incredible technique which allows you to target the core of someone’s phobia or post-traumatic stress disorder and treat it rapidly – often within a single session, helping clients achieve freedom from the trauma that has held them back so that they can move on with their lives.\nIt isn’t uncommon to have helped someone relieve trauma, a phobia or PTSD that they have had for decades within 10-15 minutes which can be highly rewarding for you as the therapist as well as life changing for the client.\nMany psychological issues that clients present with in therapy have trauma at their core. Clients with obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety issues, depression and addictions frequently have trauma as a core component driving them. It could be the trauma laid down the thinking and behavioural patterns which underlie the development of depression or anxiety issues, or that led to obsessive compulsive behaviours which developed to protect the individual from experiencing similar trauma again, or addictive behaviours to block out or cope with the trauma.\nThose experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder may develop relationship issues, face unemployment and find themselves not getting their basic emotional needs met as they struggle with outbursts of anger, depression, anxiety, flashbacks and more. Yet a single session with the Rewind Technique removing the power of the past trauma can transform the present and future for that individual.\nIn a single session you can help them end flashbacks, angry outbursts and anxiety, you can help them feel a sense of peace and calm they perhaps haven’t experienced in years, you can give them hope and help them to begin their journey out of depression, or take the power out of their obsessive compulsive disorder and all of this helps improve their relationships and ability to work.\nMany other approaches to trauma treatment take many sessions and often involve having the person relive or re-experience the trauma through approaches like exposure therapy or critical incident debriefing. This can reinforce the trauma rather than remove it. Or they look for what is ‘behind’ the trauma, trying to figure out why the person developed the trauma in the first place, yet most people with PTSD or a phobia know why they have the trauma but this knowledge hasn’t treated them, when it is illogical – for example, in the case of a phobia like a fear of flying and knowing that flying is one of the safest modes of transport, this also doesn’t help to treat the phobia because trauma is processed non-consciously. It is a ‘fight-or-flight’ survival response which is stubbornly resistant to trying to treat it with logic and reason.\nTrauma is a non-conscious automatic survival response that takes all elements of the initial traumatic experience and globalises these creating a ‘sloppy’ pattern to offer the best chances of survival in the future to anything which could be a repeat of the threat. So if someone was mugged by a person wearing black, then anyone wearing black could trigger the trauma, if the person was mugged at night then night-time or darkness could trigger the trauma pattern.  This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. If your ancestor was walking through a savanna and there was a rustling in the bushes and a lion jumped out and attacked and they escaped, the person who now had fear triggered by the sound of rustling bushes would keep away from rustling bushes in case there was another lion. In many cases there wouldn’t be, but it is better to be safe than dead. For those who don’t feel fear when they hear a rustling bush, they may remain too close to the wrong rustling bush one day and not survive to be anyone’s ancestor. The role of the therapist, and what the rewind technique does, is to take that global ‘sloppy’ pattern and make it specific, so the mugging was a scary experience, but going to bed and turning your lights out shouldn’t be. By using the Rewind Technique you have traumatic memories reprocessed so that they stop having this global hold over the person.\n\n\nThe boy with 20 phobias\nI was approached by a mother of a teenage boy with about 20 phobias. The boy had been seeing a psychiatrist for many years to try to treat them of these phobias. The treatment was remaining unsuccessful, the boy had behavioural problems in school and at home. He regularly displayed anger towards others. In about ten minutes I had helped the mother with a phobia she had, so she wondered whether maybe I could help her son. I thought about how unlikely it was that someone would develop so many phobias in such a short life, so assumed that there was a good chance there was a single incident which caused them all. I asked for a list of all the phobias which included things like: pencils, rubbers, cups, plates, chairs, tiles, paper, paperclips, staplers and chalk. I thought about what triggers his anger: school, teachers, authority, telling him what to do. I thought what connects all of these. I asked the mother whether her son had ever had a negative experience in a class in school around the time these problems started developing. The mother told me that her son wet himself in class once in primary school and the teacher got him up in front of the class and made him stand on her desk and humiliated him in front of the class. This was the type of experience I was expecting to be told. I de-traumatised this experience in about 15 minutes using the Rewind Technique and he no longer had any of his phobias, he stopped being so angry and engaged more in school and at home. The psychiatrist was annoyed with the mother for letting her son get ‘treated’ by me, but what I had done in under 30 minutes of meeting with the son transformed the final few years of his time in school and the quality of his life and interactions with family and others. This is the power of the Rewind Technique. If you would like to find out more you can check out the first few lectures for free.",

      "description": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a psychotherapy within the so-called third generation psychotherapies and contextual therapies, which emerged between the 80's and 90's in the United States as part of the behavioral and cognitive therapeutic models.\n\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy is oriented towards the clarification of personal values and action committed to these values, in an attempt to develop a meaningful and meaningful life. This approach understands that suffering is something universal and inherent to the human being, so its intervention is not aimed at seeking the elimination of the symptom, but to expand the behavioral repertoire and increase the psychological flexibility of the patient, using different tools such as metaphors, experiential exercises and different strategies of acceptance and mindfulness or Mindfulness.\n\n\nA good part of this course delves into the pillars or foundations that support Acceptance and Commitment therapy. This can be a very theoretical and sometimes dense content, but it is necessary because ACT is a different therapy from the most predominant therapies in Health Psychology, especially those belonging to the Biomedical perspective. For this reason, we will first delve into the three pillars that support Acceptance and Commitment Therapy:\n\n\nFunctional Contextualism\nThe Relational Frameworks Theory\nExperiential Avoidance Disorder or Psychological Inflexibility.\n\n\nAfter this broad introduction to the fundamentals of ACT, we will enter into the therapeutic practice of ACT. Where we will try to clarify with demonstrations of Rol Play the following topics:\n\n\nCognitive defusion\nCreative hopelessness\nAcceptance\nContact with the present moment\nClarification of personal values\nAction committed to those values\nThe question of conscious control",

If people obtain the promotional rate from Udemy, then they receive a certificate from Udemy at the completion of this course.\nIf your peak body requires a certificate from the Optimal Health Group instead, participants need to pay the normal fee of $195 from the link on our website (dualdiagnosistraining . com . au);\nIf you need a certificate from Optimal Health Group, please contact us on george@dualdiagnosistraining.com.au to enrol and pay the difference between the promotional rate and the normal $195.\nThis advanced training covers all of the current evidence based, best practice in the Alcohol & Other Drugs (AOD) and Mental Health from an integrated, holistic framework.\nIn June 2018, S.A.M.H.I. launched its 6 module, 12 hour course on Dual Diagnosis Training (www.samhi.online). This training will equip workers to be able to deliver brief & early interventions to people struggling with substance abuse and mental health issues, as well as advanced psychotherapeutic skills. This is the same as the comprehensive 2 day advanced training that is being delivered live across Australia and explained on our Dual Diagnosis Training Australian website;\nThe reason why S.A.M.H.I Dual Diagnosis Training has gone online is to expand the coverage of the highly acclaimed, comprehensive 2 day advanced Dual Diagnosis Training designed and presented by George Patriki. George and many of his staff will be still conducting live training under the banner of Dual Diagnosis Training in conjunction with the online adapted S.A.M.H.I course. We have very specifically and deliberately made this course very affordable at $195. This is half price.

This course was created to compress the most vital information into a widely-accessible and comprehensive online program that was targeted at everyone, not just academics and those experts working with PTSD on a daily basis. In order to keep it succinct, I have also included an expansive range of external links that will allow you to continue to explore PTSD at the level and depth you require.\nAre you ready to take your knowledge to the next level? In this most comprehensive course, you will learn everything you need to know about Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and will acquire substantial integrated knowledge, allowing you to take more control of your own PTSD, support your family or friends with a PTSD diagnosis in a much more informed way, or provide better preventative frameworks and positive interventions for your clients, workplace, and industry…. This course covers all of the important topics you will learn from getting a PTSD education from a University program or professional workplace course.\nThis course is taught by a highly-experienced University and College Educator with significant real world experience working clinically with people with PTSD, the families of those with PTSD, and consulting with front-line organisations committed to improving the outcomes of their personnel. This includes work within the mental health realm, as well and integrated mental and physical health interventions, and the use of evidence based adjunctive therapies including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The frameworks, concepts, knowledge, and resources used within this program closely align with those used throughout my Masters Program at Griffith University (Australia) where I specialised in the areas of disability, rehabilitation, clinical counselling and mental health, with a specific focus on Trauma and PTSD (particularly as it related to military and emergency services personnel and their families).\nPsychological and Mental Health information can be full of jargon and complicated for those who may not have a professional background in this area. I have done my best to keep the course simple and relevant, whilst providing the ability to practically integrate the new learnings into your personal life and/or professional life.\n(The Comprehensive PTSD Course copyright © 2016, of the author, Péta Phelan MRC)\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Disclaimer**  Information in this presentation is for educational purposes only.

Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\nThe course also has a thriving Facebook networking group.\n\n\nIf you would prefer to take a version of this course that is meant for individuals, not life coaches, check out the \"REBT Mindset Mastery\" course.\nBecome a Certified Rational Emotive Behavioral Life Coach!\nDo your clients have big goals and dreams but they feel like there’s always something standing in their way?\nDo you want to empower them to go for what they REALLY want and stop holding themselves back?\nDo they hold themselves back because they’re afraid of uncertainty or worried about what others will think?\nWould you like to help people overcome overwhelm, stress, or worrying?\nDo a lot of your clients seem to suffer from feelings of unworthiness?\nDo you want to help them feel confident and happy in their everyday life?\nLearn how to life coach your clients to empower their beliefs and take back control of their lives by becoming a Certified Rational Emotive Behavioral Life Coach!\nAs a life coach, you probably want nothing more than to see your clients reach their potential! You may have had the sneaky suspicion that your clients’  limiting beliefs and irrational thinking is what was holding them back, but until now you didn’t know what to do about it.\nThis course will help you guide your clients to finally feel in control of your destiny! You’ll show them how to stop trying to control other people or the outside world and instead to TAKE BACK THEIR POWER by learning how to direct their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\nThe truth is that none of us were ever told that we have super powers because we each are the owners of the most powerful machine on the planet—the human mind! We have the ability to feel happiness, no matter what is happening around us. We have the ability to learn and change ANYTHING we want about ourselves. We have the ability to create the life we truly want, yes, even if right now it seems impossible.\nWe’ve just never been taught how to use this power!\nThis course is like a human mind owner’s manual! Learn how to unlock the power of the human mind so you can teach it to your clients!\nTeach them the #1 most important thing they could ever understand about themselves, which is that their thoughts are what create their emotions.\nKnowing this puts the power back in their hands because you’ll show them how to CHOOSE THEIR THOUGHTS, and by doing so they will be able to control their emotions.\nThe reason this is so important for you to know is that no matter how motivated and talented your clients are, this human mind of theirs is FLAWED. Without training, everybody’s thinking is extremely IRRATIONAL. Including yours!\nThe reason why is that inn our brain’s quest to interpret our world and keep us safe it misinterprets what’s happening, it makes false judgments, and it demands unreasonable things from ourselves, others, and life. Plus, after years of living around dysfunctional people we pick up their faulty belief systems.\nAnd that’s why this course is so important! Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy is the foundation of modern psychology. The insights and techniques of REBT have unlocked human potential in the last century and are what ultimately differentiates those who are successful from those who are not. It’s also one of the most powerful tools to use as a life coach to help your clients rewire their faulty beliefs and rip the cause of their emotional pain out by the root!\nBecoming an REBT Life Coach will give you the tools to help your clients avoid the ultimate form of failure, which is to reach their goals but still feel unfulfilled.\nIf you already enrolled in our popular CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) course, REBT is the foundation of CBT and digs even deeper into the root beliefs that are the problem! You’re going to LOVE this! In other word REBT takes what you may know about CBT to a whole new level.\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.\nSo who are we?\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera. We’ve been studying, mastering, and teaching about the power of the mind for almost 20 years. We’re entrepreneurs and Life Coaches and we’ve worked with over 800,000+ students, Life Coaches and businesses from 200 countries.

Did you know that ACT is also a great tool for managing our own thoughts and behaviours, improving our emotions and moods on daily basis?\n\nIn this course you will take 34 informative lectures taught by UK Research Psychologist and international lecturer on Psychology & Counselling - Elmira Strange, MPhil. In this course you will find out about many interesting ACT aspects (such as 'Acceptance' and 'Identifying Your Values') that you will be able to use for yourself and when working with other people.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn for example, what ‘Psychological Flexibility’ is and why you have to develop this skill if you want to feel more satisfied with your life. You will also learn how to practice 'Mindfulness' and 'Acceptance' in your daily life so that your cognitive state became more balanced over time. You will also find out why 'chasing happiness' is not such a good idea after all and what you can do about it.\n\n\nYou will also understand how to use 'metaphors' for managing your own thoughts and emotions so that you could regain control of what you think and how you feel on daily basis.\n\nAt the end of the course you will have access to 2 BONUS Lectures: \"Stress & Anxiety Management\" and \"Psychology of Alcohol and Drug Addictions\"\n\n\nP.S.

However, you don't need to be a trauma specialist to provide trauma-informed care.\nBy empowering survivors to exercise control over their lives and decisions, they can find the power to overcome their trauma.\nNo matter what organization you work for, trauma-informed care aims to provide appropriate services for people who have experienced traumatic events.\nTrauma-informed care is all about connecting with others and providing genuine, sincere, and compassionate services for trauma survivors.\nTrauma-informed care is awareness of the prevalence of trauma and its effects on individuals. Understanding trauma gives people the knowledge they need to help trauma victims in the workplace and in everyday life.\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, or the SAMHSA, has developed the Four Rs of Trauma-informed care. Let's go through these now.\nThe First is \"Realize,\" which is realizing the widespread impact of trauma, how it affects individuals and groups, and potential paths for recovery.\nThe second is \"Recognize,\" which is recognizing the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, staff, and other affected parties.\nThe third R is \"Respond,\" which is responding to trauma by integrating knowledge about trauma policies, procedures, and practices.\nAnd lastly, there is \"Resist,\" which is resisting retraumatization of affected parties.\nI hope you are excited to get started with this course.",

People who meet you see a high achiever, an immaculate appearance, you’re never confrontational. But despite trying to do everything right, deep down you feel hollow and exhausted.\nYou feel like you’re never good enough.\nDespite trying so hard, you’re your own worst critic. Maybe you replay every situation in your head over and over, maybe your relationships feel shallow or distant.\nIf any of this sounds like you, you may be a perfectionist or a people pleaser.\nPerfectionists and people-pleasers spend enormous amounts of time and energy working to be the best, the brightest, and the nicest. They twist themselves in knots trying to be what they think they should be in order to finally feel like they’re enough--in their own eyes and in the eyes of others.\nBut at what cost?\nIn this course, Dr. Carly LeBaron explores what perfectionism and people-pleasing are, how they negatively impact your life, and how to break free from those old habits to embrace who you truly are.\nAre you ready to let go of the mask, of the fragile shell that you carry around, and replace it with real relationships, self-love, and finally feel a sense of peace?\nAre you ready to become authentic and happy?\nIn this course you’ll learn why all that trying so hard to get rid of your flaws is backfiring.

I’d like to invite you on a journey with me where you will learn how to heal psychological and emotional wounds that you may be struggling with, using practices and exercises from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)—an evidence-based psychotherapy.\nIn creating this course, I bring not just my professional knowledge from studying psychology and as the founder of Inner Path Seekers, an educational platform on life that informs and educates you on life topics that we learn little to nothing about while growing up—topics such as mental health, the mind, relationships, the body and brain, etc.\nBut, I also bring my personal understanding of these topics from picking myself up after being stuck in a very dark place myself for several years.\nWhat I mean is that I’m someone who does not just theoretically understand what I am talking about, but I am also someone who is truly familiar with serious issues, having gone through difficult times myself.\nIn this course, I will teach you what I have learned in the last 5 years of devoting my life to helping others live better: ways and techniques to heal yourself and become unstuck in life through practices and exercises used in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\nYou will receive not only a well-crafted, well-thought-out, and downloadable Workbook with various exercises and resources, but you will also enjoy pleasant animations and customized illustrations to make the whole learning process more fun and engaging.\nLastly, I want you to know that along the way, you will also have my full support as an active instructor, so please don’t hesitate to ask me any questions you may have.\nHaving provided some description about this course, I sincerely hope to welcome you in our first lesson at the start of this exciting journey, where you will learn the tools and techniques to heal yourself.\nI have taken a lot of care in creating this course, and I feel positive that it can bring a change to your life.\nJellis",

      "description": "Various studies indicate that one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. Around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill-health and disability worldwide. In terms of quality years of life lost due to disability or death, the U.S. ranks third for unipolar depressive disorders, just after China, which is ranked No.1, followed by India. As per WHO, certain mental disorders like Anxiety Disorders, including Panic Disorders, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder(OCD), Phobias, Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder(BPD), Bipolar Disorder(BD), and other mood disorders, Eating Disorders, Personality Disorders, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD) have been on the rise worldwide.  Effects of #Covid19 on the mental health of people would be gigantic. . Treatments are available, but nearly two-thirds of people with a known mental disorder never seek help from a health professional due to lack of awareness and fear of stigma.\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy, abbreviated as CBT, is a widely used therapy that helps to rectify Cognitive Distortions so that people can break through their limiting self-philosophies. It helps them live more empowered and autonomous lives by transforming their own thought process from the inside out. Cognitive Distortions are exaggerated or irrational thought patterns, a negative outlook on reality sometimes called negative schemas, involved in the onset of the perpetuation of psychopathological states of thinking, that are often inaccurate and negatively biased.\nThe negative thought patterns are potential time bombs and can cause irreparable damage to a person’s attitude and personality. Unless treated early they may lead to disappointment, frustration, anger, anxiety, and depression.\nThis course attempts to make you learn the Cognitive Distortions and apply CBT techniques to rectify the negative thoughts and facilitate the positive transformation in people and also help them to think, feel and behave positively when pursuing their goals or objectives in life. It is a beginner level course where you can easily grasp the concepts and the methodologies in simple steps. The teaching style is simple and easy so that the students can easily grasp and digest the subject. The instructor makes the students grasp the concepts step by step and guide them to complex areas of learning.\nThe course is divided into 9 sections, with one being an introduction video and the 8 sections being lessons. The sections are replete with video lectures & Demo Videos in the MP4 version, Self-Help Worksheets from well-reputed websites, reference articles, CBT Manuals, Psychology Dictionary and Self Achievement Test with answer key.\nYou can complete this ‘CBT for Treating Cognitive Distortions Course’ at your own time and pace. You can easily complete the course in 16 days by completing each section in one day and performing the self-achievement test the next day. It is ideal for first-time learners who have no idea of CBT but have a great need for the subject in their lives.",

I was brought up in an era where there wasn't a lot of understanding about dyslexia and other learning difficulties.\n\nThe major change happen when I went to an organisation in New Zealand called SPELD NZ to help me with my dyslexia. Receiving one-on-one tutoring helped my mind function more effectively. I was introduced to brain gym-type physical exercises, which I believe had a remarkable effect on my brain functioning power.\n\nThis lead me to complete a Degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture and three other diplomas in Chinese medicine.\n\nIn this course some of the exercises are modified versions of brain gym exercises and others I have learnt over the years and have found to be very effective in helping brain functions in patients and students.\n\nI have put this course together to help other people who may have learning disabilities similar to my own. By practicing these exercises it is possible experience the same life changing effects that I did.\n\nTraditional Chinese Medicine has been using Qigong exercise to increase brain functionality for thousands of years.\n\n\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN FROM THIS COURSE?\n\n\nThe differences between ADHD, ADD, Dyspraxia, Apraxia & Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\nYou will learn the signs and symptoms of Dyslexia and ADHA.\nYou will be able to complete a test to determine whether you or your child shows any symptom of these conditions.\nDuring this course you will learn 25 different exercises that could help you or your child's brain functions, memory, comprehension and cognitive power.\n\n\nEnjoy the course - I hope you get as much from these exercises as I did. They changed my life. f you have any question please ask through the course contact details.\n\n\nCheers,\nPete C",

Psychotic experiences are conceptualized as being understandable in relationship to an individual's life story, and capable of being altered when people experiment with different ways of thinking and behaving. Learn how to collaborate with people having these experiences, “exploring the evidence\" rather than imposing beliefs, and developing coping options so people are not forced to rely entirely on the often limited effectiveness of medication to address problems.\nThe course starts by examining the nature of psychosis and CBT, providing a foundation for understanding how CBT can be helpful. Then the basic style of CBT for psychosis is introduced, followed by an introduction to two of the most important techniques. Finally, applications of CBT are explored for some of the main problem areas, such as hearing distressing voices, paranoia, delusional beliefs, disorganization, and negative symptoms.\nIncluded in the course are video lectures, slides with some diagrams, video demonstrations of CBT for psychosis being practiced, and links to additional resources for further study.\nCBT for psychosis uses a minimal amount of jargon, and the concepts and practices tend to be easily understandable.\nThe course will take 6 hours to complete.",

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?\nHow common is OCD?\nThe closest estimates are that about 1 in 100 people – or between 2 to 3 million individuals - in the United States – currently have OCD. This is roughly the same number as people living in Houston, Texas.\nAt least 1 in 200 – or 500,000 – children, youth and teens have OCD. This is equal to the number of kids with diabetes. That means four or five kids with OCD are likely to be enrolled in any average size elementary school. In medium to large high schools, there can be over 20 students struggling with the problems caused from suffering from OCD.\nMen, women and children of all races and backgrounds can be affected by OCD.\nAccording to a recent Miami Herald article:\n\"Brain-imaging research has helped to uncover the brain-related dysfunction that manifests as OCD. Thus, like Alzheimer’s disease and depression, OCD is a disease of the brain. OCD can run in families; rituals can be learned by children from their parents.\"\n\"Fortunately, OCD is treatable...forms of psychotherapy can have marked success in alleviating the distress and disability associated with OCD.\"\nIn this course, Joan Kaylor takes you through effective EFT and Gentle Behavior Therapy modules, guiding you towards a better situation dealing with your compulsive thoughts.\nYou will learn the basics of EFT and Gentle Behavior Therapy. Then you will discover through experiential lectures, how this modality can affect your thoughts.\nSessions include:\nGentle EFT for Checking\nGentle EFT for Counting\nGentle EFT for Touching\nGentle EFT for Fear of Getting AIDS\nGentle EFT for Fear of Harming Others\nGentle EFT for Pure Obsessionals\nGentle EFT for Sexual Obsessions\nAnd much more...\nIf you are ready to make a change then this course is for you. If you know someone who is OCD, then this course will help you understand them better and give you tools to help you deal with them.\nWe are here at all stages to guide you with any hands-on advice that you may need - that's also all included in the course - there is nothing extra to pay! Remember, Joan been in private practice since 1994!\n\nStill unsure?\nWell, every moment you delay is now actually costing you Peace of Mind... and Udemy offers you a full \"never any questions asked\", fully unlimited, 30 day full money back guarantee.\nUdemy covers you, fully, so you are never taking any risk at all! And if you achieve a quiet mind, what is that worth to you?",

      "description": "\"I eat my feelings, I just can't help myself. I come home after a long stressful shift and I work nights sometimes so I often skip meals. I'm just so tired and stressed when I come home but I know that crisps, chocolate and wine are waiting for me. In the moment I feel better.. but the guilt kicks in afterwards.\"\nDoes this sound like you?\nMany people struggle with emotional eating or 'comfort eating' and use food as a self-soothing mechanism for strong emotions.\nThe difficulty with emotional eating, is that our society shames people for comfort eating, and then pushes them towards dieting or restricting food in an attempt to curb food intake or counter-act emotional eating.\nThis approach actually exacerbates it and often leads to further eating problems (like binge eating disorder, for example).\nThe approach we take in this course (and the exact approach I use with my coaching clients) is to first increase your emotional awareness through mindfulness and meditation and then help you understand the purpose of even the most negative emotions you feel. We then look at how to build alternative coping strategies to meet your emotional needs and finish off by setting life goals instead of weight-based goals.\nIn taking this approach, you will no longer feel shamed for comfort eating, or destroy your relationship with food further by dieting. Instead you will feel free of food anxiety, empowered to meet your emotional needs and able to take control of your life path.\nAfter taking this course you will:\nUnderstand what is meant by 'Emotional Eating'\nUnderstand the difference between Binge Eating Disorder and emotional eating.\nBe able to recognise emotional hunger and tell it apart from physical hunger\nRecognise how emotional eating is benefiting you (yep, really). In this lesson, we look at what you're getting from emotional eating, so that we know specifically what it is we need to seek from other sources, in order to overcome emotional eating.\nUnderstanding your emotions, the purpose of them and the symptoms of them to help you label what you're really feeling.\nRecognise the full spectrum of emotions you may be feeling in a situation - this will help increase your emotional awareness.\nRecognise your beliefs about emotions - this lesson and exercise will help explain why you're trying to avoid or distract yourself from particular emotions and help you view your emotions differently so that you're not afraid to feel them.\nNotice your emotions and triggers - in this exercise, we'll practice noticing the emotions and actions you take in an emotive situation. We'll then reflect on how to interpret and respond to the event differently in the future.\nDevelop a basic plan of self-care and understand why it's so important for your emotional health\nDevelop coping strategies for difficult emotions - this is where we put in place alternatives to emotional eating.\nBe able to carry out a holistic life assessment. In this lesson, we'll look at the different areas of your life to see where you may be lacking in satisfaction and pleasure (causing you to rely heavily on food as a source of pleasure).\nHave drawn up action plans for the other areas of your life. This is a huge step, but it'll encourage you to take massive action towards improving your life overall and getting as much satisfaction and pleasure from your life as possible (without having to resort to food).\nIncluded in the course:\n12 Video lessons and exercises. These are kept short and to the point so that you can easily fit it into a busy life and take action straight away.\n3 PDF workbooks [Including digitally fillable versions]  for you to download and work through, containing all the worksheets and cheat sheets you'll need.\nUnderstanding Your Emotions\nSelf-Care\nLife Assessment.\nAn additional PDF guide to seeking Professional Support for disordered eating and mental wellbeing.\nA special (free!) bonus for you at the end of the course to help you with body image, binge eating, yo-yo dieting and more.\n\"The emotional eating [course] was LIFE CHANGING for me! I never realised that comfort eating was benefiting me on some level but it all makes sooo much sense for me now. I've been working really hard the last few months to tune into my emotions and pick apart my thoughts to figure out what I really need (it isn't wine - who knew! haha!). The worry journal exercise has stuck with me the most, it's been so helpful, thank you so much for all your help and the videos and workbooks!)\"\n\n- A client from The Health Mindset Programme, May 2018",

It not only explains these skills but gives examples on how to use these skills to change behaviours, reduce symptoms of mental illnesses, manage emotions and gain insights. It illustrates how mindfulness is far more than just a practice of watching your breath or scanning your body: The relevant skills can be used to increase conscious awareness and to have more control. This course also explains how mindfulness from a DBT perspective can bring us back to reality with \"observing\" and \"describing\", because typically we believe and react to the false stories our minds create. These stories are a part of any mental illness and any emotional distress that we experience, so learning how to unhook from our thoughts is a powerful way of reducing suffering.

      "description": "Presenter: Dr. J. Eric Gentry, Ph.D., LMHC, F.A.A.E.T.S.\nWhile the focus of Trauma Competency for the 21st Century was to acquire the basic skills for treating post traumatic stress, the focus of the Complex PTSD training is acquiring skills for effectively treating those challenging clients with complex post traumatic stress, or C-PTSD. C-PTSD can present with a myriad of difficult symptoms including intense abreactions/flashbacks; severe “depression-like” shutdown and avoidance; dissociation; relational difficulties and challenges; chronic emotional and somatic dysregulation; chronic pain; and psychotic symptoms. This course provides comprehensive presentation of clinical skills for screening/assessing, stabilizing, skills-building, and treating complex post traumatic stress in all its challenging presentations. Focusing upon working in a tri-phasic model, the participant will learn how to titrate treatment to minimize discomfort and crises while, at once, accelerating treatment gains in early, mid and latter stages of treatment. The course provides a balance of current evidence/science-based interventions and protocols paired with experiential practice wisdom from clinicians who have successfully worked with population for decades. Participants completing this course will discover a newfound sense of competency and excitement for working with these clients who, in the past, have baffled even seasoned clinicians.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n1.

      "description": "--------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE COURSE DESCRIPTION:\n--------------------------------------------------------\nWelcome to our informative course about Dialectical Behavior Therapy or DBT. I'm excited to introduce you to this vital topic and teach you how psychologists use this type of therapy to help patients.\nWhile psychologists often use dialectical behavior therapy, they aren't the only ones who will benefit from this knowledge. Social workers, professional counselors, educators, school personnel, mental health professionals, clinicians, health and human service practitioners, and other health care professionals can all utilize DBT.\nIn this course, I'll teach you what DBT is and how to become a trained dialectical behavior therapist. I'll also discuss techniques employed by DBT therapists, including psychotherapy, mindfulness training, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and more.\nLater on, we’ll examine how DBT can be used to treat various mental illnesses, including depression, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, substance abuse, and eating disorders.\nLastly, we'll discuss some case studies to illustrate DBT's effectiveness.\nI hope you're excited to begin this course and learn everything there\nis to know about dialectical behavior therapy. Thanks for being here.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nDBT stands for Dialectical Behavior Therapy.\n\n\nThe word \"Dialectical\" references two things that appear to be opposites but are both true.\n\n\nFor example, a person with mental illness has to accept that they have a mental illness. They also need to go to therapy to learn skills to cope or rid themselves of mental illness. So, the \"dialectical\" aspect is that patients must accept their mental illness and want to get better simultaneously.\n\n\nDBT therapists look at opposing sides of a patient and accept them both as true. The therapist's goal is to change the patient and try to accept them at the same time. Within this balance is where they find true healing.\n\n\nPeople with suicidal tendencies and Borderline Personality Disorder or BPD were the original targets for DBT therapy. Eventually, it was found that DBT could be adapted to address various mental health issues.\n\n\nThey found that DBT was able to help patients gain the skills to manage their thoughts, emotions, and actions.\n\n\nLater, therapists began incorporating other therapeutic strategies into DBT, including cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, meditation, behaviorism techniques, and dialectics. Combining these techniques into a structured program was a novel development that resulted in a better patient experience.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nWho are the Instructors?\nYour instructor, Michael Gutierrez, is a certified counseling professional!\nWith over 12 years of teaching and training experience, he is here to help you learn! This course sums up his 12 years of learning. Imagine the value every hour holds for you.

      "description": "In the US in 2015, one person died of suicide every 11.9 minutes and one senior died of it every one hour and six minutes. Also in 2015, there were more than 1 million suicide attempts in US or one suicide attempt every 29 seconds. In fact, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death, and among young people, it was the 2nd leading cause of death.\nWith these relevant facts, first aid for suicide prevention is crucial. While first aid is widely recognized and used for common physical problems, such as bleeding and choking, it is not well established and commonly used among psychological or mental disturbances.\n\nIn this lecture, Dr. Rayel introduces the CARE Approach as first aid for suicide prevention. Unlike other approaches, this CARE approach is a practical four-step process with both assessment and intervention prongs. Assessment is necessary to recognize the signs and intervention prong is important to prevent suicide through various first aid strategies.\nMoreover, Dr. Rayel discusses the warning signs and risk factors of suicide. He also explores and talks about some of the relaxation and coping strategies to prevent and to deal with early or worsening mental problems.\nTopics include the following:\n1. The CARE Approach as first aid for suicide prevention - This practical approach has both assessment and intervention prongs, and follows four basic yet crucial steps in dealing with mental problems and suicidality.\n2. Warning signs of suicide - Severe mental problems, feelings of hopelessness, agitated and risky behavior, preoccupation with death, among others are warning signs of suicide.\n3. Risk factors of suicide - Major suicide risk factors, such as mental disturbances, psychiatric disorders, medical problems, medications, and substances, are discussed.\n3. Relaxation and Coping Mechanisms - Interventions discussed include breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, diversion, socialization, sleep hygiene, among other coping strategies.\nIf you or your loved one suffers from mental disturbance, then first Aid strategies to prevent suicide is very important to learn.",

      "description": "Nitrous oxide course for Dentists & Dental Hygienists - Guide to Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen Minimal Conscious Sedation or PAN Sedation: Theoretical Basis of Practice. By Dr Mark A. Gillman (updated September 2024)\n\n\nThis nitrous oxide course (laughing gas) is a comprehensive, clear textbook/ workshop manual giving the theoretical knowledge on how to use PAN also known as minimal sedation with nitrous oxide/oxygen for medical and dental applications ((Nitrous oxide course for Dentists & Dental Hygienists)\n\n\n· It is particularly useful for minor medical and dental procedures which are accompanied by anxiety and/or pain.\n· It has applications in medicine for treatment of acute substance abuse withdrawal states and for diagnostic and therapeutic use in other neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression.\n· The basic slide format with commentary enables practitioners to proceed at their own pace absorbing the essential theory and once they have done so, rapidly learn the practical technique during hands-on training.\n\n\nPAN is also known as inhalation sedation or relative analgesia. This Nitrous oxide course for Dentists & Dental Hygienists  - (laughing gas) (Nitrous oxide course for Dentists & Dental Hygienists)  aims to give physicians, dentist and suitably qualified nurses the theoretical basis on which the technique is based. Like any surgical procedure replace hands-on training which takes no more that 2-3 hours to acquire practical skills once the practitioner is thoroughly familiar with the theoretical aspects, which are given in sufficient detail in the presentation to enable trainees to rapidly be taught to administer the gases practically. The training must be done with either a dental practitioner who is experienced with the technique of PAN in their daily practice or some other registered practitioner who is also well-schooled in the use of nitrous oxide/oxygen minimal sedation. Anaesthesiologists are not usually suitable because practitioners to teach PAN sedation, because they normally use much higher concentrations of nitrous oxide for anaesthesia and seldom use PAN in their practices. The crucial difference is that during anaesthesia the subject is unconscious, while during PAN sedation the consciousness of the subject is little obtunded so that they can readily understand and comply with verbal instructions. For those interested, Dr Gillman is available to train practitioners in South Africa or anywhere else in the world. He can be contacted at mag@iafrica.com.\nThis current 4th edition is largely based on the previous editions, which had a similar title which has been successfully sold in South Africa and the rest of Africa as well as various countries in Europe and elsewhere.

      "description": "The Childhood Trauma Healer & Space Holder [Accredited] course is a powerful, in-depth training for those ready to understand, heal, and transform childhood trauma—both within themselves and in others. Taught by clinically registered psychologist Yee Lin and medicine man Gabriel Castillo of Finally Detached, this program bridges the science of trauma with the sacred art of spiritual healing.\nThis course was created for those who feel the call to serve others in their deepest moments of vulnerability and emotional release. Trauma doesn’t just live in the mind—it lives in the body, the nervous system, and the energetic field. In this program, students are initiated into the dual language of healing: the clinical language of psychology and nervous system regulation, and the spiritual language of presence, energy, and sacred space holding.\nThrough Gabriel’s guidance, you’ll learn how plant medicine and shamanic practices can complement trauma-informed techniques to awaken profound breakthroughs. With Yee Lin’s clinical training and therapeutic lens, you’ll receive grounded, evidence-based insights into how trauma forms, how it expresses itself in behavior, and how to gently walk someone back to safety.\nStudents will explore the origins and patterns of childhood trauma, including emotional neglect, physical abuse, attachment wounding, and complex trauma. You'll learn how to identify trauma responses—like dissociation, hypervigilance, and emotional shutdown—and how to compassionately hold space when clients begin to confront these wounds.\nTogether, we dive deep into practical methods like:\nSomatic therapy for nervous system regulation and body awareness\nGuided visualizations to reconnect with the inner child\nTrauma-informed communication to create safety with words\nEnergy work and sacred space practices to hold space without absorbing others’ pain\nPlant medicine integration frameworks for those facilitating or supporting entheogenic healing\nThis course isn’t just educational—it’s transformational. As you learn to guide others, you’ll also be walking yourself through your own inner terrain. Every lesson is an opportunity to remember, release, and rewire. You will emerge not only as a facilitator, but as someone who has walked the healing path and now carries medicine in their words, their presence, and their way of being.\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nUnderstand the deep-rooted effects of childhood trauma on behavior, relationships, and self-perception\nMaster the tools to facilitate healing in both individual and group settings\nLearn how to hold grounded, compassionate, and energetically clean space for clients\nReceive an accredited certification to elevate your work as a coach, therapist, guide, or wellness practitioner\nEmbody the sacred responsibility of space holder—one who leads with heart, wisdom, and presence\nThis course is ideal for therapists, life coaches, plant medicine facilitators, bodyworkers, energy healers, and anyone who feels called to trauma-informed healing. Whether you are new to this path or looking to deepen your mastery, this course provides the structure, insight, and soul-centered wisdom to support your evolution.\nWe welcome you into this sacred training—where modern psychology meets ancestral wisdom, and where your own healing becomes the key to helping others heal.",

      "description": "****Course updated January, 2016!****\nJoan Kaylor stopped pulling out her hair in 1989. She has been helping children, teens and adults stop pulling hair and picking skin since 1994 when she became a professional counselor. Trichotillomania and Dermatillomania are body focused repetitive behaviors. They regulate emotions and help to soothe when we are upset, overwhelmed, bored or stressed. Joan considers pulling and picking to be addictions.\nThe treatment is completely different from obsessive compulsive disorders. Healing from an addiction is work. It can be done. In this course, Joan will teach you strategies to let go of the urges and counseling for the shame and depression and family stress that come with Trich and picking.\nJoan Kaylor has treated 1000's of individuals and families with Trichotillomania and Dermatillomania.\nThere is lots of hope and through EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), Joan will take you through a gentle process to relieve your urges to pull your hair or pick at your skin.\nTrichotillomania and Dermatillomania\nTrichotillomania (trick-o-til-o-MAY-nee-ah) is a disorder that causes people to pull out the hair from their scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows, pubic area, underarms, beard, chest, legs or other parts of the body, resulting in noticeable bald patches. Hair pulling varies greatly in its severity, location on the body, and response to treatment. For some people, at some times, Trichotillomania is mild and can be quelled with a bit of extra awareness and concentration. For others, at times the urge may be so strong that it makes thinking of anything else nearly impossible.\nSkin Picking Disorder (also known as Excoriation Disorder or SPD) is a serious and poorly understood problem. People who suffer from SPD repetitively touch, rub, scratch, pick at, or dig into their skin, often in an attempt to remove small irregularities or perceived imperfections. This behavior may result in skin discoloration or scarring. In more serious cases, severe tissue damage and visible disfigurement can result.\nTrichotillomania may affect as much as 12% of the population. Women are four times more likely to be affected than men.\nSymptoms usually begin before age 17. The hair may come out in round patches or across the scalp. The effect is an uneven appearance. The person may pluck other hairy areas, such as the eyebrows, eyelashes, or body hair.\nThese symptoms are usually seen in children:\nAn uneven appearance to the hair\nBare patches or all around (diffuse) loss of hair\nBowel blockage (obstruction) if people eat the hair they pull out\nConstant tugging, pulling, or twisting of hair\nDenying the hair pulling\nHair regrowth that feels like stubble in the bare spots\nIncreasing sense of tension before the hair pulling\nOther self-injury behaviors\nSense of relief, pleasure, or gratification after the hair pulling\nMost people with this disorder also have problems with:\nFeeling sad or depressed\nAnxiety\nPoor self image\nFor some, Trichotillomania is a lifelong disorder. However, treatment often reduces the hair pulling and the feelings of depression, anxiety, or poor self image.",

      "description": "If you or your client is living with an overwhelmed nervous system, the vagus nerve is likely weak.\nThis can make it challenging to regulate your emotions and triggers.\nHowever, according to leading trauma expert Dr. Stephen Porges, the key to supporting the nervous system in moving to a calm and more regulated state is through the vagus nerve.\nFurthermore, the vagus nerve is the main nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system, responsible for helping the body return to a state of balance (Breit et al., 2018).\nThis is why if one’s vagus nerve is weak, it is harder for one to regulate their emotions (Breit et al., 2018; Porges et al., 1994).\nWhereas a higher vagal tone is associated with emotional stability and resilience (Porges et al., 1994).\nThe vagus nerve is one of the longest branches of nerves in the body, which communicates information from our vital organs back to the brain (Breit et al., 2018).\nThankfully, there is a way to increase the tone of the vagus nerve to support you in moving to a place of emotional stability.\nFor this reason, Rewire Trauma Therapy has brought together our top experts in the field of Polyvagal Theory to create this specialized program featuring over 14 different 10-minute vagal toning techniques and 7 theory modules.\nThousands of people and therapists who have purchased this program have reported seeing noticeable improvements from their first week of integrating these 10-minute techniques into their daily routine.\nTherefore, with these techniques and enough time, we believe that you can help yourself and your clients restore feelings of safety and groundedness within the body and nervous system after surviving trauma or chronic stress.\n\n\nEmail us to enquire about receiving CE credit.",

      "description": "\"I suffered from severe depression, stress and anxiety as a result of financial problems. This ended my 16 year marriage and caused me health problems resulting in 14 operations over a 7 year period on my vocal cords. Often I was unable to speak.\nI hit rockbottom, so I took my myself on a journey and I discovered how to solve all my mental health issues. Now I am in control of my life and know the secrets to mastering mental health.\nAll my problems have gone and my life is now brilliant.\nI am now sharing my secrets to help over 100,000 people get control back over their lives and master their mental health. I hope this includes you.\" marc\n****** IF YOU HAVE DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY OR ANOTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE IT FEELS LIKE YOU LIFE IS STUCK ******\n*******  THIS COURSE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO KICK START YOUR LIFE  *******\nThis course has been specifically designed to help all those people whose life is being ruined because of stress, depression, anxiety or any other mental health condition.\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  THIS COURSE WILL WORK FOR EVERYONE IF YOU DO WHAT I SAY  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nHowever, this course is NOT for everyone. This is because I take a no nonsense approach, I am brutally honest and tell you exactly what you must do to master your mental health. I will tell you that your problems are actually an illusion, I will prove it to you and you will see for yourself that I am right. The tools and techniques I give you take less than 60 seconds and you will quickly see your perceived problems just disappear.\nHaving helped 1,000's of people, I have learned there are three types of people.\nType 1 : Those who do what I say and they master their mental health, and their lives are great.\nType 2 : Those who say they will do what I say, but in the end do nothing.  Their lives remain crap.\nType 3 : Those who like moaning about their problems, worrying and feeling crap.\n<<<<<<<<   IF YOU ARE A TYPE 1 PERSON, YOU WILL LOVE THIS COURSE AND IT WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE AMAZING  >>>>>>>>>\nIf you are type 2 or 3 person, don't buy this course because you are wasting your time and money.\n\n\nThis course is built on three simple principles :\nPRINCIPLE 1 : CONTROL - the reason why so many people suffer mental health issues is because they have given away control over different aspects of their lives - relationships, health, money, confidence etc. In this course you will learn that you were given control over your life when you were born, but due to bad experiences and bad decisions you have lost confidence resulting in you giving that control to other people.\nI put you back in CONTROL of your life with an incredibly powerful technique in under 60 seconds.\nThis is important because it means you can then feel the difference between your life now which can be 'crap', and feeling STRONG AND AMAZING after my technique.\nPRINCIPLE 2 : CHOICE - it is impossible for the two opposite things to exist in the space at the same time - like being warm and cold. I will teach you the power of choice and because you have control back over your life, you will be able to make choices that totally benefit you.\nFor example, you can choose to feel sad and down or great and excited.\nWhen you choose to be 'excited' it is impossible to feel depressed.  I will give you my personal secret tools to give you the strength to make CHOICES that make you life amazing.\nPRINCIPLE 3 : PURPOSE - when you have mental health issues, it often feels like you have no direction in life. This is principally because all your perceived problems mean you have lost sight of your purpose. Its like getting lost in the woods and unable to find the path out.\nIn this course I will show you your purpose in life and how to build that purpose back into your daily life. This means from when you wake up, your life will feel great because you have a purpose and a direction to that day.\nTHE COURSE\nThe course is structured in to the following sections :\nKNOWLEDGE - if you are going to build a house, you need a solid foundation or it will fall over. So to master your mental health, you need valuable knowledge as that foundation on how life works. Therefore I will tell you :\nYour purpose in life and why you are here\nHow the spiritual world wants to help you 24/7 make your life amazing\n5 DAY MASTERING PLAN - every day comes with the a valuable 'mastering' lesson, a powerful exercise you must do and a programme for that day. The 5 days cover the following valuable lessons :\nWANT - know the 50 things you want in life, instead of focusing on everything that you don't want\nCONTROL - powerful technique that puts you back in control of your life\nCHOICE - giving you the inner strength to make the choices that really benefit you\nEXCITED - this is the key that unlocks the door to eternal happiness\nPURPOSE - define yours and suddenly your life has meaning, direction and wonderful things happen\n11 COPING TECHNIQUES - because every one is different, I have created 11 different coping techniques that you can use to deal with anxieties, stresses, depression moments or times when you feel down and want to feel great again.\nEach technique is short (like 60 seconds) and powerful. You pick the one(s) you like and feel the difference immediately.\n21 DAY HABIT PLAN - when you have mental health problems, it also means you have developed bad habits like focusing on problems or looking for the worst in situations. I have created a daily plan that is simple, easy , makes you feel great and puts you back in control of your life.\nWhen you do this plan for 21 days, you develop habits that support a fabtastic life where you have no mental health problems.\nIts just like re-programming your life, but doing it in just 21 days.\nDAILY SUPPORT - all my students are able to join my facebook page where you receive daily support, inspiration, motivation and training to make sure your life is amazing each and every day.\n*******    YOU MUST KNOW MAKE A CHOICE  *******\nDO NOTHING AND YOUR LIFE WILL REMAIN CRAP     or      BUY THIS COURSE AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER\n\"I do hope you can join me on a fantastic journey where I am able to help you master your mental health and make YOUR LIFE totally amazing (like mine).\n'Stay excited.\"\nmarc",

      "description": "We found some techniques to help our students understand and appreciate them. First, we realized that psychology actually did matter to our students, but that we needed to make it clear to them why it did. We therefore created a more consistent focus on the theme of behavior. One of the most fundamental integrating principles of the discipline of psychology is its focus on behavior, and yet that is often not made clear to students. Affect, cognition, and motivation are critical and essential, and yet are frequently best understood and made relevant through their links with behavior.\nThe sympathetic nervous system matters because it has specific and predictable influences onour behavior. Piaget’s findings matter because they help us understand the child’s behavior (not just his or her thinking). And social cognition matters because our social thinking helps us better relate to the other people in our everyday social lives. We emphasized that what seems true might not be true, and we need to try to determine whether it is. The idea of empirical research testing falsifiable hypotheses and explaining much(but never all) behavior—the idea of psychology as a science was critical, and it helped me differentiate psychology from other disciplines. Another reason for emphasizing empiricism is that the Introduction to Psychology course represents many students’ best opportunity to learn about the fundamentals of scientific research.\nThis course is designed to facilitate these learning outcomes. We have used three techniques to help focus students on behavior:\n1. Chapter openers. Begin our focus on behavior by opening each chapter with a chapter opener showcasing an interesting real-world example of people who are dealing with behavioral questions and who can use psychology to help them answer those questions. The opener is designed to draw the student into the chapter and create an interest in learning about the topic.\n2. Psychology in everyday life. Each chapter contains one or two features designed to link the principles from the chapter to real-world applications in business, environment, health, law, learning, and other relevant domains. For instance, the application in Chapter 6 \"Growing and Developing\"—“What Makes a Good Parent?”—applies the concepts of parenting styles, and the application in Chapter 3 \"Brains, Bodies, and Behavior\" is about the difficulties that left-handed people face performing everyday tasks in a right-handed world.\n3. Research focus. We have also emphasized empiricism throughout, but without making it a distraction from the main story line.

      "description": "\"Research shows that happiness is not something we stumble upon—it’s something we cultivate. And the science behind it is more powerful than you might think.\" – Martin Seligman, father of Positive Psychology\nIn a world constantly searching for meaning and joy, understanding the science of happiness and wellbeing is more essential than ever. Did you know that positive emotions are scientifically linked to improved physical health, stronger relationships, and even longer life? According to Harvard’s 75-year Study of Adult Development, meaningful relationships and positive emotions are the two most significant predictors of a happy and healthy life. Now, imagine if you could tap into that knowledge and create a life filled with joy, purpose, and resilience.\nWelcome to Positive Psychology | The Science of Wellbeing and Happiness—a transformative course designed to help you unlock the secrets to leading a fulfilling life. This course goes beyond theory and dives deep into the scientific principles that drive happiness and wellbeing. You’ll learn how positive emotions, relationships, personal strengths, and mindfulness can drastically improve the quality of your life—and how to apply these insights to your everyday experiences.\nWe begin with a foundational understanding of positive psychology, a branch of psychology that shifts the focus from illness to flourishing. Unlike traditional psychology, which often focuses on dysfunction, positive psychology explores how we can live happier, more fulfilled lives. You’ll be introduced to key figures like Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, pioneers who have helped shape this field, and you’ll gain a clear understanding of how the science of happiness has evolved.\nAt the heart of this course is the science of happiness itself. What really makes us happy? Is happiness just a fleeting emotion, or can it be a sustainable state of being? We’ll explore the theories of happiness—the difference between hedonic happiness (pleasure-based) and eudaimonic happiness (meaning-based)—and look at groundbreaking studies like the Harvard Study of Adult Development, which shows that good relationships contribute to greater life satisfaction than wealth or fame.\nBut life isn’t always smooth sailing. That’s why we’ll explore the essential skill of resilience—the ability to bounce back from adversity. You’ll discover how overcoming challenges can actually increase your wellbeing, and you’ll be equipped with evidence-based strategies like cognitive restructuring to turn difficulties into opportunities for growth. In fact, research shows that resilient individuals have higher levels of happiness and self-esteem, even in the face of life’s toughest moments.\nYou’ll also learn about the powerful state of flow, a state of deep engagement in an activity that brings about extraordinary satisfaction and fulfillment. Csikszentmihalyi’s research on flow reveals that people who experience flow regularly report higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction. This course will teach you how to identify and cultivate more of these flow experiences in your life, boosting your overall engagement and happiness.\nNo one is an island, and our relationships are key to our wellbeing. Research shows that people with positive relationships are not only happier but also live longer and have better mental health. In this course, you’ll learn how to build and maintain healthy, supportive relationships through essential skills like empathy, active listening, and positive communication. These tools will help you nurture deeper connections with family, friends, colleagues, and loved ones.\nA life filled with meaning and purpose is the hallmark of true wellbeing. But how do we find meaning? How do we align our lives with our deepest values and passions? This course will dive into existential psychology and provide you with the tools to craft a life filled with purpose—whether through career, relationships, or personal goals. Studies show that people who live in alignment with their core values report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness.\nMindfulness is a transformational practice that is at the core of positive psychology. Not only does mindfulness reduce stress, it has been shown to enhance cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, and physical health. In this course, we’ll show you how to incorporate mindfulness into your daily life with practical exercises that will help you be present, calm, and aware of your thoughts and feelings.\nAs we wrap up, we’ll address the ethical considerations of positive psychology and explore emerging trends in the field. Is there a danger in focusing too much on happiness? How can we ensure that the pursuit of wellbeing is inclusive, ethical, and sustainable? These are just some of the questions we’ll explore in the final sections of the course.\nWhether you're a psychology student, a mental health professional, or simply someone eager to create a life full of happiness and meaning, this course offers invaluable insights backed by scientific research. Through engaging lectures, interactive activities, and reflective exercises, you’ll embark on a transformative journey of personal growth, gaining tools that will not only improve your life but also help you positively impact those around you.\nHappiness is a skill you can cultivate. Let’s start this journey together. Join us and unlock the power of positive psychology to transform your life and the lives of those around you.",

      "description": "As well as being autistic, the course tutor, Dan Jones, has worked as a psychological therapist and worked supporting children/teens and families for over 20 years.\nBetween 1 in 68 and 1 in 100 people are autistic, many autistic adults are undiagnosed and may not even realise they could be autistic. Any counsellor or other psychological therapist in full-time practice is likely to encounter diagnosed and undiagnosed autistic clients. It could be that the client doesn't realise they are autistic and most counselling and therapy training doesn't cover autism, so the therapist also may not realise that the client could be autistic, yet knowledge of this could lead to better outcomes for that client and greater awareness of what support and guidance would be helpful.\nThis course may also be of interest to those who don't do psychological therapy but who want to know more about how autism presents and what the world is like for autistic people and how autism can impact on problems people have and better understanding behaviours you observe. This course focuses more on working with autistic adults rather than on working with autistic children.\nIncluded with this course are:\n11 PDF supporting documents totalling over 18,000 words of additional content\nA PDF of my autobiography 'Look Into My Eyes' about being autistic which is over 68,500 words\nA PDF Sussex Hypnotherapy Centre certificate of completion which you can print out for Continued Professional Development\n\"I am autistic and I have over 20 years of experience working with autistic individuals of all ages and working within a variety of contexts from care homes for adults, care homes for children and teens, to working with families, couples and individuals in private practice. In this course I share my knowledge and insights around autism as a professional and an autistic individual.\nI share the different challenges and traits autistic people have and how these can manifest and impact on the problem the client is presenting with, how they can manifest and impact on the therapy and how you can work with the client and present your therapy to get the best results. You will also have an idea of the kinds of things which clients may say and do that lead you as a therapist to feel that they could be autistic.\"\nThis isn't a course teaching you how to do therapy, the expectation is that you are already trained to do therapy if you are working as a therapist. This course teaches you about the traits, challenges and strengths of autistic clients and how the client being autistic can impact on their life and on how they respond in therapy to give you ideas about understanding autistic clients better and have ideas for how you can best help them.\nThe course doesn't teach you how to 'treat' autism as autism isn't something you can cure. Autistic people are born autistic and can't be 'cured' of the autism, but I am open about my own personal experiences within the course and share my own examples and examples of experiences of people I have worked with to illustrate what behaviours others might see and what is going on for the autistic person in that moment, and what things can help the autistic person, like what skills they might need to be taught to reduce the impact of certain challenges the client may have on the presenting problem.",

      "description": "Various studies indicate that one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. Around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill-health and disability worldwide. In terms of quality years of life lost due to disability or death, China is ranked on top in the world followed by India and the USA. As per WHO, certain mental disorders like Anxiety Disorders, including panic disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder(OCD), Phobias, Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder(BPD), Bipolar Disorder(BD), and other mood disorders, Eating Disorders, Personality Disorders, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD) have been on the rise worldwide, especially due to #Covid19. Treatments are available, but nearly two-thirds of people with a known mental disorder never seek help from a health professional due to unawareness and social stigma. It is therefore important to spread awareness of the mental disease and prevent its aggravation through timely intervention.\nDBT or Dialectical Behaviour Therapy is a specialized, useful, and time tested method to treat various trauma-related mental disorders. It works exceedingly well in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Panic Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, etc. DBT incorporates a philosophical process called dialectics. Dialectics is based on the concept that everything is composed of opposites and that change occurs when there is a \"dialogue\" between opposing forces. It is also useful to treat people experiencing difficulty with emotional regulation or are exhibiting self-destructive behaviours and having thoughts of suicide.\nThis course attempts to make you learn the basic DBT concepts and techniques and apply them to help people in their work environment, neighbourhood, and family to overcome the ill effects of mental disorders. It is a beginner level course where you can easily grasp the concepts and the methodologies in simple steps. The teaching style is simple and easy so that the students can easily grasp and digest the subject. The instructor makes the students grasp the key concepts step by step and guide them to complex areas of learning.\nThe course is divided into 9 sections, with one being an introduction video and the 8 sections being lessons. The sections are replete with video lectures & Demo Videos in MP4 version, Self-Help Worksheets from well-reputed websites, reference articles, DBT Manuals, Psychology Dictionary and Self Achievement Test with answer key. This course is not a substitute for university-approved courses but it acts as an aid for quicker learning.\nYou can complete this Beginner Level Course ‘DBT for Treatment of Trauma' at your own time and pace. You can easily complete the course in 16 days by completing each section in one day and performing the Self-Achievement Test the next day.

      "description": "When you’re super emotional the thinking part of your brain essentially shuts down. That’s why when you’re upset you say things or do things that you later regret.\nI’m Emma McAdam, a Licensed Therapist, and welcome to The Coping Skills and Self-Care Course.\nIn this course you’re going to learn what most people don’t teach about coping skills- that they don’t really work on their own. That’s because coping skills need to be used in conjunction with emotion processing skills and self care skills in order to create lasting change. You’ll learn essential skills to manage intense emotions, calm the stress response, and develop a self-care practice that keeps you from burning out.\nThis course is for anyone who’s struggling with intense feelings of Anger, Sadness, Anxiety, Stress, or Discouragement. Most people only have one or two skills to deal with emotions- like eating, venting or avoiding them.  Within the first 30 minutes you’ll learn dozens of strategies to manage those intense feelings and help you calm down when emotions run high.\nBy the end of the course you’ll know over a hundred ways you can self-soothe or cope with emotions. In the first section of this course you’ll learn about four different types of Coping Skills:\nEmotion Coping Skills,\nRelaxation Skills,\nSensory Coping skills, and\nDistraction Coping Skills.\nEach section will have an explanation, a list of skills, and an exercise you can try.\nIn the second section of this course you’ll learn about Self-Care, creating habits that lead to a sustainable life.  You’ll learn to take care of your body and mind in a way that renews your energy, resolves emotions, improves relationships and helps you move forward with joy and purpose.\nCoping skills and self care work together to help you handle all that life has to throw at you.  Coping skills help you feel better in the short term, and can keep you from acting impulsively. They are essential when you’re overwhelmed with intense emotions.  But, to be most effective and to find lasting solutions to problems, they need to be paired with Self-Care skills.\nSo sign up now to begin learning right away.",

      "description": "This is a comprehensive, in-depth, academic, yet easy-to understand introductory course which is jam-packed with 32 topics relevant to the study of self-harm and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI).\nSadly, non-suicidal self-injury has become a common behavior used by children, teens, and adults for coping with their emotional distress. Most people erroneously equate self-injurious behaviors with suicidality, but this is not always true. Self-injurers have to be treated differently than suicidal people.  Moreover, self-injurers need to know that is much hope for them to recover, and that there are people-helpers who can support them in their journey towards having a more positive and meaningful life.\nThis certificated course will help you: (1) Understand the mindset and behaviors of people who injure themselves. (2) Assess self-injurious behaviors from the self-injurer's perspective. (3) Learn how to help people who injure themselves.\nThis course is NOT for you if you are depressed, self-injurious, or suicidal.\nThis is NOT a self-help course for people who are depressed, self-injurious, or suicidal.\nThis is NOT a skills-building course because skills-building is best done under supervision of a mental health professional in onsite, in-person workshops.\nThis course is taught by a doctor of both psychiatry and psychology who has had more than 25 years of clinical experience in helping people overcome and heal from their self-injurious tendencies and behaviors.",

Most people don't notice how prevalent metaphor use is when we communicate. In therapy or coaching clients will be communicating in metaphors to the therapist or coach. These metaphors and other information the client shares can be used to develop hypnotic healing stories which can be told to the client to help them move forward and overcome their problem.\nThe brain works largely by recognising patterns, this means that stories are one of the most powerful ways to help someone overcome their challenges as you can craft and tell stories which match the pattern of the clients problem and desired solution to help the client learn non-consciously what needs to be done to move forward from their situation.\nIn this course you will learn:\nHow to identify metaphors, patterns and content that clients share\nHow to use this information to create therapeutic stories and metaphors\nMy process for presenting stories and metaphors to clients that I find most effective\nI also include in the course a free copy of my Ericksonian Hypnotherapy Training Tool which you can download and use to practice creating therapeutic stories for clients with various problems.",

      "description": "This comprehensive course containing almost 1.5 hours of carefully curated unique video content illustrates in depth a therapeutic technique called 'paradoxical intention' (PI), which was developed by Prof Viktor Frankl, MD, PhD, the world-renowned Austrian psychiatrist, philosopher, Holocaust survivor, author of the internationally acclaimed Man's Search for Meaning, and the founder of logotherapy and existential analysis, regarded as the third Viennese school of psychotherapy after Freud and Adler. It is an evidence-based, scientific technique specifically designed for fears, phobias, anxiety, sexual dysfunctions, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, with a clinical success rate of over 78%. The material presented here will be of interest to both mental health professionals, but even more so to sufferers themselves and their families, especially when taking into consideration the devastating impact which the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic has had on everyone's mental wellbeing.\nImagine this scenario: someone is taking a photograph of the family at Christmas. He looks through the lens of his camera or I-phone and sees non-smiling faces. He decides to say the following: ‘Now whatever you do, don’t smile. No, no smiling. Did I see someone smiling?’ Immediately, everyone relaxes and begin to smile naturally. This is the heart of PI. Frankl asks his phobic patients (to take one example) to will to have happen the thing they fear most; it works through humour, hyperbole, and the ability we humans have to self-distance and self-detach from our symptoms.",

      "description": "FIND PEACE IN THE STORM\nIn everyday life, challenges and obstacles are everywhere. From the stress of our everyday grind to anxiety about the future brings, it's no surprise that many of us feel overwhelmed or thrown off-balance.\nMindfulness is a group of ancient techniques, now backed by modern science, that offers a proven path to more peace and less stress.\nFrom stressed-out professionals to overwhelmed parents, uncertain executives, and more, I've introduced countless individuals to the power of mindfulness, and how it can help. Through this practice, they've discovered a deeper connection to the \"here and now\", more acceptance, less stress, and more peace of mind.\nWhile there are many courses on mindfulness, no course focuses, specifically, on how to use mindfulness to actively reduce stress.\nThat is what this course aims to change.\n\n\n\n\nLET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING\nSome people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.\nAnd by this, I mean, EVERYTHING that is in the package.\nSo, here is a list of everything that this course covers:\nYou will learn about what mindfulness actually is, and its usual components (presence, a connection to nature, absence of thoughts, and more), the types of techniques that usually leveraged it (bodily relaxation, emotion analysis, and more), and the common use cases;\nYou'll learn about the role of resilience (bouncing back from issues, staying calm without giving up), how mindfulness boosts resilience (such as by slowing down thoughts and removing emotion), and other ways to improve resourcefulness beyond mindfulness (support networks, emotional intelligence, physical health, etc);\nYou'll learn about the specific effects of mindfulness (stressful hormone reduction, blood pressure regulation, others), how mindfulness is integrated into therapeutic practices such as MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) and MBCT (Mindful Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy), and its role as a quality complement to other health practices;\nYou'll learn more about using mindfulness to manage changes. Tackling the common emotions that arise (usually fear and resistance), how to flow and stay flexible, and how to make decisions in a paused manner, without stress affecting them;\nYou'll learn more about using mindfulness to perform under pressure. Recognising the physiological and mental signs of pressure (muscle tension, blood pressure, anxiety, worry, etc), how to use simple exercises to manage that pressure (such as bodily relaxation, breathing exercises, sensory stimulation), and how to solve problems in a calm way, without pressure, objectively;\nYou'll learn about using mindfulness to regulation emotions. Recognising emotional triggers (rejection, criticism, personal traumas, others), the 3 pillars of dealing with negative emotions (such as recognising their transience), and methods, such as the RAIN method, to recognise emotions, investigate them, among other actions to manage them;\nYou'll learn about using mindfulness to cultivate your support systems (having conscious, mindful relationships), using mindful communication to keep relationships healthy (such as active listening, paying full attention, etc), and other actions to cultivate these relationships (such as checking in regularly, having traditions, and more);\nYou'll see a full example in the workplace, of dealing with job changes using techniques such as identifying negative emotions and dealing with them, calming down your breathing, using active listening to remain objective in communications, and building a support network around people with similar goals;\nYou'll see a full example in a personal relationship, of moving in with someone, using techniques such as recognising your emotional triggers, communicating in a mindful manner without conflict, checking in regularly with the other side about issues, and accepting the other side without disrespect;\nYou'll see a full example in a major life change, of moving to a new city, using techniques such as taking pauses to balance yourself, grounding yourself physically to elements around you, reinforcing your support networks, and dealing with negative emotions in the long-term;\n\n\n\n\nMY INVITATION TO YOU\nRemember that you always have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there is no risk for you.\nAlso, I suggest you make use of the free preview videos to make sure the course really is a fit. I don't want you to waste your money.\nIf you think this course is a fit, and can take your knowledge of dealing with change to the next level... it would be a pleasure to have you as a student.\nSee on the other side!",

      "description": "This course is for Non-Therapists, to get personal sessions of Past Life Regression about soulmates and relationships. This course is for you if you just want to experience Past Life Regression, and you don't want to learn how to do Past Life Regression to others.\nIf you have already done the courses for therapists, and still really want to take this course to deal with soulmate and relationship issues, you can still benefit, as their are many unique features in this course.\nThis course can be a complement to sessions as a client in-person or online; For people doing Past Life sessions in-person, and having 3-5 sessions, doing this course online could cover some important areas, and reduce the number of more costly in-person sessions, giving substantial savings. If you want to have personal sessions, doing the course can get you started, and we can pick up where you left off with the videos.\n___\n\n\n1) This course is a based around Past Life Regression Therapy, focused on soulmates and relationships. The outcome is to understand and help relationship issues, especially these four major issue types, each with four issue sub-types.\nA) Romantic Relationship Ends; Has a relationship ended in due to divorce, breakup or unrequited love? Has this left you with obsessive thoughts, denial or lack of closure, or emotional residues that block or infect new relationships?\na) Have you been mistreated, causing anger or sadness?\nb) Have you mistreated other, causing guilt or regret?\nc) Do you cling on to a relationship, blocking moving on?\nWhat if you could recall lifetimes to see balancing or repeating patterns, that make understanding and forgiveness an automatic spiritual therapeutic resolution?\nThis course can help heal after a romantic relationship ends.\nB) Romantic Soulmates; A relationship is active; at the beginning with doubts, in the middle requiring maintenance, or at the end contemplating leaving.\na) New Relationship with Doubts; Does our sense of connection mean we are romantic partners? Why are we attracted?\nb) Ongoing Trust and Commitment Issues; I want to be with them, but I can’t trust them, or I can’t make a commitment.\nc) Leave Relationship To Be With Another?; Is someone else my real soulmate?\nThis course can help give clarity to decision involving romantic soulmates.\nC) Family, Friends and Rivals; We or others carry strong preset thoughts or emotions.\na) You Have An Instant Aversion To Them; There is no apparent reason for the strength of your aversion or dislike towards them, but it dominates your relationship. Trivial events in this life trigger you to have big overreactions. You feel tense and uncomfortable in their presence.\nb) They Have Instant Aversion To You; They are aggressive, intolerant or rude to you for no apparent reason. You don’t feel the same back or understand why.\nc) Competition and Tension; You can’t relax around them, and constantly ‘score points’. To be happy, it’s not enough for you to succeed, they must also fail.\nThis course can help come to peace in relationships with Family, Friends and Rivals.\nD) Relationship With Self - Low Self-Esteem, Anxiety; We can be our own worst enemy in relationships. They may build up a wall against us, yet we may build our own wall. We may be criticized by others, but the harshest critic can be ourself. Anxiety or fear can attempt to protect us, but damage our relationships.\n2) Course Structure and PLRT Process;\nPLRT done professionally has implicit within it other forms of regression therapy, so sessions include;\na) Interviews; to focus on presenting issues related to soulmates and relationships. And pre-talks to prepare for hypnotic inductions and guided meditations.\nb) Age Regression Hypnotherapy; to clarify the presenting issue and story in this life, that connects with past lives.\nc) Past Life Regression; to clarify the past lives causes, events and people, and begin to work with, or be at peace with, the karmic effects.\nd) Future Life Progression; to see how learning spiritual lessons effects our path into this life and the next, growing confidence, motivation and life purpose.\n3) Course Highlights;\n- Case Study Exercises; guide you to write your about your own past life relationships, focusing on healing or developing present life relationships.\n- Case Study Examples; from my clients and my past lives relating to relationships, illustrating themes relevant to most people.\n- Clarify your own goals for each session with worksheets and interviews.\n- Understand each technique and key themes with pre and post session talks.\n- Experience three regressions to the Present, Past and Future lives.\n- Get therapeutic resolutions to enhance your relationships.\nThis Udemy course comes with the Udemy Certificate of Completion. There are no additional certificates from my Past Life Awakening Institute for courses taken on Udemy.\nReviews for sister course “Past Life Regression - Therapist Training”\n“It is really good, covering the all aspects of past life regression. I also loved the audio session given in the last lesson on various common subjects. Overall it is good and it's really worthy to invest time to learn and heal yourself.”\n\"I'm amazed with this course. I'm already conversational hypnotist myself. Just listening to the audio I was able to view some of my past lives and benefit from it. Thank you, Mark!”",

The IFS model emphasizes the network of relationships between parts as parts may not be able to experience a change in isolation. This therapy was developed in the early 1990s by Richard Schwartz.\n\n\nThis type of therapy was developed in the early 1990s by Richard Schwartz, who developed the approach after listening to people in therapy speak about inner parts within themselves. As a young family therapist, Schwartz had received training in systems thinking and family therapy theory, and he believed he was truly able to listen to the individuals in his care once he set aside his preconceived ideas of therapy and the human mind.\nWhile the concept of multiple intrapsychic entities was not new (Sigmund Freud posited the existence of the id, ego, and superego), Schwartz’s training in systems thinking prompted him to seriously consider the interactions and relationships between these internal entities. He found internal parts to play common but dynamic roles: the relationships between parts could be changed if an individual intervened carefully and respectfully. Schwartz began to visualize the human mind as an internal family and began to apply in treatment the techniques he had learned as a family therapist.",

      "description": "Welcome to A Guided Tour of Person-Centred Counselling & Psychotherapy! Led by a BACP-accredited person-centred counsellor and psychotherapist, this course offers a warm, accessible, and comprehensive introduction to the person-centred approach. With four years as a counselling tutor and extensive experience working with adults, children, and young people in various settings—including managing a therapy service in a school—your instructor is dedicated to equipping you with essential therapeutic skills.\nAfter leaving my teaching role in February 2023, I felt inspired to share my knowledge and experiences through this online course. Together, we will explore the journey of humanistic psychology, leading to the emergence of the person-centred approach. You'll gain insights into its historical context and understand its relevance in today's therapeutic landscape.\nThe course is structured thoughtfully, beginning with an overview of psychology's evolution before focusing on person-centred counselling theory. You’ll learn about the foundational ideas that underpin this approach and how it conceptualizes mental health, addressing questions like, \"What is the best way to help people?\"\nAs we progress, we’ll delve into practical counselling skills essential for a person-centred practitioner when working with clients.

      "description": "Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that uses mindfulness-based techniques to help people manage difficult emotions. In this introductory course, you will learn about the core concepts, theories and skills used in Dialectical Behaviour Therapy.\nDBT was originally developed to treat borderline personality disorder and is now used for a range of problems including suicidal behaviour, self-harm, eating disorders, substance use and depression. DBT helps individuals deliver skills in emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness and distress tolerance so they can replace dysfunctional behaviour with healthier alternatives. The underlying model of DBT consists of four interconnected components:\nIndividual Therapy: Core one-on-one sessions where clients work on reducing problematic behaviours and building life skills with their therapist.\nGroup Skills Training: Skill-building groups covering mindfulness, emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness.\nTelephone Coaching: Real-time support between sessions for managing crises and applying skills.\nConsultation Team: Therapists consult with a team to ensure the most effective treatment and to manage their own reactions to challenging cases.\nThe course is designed for psychotherapists and mental health professionals looking to explore DBT, but it is equally accessible to all who seek to understand this evidence-based therapeutic approach. By the end of the course, you'll have a comprehensive grasp of the core concepts of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nGain a comprehensive understanding of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), a unique therapeutic approach.\nExplore the origins, history, and development of DBT, and its specific focus on Borderline Personality Disorder.\nLearn about the theoretical underpinnings of DBT, including dialectics, the cognitive model, and the functions of therapy.\nDiscover the core components of DBT, including individual psychotherapy, problem-solving techniques, validation, skills training, mindfulness, and interpersonal effectiveness.\nExplore essential skills in individual psychotherapy, such as diary cards, behaviour chain analysis, and solution analysis.\nUnderstand the problem-solving approach in DBT, incorporating both cognitive restructuring and behavioural techniques.\nMaster the art of validation and its importance in the therapeutic process.\nUnderstand the function of consultation teams and their significance in DBT practice.\nThe course is thoughtfully designed, featuring video lectures, downloadable resources, quizzes, practical exercises, and a comprehensive course handbook. On competition of the course, you will earn a certificate accredited by the International Association of Therapists. If you wish to become a registered member of the BABCP you will require further training.\nThings to be aware of:\nPrior experience in cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness and counselling skills is helpful but not required.\nDBT is typically delivered in team environments.\nDue to the nature of the material, we will briefly touch on suicide, self-harm and abuse.",

You will learn also learn what causes phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.\nGetting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function. There are numerous psychological issues that clients present with in therapy that have trauma at their very core. For example, there are a lot of people with obsessive compulsive disorder, various anxiety issues, depression as well as addictions that frequently have trauma as a core force that is driving them. In many cases, it might be the trauma laid down the thinking and behavioral patterns which underlie the development of depression or anxiety issues, or that led to obsessive compulsive behaviours which developed to protect the individual from experiencing similar trauma again, or addictive behaviours to block out or cope with the trauma. These people tend to get stuck in their head a lot of the time, engaging in very toxic and energy sucking behaviour such as rumination and overthinking.",
