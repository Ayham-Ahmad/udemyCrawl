      "description": "*First course on Udemy about CONTRACTOR SERVICES\n*All Revit versions from Revit 2020 to Revit 2025 are almost the same with some additional minor features for the later versions, but you can apply the BIM concept and follow up the course lectures using any version, from Revit 2020 up to Revit 2025.\nIn this course students will be familiar with the BIM services needed for the contractor to execute the mechanical, electrical and plumbing works on site with less time and less cost by providing the construction site with the coordinated shop drawings and exact material take off reports. So first we will learn the Revit basics of how to start a new project, setting up templates, linking the architectural model and the designed drawings into our live model and creating views and levels, then we will learn how to read and convert the designer MEP drawings into 3D models and all the tips, tricks and shortcuts needed to perform the work faster, then we will go through the coordination process by finding the clashes and solving them. Then we will use dynamo to create the builders works, then we will extract the shop drawings and the builder works from the coordinated model and finally we will learn how to create schedules for the MEP categories. This course is aimed at complete beginners who have never used Revit before and want to increase their career options by learning Revit MEP. The ideal students for this course are the mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, BIM engineers, BIM drafters.",

      "description": "What is Character Art School?\nCharacter Art School is a learn-anywhere video course where you learn how to draw professional characters for books, games, animation, manga, comics and more. I’ve hand-crafted the Character Art School: Complete Character Drawing course to be the only course you need to learn all the core fundamentals and advanced techniques to drawing and sketching characters well. If you’re an absolute beginner or you’re already at an intermediate level, the course will advance your current drawing ability to a professional level. The course is a comprehensive 10 module guided video course, where the only limit to your progression is your determination and engagement in the rewarding assignments.\nWhether you want to draw character design concept art for films and games, illustrations, comics, manga, Disney style or other styles, this is the course you need to get you there.\nI’ll teach you to draw without fear, and I’ll teach you to draw well - quickly.\n\nFinally, Learn Character Drawing Well\nWhether you’re a complete beginner, or intermediate at character drawing, you’ll learn things you never knew you never knew. Seriously. Inspired by masters and built on the theory of giants, Character Drawing Academy is one of, if not the most comprehensive character drawing course out there. I’m so convinced of this, I’ll give you a no-questions asked refund if you’re not satisfied.\n\nClear, Easy to Understand Lessons\nCrystal clear in fact. Learning character drawing and how to draw people effectively means having information presented in a logical and coherent way. The Character Academy Course is modular by design, easy to grasp, and allows you to learn in a well paced, structured way. Engage in the course chronologically, then revise each module at your leisure. Grasp concepts, such as how to draw lips, eyes, faces, and more, faster than you ever have before – there’s no fluff here.\n\nAssignments that are Rewarding\nBridging the gap between theory and practice, each module’s assignments have been designed to both reinforce theory, and feel rewarding. I’ve taken the core of the theory, and purpose built each assignment to help you rapidly progress, and you’ll see the difference in your own work almost immediately. Art is about doing, so let’s get started- let’s draw something awesome!\n\nWhat's Your Style?\nWhether you want to learn Character Drawing to draw for games, comics, cartoons, manga, animation and more, this course has you covered. I'm not teaching you a 'method' or a 'way' to draw, I'm teaching you to be fundamentally good at drawing characters, whether you prefer traditional pencil drawing or draw digitally.\n\nWhat are Students Saying about the Course?\n\n\"Probably the best art course I've ever taken -- online or in college. Wonderfully presented, it helped me correct mistakes I'd been making that were really holding my artwork back. I've seen phenomenal progress after 30 days practice of the course material. Highly recommended.\"\nDan Rahmel ★★★★★\n\n\"Just a perfect 5 stars rating. It's really complete and filled with advice, theories and concrete examples. As he said, it's probably the last character drawing course you'll take. It's all I wanted. Thank you so much Scott Harris!\"\nMario ★★★★★\n\n\"Amazing course. I haven't even started drawing yet because I'm in awe of how simple the instructor makes even the most complicated techniques look. At last, drawing like a pro is within my grasp! I also like the fact that the instructor allows me to just watch the first time through without worrying about drawing until I'm familiar with the concepts. My next time through the course, I'll be prepared and more confident than ever to begin drawing. Even so, I've already used some of the concepts in this course for a sketch here and there when I feel inspired to draw, and I can tell worlds of difference between my former drawings and newer ones. Laid back instructor, but very knowledgeable. I highly recommend this course.\"\nEric Beaty ★★★★★",

And finally, by the end, you’ll learn how to create projects with multiple interlocking parts, using different types of joints.\nYou’ll also learn the different ways a laser can affect the material you’re cutting, like scoring and engraving.  We’ll also cover non-design things, like material selection, preventing burn marks, finishing your projects, and more.\n\n\nBy using this project-based incremental learning method, you won’t feel overwhelmed trying to do something that is beyond your current skill level. And you will practice by creating actual products that you can use in your house.\nI made the projects used in this course using my Glowforge laser-cutter, but you don't need your own laser-cutter.   There are many maker spaces and libraries that now provide access to laser-cutters.   For the first 3 years of this hobby, I used an Epilog laser-cutter at my library.   The files you learn to make in this course can also be cut on almost any laser-cutter.",

      "description": "The course has its beginnings on my observation that many of my known senior engineers who have been working in FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) unit design and construction do know much about the tankers features. The reality is they when you work in a EPC company you are kept so busy in your own area that you rarely get any time to know about the other specialisations and how your work impacts them.\nAnd there is no structured training arranged by any of these companies\nBecause FPSOs are ship shaped, the tendency is for designers to approach the design of an FPSO as though it is primarily a ship with production facilities as cargo. An FPSO is a floating offshore production and storage facility which happens to be ship shaped. Therefore there has to be a change in the approach to its design to ensure that it is considered as a single integrated entity, as is the case for a fixed jacket installation\nSeeing all this, I thought a course outlining all the marine, structural, production (process) and the layout features could be a good start to introduce the FPSO to the Udemy students.\nThe course is tilted to process engineer requirements, but includes marine , structural and layout aspects also.\nAnybody who wants to know about oil and gas, FPSO units may benefit from this course.\nThe course is structured in a manner to help everyone including beginners in FPSO. At the beginning, FPSO vessel and Process overview is presented before moving into Process Design considerations. After this, “General Considerations” influencing the design of the vessel is provided. This gives a flavour of the issues that need “considerations” while deciding the vessel in which facilities will be built. Beyond this the Marine and Structural aspects of design are discussed. Finally a introduction to Deepwater system is presented.\nThe student of this course will be able to perform her job with a high level of awareness and effectiveness.\nLessons Learnt so far:\nMany important lessons have been learnt in the first year of delivery. Some of them are:\n1.  It was understood that many students with diverse experience wish to take up this course. So it is useful to restate the meaning of the word \"Design Considerations\".\nDesign Considerations are generally the things you think about before starting the major decisions about your design solution.\nThe knowledge provided by this course is aimed to enable the student to be aware of the diverse aspects that need to be considered while designing a FPSO.\n2. Some students think that the “instructor is reading out the slides”. This is not the case. The instructor has prepared the slides to serve as a pointer to the students when the material is delivered.\n3. Some young students may find this material “over the top” because of its multi-disciplinary nature. However, since the content is available lifelong, it will be of great value when they plan to get associated with a FPSO design, operation or maintenance.\n\nCourse structure\nThe intent of the course is to\npresent the FPSO vessel and production facility overview.\nProvide the design considerations of the production facilities\nPart 2 reviews a range of significant design related issues which have a bearing on the ability of the FPSO to ultimately function safely and efficiently over the time it is in the field. It covers matters such as the development of design philosophies, layout, and general system design. Although it does not attempt to fully address the design of the oil and gas production systems, it does touch on a number of issues, or contingent factors, connected with hydrocarbon recovery and processing which can have a significant bearing on the FPSOs ability to function as originally envisaged.\nPresent functional requirements, system design & equipment performance, sparing, safeguarding and shutdown, monitoring & control , maintenance, commissioning, layout, and interface requirements\nDelve into the general considerations influencing FPSO selection and design.\nGreen water, bottom slamming, tank sloshing, escape and evacuation, effects of movements.\nMarine and Structural Design Considerations of FPSO\nDeepwater systems and their Selection\nExclusion\nThis training should not be considered either as a detailed design guide or as a form of textbook on FPSO design. Neither are they a substitute for current statutory regulations that prevail now.\nImportant to note that “Design Considerations” are not same as “Sizing or Design” of equipment but they are critical from safety, operability and reliable operation of the “equipment systems”.\nThe design of FPSOs involves the use of a large range of national and international laws, standards, codes of practice and specifications and so this training by definition, can refer selectively to only a very small number of these.",

Topics include common definitions, lifecycle analysis, reliability myths, failures, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), failure rates, life data distributions, probability density functions; exponential, logarithmic, gaussian, and Weibull distributions; reliability estimates, the hazard function, MTBF, MTTF, the “bathtub curve” and its 3 regions: DFR, SFR and IFR. You’ll learn about extending a product’s life, reliability calculations using reliability networks, stress and strain analysis, fault trees and FMECA reporting.\nIn the Maintainability Module, topics include definitions, maintenance levels, FRACAS, Uptime (UT), Downtime (DT), MTTR, preventive and corrective maintenance, maintenance frequency, MTBM, Level Of Repair Analysis (LORA), Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM), Potential to Functional failures (PF), Maintainability cost, prediction, and allocation, and trade-offs between reliability and maintainability.\nIn the Availability Module, we use what we learned about R&M and apply it to availability. We also cover the three primary types of availability: Achieved Availability (Aa), Inherent Availability (Ai) and Operational Availability (Ao).\nThe course concludes by consolidating RM&A topics into a holistic picture. Topics include RM&A challenges, RM&A starting values, testing for reliability & maintainability, RM&A sequential testing and qualification and product life testing.",

Then I show how it can be fun to create a spontaneous illustration of a crazy fictitious creature... But then also, show how challenging it can be to try and make it into something acceptable to the artist when you follow that path. It's a great exercise, and you will witness me struggling a t a few points and then finally resolve where I want to go with this kind image. I believe it is important to share this aspect, as I have met many artists who run into those snags where the art just doesn't feel right to them. And then they STOP. Don't stop! Look for alternative paths! The ending can be rewarding.",

Learning anatomy is key to advancing your knowledge and skill in drawing characters and the human figure. If you’re an absolute beginner, I'd recommend taking Character Art School: The Complete Character Drawing Course in addition to this course, so that you can get a solid understanding of drawing fundamentals. This short course is a guided video course, where the only limit to your progression is your determination and engagement in the rewarding assignments. The skeletal anatomy study plan has been designed to get you working logically and consistently.\nIf you have ever sat down to draw anatomy and failed dismally at understanding how to learn and what to watch out for when drawing the skeleton, this is the course you need to get you drawing and understanding skeletal anatomy. With this course you will be able to draw the bones of the human skeleton well, and will understand the importance of the skeletal foundation for learning muscular anatomy and superficial anatomy later on.\nI’ll teach you to learn the skeleton efficiently, and I’ll teach you to learn it well.\n\n\nFinally, Learn the Skeleton Well\nThe skeleton is complex, but defined key elements can be learned quickly, allowing you to grasp the overall structure well. You’ll learn things you never knew you never knew - I’m so convinced of this, I’ll give you a no-questions asked refund if you’re not satisfied, within 30 days.\n\n\nClear, Easy to Understand Lessons\nCrystal clear in fact. I am not going to waste your time with fluff and meaningless information. Learning skeletal anatomy drawing and how to draw the anatomy effectively means having information presented in a logical and coherent way. The Anatomy Art School: The Complete Skeletal Drawing Course is modular by design, to the point, easy to grasp, and allows you to learn in a well paced, structured way. Engage in the course chronologically, then revise each module at your leisure. Grasp concepts faster than you ever have before – there’s no fluff here, just progress!\n\n\nAssignments that are Rewarding\nBridging the gap between theory and practice, the skeletal anatomy study plan and the suggested course progression have been designed to both reinforce theory, and feel rewarding. I've also included awesome 3D and drawn resources that will help you grasp the skeletal body anatomy as well as help you with drawing your own skeletal structures. I’ve taken the core of the theory, and purpose built each lesson to help you rapidly progress, and you’ll see the difference in your own work almost immediately.\n\n\nArt is about doing, so let’s get started.",

Whether you are an engineer, product developer, emerging entrepreneur, or simply an Android or Java Developer who is intrigued by the world of manufacturing, this course will provide skills that will help you in many aspects of your engineering or non-engineering career.\n\nGain Manufacturing Knowledge without Spending $60,000 in Colleges and Universities\nComplete overview of modern manufacturing methods\nVideo links that demonstrate these manufacturing methods to understand them visually\nAll complex industrial processes explained in the easiest manner; No unnecessary technical terms and jargons\nConnection between manufacturing and product development\nUnderstanding of how everyday products are made like bottles, grocery bags, smartphone case, pipes, metal containers etc.\n\n\nCourse Summary\nSometimes, even engineers who spend 4 years of college learning theories do not know enough about manufacturing. I have spent countless hours learning manufacturing theories and just as many hours practising in the mechanical engineering industry. I have compiled all the juicy and interesting things in this Udemy course while leaving out unnecessary things so this course is all you need.\nUnlike computer programming, manufacturing and mechanical engineering are hands-on fields. You need to visit machine shops and factories to see the actual physical processes in order to learn properly. But, I have manufacturing-related video links in this course that will allow you to learn everything without having to visit hot and dirty factories.\nThe best thing about this course is that it uses the simplest language and avoids all the technical and unnecessarily complicated wording so you can understand even the most complicated topics with ease. As long as you have passion to learn amazing things, YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE.\nContents and Overview\nThis course contains over 40 lectures, 2+ hours of contents, and a compilation of the best video demonstrations for each topic discussed.\nI will cover these topics\nMaterials\nPlastic Types\nConcept Generation\nCasting\nMolding\nForming\nMachining\nPowder Processing\n3D Printing\nJoining\nBy the time you complete this course, you will feel very accomplished and look at products around you differently depending on your profession. If you are in engineering, you will be able to make great prototypes for your design projects and have more hands-on skills compared to your other classmates. If you are not in engineering, you will develop a good eye for seeing things in terms of manufacturing. you will be able to see your smartphone or your window frames and think how they must have been made!\nThere is a lot to learn and you will have questions along the way. Feel free to post your questions and ideas onto the discussion board of this course and I will reply with an answer within 48 hours. I encourage students to participate as much as possible.",

      "description": "Crash Course Electronics was designed for one thing -- to take you from mystery to mastery in Electronics and PCB Design. This massive course was custom made for those interested in learning electronics from the ground up that wish to leverage that knowledge to build actual printed circuit boards (PCBs). There is no other course like this in existence that has the depth and breadth of Crash Course Electronics. The course starts with atomic physics and the electron, before you know it you are learning Ohm's Law, circuit analysis, AC, DC, complex impedance, RC and RL circuits,  filters, amplifiers, transistors, FETs,  analog and digital theory -- too much to list here!\n\nBut, unlike other courses that are highly technical and math based. Crash Course Electronics was designed to be taken as a journey with the instructor. Each lecture building on the last, each new concept like a new puzzle approached in many different ways. The most complex topics and mathematical concepts are distilled down into understandable lectures and we have a lot of fun doing it! I had to learn this stuff at one point and remember how hard it was, so I approach each lecture as if we are both learning for the first time and make no assumptions about what you know or don't know.\nAs we progress through the lectures, expect to see every circuit and idea worked out on the black board, virtually simulated (with Labcenter Proteus), and built by hand right in front of your eyes in high def, ultra clean video and audio. Not only will you learn all the theory and practical aspects of Electrical Engineering, but my 35+ years of experience with electronics will be downloaded to your brain with countless real-world tips and tricks that will take you from a hobbyist to a deep understanding of the subject matter.\nThen when we have all the basic electronic theory under our belts, buckle in for something you have never seen -- we will build, not one, not two, but three complete products! We will talk about the design, the motivation, look up parts, background information, and then design the circuits together like colleagues, lay them out in Altium CircuitMaker, route them, verify and produce manufacturing files. If that wasn't enough, we will take those files and go out on internet and send them to a number of online manufactures and get them ready for production, all you have to do is hit SUBMIT!\nLast, but not least -- the course is based on my college text book \"Design Your Own Video Game Console\" aka \"The Black Art of Video Game Console Design\" -- this 800+ page book is included free of charge (the PDF version) with the course. Although, we won't be talking about game consoles in this course, we will be using the text for its theory, electrical engineering and PCB design chapters.",

      "description": "In this course you will learn how to draw : in 10 exercises, you will learn the most important skills that you can use to  draw anything. From there, you will have a foundation on which to build a lifetime of drawing.\nIf you think you can't draw, or you don't know how to draw; if you've never even drawn anything before, or if  you'd love to get better at drawing, then this course teaches you how to confidently and consistently draw anything.\nYou will learn how to draw : learn pencil drawing : learn still life : learn figure drawing !\nThis course focuses on a set of 10 drawing exercises. These are divided into 3 sections.\nThe first section is all about seeing shapes - I teach you how to tune into what’s called a drawing mode, and see complex things in terms of their shape, instead of the way you would normally see them.\nThe second section is about seeing relationships of size between shapes. You’ll learn about rules of perspective and I teach you how to use the artists' method of sighting in your drawing.\nThe last section teaches you about form. For me, form means the whole thing, and the exercises in this section are aimed and giving you an understanding of how to bring your drawing from being flat 2 d rendering to a fully finished drawing of substance.\nMy approach to teaching drawing doesn't focus on showing you how to draw one thing really well; you won't learn how to draw a specific thing like a nose, or eyes, for example. In fact, my main goal isn't really to teach to draw. Instead I teach you how to observe. \"Drawing is Seeing\" - Edgar Degas. This is the most important insight to have when it comes to learning how to draw. In order to draw anything, you need to be able to observe correctly. Only then will shapes, edges, size, shading, weight, space all make sense within your understanding of drawing, and what drawing is. With this knowledge you can build your own drawing skill yourself.\nAnd that way, you have the chance to really bring something unique and valuable into the world: your very own vision and expression through drawing.\nI’m a figure drawing instructor, artist and animation professional with close to 20 years experience making drawings as a professional, and in my personal drawing practice. Drawing is my passion - it’s something I think about every day and it’s something I’ve been thinking about how to teach other people.  This course distills everything I know about how to lay a solid foundation for drawing. I believe that being able to draw in a way that is natural to you and in a way that will prove consistent t no matter what it is that you draw, has the power to completely change things in your life for a very simple and often overlooked reason: the right way to learn how to draw allows you to express yourself. That can't be undervalued.\nIf you can draw, then wherever you are no matter what, once you have something to draw with, and something to draw on, then you can be an artist. That is all it takes. You don’t need anything else. But even if you don’t necessarily want to be an artist, learning to draw is a deeply creative endeavour that helps you to see the world differently and naturally feeds into all aspects of your other work.\n#howtodraw #howtodrawforbeginners #drawfigures",

In addition, practical examples using FPGA development boards will be provided. Combinational and clocked logic circuit design will be explained by examples. We will use either VIVADO or MODELSIM platform for the simulation and development of VHDL designs. Some of the written codes will be loaded into FPGA cards for demonstration purposes.\nWe use MODELSIM for simulation of the VHDL codes. In VHDL circuit design, good knowledge of signal and variable objects is necessary, and the engineer should know the differences between signal and variable objects very well. The most confusing part between the signal and variable objects is that variable objects are updated immediately whereas update of the signal objects is not immediate. Clock division operation and behavior of the signal and variable objects are explained in details using MODELSIM simulations. The behaviors of the combinational and sequential circuits are clarified using MODELSIM simulations.\nWe use VIVADO platform for simulation and circuit synthesis of the VHDL codes. In fact, it is better to use the MODELSIM platform for simulations and VIVADO platform for circuit synthesis and FPGA programming. We indicate that a VHDL code which can be simulated may not be synthesizable,  and we explain this concept providing examples on VIVADO platform. Through the course, we provide many videos explaining VHDL language for circuit design and use of MODELSIM and VIVADO platforms for simulation and circuit synthesis.",

That's a mosaic - made with paper - so... \"Paper Mosaic\"!\nThis course will take you step-by-step through the process of creating a paper mosaic from start to finish. You can join me and create a butterfly, or you can take what you learn and make something else. Even if you have worked in paper mosaics before, I hope you will find lots of tips that you can incorporate into your work and style.\nThe \"Preparing Papers for Your Art\" course is not a prerequisite for this course, but it is helpful to have the papers from that class to use in this one. If you don't wish to take that class, you can use other papers such as magazine papers, book papers, scrapbooking papers, etc... in this course.\nLet's get started!\n\n\nBeginning Paper Mosaics Supply List\nThe supplies listed here can be replaced by different brands, and you might not need everything listed here. You can come up with your own ideas, too, to supplement this list. These are ideas to get you started on your creative journey!\nBare minimum list: thick paper for your base, magazines to rip up, ModPodge, a paintbrush, scissors.\n\n\nMore extended supply list:\nSubstrates:\nWhat you use for your base is up to your own personal choice after watching the lesson. Below is my favorite…\n· Ampersand Hardbord (Item #14941-1212 Dick Blick) Comes in many sizes\n· Golden Gloss Medium for the sealer (Item #00628-1115 Dick Blick)\n· Golden Gesso (Item #00628-1175 Dick Blick)\n· Foam Brushes\nLesson 2 – Design:\n· Sketch paper\n· Pencil\n· Optional: Carbon paper, tracing paper, scissors\nMaking a Paper Mosaic:\n· ModPodge (Item # 10047537 Michaels)\n· Papers for ripping, cutting, gluing. You can use painted papers from the course \"Preparing Papers for your Art\" or simply use magazines and other found papers\n· Brush - I use CraftSmart brand brushes. They are $8 at Michaels but they don't seem to have them on their website. The bristles are called \"taklon\" and they are great to use with ModPodge.\n· Low lid for holding ModPodge\n· Tracing paper\n· Scissor\n· Xacto knife\n· Cutting mat\n· Thin Black Sharpie\nVarnishing:\n· Liquitex Gloss Varnish (Item #61670 Jerry's Artarama)\n· Foam brush\n· Cup for varnish",

I only knew how to use markers like a child at school - by filling in space between the lines. So, I was interested in learning some basic techniques and was inspired by the delicious subjects. At first, I was hoping for more specific recommendations on supplies, but I found the information given in the course was enough. I went on Amazon and purchased a set of markers and paper I was comfortable with for my budget. I didn't get all the extras like the liners, sepia pen or snowball pen. But, I didn't really need them. I was able to complete the projects with just my set of markers. As a beginner, I followed the tutorial very closely. I did all the exercises on blending and texture first and learned a lot about the markers through these exercises. I wasn't sure if I was ready to jump into the strawberry tart, but I did it and was very happy with the results. I look forward to using my markers more!\"\nWould you like to draw some yummy illustrations? Then let’s do it using ink markers.\nIn this course, I’ll teach you how to draw and color food in a realistic style using what are called alcohol-based ink markers.\nI’ll start by teaching you markers' basic coloring techniques (color blending and gradation and texture creation). Then I’ll apply these techniques through a number of food drawing tutorials. And through each tutorial, you’ll learn how to use the markers to create textures, show light and shade, and make a realistic drawing that everyone would like to eat!\nI’ll take you on a step-by-step journey starting from sketching to adding the final touches to each drawing. And every now and then, I’ll add a new tutorial to the course, so you’ll not just learn the available tutorials, but you’ll also have the upcoming ones.\nCurrently available tutorials;\nRealistic drawing of a strawberry tart.\nRealistic drawing of cantaloupe and watermelon.\nRealistic drawing of donuts.\nSo, Why ink markers?!\nWell, simply because they enable you to make amazingly realistic illustrations that would love to eat!\nBesides their living bright colors, ink markers are so enjoyable in drawing and expressing color gradation and textures.\nNot to mention that you can carry them with you whenever you’re, so you can draw your food anywhere.\nInk markers are available in the market under several brand names, for example, Copic markers, Touch markers, Prismacolor markers, etc. In my course, I use two different brands alternately (Touch markers and Sign me Markers). Although different marker brands vary in quality, you can apply the same coloring techniques taught in the course using any brand. So feel free to get any brand you want according to your preference and budget.\nThis course will teach you how to color using ink markers through food illustration, although you might use the techniques taught in the course in fields other than that. So the aim of the course is to increase your appetite for marker sketching in general, and who knows, maybe for food too.\nHope you’ll enjoy the course and Bon appetite!",

Hot Rolled and Cold Rolled Steel Structures are discussed in great detail. Various practical examples with detailed pictures are explained.\n2. Design of Composite Steel Platform Structure as per AISC 360\nThis is an exclusive lecture series on the internet that is guiding you on how to design the composite beams in STAAD as per AISC 360. You shall learn how to model the composite decks first. Then you shall learn how to assign dead, live , wind and seismic loads as per ASCE 07. Direct Analysis method is explained in detail. Then , you shall learn the difficult part of assigning the Design Parameters.\n3. Design of Plate Girders as per AISC 360\nPlate Girders are used in Bridges , Buildings etc. You shall learn how you can model the Plate girders in the STAAD with Lateral Diaphragms. You shall learn how to design the plate girders as per AISC 360. In the end , you shall learn how you can read the shear force and bending moment diagrams.\n4-5. Linear Cable and Advanced Cable Analysis of the Structure\nCable elements used in STAAD are very useful when dealing with cable stayed bridges, suspension bridges, cable nets and guyed poles/towers etc. However, cables are very difficult to model and analyze because of their highly non-linear traits. Cables generally resemble thin steel wires or ropes that are very flexible, often undergoing large deflections. For these reasons, a linear-static analysis is not appropriate and can lead to extremely inaccurate results. STAAD provides us option to do the cable analysis of the Structure. Both Linear and Advanced Cable Analysis of the Structure is explained in this lecture series.\n6-7. Design of Cold Formed Steel Structure as per American and Indian Design Standards\nIn this lecture series ,  Cold-formed steel (CFS) members structures are modelled to make various types of structural arrangement. Design of these structures is done as per American AISI and Indian IS 801 Design Standards.\n8. P-Δ Analysis of the Watch Tower Structure and Design as per IS 800\nIn structural engineering, the P-Δ or P-delta effect refers to the abrupt changes in ground shear, overturning moment, and/or the axial force distribution at the base of a sufficiently tall structure or structural component when it is subject to a critical lateral displacement. Towers are discussed in great detail. The results are compared of the model made with and without P-Delta Analysis. Design of the modelled structure is done as per Indian Steel Design Standard IS 800.",

      "description": "Do you want to learn the two most popular and modern software architecture styles?\nAre you looking to grow your career to the role of a Technical Lead or Software Architect?\nYou came to the right place!\nTaught by an Ex-Google Software Engineer and a Software Architect with real, hands-on experience with Large Scale Systems and Microservices Architecture, this is the most comprehensive and up-to-date course on Microservices and Event-Driven Architecture.\nThe combination of Microservices Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture is the biggest contributor to the success of top-tech companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, Spotify, eBay, and many others.\nThis course will teach you all the core principles, design patterns, and industry-proven best practices to apply Microservices and Event-Driven Architecture to your system.\nThroughout the course, you will learn to:\nMigrate a Legacy Monolithic Application to Microservices Architecture\nDesign scalable, reliable, and loosely-coupled Microservices\nTest and Deploy Microservices to production using Cloud Computing, Serverless, and Container Technologies like Kubernetes.\nIn addition, this course includes many:\nReal-world examples.\nDetailed software architecture diagrams.\nLinks to external resources and technologies.\nQuizzes to help you test your knowledge\nA downloadable workbook to take notes and review the material\nBy the end of the course, you'll be able to:\nHelp your organization save costs and increase efficiency by using Microservices and Event-Driven Architecture\nFollow industry-proven design principles for architecting scalable and reliable Microservices\nApply your knowledge to System Design Interviews\nThis course is for you If:\nYou are an experienced software engineer and want to take your career toward the role of a Technical Lead or Software Architect\nYou want to help your company cut costs, increase scalability, and improve its software architecture by migrating to microservices.\nYou are preparing for a System Design Interview at top tech companies that run large-scale systems.\nSo what are you waiting for? :)\nLet's get started!\n\n\nFAQ\n- \"My company doesn't use Microservices. Should I still take this course?\"\nYes! Microservices Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture are core skills for any senior software engineer and software architect. Once your company is ready to migrate to Microservices Architecture, you will play a vital role in this transition. Your knowledge and skills will help your company migrate successfully, avoiding all the common pitfalls and anti-patterns. This will help your company save a lot of money, which will ultimately help grow your career.\n\n\n- \"There are many other courses on Microservices Architecture. How is this course different?\"\nUnfortunately, many courses on Microservices follow (and sometimes even copy) widely available articles and often outdated purely theoretical books without necessarily having the real-world experience to distill what is important and correct. In this course, I bring you years of my personal experience working on large-scale systems at companies like Google and Maginte (formally Rubicon Project), as well as the most up-to-date lessons of thousands of industry leaders and software architects, sharing knowledge in the most prestigious software architecture conferences. This course will bring you real-world knowledge that you can confidently apply in practice within your company.\n- \"Does this course involve any coding?\"\nNo. This is a Software Architecture course primarily focused on Microservices Architecture. It is not a programming course. The skills you learn in this course are applicable to any programming language, cloud vendor, or technology stack. One of the main advantages of this approach is while technologies get outdated very fast, the knowledge you get from this course will last you for many years and will be equally applicable to any company you work for.\n\n\n- \"Does the course have any prerequisite?\"\nThe only prerequisite is a few years of software development experience. Taking the Software Architecture & Design of Modern Large Scale Systems or having some software architecture experience is recommended but not required. This course will teach you everything you need about Microservices Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture.",

There are 3 major improvement we made this time:\nNo more distracting ambient/background music;\nFully custom transcription in sync with the narrator content;\nRecorded narrator voice with TTS technology (we have to seek for this resort due to our limited bandwidth/budget). But it is much more easy to understand now.\nMake the course more practical emphasized along with the essential theoretical background. We have introduced a lot new examples and 28 special topics right after each knowledge point.\n\n\n> If you are actively looking for a new job, you may also want to watch for the course in planning: (will be coming online in a short time)\nASIC Bootcamp for VLSI Students: Cracking the Physical Design Interview",

      "description": "1. Basic Introduction to the STAAD Pro Software\nBefore we go Professional , this lecture series is intended to teach you about the very basics and advanced basics functions of the STAAD Pro software. You will start with learning modelling , Introduction to the Graphical user Interface , Repeat Commands , Beams, Plates , Solids etc.\nEditor file is thoroughly explained with a small example of how it can be utilized to save time. The things taught is this lecture series shall serve as a kick start for the person who does not know anything about the STAAD Pro , but this shall also serve as a refreshment series for those who already know.\n2. Linear Dynamic Analysis of School building as per IS 456, IS 875, IS 1893 and Detailing as per IS 13920\nThis is the only exclusive course on the web that is taking the practical case study of a building starting from Reading the Architectural Drawings and going all the way to Detailing in AutoCAD.\nYou shall start with learning how to read the Architectural Drawing of a School building and plan the location of RCC Columns. Next you shall learn how you can prepare the Analytical Model in STAAD. Wind and Seismic Load Definitions and Calculations are taught in great detail to help you understand how you can design wind and seismic resistant design structures. Response Spectrum Analysis is done for this model. Design and Detailing is done for this structure as per IS 456 and IS 13920:2016.\n3. FEM Analysis and Design of Pad Eyes\nSTAAD Pro is an excellent FEM Analysis software , but user needs to understand how to do it correctly. You shall learn what are the practical aspects of Pad eyes , how they are used . You shall learn how you can prepare the FEM Model and read the stresses for designing after applying Loading on it.\n4. Load Generation as per ASCE 07\nIn this lecture series , you shall learn how to Calculate the Snow Loads and assign its definitions in software. Wind Load is very difficult to understand in the beginning , but Author explains everything in bit sizes about its Auto generation in software. Special focus is given to explain about the Frequency determination i.e. Rayleigh Frequency and Modal frequency. This is the best series for those who are absolutely new to this software.\n5. Linear Cable and Advanced Cable Analysis of the Structure\nCable elements used in STAAD are very useful when dealing with cable stayed bridges, suspension bridges, cable nets and guyed poles/towers etc. However, cables are very difficult to model and analyze because of their highly non-linear traits. Cables generally resemble thin steel wires or ropes that are very flexible, often undergoing large deflections. For these reasons, a linear-static analysis is not appropriate and can lead to extremely inaccurate results. STAAD provides us option to do the cable analysis of the Structure. Both Linear and Advanced Cable Analysis of the Structure is explained in this lecture series.\n6. Linear Buckling Analysis of Structures\nLinear Buckling Analysis is a very interesting concept ,which form the basis of design of many types of structural elements. You shall learn how to do buckling analysis of Column Manually. After getting your concepts cleared , you shall learn how to perform buckling analysis of I shaped Steel Girders , I shape Columns and Cooling Tower.\n7. P-Δ Analysis of the Watch Tower Structure and Design as per IS 800\nIn structural engineering, the P-Δ or P-delta effect refers to the abrupt changes in ground shear, overturning moment, and/or the axial force distribution at the base of a sufficiently tall structure or structural component when it is subject to a critical lateral displacement. Towers are discussed in great detail. The results are compared of the model made with and without P-Delta Analysis. Design of the modelled structure is done as per Indian Steel Design Standard IS 800.\n8. Non-Linear Static Analysis of Steel Structures (Pushover Analysis)\nIn this lecture series , Non-Linear Static Analysis of Steel Structure is done in the STAAD. The pushover analysis is taught in great detail in this lecture series. The modelling is done for a planar structure in STAAD. The pushover curved is generated and the results are ascertained.",

      "description": "A fire fighting system is probably the most important of the building services, as its aim is to protect human life and property, strictly in that order.\nIt consists of three basic parts:\na large store of water in tanks, either underground or on top of the building, called fire storage tanks\na specialised pumping system,\na large network of pipes ending in either hydrants or sprinklers (nearly all buildings require both of these systems)\nA fire hydrant is a vertical steel pipe with an outlet, close to which two fire hoses are stored (A fire hydrant is called a standpipe in America). During a fire, firefighters will go to the outlet, break open the hoses, attach one to the outlet, and manually open it so that water rushes out of the nozzle of the hose. The quantity and speed of the water is so great that it can knock over the firefighter holding the hose if he is not standing in the correct way. As soon as the fire fighter opens the hydrant, water will gush out, and sensors will detect a drop in pressure in the system. This drop in pressure will trigger the fire pumps to turn on and start pumping water at a tremendous flowrate.\nA sprinkler is a nozzle attached to a network of pipes, and installed just below the ceiling of a room. Every sprinkler has a small glass bulb with a liquid in it. This bulb normally blocks the flow of water. In a fire, the liquid in the bulb will become hot. It will then expand, and shatter the glass bulb, removing the obstacle and causing water to spray from the sprinkler. The main difference between a hydrant and a sprinkler is that a sprinkler will come on automatically in a fire. A fire hydrant has to be operated manually by trained firefighters - it cannot be operated by laymen. A sprinkler will usually be activated very quickly in a fire - possibly before the fire station has been informed of the fire - and therefore is very effective at putting out a fire in the early stages, before it grows into a large fire. For this reason, a sprinkler system is considered very good at putting out fires before they spread and become unmanageable. According to the NFPA of America, hotels with sprinklers suffered 78% less property damage from fire than hotels without in a study in the mid-1980s.",

Also, one should know how to read a manufacturers catalog and the specifications contained so as to select the best possible fixture for the desired effect - this course will give you this knowledge.\nWhere necessary, calculations and formulas are provided in both Imperial and Metric values.\nAt its most basic, lighting design consists of two methods - uplighting and downlighting.  Lighting manufacturers have created a wide range of fixtures to expand on these two methods utilizing different beam spreads, light color, and fixture style.  This course is not an endorsement of any one product or manufacturer; every company will have similar products and fixtures and I will draw on many different companies throughout this class to demonstrate what is being presented in each lesson.\nSection One will include photo gallery showing different lighting techniques and how they were created.  I'll also cover a brief history of landscape lighting and why we do it.\nSection Two will dive into the some of the aspects of lighting design, meaning bulbs, the properties of light, color temperature, reading photometric charts, and some of the different fixtures available to us.\nSection Three will discuss the temperature of light and how temperature will affect how we view objects within our design.\nSection Four will look at the process of developing a lighting plan.  Design considerations, site assessment and an overview of fixtures.\nSection Five will jump into installation methods, wiring, and transformers.  Two different wiring techniques will be covered - Daisy Chain and the Hub method.  I will leave it to you, the student, to decide which method you find the most reliable or worthy of your time.   Finally, I'll cover voltage drop calculations - in both Imperial and Metric values.\nSection Six will cover some basic installation procedures.\nSection Seven will be a course review and wrap up.\nResources will be provided to reinforce the lessons being presented.\nRemember, you have a 30-day, money-back guarantee, so you have nothing to lose if you find this is not the course for you.  Thank you for your interest and I look forward to seeing you in our first lesson.",

      "description": "Have you always wanted to learn how to draw? Are you struggling to get better at drawing? Often artists appear to have a magical ability to see something – really see it – and draw what they see near perfectly. In this specialist drawing class we'll delve into those seemingly magical skills and learn how to really look at a subject and draw it.\nI've been teaching Learn To Draw classes for a few years now with lots of successful results. Through my teaching experience I've been able to develop and refine a series of classes to teach anyone to learn how to draw. In this course I've taken what works best and put it together in a five part course to take you from beginner to improver! Even if you've been drawing for a while you'll find useful skills and practice exercises to take your drawing to the next level.\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nThe aim of this course is to enable the student to change the way they see - to look at what they are drawing as a series of lines, shapes and tones and to be able to successfully translate this onto paper. Each part of the course below covers a key aspect of learning to draw and includes explanations, exercises and a practice project.\nPart 1: Sketching and Shading Basics\nPart 2: Looking at Edges\nPart 3: Proportion\nPart 4: Tone & Shading\nPart 5: Final Drawing Project: The Eye\nTo succeed at drawing requires practice, practice, practice! - It's very similar to learning a musical instrument - you can understand all the theory in the world but to become competent at playing you need to put in the practice. To successfully improve your drawing will require a commitment to practicing and I suggest spreading this course out over 5-6 weeks with self-practice in between classes. I'm more than happy to give you feedback on your drawing or answer any questions you may have along the way!",

I currently own a Prusa i3 mk3s and Makerbot Replictator 2x, and use them regularly, about 4-5 times a week. I print in all kinds of materials, but usually PLA, ABS, and PETG.\n\nAs an instructor, I have also taught many of my friends, clients, and relatives as well as their children how to use a 3D printer to create their own designs.\n\nI can promise, once you learn the basics, it will change how you think in the best of ways! I am amazed at how natural and creative children are especially. I use my 3D printer to make money, and have paid for my printers many times over. I even have a utility patent for one of my 3D printed inventions and it all started with just being a little curious to start.\nBecause this is my first course on 3D Printing, I would love to hear your feedback about what I can do to improve the course and make it easier to understand. Are you ready to get started?\n\nWelcome to the whole new world of 3D printing and design with Tinkercad!\nBest wishes\nMichael Andrew\nPS- Thank you again",

You will need this course if you are responsible about the process controls part in a production line. This course covers all the basics and details about controls circuits for 3 phase induction motor and how to build them from scratch. We will first start with an introduction about classic controls, then we will go to the circuit components that are used to create Industrial controls circuit, For these components, we will cover its definition, working principle and types, We will also see engaging animations for our lectures and circuits. Then we will design the most common circuits that are used in the industry and then we will simulate them; if our simulation is successful I will build it by hand wire by wire. In this course you will understand the induction motor more and its windings and terminals. We will also discuss the voltage in star and delta connection. Finally, we will try to select our power components for a project in which we will calculate the Full Load Current and based on that we will choose our component’s sizes according to IEC and NFPA Standards.",

This course doesn't require you to have any prior experience in this software or any other structural design software. It will teach all the aspects of the software from very basic and will take you to the higher levels of the software as the course progresses. The course has been very systematically arranged so that you can best understand the software. Once you complete this course, you will have all the necessary knowledge to do the structural design of a building. You can do the structural design of buildings on your own projects.\nWe spent years at college but yet there are some topics that are overlooked in the engineering syllabus but are important in working fields. This course titled \" ETABS: Structural Analysis and Design of a Building\" has been created in order to fill that void and help students start out with structural design software. ETABS is a structural analysis and design software developed by csiamerica. It is a very powerful software that can design almost any kind of civil engineering structure.\nETABS is used for the design of beam and columns only. However, this course also contains the design of slab and the footing. Unlike other courses available online which only teach you tools of ETABS and not the actual process of analysis and design, this course takes a real-world architectural drawing of a building so as to explain the entire process from modeling up to the design.",

      "description": "Stack up and Tolerance Design is all about quality, or in other words, the allowable parts to be rejected during the process. In escence, this results in an iterative process between the design department, manufacturing and the customer. In this course you will learn the concepts to master plus/minus tolerance stack ups in 2D. At then end, you will become a valuable member for your company because you will be capable to assess assemblies and propose changes to meet critical requirements. Although currently there are several software which run complex tolerance analysis in 3D, in my experience, most of the times you can simplify the problem with a 2D analysis, so as mechanical designer YOU MUST be capable of performing 2D analysis in order to save valuable resources to the company.\nFirst, you will learn the basics: The definition of nominal value, tolerance, standard deviation, normal distribution and the importance of tolerance analysis in mechanical design.\nThen. you will learn how to create the sketch (loop) to follow in the calculation of tolerance analysis. Several exercises will be provided so you can practice this process.\nNext you will Learn how to perform a linear stack ups with three approaches:\nWorst Case: When no rejections are allowed. This apporach results in the most expensive, but it is used in critical applications.\nStatistical: Some rejections are allowed. The costs are reduced because some defects will always be presented.\nSix-Sigma: Complex considerations such as process distributions, process caapability and loss of performance are taken into account to improve the design at different quality levels.\nFinally, for each approach I will provide you five assemblies with different requirements. You will need to apply the concepts to find the suitable design which meet the quality levels and solve the critical clearances. A template in excel will allow you to perform these calculations.\nPlease note: We will cover ONLY plus/minus tolerances. But the knowledge is also applicable for geometric tolerances.\nThis course is based in my own experience as designer in the aerospace industry for 10 years. I used this methods everyday to discuss initial changes with customer, find a suitable provider and reduce costs with manufacturing.",

Throw in some ink and some colored pencils, maybe some gouache and NOW we're talking!\nI'll guide you through a portrait from start to finish in real time, and take you through a few others as well. You'll see me draw the face, but I also provide a couple different alternative ideas if drawing makes you nervous. I encourage you to read through the lecture descriptions before each video lecture. (They are on the course landing page and there is one for every lecture.)\nI'll be using toned mixed media paper for the main portrait instead of white watercolor paper, but you can also use white. If you use watercolors, using toned paper may be new to you. We get to add highlights!\nI am encouraging and challenging you to take risks. Try drawing, even if you aren't confident in your skills. The only way to learn is to try, then try again, and just keep practicing. If you think purple might look cool on the neck, but you aren't sure because, really, who has a purple neck? Go for it! What is the worst that can happen? You end up with purple on the person's neck. It might surprise you and look amazing! If not, keep going. Put purple in other places too. It might tie it all together. You will never learn and grow if you don't try. That's what this course is all about!\nI'll introduce you to the app called Sktchy (UPDATE: It is now called \"Museum by  Sktchy\".) There are lots of people ready for their portraits on the app. Draw one of them instead of someone dear to you. That will keep you free to take risks and not worry about \"ruining\" the portrait. And don't spend days on it. See what you can do in a few hours. Then be done and move on to the next one! (PS - Stkchy/Museum is only available on Apple products, but you could also get great reference photos from the websites Morguefile or Pexels.)\nI am SO excited! I hope you are ready to get started! :)",

      "description": "In this bumper woodworking course, you will learn how to build a beautiful bird house, a small aviary (animal enclosure), three wooden garden planters: a decorative planter, a more simple planter and then a stackable vegetable planter.\nDevelop your skills\nWe’ll start off learning how to build a simple planter made out of decking boards. This course assumes no prior knowledge, so everything is explained in full and you no DIY experience. Once we’ve created the first planter, we will develop our skills further and apply them in building a much more decorative version of the first planter.\nThe good thing about both of these planters is that the materials required are relatively inexpensive, and the tools you’ll need can be found in any DIY shop and can be bought without spending a fortune. Because the materials are affordable, the projects in this course are great for developing and improving your DIY skills. The skills you learn can be applied to other DIY projects too.\nAs well as garden planters, I’ll show you how to build a very simple but very useful stackable vegetable planter. This planter can be completely bespoke, and you can make it as tall or short as you like and arrange it into an array of different designs. I’ve called it a vegetable planter as it is ideal for creating your own home allotment, but it can actually be used for growing anything you like.\nIf you’d like to welcome more birds into your garden then why not build your own bird table, lavish it with food and watch as your new feathered friends enjoy your handy work.\nThe final project is the small bird aviary that can also be adapted to house other animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs and many other furry or feathered friends.\nBudding carpenters\nThis course is perfect for the complete beginner and is ideal for developing your skills as a DIY carpenter without spending a fortune.",

      "description": "The uninterrupted use of a datacenter or any facility with high-value equipment is always delicate, and in many cases vital, and damage to one of these facilities, such as that caused by a fire, can be catastrophic. In the specific case of data centers, they include equipment that is expensive and sophisticated, that is susceptible to damage, whose replacement can take a long time and that when it does not work, it could cost a lot of money. This is where Clean Agent Extinguishing Systems come in, considered one of the most effective systems in suppressing fires.\nEvery day we see more complex projects with more demanding requirements, which require extensive knowledge of the concepts and standards by engineers and architects for the design of Fire Extinguishing Systems, as well as the field personnel in charge of the installations, tests and maintenance.\nIn this course you will learn the concepts, components and specifications of Clean Agents, design calculations, installation procedures, testing and maintenance of Clean Agent fire suppression systems. It is designed for beginning students as well as professionals with prior knowledge of fire protection systems.\nThe course uses a theoretical/practical methodology so we will be working together on a Datacenter design, where we will have to perform calculations and locate the different components based on what the NFPA 2001 standard dictates. We also include a practical exercise, designed for you to use your knowledge to find the answer. Before working on the design we will focus on reviewing each component of the system, schematic and operation.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\n\n\nConcepts:\nCharacteristics of fire and its relationship with clean agents\nTypes and characteristics of clean agents\nImpact of clean agents on humans\nScheme of a complete clean agent extinguishing system\nOperation of Clean Agent systems and their relationship with fire alarm systems\n\n\nConcepts about the NFPA 2001 Standard\nLearn the composition of all the chapters\nWe will study the design standards\nWe will study the requirements for the installation, testing, inspection, training and maintenance of clean agent extinguishing systems.\n\n\nDesign of a Clean Agent Extinction System in a Datacenter\nMinimum requirements for the design of clean agent extinguishing systems\nIsometric development\nPractical calculations to determine the amount of Clean agent required\nCalculation of quantity of material for installation\n\n\nInstallation and testing\nStep by step to prepare the enclosure for installation\nInstallation and testing procedure",

      "description": "Hey there, it’s Clayton from How to Draw Comics . NET,\nI’m ultra-excited to present to you HTDC’s first \"Figure Drawing Fundamentals Lesson | Proportions!\"\n\"Figure Drawing Foundations | Proportions\" is a laser focused volume of Comic Art training created specifically to give you the ability to draw your Comic Book Characters in Proportion.\nThe ideas, techniques and tools you’re about to learn in this training package have been carefully developed and refined over years of learning, testing and experience.\nI use them every day I sit down to draft out a new Comic Book Character myself, because the truth is everything you’re going to learn in this lesson ACTUALLY works if you apply it!\nAnd I’m not the only one who’s taken advantage of what I’m giving you here - over the years my students have also used these insights and techniques to conquer the most challenging, fundamental obstacle every artist is met with when they set out to improve their drawing abilities - Proportions\nFigure Drawing Foundations | Proportions - Includes:\nFigure Drawing Fundamentals | Proportions E-Book\nThe 34 Page E-Book holds some of the most concentrated, highly polished fundamental knowledge on Proportions that you will not find anywhere else.\nEvery piece of insight has been carefully articulated with complimentary, high detail Comic Book illustrations to give you clear visual examples, and to inspire. The Proportions E-Book is a must have reference guide for every aspiring Comic Book Artist who wants to get their figure drawing foundations handled – beginning with Proportions.\nBest of all it’s all digital! So you don’t have to wait to get it in the mail, you get it instantly. You never have to worry about it getting damaged or lost, and you can take it anywhere, having it right at your finger tips whenever you want it.\nFigure Drawing Fundamentals | Proportions Core Lesson\nThe Core Proportions Lesson is the 40 minute, narrated, Video adaption of the Proportions E-Book - designed to give you a highly immersive, potent learning experience. The core lesson breaks down the topics step by step, walking you’re through each segment. Instead of just looking at each example, I’ll be highlighting the Proportions of the human figure segment by segment so that you don’t miss a beat.\nThe entire lesson has been narrated, which means you can sit back, listen, watch and learn, giving you a whole new level of educational immersion.\nBoth the Core Video and the E-Book are exceptional volumes of Comic Art training, designed and carefully composed to be delivered in two different formats.\nFigure Drawing Fundamentals | Proportions Templates\nAs well as the training material, I’ve also created a set of high resolution Proportions Templates. These Templates are essentially a height chart for each of the overarching topics covered in the E-Book and Core Proportions Lesson – The Heroic Figure, Proportions at Different Ages and Comic Book Archetypes.\nThese were specially created to serve you as the go to reference guide whenever you set out to draw a Comic Book character – a guide not just to drawing your characters in Proportion, but also to provide a reference for placing in their anatomy.\nThe Proportions Templates are ultra-high resolution image files which means you can set them up as your desktop background, or print them out on giant posters to hang up in your studio or work space. Either way, you can rest assured that every detail will be captured in sharp HD focus.\nBut I didn’t want to stop there. See, one of the toughest things to overcome when learning is the fact that you’re not here in the classroom with me to guide you through the process of implementing all the cool stuff you’re going to learn.\nSo I decided to really go above and beyond for you here to GUARANTEE you the results you came here for.\nAlong with the Proportions E-Book, Core Proportions Lesson and Proportions Templates - I’ve also included:\nFigure Drawing Fundamentals | Proportions Workshop\nAs far as content and step by step instruction - this is where it’s at. The Proportions Workshop is a 5 Hour + module of intensive, real-time training designed to help you implement everything you’ve learned in the Core Proportions Lesson.\nIn the first 4 Workshop Sessions you’re going to learn step-by-step how to build a proportionally accurate figure drawing from the ground up. I’ll walk you through the front, and side view of both the male and female figure so that you get a full understanding of how the key forms of the human body are drawn. Literally, you’ll follow along with a sketchbook and pencil as we do the exercise together, and finish up with a set of Proportionally accurate figures in front of you.\nIn the following 4 sessions we enter into the advanced concepts of Proportions where I’ll walk you through a series of examples and exercises designed to get you drawing your figures in perspective – while keeping their proportions intact!\nEach of the Sessions focus on:\nHow to place down, and construct your characters on the page so that they fit within the space you’re drawing them – whether that be the page itself or the panels within a sequential piece of art work.\nHow to draw your characters in different poses, and foreshorten them in Perspective – and how to apply Proportions in those more dynamic scenarios.\nYou’ll learn how to understand the human figure in terms of simple form so that you can take a pose from observation, turn it around inside your mind and draw it down onto the page at any angle, in any view you desire. And I show exactly how to do it – in fact I walk you through it one step at a time so that you can implement the process for yourself.\nAnd finally I share practical exercises with you that are specially designed to make drawing your characters in proportion second nature, through repetition. If you practice the exercises you learn in this session, Proportions will be a problem for you no more.\nEach of the 8 sessions within the Proportions Workshop goes for 40 minutes to an hour, and are aimed at putting everything you’ve learned into action straight away so that you can see an improvement in your drawings right NOW!\nUltimately, when you get Figure Drawing Fundamentals | Proportions, my hope is that it will not only give you a highly concentrated, deep level of insight into the complexities of Proportion - but that it will also serve as a dependable guide for you to refer back to whenever you need it.\nMy goal was to deliver ‘the’ guide to drawing your Comic Book Characters in Proportion. And I really do believe that I’ve created that for you here.\n-Clayton",

These will include high downwash designs, large undercut designs, size zero and shrink wrap design.\nFinally, we will learn about legality. Why is it important to design legal parts, especially for small teams? How do I build in mechanisms into my design to avoid designing illegal parts? And how do we check for legality efficiently?\nIf you are seeking a career in F1 and/or are a F1 fan and want to know more about how to design a F1 car, this is the right course for you.\nBest,\nMartin",

Your gamedev journey starts today!\n\nThis course teaches the basics for creating video game pixel art. Students will learn about shapes, values, edges, color theory, creating a basic palette, and animation.\n\n\nIf you are new to art or pixel art and want to create better art for your indie games then this course is for you.\n\n\nIt will take roughly 8 hours to complete this course.\n\n\nThis course contains step by step video lectures, quizzes for important section information, and challenges to help students improve their pixel art outside of the video lectures. Practice is key in art and you will get a good amount of practice as you complete this course.\n\n\nThis course will strengthen your foundations in art and pixel art. It will build your confidence in your art and give you the information you need to continue improving your pixel art even after completing the course.\n\nPixel art is appealing and useful for indie games because of its clarity, nostalgia, and efficiency. Its minimal forms are instantly recognizable, evoking early gaming while offering a distinct style. The resolution and color constraints drive creativity, making it a lasting and versatile art form. Just like 2D art in animation, well-made pixel art will always be a viable art style in videogames, no matter how realistic and lifelike other video game art styles get.",

      "description": "Description\nA Pre- Engineered Building or PEB is a metal building frame that includes a structural system and often also roof and wall cladding. A PEB building, as it is called, is engineered at a factory and assembled at site. Built-up sections are fabricated at the factory to size and then transported to site to assemble with bolted connections. This type of Structural Concept is generally used to build Industrial Buildings, Metro Stations, Canopies, and Warehouses etc. These rigid frames consist of roof beams and columns that are field bolted together. These frames can span large distances without intermediate supporting columns.\nThis course summarizes the IS design code requirements and industry practice design criteria, design loads and other design consideration for PEB that are being followed in the Design offices.\nIn this course, your trainer takes you through designing process of PEB in the structural engineering software. Modelling the PEB and applying loads can be a complex and confusing in beginning, but your trainer breaks it down into bite-sized pieces and teaches it in plain English.\nYou will start with the absolute basics i.e. calculating loads on the PEB. Your trainer proceeds step by step through the process of modelling columns, beams, stringers, bracing, applying dead loads, product loads, thermal loads, wind loads. Next, trainer proceeds further on how to assign the properties to the structural steel members, assigning the releases and supports. Final stage shall be how to analyze and assign the design commands. Trainer finishes the lecture by explaining how user can optimize the structure as per the industry standards.\nWhat Will I Learn?\n· How to design Indian Standard codes compliant steel structural PEB.\nRequirements to learn this course\n· A computer with either Windows, Mac with good internet connection.\nDescription\nYou’ve just stumbled upon the most complete, in-depth Structural Steel Design for PEB course online. With almost scarce data available on the net, this comprehensive tutorial covers everything you’ll ever need.\nAt the end of this course, You’ll even get a certification of completion to add to your CV.",

      "description": "The Best Ideas Don't Let You Sleep\nRemember when you were a kid, and you’d sit around with your friends spit balling ideas for comic book characters just for fun? You’d come up with cool super powers and abilities, give them quirky names and pit them against each other to see who would win. Maybe you’d draw them out in your scrapbook, or role-play with your pals in the backyard.\nTill this day your imagination probably hasn’t let up either. Every now and then, you’ll watch a movie on Netflix, play a video game or read a comic book that sets off that same spark of inspiration. And that character you’ve just conjured up from the depths of your imagination keeps you up for the rest of the night, as you let the stories you dream of writing for them someday play out as a mental movie.\nThe best ideas don’t let you sleep. They linger. And at some point you’re compelled to do something with them. For us artistic types, that means putting pencil to paper and drawing them out. That’s the best way we know to process our thoughts and ideas so that we can share them with the world.\nBut what if the next time you put pencil to paper you were able illustrate that character like a pro? How much would it mean to you, if you had the ability to pencil, ink and color your characters like the comic book artists you look up to and admire most?\nIf you knew how, maybe you could turn that idea into something real.\nWouldn’t that be cool? Of course it would! Creating our own comic book characters and illustrating them like the pros would be a dream come true.\n\n\nThe Question is Though – Where Do You Begin?\nThere are so many steps in the process to creating a complete comic book character that the mere thought of attempting to do it yourself is utterly overwhelming.\nWhat if you didn’t have to tackle this alone though? If you were given a complete guide that actually showed you exactly how it was done from start to finish would you put what you learned into action?\nIf your answer is yes, I think you’re going to like what you’re about to read next.\nBecause I’m offering you that very opportunity right now with my new character creator course, where you’ll learn the entire production workflow for drafting, designing, inking and coloring a complete character concept from beginning to end.\nThe demonstration featured throughout these lessons gives you an inside look into the making of ‘E’ an original character I created for an apocalyptic/sci fi action comic. Every aspect of her design was carefully crafted, each line intricately inked in with attention to detail, colored and rendered to present her with maximum depth and dimension.\nYou’re going to get to watch how it was all done through my eyes as I explain every part of the process along the way.\n\n\nWhy Learn From Me?\nBefore we talk about what this course is all about and what it has to offer you – I’d like to tell you who I am, why you would want to give me the time of day and what I can offer you as a teacher.\nBecause we all know that being a brilliant craftsman doesn’t equate to someone’s skill as a teacher. So what makes me such an exception?\nThe thing is, being a comic book artist isn’t my only passion. I also have a profound love for teaching.\nLike drawing I wasn’t very good at it to begin with though. I was a shy kid growing up and avoided public speaking like the plague. So when I was offered a position at the university I’d just graduated from in 2010 I was stricken with terror.\nI knew however what an incredible opportunity I’d been given career-wise. I also realized at this point the knowledge and experience I’d honed over the years didn’t have to stop with me. Now I could pass what I knew onto others and help them avoid the pitfalls and obstacles I’d already come up against.\nI could become the mentor I’d wished I had for others. That made facing my fears of public speaking a worthwhile endeavor.\nOver the years I’ve honed my craft as a teacher and practicing artist, walking the talk and teaching across multiple universities. I taught classes on a range of different topics including character design, digital illustration, and visual communication. Every time I walked into the classroom I was forced to rattle away the nerves, break down my process and explain every step of it throughout the demonstration.\nMost importantly, I had to make sure that my students were able to implement what I was teaching and see a real improvement in their work, so that they could pass the class and I could keep my job.\nAlong the way I’ve helped countless students level up their skill-set both in the classroom and through my online courses. At this point I know the common problems students are likely to run into, and how to help them move past them. There’s only so many ways you can mess up a character illustration – and at this point I’ve seen them all, having battled through most of them myself.\nAnd you know what else has happened since then?\nIt must be true when they say the best way to learn is to teach because my abilities as a comic book artist have absolutely skyrocketed.\n\n\nThe Purpose of This Course\nWhat I’d like to do for you is shorten your learning curve, as I’ve done for so many others, by giving you a clear guide that’ll reveal what it takes to create a complete comic book character concept from start to finish.\nThroughout the years, I’ve developed a specific workflow I follow every time to create compelling comic book characters which are captivating and memorable. I’d like to share that with you in this course so that you can use it to create your own.\nIn short, you’re going to get the complete process I use for producing a comic book character design, unpacking everything my drawing, inking and coloring workflow entails. Best of all its repeatable. So you’ll be able to put everything you learn throughout this course straight into action to create your own epic comic book characters.\n\n\nWhy You Can Actually Do This!\nNow, at this point you’re probably thinking this sounds like a great deal – BUT there’s no way in the world you’re going to be able to pull off a character with the same level of quality.\nIt’s intimidating, I get it.\nYou’re right. At least for now. Learning how to produce a character to the standard you’ll see demonstrated in this course is going to take time, practice and dedication. You won’t magically be a pro just from watching a few videos. But when you take this course, make no mistake – you will know how it’s done. You’ll know what the process entails.\nAll you got to do then is implement it.\nThe rest is up to you. Unfortunately I can’t force you to put what you’re going to learn here into action. I can’t make you practice it over and over again until you’ve processed all that knowledge and fully integrated it into your approach to character creation.\nBut I can promise that if you do – the kind of characters you’re illustrating a couple months from now will be on a whole new level to the character’s you’re able to create today.\nI know that for a fact – because I started out the same as you.\n\n\nDid I Mention I Have No Talent?\nI wasn’t born with a natural talent; I had to learn this stuff just like you. That’s not a humble brag, it’s the truth. When I was coming up in the game, there were no courses out there that gave you the full scoop on how to draw, ink and color a complete comic book character. I had to put those pieces together myself, and I sucked at it at first.\nThe incredible thing about honing your skills as a comic book artist is that you can be as good as you want to be. It all comes down to how much time you’re willing to put in. And if you care enough about mastering that which you’re most passionate about, you’ll do whatever it takes.\nYour learning doesn’t stop with the content in this course. 80% of the success you’re going to see after taking it will come directly from you – as long as you do something with it.\nSo to help you apply all the techniques and methods I’ll be sharing with you, I’ve included assignments that you’ll complete along the way so that by the end, you’ll have produced a full color character design you can be proud of.\n\n\nCourse Outline\nThat all said, here’s the full course outline and what you’re going to learn when you enrol:\nFoundations: Give your character design the best chance of success right from the start by establishing a solid foundation that upholds the fundamental principles every well drawn character is built upon – proportions, pose and placement. You’ll see how the same figure (and head shot) is constructed from multiple points of view so that you know how to draw them from the front and back three quarter angles.\nCharacter Design: Once we’ve got a sturdy foundation to build our character upon, we’ll sketch in their anatomy and pencil out the design draft on top. This is my favorite part of the whole course because it’s where we really get to exercise our creativity and come up with a character design that’s captivating and most importantly – memorable. You’ll also learn how to create consistency from one view point to the next, so that you know exactly how they’re going to look no matter what angle you’re drawing them on.\nInking: After we’re done with the rough draft it’s time to cement our idea in ink, using sharp, slick, energetic line art. We’ll begin by outlining the primary contours that define the character design, applying line weight variation for a more dynamic, visually appealing contour.\nNext we’ll drop in the shadows to suggest the overall lighting scheme, describe form and create contrast between the various materials featured throughout the character design. This step is key to breaking them up with varying levels of dark and light value, creating a greater level of readability and impact on the page.\nThen we’ll push the depth of the character even further using fine-lined hatches to render out the forms, materials and textures for added definition – completing the inking stage and leaving us with a crystal clean line art presentation for our character design.\nColoring: The final portion of the course is dedicated to coloring, and in the remaining lessons, you’ll learn how to compose an appealing color scheme for your character that compliments their design. We’ll discuss color theory and psychology, along with the technical considerations such as the layer hierarchy, brushes and settings used throughout the process.\nI’ll share my favourite methods for rendering forms and materials with realistic shading and lighting, using adjustment layers and blending modes to create a vivid presentation that makes the character pop right off of the page.\n\n\nProject Files and Digital Art Brushes\nAlong with the lessons themselves, you’ll also receive the PSD files and digital art brushes featured throughout the demonstration, so that you can go back through these documents for yourself to see how everything was organized and composed.\nAnd as I mentioned already, you’ll also get accompanying assignments for you to complete as you go through the course, so that by the end you’ve got a complete comic book character design sitting right there in front of you – that you can use in a portfolio, gallery display or comic book.\nThe great thing is you can watch these lessons on your desktop, mac, or portable device of your choosing, at your own pace and convenience. You can go back through each chapter and recap on the information given throughout the course as many times as you need to make sure you don’t miss a second of insight.\n\n\nCouldn't You Learn All of This On Youtube For Free?\nOkay, this is all good and well, but couldn’t you just learn all this stuff for free on Youtube? Of course you could. A lot of what I learned, I learned on Youtube too. You might have even subscribed to my Youtube channel already and taken away a ton of value from the videos I’ve put out. We’re incredibly lucky to have so much information on any topic we’re interested in right there at our finger tips.\nBut here’s the big difference between this course, and anything you’ll find on Youtube. Everything you need to know is packaged into one place here and carefully structured to give you a comprehensive volume of character creation know-how. That’s 6+ hours of curated content that’s purpose built to give you a no BS approach to creating your own comic book characters.\nContrast that with Youtube – and you’re looking at 10-15 minute videos that are scattered all over the place, often taught by different instructors of varying degrees of teaching ability, which don’t give you anywhere near the same level of depth or explanation you’re going to get out of this course.\nNot to mention I’ll be giving you assignments the whole way through that give you the opportunity to implement what you’re learning.\nPlus, I don’t know about you, but the one thing I try to stay away from when I’m learning something new is Youtube. Because it’s incredibly distracting! Chances are, when you do watch those free tutorials, you’ve got a bunch of other tabs open at the same time that you’re switching between – dividing your attention and sabotaging your learning experience. Youtube is built to entertain, excite and indulge, before it’s meant to educate.\nSo while you could learn this stuff elsewhere, you really have to weigh up whether or not it makes sense to save your time sifting through all the subpar content on Youtube to find a few reasonably well put together videos – or if it’s better just to get this course now, knowing that you can get started right away with everything you need to know being here all in one place.\n\n\nAre You Ready For This?\nIf you’re ready to take you’re comic art abilities to the next level, and commit to truly honing your skill-set –what are you waiting for?\nGet started now!\nAfter you’ve purchased the course you’ll have immediate access to all the video lessons, assignments and projects files inside. You can stream the lessons online on your PC, Mac or portable media device – or you can download the whole course and keep it on your hard drive.\nBy the end of this course you’ll know how to illustrate a full comic book character concept – but even better than that, you’ll have created your own, with hopefully many more to come after that one. But we’ve got a lot of ground to cover, so if you’re ready to take your comic art skill-set to the next level and create characters like a pro let’s do this! Enrol now – and we’ll get started in just a few short moments.\nSee you inside.",

      "description": "This course is dedicated to students looking to acquire electrical low-voltage power design experience from scratch.\nThis course covers low voltage distribution system design-related topics for a total duration of 10 hours.\nEssentially, the course begins section 1 by introducing the well-known drawing software \"AutoCAD\" and emphasizing its different toolbar options to prepare the student to be familiar with its use. Consequently, lighting design and lux calculations using DIALux software are fully explained in section 2 to prepare the lighting distribution system that will be explained and designed as a following step in section 3.\nAfter that, lighting & power systems distribution are covered in sections 3 & 4, which in turn prepares the student to understand how to gather information and calculate the total connected loads following the lighting and power designed layouts to be reflected in the panel schedules and single line diagrams which will be explained in the 5th section of this course.\nOnce reaching this stage of the course, you will have to perform a range of low voltage system-related calculations of sizing Transformers, Generators, Cables, Circuit Breakers, calculations of voltage drop and short circuit current levels & power factor correction to ensure a safe design for the entire system for the aim of reflecting the calculated values in the single line diagram of the project. All these calculations will be explained separately in detail using simple steps that you can apply manually and with the help of predefined Excel sheets for solving different formulas in section 6.\nThe last section of this course covers the earthing & lightning system topics, emphasizing their different types, components & the appropriate methods to design these systems following international standards.\nFurthermore, design topics in this course are explained by exploring pictures of different electrical equipment installed on the site to clarify the bond between the design and real site installations.\nBesides, the course is enhanced with a variety of helpful resources that are attached to it.\nIn a nutshell, the sections of this course are arranged in ascending relevant stages, starting from section 1, which introduces AutoCAD, and finalizing the course by explaining the earthing & lightning systems which could be designed in the last stages of the design.",

      "description": "The primary aim of this course is to give you a thorough grounding in the techniques of how to approach the design of a garden, progressing through all the stages from the outline of an empty garden plot right up to a fully illustrated garden design.\n\n\nI strongly believe that the most effective way of teaching garden design skills is to involve students in designing for themselves right from the start. So, with this in mind, I have designed 13 exercises where you can pause the presentation of the course and work through each exercise in your own time supported by download resources\n\n\nIn six of these exercises, gardens of varying size, shape, style and complexity are introduced. This is followed by demonstrations, filmed from above a drawing board, of all the stages in the design of each garden. You will then be able to create your own designs for these gardens using the supplied base plans.\n\n\nThe presentation of this course includes more than 70 slides to accompany a commentary on how to design, and these slides combine examples of garden design projects, images, sketches, photos, plans and diagrams. Each slide will also include bullet points summarising the main points of my commentary, and these bullet points can be a useful reminder if you need to look back over the main features of the course.\n\n\nThe final sections of the course summarise the important design considerations needed to create original and attractive gardens, and demonstrate how to find and record inspiration for your designs.\n\n\nThis course has been written for anyone who wants to learn the skills and techniques of how to design original and beautiful gardens. You may be someone who wants to know how to design your own garden, or someone who is interested in starting a career in garden design, or a student studying garden design. Or you may be working as a gardener, a garden contractor, a garden designer or a landscape architect.\n\n\nFor all these people and anyone simply interested in garden design, this course progresses from the essential baseline skills, to more advanced techniques which will be demonstrated in the design of gardens of increasing complexity\n\n\nThis course is the third in this series of four courses under the heading of ‘The Complete Garden Design Course’. Taken together these four courses will give you a thorough grounding in the art of garden design so that by the end you will have learnt all the skills you will need to undertake your own garden design projects. However, while this course on How to Design often refers back the earlier two courses, it can also be studied as a stand-alone course. A list of drawing equipment introduced in the earlier Drawing Techniques course and which will be needed to complete the design exercises is provided at start of Section 2 of the course.",

You need nothing about any experience or knowledge of it.\n\n\nIn the first section, you will learn how to create a short story using \"The 12 Questions Method\". This method is a simplification of the complex thinking process of professional Manga Artists. You can easily create a story outline by just answering the “12 questions”. What is the most important thing to create a story? The theme? The content of the story? You can find them in many instructional books. But at least that's not how we Japanese manga artists see it. Of course, I'm not saying that you don't need a theme or a story, but there is a more important thing to consider first. That's \"THE CHARACTER\". Many beginners fail because they think too hard about their theme or story without thinking about the Character.\nIn the second section, I will share with you \"The Resume Method\" that I used in my university classes, and I will teach you specifically how to create a Character. This method allows you to concretely understand your Character, and it allows them to begin to move freely within your story. This method is very effective not only for manga, but also for short stories or scripts. You will analyze the protagonist of \"The Gruffalo\", \"Pokémon\", and \"Naruto\".\nIn the final section, you will create a protagonist's \"Resume\", and then apply my \"12 Questions Method\" to them. The outline of your short story will be now complete.\nNow, let's dive into the story world with me and enjoy creating the short story in this way. See you in the course!",

He's not simply some guy who's always liked to draw, got a microphone for Christmas and thought it'd be cool to make a course. I regard myself as an exceptionally unexceptional draftsman but can already sense some improvement in the way I'm tackling portraits.The value I've already received leaves me with absolutely no complaints. You'll be getting A LOT of information from a guy who knows what he's doing with this course. And the demos - from blank sheet of paper to finished, fully rendered drawing - are both highly informative and inspirational. I'm not sure you can ask for more than that from any instructor. It's a keeper. Many Thanks, Mr P for putting this together.\n–Sam Pollard\n\nOf all the elements of drawing, portraiture is one of the most difficult to master. Practice alone is not enough to create portraits that come alive. That is the core value of this course. It provides a strong foundation for the individual to begin to master the creation of portraits of substance. This is not a course for the lazy. It requires patience and practice. But it will provide a roadmap that will allow the student to create fulfilling and satisfying portraits.\n–Stuart Givot\nAn Excellent Course. I was Impressed by Chris's Level of Knowledge, Experience and Expertise. This course has differently give me knowledge that will help me improve my work and help me integrate into work with Charcoal.\n–Aisha Smith\nI was blown away of how great of a teacher Mr. Petrocchi is. He provided some incredible insights into helping me improve my facial drawing skills. It's amazing of how easy and simple he teaches technique. I feel inspired and highly recommend his courses. I can't wait to learn more from him!!!\n–Tuese Ahkiong\nHere is a clear, deep and well made course. Chris's sense of art teaching is excellent, it's like hanging out in his studio, looking over his shoulder (literally sometimes) and learning from following a professional. He talks out loud what goes on in his thoughts as he mindfully works his image. Seeing him work really helps me. His own career is used as an example, and I love all the personal stories that talk about his journey in the art world and specifically in this field of drawing portraits. The course is full of gold nuggets of info, stories, metaphors that help me put words and structure in my work. (I love the \"Valley of the Suck\" concept–so true! ) This course really helped me to clarify my work in regards to values. Also, it helps to come back to those foundations of the underlying structure of the face. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to build a strong foundation and seriously wants to get into portrait art. As it is in my case, I would recommend it as well to any professional that wants to come back and touch those foundations again, one tends to forget stuff! Thank you Chris, and I agree \"the figure is a song\"!\n–Philippe Ames\n\nIf you are ready to improve and go higher than you ever thought you could with your portraits then this course is for you!\nSee you inside,\nChris Petrocchi | Draw Juice studio\n#portrait #portraiture #drawing #draw #human #faces #beginners #pencil #charcoal",

      "description": "Some technologies are simple like a cup or hammer, some are complicated like a circuit board or car, but some are truly complex such as large information systems, supply chain networks, sustainable urban environments, health care systems or advanced financial services. These complex engineered systems are defined by consisting of multiple diverse parts that are highly interconnect and autonomous.\nThis course is a comprehensive introduction to the application of complexity theory to the design and engineering of systems within the context of the 21st century, from the bigger picture of why we should care to key architectural considerations, It brings together many new ideas in systems design to present an integrated paradigm and set of principal to the design of complex systems.\nA new design paradigm- In the first section of the course we will explore some of the major themes that are shaping the design and engineering of systems in the 21st century, such as the rise of sustainability, information technology, the revolution in services and economic globalisation, these will all provide a backdrop and reoccurring set of themes that will be woven into our discussion. This section will also give you an overview to complexity theory and the basic concepts that we will be using though out the course, such as the model of a system, a framework for understanding complexity and a definition for complex systems.\nThe last section of this model will give an overview to complex systems design providing you with a clear and concise description of what a complex engineered system is and how this new paradigm in design differs from our traditional approach.\nKey concepts- Next we introduce you to the key concepts within this new domain, we will talk about services and product-service systems, designing synergistic relations in order to integration diverse components and one of the key takeaways form this entire course the idea of abstraction as a powerful tool for solving complexity.\nDesign Principals- In the third module to the course we discuss the primary principals that should govern our approach to designing complex systems. Firstly networks with these highly interconnected systems networks are their true geometry, understanding them and being able to see the systems we are designing as networks is one of our key principal. Secondly we will look at adaptive systems and how I.T. is enabling the next generation of technologies that are responsive, adaptive and dynamic, allowing for self-organisation and a new form of bottom up emergent design. Lastly in this section we will also cover the key mechanisms of evolution and how it effect the lifecycle to the system we are designing.\nSystems Architecture- In systems architecture we begin to change gears to talk about the more practical mechanics of how to design complex systems based around a new systems architecture paradigm that has arisen within I.T. over the past few decades what is called Services Orientated Architecture, in this section we will discuss platform technologies and their internal workings, modular systems design and Event Driven Architecture which is particularly well suited to the dynamic nature of the systems we are developing.\nDesign Methods- Lastly we present a series of lectures on the design method or process best suited to complex systems design. In this module you will be introduced to design thinking that represents a repeatable set of stages in the design process for solving complex problems.",

An added bonus is that the same concepts and ideas put forth in this course will help anyone in their understanding of nearly any color, not just skin tones. Although Color Theory is a vast and complicated subject, and this course narrows in on skin color, that is itself very broad and far-ranging, so there is plenty to go through. The course focuses primarily on presenting the most useful aspects of color theory for representational artists and provides a logical and simplified vocabulary for that, namely: hue, value, and chroma. More specifically, you will learn how to use this \"language\" when considering or describing the  nuanced world of skin tones without relying, for example, on names of paints (as opposed to names of colors). Paint names can be surprisingly misleading since the same paint from one manufacturer can look quite different from the paint with same name from another. The concepts presented will be useful for artists in any medium.\nThrough lecture and demonstration, including some exercises that subscribers may wish to try on their own, this course will develop a theoretical framework for the artist. But, as the title implies, it will be more than theoretical because the knowledge gained can and, perhaps, ought to be put into practice and used every day.",

Some part of the course is recorded in Madrid version\nThis course contains close to 8 hours of training videos. The last section deals with the creation of custom applications based on requirements. In this section, we will be doing a Hands-on session in the ServiceNow system.\nA real-time hands-on experience would give us more grip on the ServiceNow system rather than just going through fancy slides. That's the reason I focused on the content-oriented training course.\nPlease understand that this is an Intermediate Level Course. You should have some knowledge already on the ServiceNow Admin concepts. In addition to that, knowledge of any coding language is required to understand the course, as we are going to deal with the scripting part while configuring. Basic knowledge of Javascript is recommended.\nWe will be talking on many key scripting items in this ServiceNow Developer course.\nBelow are the key items which we would be covering;\nWorking in Application Studio for developing custom applications in ServiceNow\nDirections on which configuration should be used - like Business rule or Client Script or UI Action, etc\nConfiguring Scripted Scheduled Jobs which run on a specified time period\nCreating basic reports in ServiceNow platform\nGood understanding of Server and Client APIs like GlideSystem, Glide Record, Glide Form, Glide Ajax, Glide User, etc\nMaking a column unique in a table\nUseful methods in Out of The Box APIs\nSetting ACL restrictions on tables and records in ServiceNow\nThis course would also help you to get closer to the concepts required for ServiceNow Application Developer certification\n\n\nI always believe in student satisfaction, if you have any question on ServiceNow, feel free to post your question in the Q&A section, I will respond :)",

The odds are, most of them have been accidental and unpleasant. Sound profoundly affects every area of our lives, from our health to our productivity.\n\nThe word 'soundscape' was coined by the Canadian composer and author Murray Schafer. Schafer used the word to describe all of the sound around us. 'Soundscaping', the verb, describes the process of consciously designing that sound; taking responsibility for it and creating sound that is appropriate, effective and intentional. This skill can be applied anywhere; in your home, in your office, in your schools.\n\nMy mission is to make the world sound beautiful. I've spoken about this topic on the TED stage in my talk Why architects need to use their ears. As founder of The Sound Agency, my company works with some of the world's biggest brands to increase their sales and customer satisfaction by improving the way they sound. Now I share this knowledge with you to help you master the art of soundscaping.",

      "description": "Design and build you own portable speaker\nIn this course you will learn all there is to know to design a portable speaker which will suit your needs. Not only you will have the satisfaction to build your own speaker, but will also have the opportunity to design every aspect of the speaker to your liking. Maybe you want a large battery pack, so the speaker will last a long time without charging. Maybe you don't particularly care about portability and want to use large speakers for high volume listening. It's all up to you on how you design it.\nCourse contents\nThis course will take every part of the portable speaker and teach you everything there is to know about them. Only after that you can make your own decisions on what you want to use for your next project. Here are some lessons which you should expect :\nBattery pack : The battery pack can be built in many ways, depending on your available equipment. Also, it needs to be in accordance with your other components. There are many little secrets to help you in making a good and safe battery pack.\nAmplifier : There are many mini amplifiers to choose from. The course will help decide which one you need according to the speaker that you choose. The amplifier choice will mainly dictate what type of battery pack that you need.\nSpeakers : The speakers are heart of your project. They will pretty much say how large your enclosure will be, what amp you need and all the other implications. We will talk about what parameters we need to look for and which enclosure will best match these speakers.\nBluetooth module and accessories : Besides the main components, you would be surprised how many other little components there are in portable speaker : buttons, connectors, voltage step-down circuits, isolators etc. These all need to be picked carefully and in accordance to your other components\nThe enclosure : Finally the box itself. While the box itself will be a compromise, as we need to make it as small as possible, we will talk about which design we should choose and how to get the most out of the available space.\nWill there any box design examples?\nYou bet! We will have 4 box design and build example. From small to large. So you will have a step by step process of designing a portable speaker. How I chose the components, how the circuit diagram for all of the components looks like. What problems I encountered and how you should avoid them, or how to fix them if you run into them. Not only do I show you how to design them, but I will also show you how I built them and walk you along the way of the construction process. Furthermore, there will be examples of each enclosure type which are most popular for Bluetooth speakers : sealed, bass reflex and passive radiator.",

Starting with the very basics, we consider definition of the bridge, different types and what is the statically system of each type of bridges. We then move on to look at bridge components ; what are they and how the loads transfer through them? We'll cover the different types of  design codes and the different types of loads in detail. Worked examples are used extensively to demonstrate the practical application of theory.\nBased on my experience lecturing to engineering undergraduates, the course focuses on those areas students find particularly tricky when starting out. The link between theory and practice is reinforced using my experience as a infrastructure design engineer. The course includes video lectures which combine screen cast voice over with traditional style lectures.\nThe emphasis is on worked examples with students encouraged to try questions before the detailed solution is presented. The teaching philosophy is 'learn by doing!'.\nThis course is suitable for engineering students who find their bridges lectures confusing and feel a little lost when it comes to bridge design. The course also give the hand for the graduated engineers to build their way to be bridge designer. Bridge designer became one of the most required civil engineering jobs in the market. Once you get the chance to understand and apply on real brides you already created a new chance for your career.\nWho is the target audience?\nThis course is great for undergraduate engineering students who feel a little lost in their bridge design lectures. We start from scratch, establishing the basics and build from there.\nGraduated engineers who want to create another chance on their career as bridge designer.\nIf you're about to start an engineering program, this course is a great way to get a head start.\nBridge designers who are doing their design manually want to learn a fast tool to design bridges by computer.\nWorking examples\nDesign examples on real bridge design will be updated in order to increase the application and ability to understand.",

      "description": "This comprehensive course offers a thorough exploration of Zemax Sequential Mode, providing participants with a systematic understanding of lens design, optical system analysis, and surface property management. Structured to align with real-world optical engineering needs, this course introduces foundational concepts before progressing to advanced design techniques, supported by a practical, hands-on approach.\nThe course begins with an in-depth examination of the Zemax environment, ensuring participants develop a strong understanding of the interface and its core functions. You will learn to navigate the Zemax workspace, set up optical systems, configure system data, and import lens prescriptions. Essential topics such as system explorers and the implementation of optical surfaces are covered in detail, along with methods for extracting and utilizing commercial lens specifications. Foundational techniques like thickness solves, paraxial focus, lens layout, and input ray setup provide the groundwork for building precise optical systems.\nMoving beyond singlet lenses, the course introduces doublet lens design as a practical example. You will explore the concept of doublets, apply first-order equations to these systems, and import them into Zemax for analysis. Through this example, you will learn to evaluate the first-order properties of real lenses, including virtual image formation and key performance characteristics. This section provides an ideal bridge between theoretical optics and practical implementation.\nIn the Curvature Solves section, participants will develop the ability to control and optimize lens curvature using advanced tools. Topics include fixing and varying curvature values, effective focal length (EFFL), marginal ray angles, pick-up solves, and calculations for element power and F-number. Additionally, the course covers thickness solving, where you will study marginal ray height, edge thickness, positional constraints, and center of curvature considerations for precision lens systems.\nThe program further explores Material Solves, where you will learn how to model and substitute materials efficiently to achieve desired optical performance. In conjunction, the Clear Semi-Diameter section introduces automatic and maximum aperture settings to refine optical designs. Mastery of these tools will enable participants to solve complex lens challenges with confidence.\nAn essential part of the course focuses on the Lens Data Editor Toolbar, a powerful resource for fine-tuning optical elements. This section teaches how to automate lens updates, introduce tilt and decenter elements, add fold mirrors, reverse optical elements, and configure apertures. Participants will learn to implement double-pass configurations and other practical techniques critical to optical simulations.\nThe Surface Properties module delves into the visual and functional aspects of optical surfaces. Topics include surface coloring, opacity adjustments, row customization, and the creation of surface stops. Advanced surface tools such as “Ignore This Surface,” surface property drawing, aperture editing, and tilt/decenter configurations are also explored, ensuring participants gain full control over surface design.\nThe course culminates with Practical Examples, allowing participants to apply their knowledge through real-world lens systems. You will analyze and design both Triplet Lenses and Cook Triplets, following a step-by-step process of explanation and solution implementation in Zemax. These exercises solidify key concepts, reinforce problem-solving techniques, and prepare participants for independent design work. We also explore the design and analysis of the Maksutov Telescope, offering participants a deeper understanding of more complex optical systems and their integration in Zemax.\nBy the end of this course, participants will have gained mastery in setting up, designing, and analyzing optical systems within Zemax Sequential. This program is ideal for optical engineers, researchers, and professionals seeking to develop their expertise in Zemax and optical system design. Whether you are building singlet lenses, doublets, or complex optical assemblies, this course provides the tools and techniques needed to excel in optical engineering applications.",

Here in this course the instructor has experience and shows in steps how to make your own jewelry pieces. I would love to see a part 2 to this course or any other polymer clay techniques that Maha Atef has. I have already completed several pendants and have loads of bezels to work with. The quality and amount of material presented is top notch. Many thanks to the instructor!\"\nIn this course, you'll learn how to make floral jewelry using what is called the \"Applique Technique\" in polymer clay. You’ll learn how to make necklaces with realistic and stunning flowers and unique designs. You’ll also learn when and how to apply paints to polymer clay, and how to protect the delicate parts of your design against breakage.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll be able to apply what you’ve learned to make your own designs that could be either floral or not, as you would’ve gained the skill of making and shaping using polymer clay. So many other things will be easy for you.\nAnd don’t worry if you’ve never touched polymer clay before because this course will give you fundamental knowledge about polymer clay, how to condition it, how to bake it, and much more about its properties.  Moreover, I’ve taken into consideration that you wouldn’t have enough tools as a beginner, so I made some tutorials with the use of objects that would be accessible such as an empty pen.\nAnd of course, if you’ve worked with polymer clay before and you’d like to learn about the \"Applique Technique\" and to get some useful working tips and precautions, then this course is absolutely for you.\nThe course is structured to give you:\nBasic information about polymer clay.\nMaterials and tools.\nGeneral knowledge about polymer clay properties.\nConditioning polymer clay.\nBaking polymer clay.\nHow to glue polymer clay to metal bezel pendants.\n\n\nStep-by-step tutorials for five designs:\nRoses Necklace\nSunflowers Necklace\nCottage Window Necklace\nMultiple flowers Necklace\nBasket of flowers Necklace\nThe videos of the course were shot with high quality to show you the small details from different perspectives. And so you can play them on your pc, tablet, or mobile with a clear image.\nYou'll have this course forever plus any future updates or new designs from me.  This course is not like any other free online tutorials; as you’ll have my experience and all that I’ve learned from my mistakes, and that will save you much time and effort. Plus, you’ll have me answering all your inquiries.\nNow you can have a look at the content of the course and if you’ve any questions, just send to me.\nI hope you’ll enjoy it and I’m looking forward to seeing your creative work.",

It doesn't have to be this way. This course will take you from knowing nothing about databases to being able to decisively design relationships between tables. Now, if you're a beginner, you might be asking...\"What are database relationships and why do they matter?\" The answer is simple, every database is built off the fundamentals of database relationships.\n\nIf you want to really understand what a database is, how it works, and how to design your very first set of database tables, this course is for you.\nEvery lecture is taught in an easy to follow method using on-screen illustrations, drawings, and examples. This course will bring you to a level of understanding that will allow you to develop skills quickly and use them at home, in school, and even in the work setting. These are practical skills. The skills learned in this course are skills that can help you get a job in IT or Database design.\nDo you want even better news? These skills are easy. No more confusion, no more fright, no more being a step behind everybody else in database technology. Here is just some of the information you will learn in this course:\nThe basics of databases - what they are, how they work, and how they structure data.\nData management - How do we keep millions of pieces of information organized and up-to-date?\nData structure - How do we organize data so that our database is protected from anomalies?\nHow to structure the three types of relationships between tables - one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. Each with practical examples.\nI didn't create this course to sell you something that's going to waste your time. I created this course because I have a passion for databases and I love teaching in a fun way. This course is fun, easy to follow, and worth every penny.",
