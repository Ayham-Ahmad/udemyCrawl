I made a ton of mistakes when I started. Many financially costly... mistakes. And you know what? I'm glad I did. If it wasn't for those mistakes, I wouldn't have learned as much as I did, and I certainly wouldn't have been able to teach others how to build a massively profitable business. Business is an extremely humbling venture... to say the least.\n\n\nIf it wasn't for my mistakes, I wouldn't have figured out how to get a 26X return on ad spend, wouldn't have figured out how to build the strongest supplier relationships in the industry, wouldn't have figured out to build a lead generating machine, wouldn't have figured out how to write compelling copy and descriptions, and certainly wouldn't have figured out how to create a duplicatable structure that I now use in multiple other e-commerce businesses.\n\n\nIncluded in this course:\nWhy high ticket products work best\nHow to find high ticket products in HIGH demand with LOW competition\nHow to choose a domain name that boosts your SEO almost immediately\nWhich e-commerce platforms are the best\nHow to contact and obtain USA suppliers\nTalk tracks and scripts to lock down these suppliers and even negotiate better terms and better pricing\nHow to understand different types of buyers\nHow to design your pages so they convert at a high level\nHow to build a lead magnet that overflows with qualified buyers\nHow to write compelling copy that sells itself\nAdvertising and marketing strategies that are FREE and get you tons of traffic\nPaid advertising and marketing strategies using platforms like Google, YouTube and Facebook ads\nHow to improve your search engine optimization (SEO)\nSales training - understanding the sales cycle\nHow to overcome objections using my objection cycle formula I developed\nHow to follow up like a pro\nHow to scale your business to new levels\nAND MORE\nWhen I was building this course, I went back to refine each section, remove the fluff, and give you real straight-to-the point content that will put you on the fast track to massive profitability and success. I have clients that I work with 1on1 where I charge $5,000 per month to teach these strategies and this content in this course. With how much value that is packed into this program, this should be the ONLY course you'll EVER need to buy if you want to build the e-commerce business you always wanted.\n\n\nThis course was built in order so you can easily follow the steps, pause to take the action, and then proceed when you're ready to move on.\n\n\nMake 2023 your break out year!",

But the very next step is deciding how and where to sell your products. There are so many options: your own WordPress store, your own Shopify store, selling on Amazon, Etsy, eBay, or a number of other marketplaces.\nIt's also confusing what methods should be used. Some people say you should sell Ecommerce products by running ads. Even that can be confusing. Which ads? Google Ads, YouTube ads, Instagram ads, or Facebook ads? Even in Google ads, there are many different types of ads. There are the basic text-based Google ads and there are ads specific for Ecommerce. It can all be overwhelming.\nIn this course, I'll outline a good-practice Ecommerce strategy for you to follow, and explain pros and cons to you at every step so you can empower yourself to always make the right decisions for your unique Ecommerce business.\nInvest in your future.

That’s it, all other tools will be shown in the course step-by-step on how to sign up and use them.\nTo really succeed in this course you will need a growth mindset and a willingness to fail.

Whether you are wanting to eventually quite your job or if you are simply wanting to raise money for your local school or charitable organisation. I have looked at a lot of other courses assisting people with creating an online store, and found the most common complaint is that people don't understand what all the options are. So I made sure to mention each setting we cover to give you a full understanding of Woo Commerce. Which gives you the understanding and freedom to do more than just what I teach you.\nWhile there are optional paid upgrades for some of the software used in the course, everything we use is 100% free and can be successfully used to create a professional online store and start earning from it.\nThe course should take you between 3 and 5 days to get your first online store built. Thereafter it becomes very quick to launch.\nThe course is designed to be followed in chronological order. The early lectures start off with setting up a flash drive for testing (optional), and works right through to the end where we edit an installed theme to suit our purposes. If you honestly take this course and launch your site, I believe you should earn more than your money back within 30 days of starting the course.\nWhat are the requirements?\nWe will be using two pieces of software, both of which are free. For people not wanting to use a paid webhost, there is a third piece of software but that is also free. All software used is covered in the course.\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\nCreate a Profitable Online Store\nUnderstand the basics of managing stock in an online environment\nKnow how to use correct keywords and tags for proper search results\nLearn how to profit with nearly zero overhead\nWhat is the target audience?\nThis course is best suited for people who are wanting to work for themselves and have entrepreneurial desires and feels comfortable around computers (PC or Apple) and the internet.

It allows not only to win some money, but most importantly, not to lose the entire bankroll.\nBlackjack is aproximately equal and fair casino game. And at the same time, unlike other games of chance, here not everything is decided by fortune. An experienced player who understands the basic principles of the game and is qualified enough, has some advantage over the casino and expect stable winning.\nThe course consists of 2 parts.\nIn the first one, I will talk about the basic blackjack strategy that gives the player a 0.3% mathematical advantage over the casino. This is very small, and this is very average. But it's amazing nonsense in general, because no other casino games give the player any advantage at all.\nIn addition, I will talk about modifications of the blackjack rules: some of them give even more advantages to the player and some are mathematically unprofitable.\nIn the second part, I will present to your judgement my personal development - the \"Wings\" strategy, which I created myself. Its main goal is to prevent a complete loss. We will try to determine together the only case, when a player can lose totaly. And then we'll try to find a way to deal with this problem. We will use some backdoors in the blackjack rules to reduce our risks and defeat our main enemy.\nSubscribe, it will be interesting. And, I hope, helpful.",

There is no cost to start, Etsy is easy on budget;\n2. The platform is forgiving on newbie mistakes;\n3. It is not saturated (no matter what you have been told) and anyone has a chance.\nThere are three major cautions:\n1. Success takes time.  Etsy has a time line that takes time, even if you are on the right track.\n2. It is unlikely someone get insanely rich quickly.  However, it is possible to have a side income business.\n3. One benefits of starting to sell is you gain the business mindset.  Once you know how to build a shop business, you can build any business.\nSyllabus:\nIntroduction\nShould I do it?

Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon com. amazon fba private label, amazon fba wholesale, Amazon fba product research, amazon fba canada, free amazon fba, amazon private label, sourcing Alibaba, amazon fba mastery, dropshipping, amazon dropshipping\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail.

Not only does this take the packing and shipping burden off your shoulders, but it also means you can offer Prime shipping to those 200 million Amazon Prime members — who on average spend over 4 times as much as non-Prime shoppers.\nUsing FBA also means Amazon takes responsibility for any problems that arise during shipping, like late shipments, damaged items, or other issues. Your reputation as a seller doesn't take a hit.\nSo Wondering how to sell your product and list it on Amazon?\nIn this course, we explained what is product Listing on Amazon. We discussed why Product Listing on Amazon is so Important and how can you do to optimize it in all its details and explained the working logic of the system. We explained the Product Title, Bullet Points, Description, Search Terms, and Images part of the listing and we create them together on a sample product step by step.

Many people have changed their jobs through our course and consultancy support and are still successful sellers on Amazon.\nWhat is Amazon FBA?\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a service Amazon offers its third-party sellers. Using FBA amazon, sellers send their goods to one of Amazon’s fulfillment centers, and Amazon ships the items to the customer. Customers who buy FBA products usually get their items rather quickly. When an item sells, employees pick and pack the order and it leaves the warehouse shortly after the sale. Amazon’s shipping partners, including the USPS, work hard to ensure timely delivery. Even companies that don’t deliver on Sundays will ship FBA products seven days a week. It’s fairly simple to use FBA. Sellers must contact Amazon after they prepare their listings. They provide several details, including product information and the quantity they plan on sending. Amazon tells the seller where to send the shipment and they handle deal it from there.

Other than in a few specialty categories, Amazon’s referral fees range between 8% and 17% of the sale amount. People who sell on Shopify try to avoid these fees, but there’s a reason why people gladly pay Amazon’s referral fees. Amazon attracts buyers from around the world to its platform, while Shopify sellers have to do their own marketing to sell their products. Shopify sellers also aim to build a brand without being subject to Amazon’s regulations. For example, Amazon does not allow its sellers to contact buyers. Many people feel that engaging customers is the best way to grow a business. Each of the platforms has its advantages, but people who want to list items without having to market them should definitely sell on Amazon.\nShould I Sell on Amazon or Ebay?\neBay and Amazon have distinct platforms. Deciding which one to use depends on your goals and what you're looking to sell. Amazon, in general, has a much higher sales volume than eBay. Many sellers choose Amazon because they feel they could earn more money there. While this is true in a lot of cases, some items do perform better on eBay. Amazon is the more restrictive of the two, so there are some products that you can only sell on eBay. For example, Amazon doesn’t allow used clothing sales. For many products, you need preauthorization before you sell them on Amazon. eBay has fewer guidelines for creating listings. If you only plan on selling a few pieces of each item, you might want to stick with eBay. Either way, both Amazon and eBay are great options for most sellers.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because sellers who use Amazon com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\n\nDropshipping is an order fulfillment option that allows ecommerce businesses to outsource procuring, storing, and shipping products to a third party. This order fulfillment method appeals to entrepreneurs seeking low overhead and low capital investments, but it can come at a cost.\nEcommerce is competitive. Dropshipping may appeal to entrepreneurs looking to sell generic products, but it can limit opportunities to build a brand or differentiate products. Thus, businesses that use dropshipping may wind up competing on price, leading to low margins.\nIf you are considering dropshipping for your ecommerce business, there are several factors you should review—including some variations and alternatives that offer similar benefits.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse.

And Google Analytics is undoubtedly the most powerful and popular option out there.\nIn this course we will learn one and only one thing - that is - to correctly setup Google Analytics with Shopify.\nTo be honest, to integrate Google Analytics in Shopify, all you have to do is to paste the code provided by Google Analytics in your Shopify store admin.

      "description": "The Amazon Influencer Program is one of the most exciting opportunities in eCommerce right now, offering an easy way for you to earn commissions while leveraging the massive reach of Amazon's large customer base of millions and millions of people ALREADY looking for products and ALREADY shopping on amazon.\n\n\nAmazon’s platform is already trusted by millions who are actively searching for products to buy, making it the perfect place to showcase your product insights. Unlike starting a blog or YouTube channel from scratch, you’re tapping directly into Amazon’s organic traffic. With each review, you gain exposure to millions of potential buyers, leading to high conversion rates and substantial commissions.\n\n\n\n\nHow It Works\nAt its core, the Amazon Influencer Program is simple: you create and upload product review videos directly to Amazon’s product pages through your Influencer dashboard. When shoppers view your video and then decide to purchase the product, you earn a commission.\n\n\nWith millions of shoppers browsing Amazon daily, your videos can drive traffic and sales WITHOUT any extra effort on your part or any ads needed to make money. You can literally upload videos to amazon…and make money simply because amazon already has millions of people intending to buy specific products (that just might want a little more clarification on a product first…or even want to see someone else’s experience using that product).\n\n\nAnd the best part is you can start with products you already own. Whether it’s that high-quality kitchen gadget you love, or an expensive grill, or the fitness gear that’s helping you hit your goals, reviewing products you use daily and already have is COMPLETELY FREE and also allows you to start making money with this IMMEDIATELY (which is a game changer).\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s Inside This Course:\nEasy Start: Learn how to begin with products you already own. Review items around your house to start generating commissions right away, entirely free.\nEarn Passive Income: Once your videos are live, they keep working for you, earning commissions over time. With a growing library, you can build a long-term revenue stream.\nScale Effortlessly: As your influence grows, brands may send you products or even pay you upfront to review, making this opportunity scalable and potentially lucrative.\n\n\nAct Now to Gain Early Advantage\nThis program is gaining traction quickly, and there’s still time to carve out a substantial share of this opportunity. Early adopters will benefit from less competition and an open landscape of products. As the program expands, you’ll be ready to capitalize on the growing demand from brands and buyers alike.\n\n\nGet started today, and be among the first to tap into this exciting opportunity!",

      "description": "In this comprehensive course, you will learn everything you need to know to launch and grow a successful Shopify dropshipping business. The course starts with the basics of Shopify and dropshipping, including setting up your store, selecting products, and finding suppliers. You’ll also discover how to create an effective marketing strategy, optimize your website for search engines, and drive traffic to your store\nWhat is Dropshipping? Dropshipping is an eCommerce model that makes it easy to sell products online without the need for inventory or shipping tasks. With a traditional business model, if you want to sell products online, you first need to acquire the products—either by making them yourself or by buying them from a manufacturer or supplier—before offering them for sale. However, with a dropshipping model, you don’t need to buy or even see any of the products you offer in your online shop. Instead, when a customer buys a product from you, you contact the supplier, who then packs and ships the product directly to the customer. The big advantage of dropshipping is that it allows you to run an online store without having to keep an inventory, freeing you up to focus on marketing and advertising your products to potential customers\nBest Practices for Dropshipping:\nSelecting Suppliers: Popular dropshipping companies include Oberlo, AliExpress, DHgate, SaleHoo, and Spocket. Each company offers unique benefits, such as supplier reviews, order automation, low pricing, or seamless integration with e-commerce platforms. Consider your business priorities when choosing a dropshipping company.\nProduct Selection: There’s no limit to what you can sell through dropshipping. Tech accessories, toys, pet accessories, beauty and health products, and even drones are just a few popular items. Focus on products that solve everyday problems, are hard to find in stores, and are easy to advertise on social media.\nResearch Trends: Successful dropship sellers spend time researching online trends to identify new products people are talking about. Then, they focus on marketing and promoting these trending products to attract customers to their online stores\nRemember, dropshipping can be a powerful way to start an online business, but it’s essential to learn the nuances and best practices to succeed. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced entrepreneur, Udemy offers various dropshipping courses to help you master this eCommerce. Happy learning!",

I am currently a paralegal that is searching for the freedom to live a less hectic lifestyle. I have just purchased a product that I am excited to test out and look forward to sharing the results.\nStarting an Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) account is a great way to eliminate some of the annoying logistics associated with running your own home business. Rather than source, package, and ship products yourself, Amazon takes care of the hassle by storing and then fulfilling your orders for you.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon. com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because of sellers who use Amazon. com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon. com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon. com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse. Not only does this take the packing and shipping burden off your shoulders, but it also means you can offer Prime shipping to those 200 million Amazon Prime members — who on average spend over 4 times as much as non-Prime shoppers.\nUsing FBA also means Amazon takes responsibility for any problems that arise during shipping, like late shipments, damaged items, or other issues. Your reputation as a seller doesn't take a hit.\nOne of the most common questions asked by new Amazon sellers is, “Where can I buy products to sell on Amazon?\n“While there are a few different answers to this question, an experienced seller’s answer will most likely be, “On Alibaba.”\nAlibaba is a great place for sellers of all experience levels to source millions of different products that you can private label and brand. Many businesses rely on getting profitable product sourcing from Alibaba to Amazon FBA.\nIf you are unfamiliar with Alibaba and how it works, it can be overwhelming. In this course, we’re going to go over everything you need to know about Alibaba amazon, so you can successfully source quality products for your private label Amazon FBA course business.\nWhy do Amazon sellers use Alibaba?\nMany Amazon sellers use amazon Alibaba to source products because of the simplicity of its user-friendly site and well, the low prices. Most manufacturers that you come across on the platform will be based in China, where they can produce quality goods at a much more affordable price than, say, in the United States or Canada.\nAny seller can go to import from Alibaba right now and search for the type of product they’re interested in selling and come across thousands of potential suppliers. Finding a manufacturer for your product has never been easier.\n\nWhat is Amazon FBA?\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a service Amazon offers its third-party sellers. Using FBA amazon, sellers send their goods to one of Amazon’s fulfillment centers, and Amazon ships the items to the customer. Customers who buy FBA products usually get their items rather quickly. When an item sells, employees pick and pack the order and it leaves the warehouse shortly after the sale. Amazon’s shipping partners, including the USPS, work hard to ensure timely delivery. Even companies that don’t deliver on Sundays will ship FBA products seven days a week. It’s fairly simple to use FBA. Sellers must contact Amazon after they prepare their listings. They provide several details, including product information and the quantity they plan on sending. Amazon tells the seller where to send the shipment and they handle deal it from there. You can achieve, amazon fba private label, amazon fba wholesale, Amazon fba product research, amazon fba canada, free amazon fba, amazon private label.\nIn this course, You will success amazon ppc, amazon marketing, amazon advertising, amazon ads, ecommerce marketing, retail arbitrage, ecommerce, e commerce, php, amazon ppc, google shopping, ecommerce website, ecommerce marketing, amazon dropshipping, shopify development, amazon.\nIs Shopify better than Amazon?\nSelling on Shopify using Amazon’s FBA service requires a different mindset than selling on Amazon with FBA. Other than in a few specialty categories, Amazon’s referral fees range between 8% and 17% of the sale amount. People who sell on Shopify try to avoid these fees, but there’s a reason why people gladly pay Amazon’s referral fees. Amazon attracts buyers from around the world to its platform, while Shopify sellers have to do their own marketing to sell their products. Shopify sellers also aim to build a brand without being subject to Amazon’s regulations. For example, Amazon does not allow its sellers to contact buyers. Many people feel that engaging customers is the best way to grow a business. Each of the platforms has its advantages, but people who want to list items without having to market them should definitely sell on Amazon.\nShould I Sell on Amazon or Ebay?\neBay and Amazon have distinct platforms. Deciding which one to use depends on your goals and what you're looking to sell. Amazon, in general, has a much higher sales volume than eBay. Many sellers choose Amazon because they feel they could earn more money there. While this is true in a lot of cases, some items do perform better on eBay. Amazon is the more restrictive of the two, so there are some products that you can only sell on eBay. For example, Amazon doesn’t allow used clothing sales. For many products, you need preauthorization before you sell them on Amazon. eBay has fewer guidelines for creating listings. If you only plan on selling a few pieces of each item, you might want to stick with eBay. Either way, both Amazon and eBay are great options for most sellers.\nWhy You Should Be Selling on Amazon?\nMaybe you already have an online store of your own and you're looking to break into a larger market. Maybe you're already selling on a large marketplace but you want to expand your reach. Or, maybe you're just starting out, you have no website or item listings anywhere, and you have yet to make a single sale.\nThese are very different situations, but they have a lot in common, and that's the potential to grow by finding new channels for your products to sell.\nAmazon can be a lucrative marketplace for any online seller, whatever the current status of their business. In fact, if you're serious about eCommerce, you should definitely try to sell on Amazon com.\nAmazon is the cutting edge of online retail. So selling on Amazon is the best way to stay on top of the latest developments in online retail. It gives you a leg up because sellers who use Amazon com will not be surprised by new technology or other developments in the market.\nIf you’re interested in reaching a much larger customer base and increasing your sales volume, Amazon com can be an incredible resource.\nThe best way to see if Amazon com is for you is to simply try your hand at selling a few products on the platform.\n\nDropshipping is an order fulfillment option that allows eCommerce businesses to outsource procuring, storing, and shipping products to a third party. This order fulfillment method appeals to entrepreneurs seeking low overhead and low capital investments, but it can come at a cost.\nEcommerce is competitive. Dropshipping may appeal to entrepreneurs looking to sell generic products, but it can limit opportunities to build a brand or differentiate products. Thus, businesses that use drop shipping may wind up competing on price, leading to low margins.\nIf you are considering dropshipping for your e-commerce business, there are several factors you should review—including some variations and alternatives that offer similar benefits.\nFantastic Shipping with Fulfillment by Amazon\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a system in which you send your inventory to Amazon and they handle the picking, packing, and ship your products directly from their warehouse. Not only does this take the packing and shipping burden off your shoulders, but it also means you can offer Prime shipping to those 200 million Amazon Prime members — who on average spend over 4 times as much as non-Prime shoppers.\nUsing FBA also means Amazon takes responsibility for any problems that arise during shipping, like late shipments, damaged items, or other issues. Your reputation as a seller doesn't take a hit.\nSo Wondering how to sell on Amazon? Do you already have a brand and products, but do you want to learn how to start an Amazon FBA business? You found a very good product but don't know how to supply it?\nIn this lesson, I explained what the supplier criteria are, how to find suppliers according to these criteria, how to analyze suppliers, how to contact suppliers, and what points we should pay attention to when getting a request order quote. I showed you how to find your own freight forwarder on the site I use.

      "description": "If I taught you how to build a website, I wouldn't be doing you any favors. There are nearly 1 billion active websites on the internet as we speak.\nWhat are the chances that someone is going to visit your website? You have a better chance of winning the lottery.\nIf I taught you how to build a website, like everyone else does, then what could you do with it?\nProbably not as much as you had hoped because all of those other teachers out there didn't set you up for success.\nThey completely leaped over the building block skills that you should have before you even start to think about a website..\nand they stopped as soon as that website was built, leaving you with the hope that \"If you build it, they will come\". Then they didn't.\nI've been making money online now for 7 years and I recently decided I was going to start teaching others how to do it.\nSo like any venture you decide to get in to, you need to do your research and find out where you can break through.\nI was AMAZED, about how disappointed I was, with what I found.\nMost of the material on \"How to Make Money Online\" is so out of date it's hardly useful at all and because of that, there are many unfortunate people out there disappointed and probably blaming themselves for not being able to get to where they were built up to believe they could.\nHere's what I know, you don't want build a website. You want to build something you can be proud of, passionate about, and make money while you're doing it.\nBecause doing anything other than what makes you happy, isn't living, it's only surviving.\nYou only need three things to make that happen.\n1. Know your goal.\nI thought mine was playing games, that is how I started out, but as we learn, and as we grow, we change.\nWe evolve into someone so much better. I am not the same person, I am so much better.\nJim Rohn is an entrepreneur and he said\n\"Successful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do.\nDon't wish it were easier; wish you were better.\nDon't wish for less problems; wish for more skills.\nDon't wish for less challenge; wish for more wisdom.\"\n2. Knowledge Foundation - It's the more you know. When you're informed and you have all your faculties about you, you are unstoppable.\nNearly any obstacle that stands in your way, you will find a way around it, under it, over it, and always get through it.\nI have to say nearly because it's inevitable that there will be failures, some ideas just don't work out, but that doesn't have to end you.\n\"Success is not final; Failure in not fatal, it's the courage to continue, that counts\" ~ Winston Churchill\n3. Community - This isn't a one-sided conversation. When you join this course, you are joining a community of people that have the same goal.\nWe all want to be better and we're going to make it happen.\n\"Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world. For, indeed, that's all who ever have.\" ~ Margaret Mead\nYou're not going to walk away from this thinking it's another broken promise.",
