There is myth in the market, if you don't score 80% in your mock exam, your success rate decreases in the real exam. I always condemn this thought, as there is a great variance in the degree of Mocks available in the market from quality point of view.\nMy message to all Aspirants\n1) Read PMBOK guide ,Agile Practice guide, Scrum guide 2019 thoroughly.\n2) Take the print out of 5-10-49 (5 process groups, 10 Knowledge Areas, 49 processes) from PMBOK-6 and read it on daily basis.\n3) Download PMBOK outline document from PMI website and make a habit of reading on daily basis.\n4) Know the functionality of all 33 project documents and its reference in project life cycle.\n5) Smartly learn Tools and Techniques. There are 9 Data gathering tools, 27 Data analysis tool, and so on. Check its reference and usage in Project life cycle.\n6) Understand 4 values and 12 Principles of Agile carefully. Read roles and responsibilities of the Scrum Master, Development Team, Product Owner.\nRead and understand artifacts ( Product backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increments) , and events ( Sprint, Daily Scrum, Iteration/Sprint review, Sprint Retrospective, Backlog grooming).\n7) Practice my set of 540 questions, which has been broken down to 3 sets:\n1. PMP Practice Test 1 - Full Mock (180 Questions) - 2023 - Up to date as per current PMP exam content outline.\n2. PMP Practice Test 2 - Full Mock (180 Questions) - 2023 - Up to date as per current PMP exam content outline.\n3. PMP Practice Test 3 - Full Mock (180 Questions) - 2023 - Up to date as per current PMP exam content outline.\n8) Don't forget to review those questions which you have answered wrongly.\n9) Retake the test, if you score less than 75 percent. I would recommend to continue practicing until you get 90 percent.\nI have covered all important topics, if u do all my questions with proper understanding, your probability of passing the real exam with flying colors will be higher.\n10) Practice my 180 Questions mock sets at least twice to assess your speed and readiness.\n11) Remember the age old saying: - God helps those who helps themselves. This practice tests doesn't guarantee your success in the PMP exam, but it will certain increase your confidence level.\n\n\nGood Luck All!!!",

      "description": "The \"Audit Process Implementation\" course is designed to offer a comprehensive understanding of the critical steps involved in conducting an audit. Auditing is essential in many sectors, including finance, business, healthcare, and government, as it ensures the accuracy, legality, and reliability of financial statements, processes, and systems. This course aims to equip participants with the knowledge and practical skills needed to successfully implement the audit process from start to finish.\nHere’s a breakdown of what participants will learn:\n1. Audit Preparation and Planning\nThis is the foundational phase of the audit process, where everything begins. During this stage, participants will learn how to:\nIdentify Audit Objectives: Understand the purpose of the audit and the key goals to be achieved.\nDetermine Scope and Risks: Assess the boundaries of the audit and identify potential risks that may affect the audit's effectiveness.\nPlan the Audit Approach: Develop an audit plan that outlines the methodology and resources required. This involves understanding the organization’s operations, evaluating internal controls, and ensuring the audit is efficient and thorough.\nEffective planning is essential for a smooth and successful audit, ensuring the audit’s objectives are met with the right approach and resources.\n2. Audit Performance\nOnce the audit plan is in place, the next step is the actual execution of the audit. In this phase, participants will focus on:\nCollecting Evidence: Learn how to gather relevant data and documentation to support audit conclusions.\nPerforming Audit Procedures: This includes evaluating the processes and systems in place, identifying discrepancies, and verifying information accuracy.\nUsing Auditing Tools and Techniques: Auditors will become familiar with methods like sampling, which helps evaluate large datasets and identify trends or issues. These techniques ensure that audit results are both accurate and meaningful.\nThis phase is where the practical work of auditing takes place, and participants will gain hands-on experience with tools and procedures critical for effective audits.\n3. Audit Reporting\nAfter collecting and analyzing data, the next step is to communicate the findings. This stage focuses on:\nPreparing Clear and Concise Reports: Participants will learn how to draft reports that clearly communicate the audit’s results, including any identified issues, deficiencies, or areas that need improvement.\nHighlighting Key Findings: It is important to pinpoint critical concerns or weaknesses in systems, processes, or financial statements that require corrective actions.\nConveying Recommendations: An essential part of the report is providing actionable recommendations to address any identified issues, supporting the organization in making informed decisions and improving its operations.\nEffective reporting is crucial for ensuring that the audit’s findings are understood and acted upon.\n4. Audit Follow-Up and Closure\nAn audit doesn’t conclude with the reporting phase; it’s important to track progress and ensure that recommendations are acted upon. In this phase, participants will learn how to:\nVerify Corrective Actions: Ensure that the necessary changes or improvements have been made based on the audit findings.\nAssess Effectiveness: Evaluate whether the corrective actions implemented have resolved the issues identified in the audit.\nClose the Audit: Once the audit has been fully addressed, participants will learn how to formally close the audit engagement, signaling that the audit process has been completed and the issues have been resolved.\nThis phase ensures that the audit leads to real change and improvements within the organization, reinforcing the importance of follow-up and closure.\nIn Summary\nThe \"Audit Process Implementation\" course provides participants with a thorough understanding of the entire audit process. From planning and executing audits to reporting findings and following up on corrective actions, this course covers all essential aspects of auditing. Whether you’re pursuing a career in auditing, quality assurance, or simply looking to improve your organizational skills, this course will help you grasp the significance of auditing and how to implement it effectively across various industries.",

Communication barriers affect individuals, personal relationships, and certainly have impacts at organizational levels. We're often told that we need to improve communication but aren't always given practical examples or tips on how to accomplish that. That's the main problem I was trying to solve when I created this course!\nIn this course, you’ll learn about the communication loop and the importance of closing it. You’ll be introduced to the components of an effective message and will learn how to develop and plan well thought out communications. You’ll also be introduced to the components of active listening and will receive resources on how to improve your active listening skills. Quizzes and assignments will be peppered in throughout the course to support practical application of the lessons learned every step of the way.\nWith some of our teams working across different states or countries and many of us working from our homes, we see less facial expressions, less body language, and don’t always get to actually hear the tone of a message. Communication has always been a key component of project success, but it’s becoming even more relevant as our teammates become more physically distant.\nThere’s also an extra section at the end that covers meeting management! You’ll receive a quick start to finish guide of basic practices you can start using as soon as today to set your meetings up for success.\nLet the journey begin!\nCONTINUING EDUCATION NOTES:\nPMP(R) Certificate Holders: This course content is appropriate to be self-logged for 0.5 PDU in Power Skills under the Education category.

      "description": "Have you ever conducted or been invited to a 'workshop' in your career that lacked the true characteristics of an actual workshop?\nIn these so-called “fake workshops,” a long presentation is given, discussed endlessly, and ultimately, participants leave the room without any concrete results.\nFake workshops waste participants' time because they are not actively engaged in problem-solving as they would be in a genuine workshop. Participants' potential to achieve better results through collaboration goes untapped, leading to wasted resources, higher costs, and decreased motivation to tackle challenges.\nA real workshop, by contrast, is interactive and collaborative; participants actively work together, exchange ideas, and develop solutions collectively.\nThe “Thumbs Up for Your Workshop” course helps you avoid common mistakes when planning and running workshops.\nIt includes practical checklists to help you apply what you've learned effectively.\nBy the end of the course, you will have the skills to run a successful workshop. The course is process-oriented, straightforward, and easy to understand.\nThe course is designed for professionals who develop services and products in group settings and for managers aiming to improve organizational development and leadership skills.\nThis 60-minute course can be easily integrated into a busy work schedule.\nSignificant workshops are held in person because in-person interactions offer valuable personal exchanges. As a specialist or manager, you need to be able to lead an on-site workshop with all participants physically present. In this course, you will learn how to structure, plan, and conduct such a workshop. You'll understand your responsibilities as a facilitator and how to set measurable workshop objectives. You’ll learn to structure your workshop with a detailed agenda and visualize the results.\nYou'll also learn how to select the appropriate workshop method for specific challenges and how to fulfill your role as a facilitator.\nIn addition, you will gain insights into creating a creative atmosphere and managing uncomfortable situations.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll be equipped to lead a successful in-person workshop, with all participants present.\nThis knowledge forms a foundation for conducting hybrid or fully digital workshops.\nThe best prerequisites for this course are experience in leading meetings and change processes. While these are helpful, they are not required",

DSDM was found in 1994 by a group of IT Practitioners, to improve the traditional approach.\nDSDM is a method of incremental delivery of parts of the solution. It means, that in DSDM Project is divided on increments and so the solution is delivered partially, to deliver the expected level of quality.\nThe course is focused on deeper understanding of Agile and contains Practitioner level material. These knowledges will be enough to start a professional career in Project Management or successfully open your own business.\nAfter completing this course you will be prepared for the Practitioner level exam. If you want to pass the exam, please watch the course till the last video, as at the exam, there may be any question from each section. In addition, Practitioner level exam is not the cheapest and easiest one, so please dont rush with an final exam attempt and try to go through the official samples first.\nThis course is for people, who want to know how to build project or business succesfully.

      "description": "Are you tired of traditional CAPM study methods that drag on for months while you juggle work, family, and life? Stop wasting time with outdated preparation techniques that leave you overwhelmed and unprepared. The project management field is evolving rapidly, and your certification journey should match the pace of modern career advancement.\nThis course contains the use of artificial intelligence.\nTransform From Beginner to Certified PM Professional - FAST!\nMaster the complete CAPM knowledge framework through proven accelerated learning techniques\nBuild unshakeable exam confidence with AI-powered simulation practice\nEliminate test anxiety using cognitive-behavioral strategies from performance psychology\nNavigate the complex PMI ecosystem and avoid expensive training pitfalls\nFuture-proof your career by understanding AI's impact on project management roles\nDevelop marketable \"power skills\" that employers actually value in 2025\nCreate a strategic roadmap from CAPM to PMP certification and beyond\nMaster Your Certification Journey With Complete Confidence and Scientific Precision\nThe skills-based hiring revolution has fundamentally changed how employers evaluate candidates. According to Deloitte's 2023 Human Capital Trends report, 93% of organizations are shifting toward skills-based talent strategies. In this competitive landscape, professional certifications aren't just nice-to-have credentials—they're verifiable proof of your capabilities that can increase your earning potential by up to 25% within the first year.\nBut here's the challenge: the CAPM preparation market is flooded with confusing options, inflated promises, and questionable \"pass guarantees.\" Many professionals waste thousands of dollars and months of time on ineffective programs that focus on memorization rather than mastery. The pressure to pass on your first attempt has never been higher, with exam fees increasing and employers expecting immediate competency.\nYou'll master the complete PMI framework through our 6-module intensive system that balances speed with depth. Unlike generic bootcamps that rely on cramming, this program applies cognitive load theory and spaced repetition techniques to ensure information moves from short-term memory to long-term retention. You'll practice with advanced AI simulators that adapt to your learning patterns, identifying knowledge gaps before they become exam obstacles.\nThe program also addresses what traditional courses ignore: test anxiety and performance psychology. Using proven cognitive-behavioral techniques, you'll develop the mental resilience needed to perform under pressure. You'll also gain insider knowledge about PMI Authorized Training Partners (ATPs), pricing strategies, and how to calculate your true return on investment.\nThis course is designed for:\nAspiring project managers ready to transition into PM roles with credible certification Recent graduates seeking competitive advantage in today's skills-based job market\nCareer changers who need efficient, results-focused preparation without academic fluff Working professionals who require flexible, accelerated learning that fits their schedule\n\"But I don't have project management experience\" - Perfect! The CAPM is specifically designed for entry-level candidates. Our program builds foundational knowledge systematically, starting with core concepts and progressing to advanced applications.\n\"I'm worried about the time commitment\" - The sprint method is designed for busy professionals. You'll invest 10-12 hours per week using scientifically-proven learning techniques that maximize retention while minimizing study time.\n\"What if I fail the exam?\" - Our approach focuses on deep understanding, not just passing. Students who master our system report feeling genuinely prepared and confident, not just \"test-ready.\" We provide lifetime access to updates and additional practice materials.\n\"The training market seems overwhelming and expensive\" - We cut through the noise by explaining exactly what you need, what you don't, and how to avoid expensive traps. You'll understand the real differences between ATP and non-ATP providers, making informed decisions based on facts, not marketing.\n\"AI is changing everything - will this certification still be valuable?\" - This program specifically addresses AI's impact on project management. You'll understand which tasks are being automated and where human skills become more valuable, positioning you ahead of the curve.\nThe Science Behind Accelerated Learning Success\nRecent neuroscience research reveals that intensive, focused learning periods can be more effective than extended, diluted study schedules. Our program leverages three key cognitive principles: chunking for information processing, interleaving for pattern recognition, and retrieval practice for memory consolidation. This isn't just theory—these techniques have been validated in multiple studies and consistently produce better learning outcomes than traditional methods.\nComplete Course Structure:\nModule 1: Foundation & Strategy Master PMI terminology, understand the complete exam blueprint, and create your personalized study plan. You'll learn the critical difference between PMI Authorized Training Partners and independent providers, helping you make informed decisions about additional resources. This module includes comprehensive worksheets for tracking your progress and identifying your strongest knowledge areas.\nModule 2: Core Knowledge Areas Deep dive into all ten knowledge areas: integration, scope, schedule, cost, quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management. Each area is taught using real-world scenarios and case studies, ensuring you understand both the theoretical framework and practical applications. You'll complete interactive exercises and mini-assessments to reinforce learning before moving to the next topic.\nModule 3: Advanced Simulation & Practice Intensive practice with AI-powered exam simulators that mirror the actual CAPM testing environment. These adaptive tools analyze your performance patterns, automatically adjusting question difficulty and focusing on your weakest areas. You'll complete full-length practice exams with detailed explanations for every answer, building both knowledge and test-taking stamina.\nModule 4: Psychology & Performance Master test anxiety management using evidence-based techniques from sports psychology and cognitive behavioral therapy. Learn specific breathing exercises, visualization methods, and cognitive reframing strategies that elite performers use to excel under pressure. This module also covers optimal study scheduling, sleep hygiene for memory consolidation, and nutrition strategies for peak mental performance.\nModule 5: Final Preparation & Career Transition Consolidation techniques that ensure long-term retention, detailed exam day protocols, and a comprehensive career advancement strategy. You'll learn how to effectively showcase your CAPM certification on your resume, LinkedIn profile, and during job interviews. We also provide templates for salary negotiation and promotion discussions, maximizing the financial return on your certification investment.\nModule 6: Future-Proofing Your PM Career Understand how artificial intelligence and automation are reshaping project management roles. Learn which skills remain uniquely human and how to develop these \"power skills\" that will keep you relevant in the evolving job market. This module includes exclusive insights from industry leaders about upcoming trends and opportunities in project management.\nComprehensive Exclusive Package:\nExpert Q&A Sessions: Live recordings where certified PMP instructors deconstruct the 10 most challenging CAPM question types, revealing the logic behind correct answers and common traps to avoid\nSelf-Study Toolkit: For highly disciplined learners who want to supplement formal training with independent study methods\nCareer Transition Kit: Professional templates, LinkedIn optimization guide, and interview preparation materials specifically designed for new project managers\nLifetime Updates: Access to course revisions, new practice questions, and updated industry insights as the CAPM evolves\nPrivate Student Community: Connect with fellow students, share resources, and maintain accountability throughout your certification journey\nWhy This Program Delivers Results\nTraditional CAPM preparation focuses on content delivery without considering how adults actually learn and retain information. Our approach is fundamentally different. Research from the Journal of Applied Psychology shows that students using spaced repetition and interleaved practice retain 67% more information compared to traditional blocked learning methods.\nWe also address the psychological barriers that cause many candidates to fail despite knowing the material. Test anxiety affects up to 40% of certification candidates, leading to poor performance even when knowledge levels are adequate. Our integrated approach to performance psychology ensures you can demonstrate your knowledge effectively during the actual exam.\nInvestment Protection & Risk Mitigation\nUnlike programs that make unrealistic guarantees, we focus on genuine preparation and skill development. You'll receive lifetime access to all materials, ensuring your investment continues providing value throughout your career. Our comprehensive approach means you're not just preparing for an exam—you're building foundational knowledge that will serve you as a project management professional.\nThe Time Is Now\nThe project management field is experiencing unprecedented growth, with the Project Management Institute predicting 2.3 million new PM roles annually through 2030. Early-career professionals with CAPM certification are positioned to capture these opportunities, but only if they act decisively.\nReady to Transform Your Career? Your Transformation Starts Today\nStop settling for generic study guides and expensive bootcamps that treat you like just another number.

Agile Leadership and Soft Skills\nUnderstand coaching, team dynamics, and leadership within Agile contexts.\n6. Advanced Agile Concepts\nLearn about scaling Agile, DevOps, business analysis, and Agile transformations.\n\n\nRegularly Updated Questions to Keep You Ahead\nIn the ever-evolving world of Agile methodologies, staying current is crucial. That's why we regularly update our practice test questions, ensuring they reflect the latest trends, practices, and Agile principles. This commitment to up-to-date content means you're always preparing with relevant and contemporary material, giving you an edge in your Agile journey and interviews.\nSample Practice Test Questions\nThese examples illustrate the depth and practicality of our tests, designed to enhance your understanding and readiness for Agile interviews.\nWhat is the primary purpose of a Burndown Chart in Agile?\nA) To track team morale\nB) To display the remaining work in a Sprint\nC) To show the number of completed user stories\nD) To calculate the budget of the project\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) To display the remaining work in a Sprint. A Burndown Chart is an essential Agile artifact used to visualize the work left versus time. It helps teams understand if they are on track to complete the work by the end of the Sprint. While other options like tracking team morale or showing completed user stories are important, they are not the primary function of a Burndown Chart.\nWhich statement best defines a User Story in Agile?\nA) A detailed specification of software features\nB) A short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the end user\nC) A technical requirement for system developers\nD) A long, detailed description of the application’s functionality\nExplanation: B) A short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the end user is the correct answer. User stories in Agile are intended to be concise and focused on the user's needs. They are written in a non-technical language and often follow a simple template: \"As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/value].\" This approach differs from detailed specifications or technical requirements, focusing more on the 'what' and 'why' than the 'how.'\nIn Scrum, who is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and managing the Product Backlog?\nA) Scrum Master\nB) Product Owner\nC) Development Team\nD) Project Manager\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) Product Owner. In Scrum, the Product Owner has a pivotal role in ensuring that the product backlog is well-maintained, prioritized, and transparent. They are responsible for articulating the product goals, ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions, and ensuring the value of the work the Development Team performs. The Scrum Master and Development Team have different roles, focusing on facilitating Scrum processes and executing the work, respectively.\nWhich of the following is NOT a core value of the Agile Manifesto?\nA) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\nB) Responding to change over following a plan\nC) Comprehensive documentation over working software\nD) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\nExplanation: The answer is C) Comprehensive documentation over working software. This statement is actually the reverse of one of the core values of the Agile Manifesto, which states, \"Working software over comprehensive documentation.\" The Agile Manifesto values working software more highly than extensive documentation, reflecting Agile's emphasis on tangible deliverables and adaptive planning. The other options are correctly stated values of the Agile Manifesto.\nWhat is the main benefit of the Daily Stand-up meeting in Agile?\nA) To discuss solutions to technical challenges\nB) To provide a status update to stakeholders\nC) To facilitate team bonding\nD) To synchronize the team's work and plan for the next 24 hours\nExplanation: D) To synchronize the team's work and plan for the next 24 hours is the correct answer. The Daily Stand-up, or Daily Scrum, is a short meeting for the development team to synchronize their work and plan for the next 24 hours. This meeting helps identify blockers and dependencies among team members but is not meant for problem-solving, detailed discussions, or status updates for stakeholders. The primary focus is on progress towards the Sprint goal and immediate next steps.\nEnroll Now to Transform Your Agile Knowledge and Interview Skills\nTake the first step towards Agile mastery.

      "description": "Scrum is a popular framework for managing complex tasks during the product development process. The framework is often used in an environment of rapid change and uncertainty, where it is no longer feasible to plan out a product in detail from the beginning. Instead, the Scrum framework emphasizes the importance of working with time boxes and being able to adapt quickly to changes in order to make the product successful.\nOne of the key benefits of using Scrum is the ability to receive feedback at the end of each time box. This allows for small improvements to be made to the product with each iteration. During each sprint, the team works on all the necessary steps required to develop a small part of the product, such as collecting requirements, designing and prototyping, developing, testing, and documenting.\nThe ultimate goal of each sprint is to create a working, tested, and potentially releasable product. The team then demonstrates the progress to the client and discusses what to do next. This approach allows clients to better understand their real needs by seeing the product and providing feedback to the team.\nA Scrum team typically consists of a Scrum Master, product owner, and developers. The product owner is responsible for creating a list of attributes, known as the product backlog, and editing it to maximize value. The developers work to turn the items in the list into a presentable product. The Scrum Master focuses the team on the sprint goal and helps remove any obstacles that may arise during the development process.\nOne of the key events of each sprint is the retrospective meeting, where the team looks for areas of improvement and plans for the next sprint. By continuously improving the process, the team is able to create a more effective and efficient workflow, resulting in a higher quality product in the end.",

      "description": "The PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) highlights your ability to identify and assess project risks, mitigate threats and capitalize on opportunities. In this capacity, you enhance and protect the needs of your organization.\nGaining distinction as a PMI-RMP® sets you apart from other professionals and brings credit to your organization. Eighty-three percent of organizations that are high performers in project management practice risk management frequently while just 49 percent of low performers do so. The practice contributes to a handsome payoff: high performers meet their goals 2.5 times more often and waste 13 times less money than low performers, as found by our 2015 Pulse of the Profession® report.\nIf you’re ready for greater recognition, the PMI-RMP will validate your specialized expertise and help you stand out to employers, stakeholders and peers.\nPMI-RMP Certification Benefits\nTo improve my project success rate. What’s the project success rate for your organization? Thirty percent? Fifty percent? Project risk management gives you the ability to identify and assess risks, mitigate threats, and capitalize on opportunities. Hence, improve your success.\nTo help my organization with risk management, top to bottom. I served as the Director of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) for a large insurance company. Our ERM policy and processes were largely developed based on what I had learned about risk management as a PMP and PMI-RMP. Risk management always involves identifying, evaluating, responding to risks, and monitoring risks. Furthermore, these processes may be applied at different levels of an organization—enterprise, departments or business units, portfolios, programs, and projects.\nTo increase my career opportunities. If you’ve been in the project management job market lately, you have seen a high percentage of employers looking for certified project managers. Having an additional certification provides project managers with a wider range of opportunities—it’s like having a double major. Most noteworthy, employee compensation surveys report that certified project managers enjoy higher salaries compared to uncertified project managers.\nTo sharpen my saw. Life gets stale when we’re not learning new things. I like to sharpen my saw physically, socially, mentally, and spiritually. Likewise, pursuing the PMI-RMP was a challenging and rewarding journey that helped me grow professionally.\nTo boost my knowledge and expertise. Any time we invest in ourselves by focusing on our profession is time well spent. Consequently, we’re going to get better at what we do. Studying and applying risk management principles has helped me learn practical tips, tools, and techniques.",

Projects rarely fail because of technical challenges alone - they fail because risks were not properly identified, assessed, and managed.

We will cover the difference between risks and their sources, explore risk appetite, tolerance, and thresholds, and practice using common response strategies for both threats and opportunities.\nOn the practical side, you will gain access to my ready-made Risk Register template, which you can adapt to your own projects. Together, we will walk through real-world examples to see how to log risks, calculate a risk index, prioritize effectively, and design clear response actions.\nBy the end of this course, you will not only understand the theory, but also have the confidence and resources to analyze, assess, and manage risks effectively - ensuring your projects are better prepared to succeed.",

The complete course will cover all the topics needed to prepare for the highly recognised Project Management Professional (PMP)® certification from the Project Management Institute (PMI)®.\nTo earn most of the recognised Project Management certifications, such as Project Management Professional (PMP®) from the Project Management Institute (PMI®), PRINCE2 Practitioner from AXELOS, or Certified Project Manager (CPM) from the International Association of Project Managers (IAPM), you have to pass a rigorous exam. The exam questions are based on sophisticated professional texts full of Project Management terminology and complex business lexicon. To get to the gist of a question and answer it correctly, you have to build a solid, specialised vocabulary and develop advanced reading skills. This course’s aim is to help you do exactly that.\nThe course is designed in a way that helps you remember difficult project management-related vocabulary and specific project management terms. It is done not by directly giving you the definitions but by offering a series of specially designed exercises to help you to guess the meanings of the new words and project management terms yourself. This approach makes the definitions stick in your memory.\nThe course is based on professional project management texts adapted from such sources as Project Management Body of Knowledge, Process Groups: A Practice Guide, Governance of Portfolios, Programmes, and Projects: A Practice Guide published by Project Management Institute (PMI), the provider of the highly regarded Project Management Professional (PMP®) certification, and others.\nEach unit contains an introductory case, which describes the project situation, illustrating the importance of some project management concepts. It is followed by a series of articles on specific project management tools and techniques related to the concept. After reading an article and completing related exercises, you will have the opportunity to apply each tool to a like-real project situation by solving a short case study. You will be able to check your solutions by comparing them to the example solutions accompanied by detailed explanations. At the end of each unit, there is a test on the new vocabulary, terms, and project management concepts learnt in the unit.\nGood luck with your studies!",

With our comprehensive practice tests and in-depth explanations, you'll be well-prepared to tackle the exam with confidence.\n\nQuestion:1\nYou are the Agile coach for a team transitioning to Agile. The team is working on a project to develop a new software product. The product owner has a long list of features requested by stakeholders. As part of Agile planning, you suggest the team focus on creating small, releasable increments by organizing the requirements into Minimally Marketable Features (MMFs) and Minimally Viable Products (MVPs). However, the product owner is concerned about stakeholder pressure to deliver all features quickly. What would be the best approach to ensure early value delivery while managing stakeholder expectations?\nA. Break down the entire feature list into smaller tasks and ensure that every sprint delivers some portion of each feature so that stakeholders see progress on all features at once.\nB. Prioritize features based on stakeholder demands, delivering high-priority items first, and then focus on delivering the remaining features in subsequent sprints.\nC. Work with the product owner to prioritize features based on business value and create MMFs and MVPs. Communicate to stakeholders the importance of focusing on delivering small, valuable increments to get early feedback.\nD. Focus solely on completing the features in the backlog without worrying about early releases, as this will ensure that the final product includes everything stakeholders requested.\nAnswer:\nC. Work with the product owner to prioritize features based on business value and create MMFs and MVPs. Communicate to stakeholders the importance of focusing on delivering small, valuable increments to get early feedback.\nExplanation:\nThe best approach in Agile is to deliver value early and often by focusing on Minimally Marketable Features (MMFs) and Minimally Viable Products (MVPs). This approach ensures that the team delivers small, releasable increments of the product that provide real value to the customer.\nOption A may result in spreading the team's focus too thin, leading to incomplete features that don’t provide any usable product increments. Option B prioritizes features but does not address the need for delivering small, valuable increments that provide early feedback. Option D ignores Agile principles by focusing on completing all features without considering early delivery and value feedback.\nOption C aligns with Agile principles by encouraging the delivery of MMFs and MVPs, which help ensure early value recognition and allow the team to gather feedback from stakeholders to guide future development.\n\n\nQuestion:2\nYour Agile team is working on a high-risk project for a financial services client, developing a new online payment system. The product owner has populated the backlog with a mix of feature requests from stakeholders and identified risks associated with security, compliance, and system performance. The team is struggling to balance development work on deliverable features with necessary risk reduction efforts. The product owner is focused on delivering customer-facing features to meet tight deadlines, but you are concerned about the long-term risks. What is the best approach to balance value delivery and risk reduction?\nA. Focus solely on delivering customer-facing features to meet the tight deadlines, and address risk reduction in a separate phase after the MVP has been delivered.\nB. Prioritize risk reduction work first to ensure that all risks are mitigated before delivering any features to stakeholders.\nC. Incorporate both value-producing features and risk-reducing tasks into the backlog, and balance them during sprint planning to maximize long-term value delivery.\nD. Ignore the identified risks in the backlog for now and focus exclusively on delivering the high-priority features requested by stakeholders.\nAnswer:\nC. Incorporate both value-producing features and risk-reducing tasks into the backlog, and balance them during sprint planning to maximize long-term value delivery.\nExplanation:\nIn Agile, it’s essential to balance value delivery and risk reduction to maximize the total value proposition over time. Focusing exclusively on customer-facing features (Option A) can lead to significant risks being overlooked, potentially jeopardizing the project's success. Prioritizing risk reduction over everything else (Option B) might slow down value delivery and delay stakeholder feedback, which is critical in Agile. Ignoring risks (Option D) is a short-term approach that may lead to severe issues later on.\nThe best approach is C, where both value-producing features and risk-reducing tasks are incorporated into the backlog and balanced during sprint planning. This ensures that the team addresses risks proactively while continuing to deliver features that provide value to the customer, thus maximizing the overall value proposition of the project.\n\n\nDon't Miss Your Chance to Achieve PMI-ACP Certification Success!\nEnroll now in our PMI-ACP Exam: Practice Tests (2024) course on Udemy and take the first step towards passing the PMI-ACP certification exam.

      "description": "Project Management is a critical discipline that ensures projects are executed efficiently, meet specific goals, and create value for stakeholders. The Project Management Professional (PMP®) certification, recognized in over 200 countries, is a prestigious credential that validates a project manager’s skills, knowledge, and credibility. This course is designed to introduce you to the core concepts of project management and provide insight into the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK®), a globally recognized standard for managing projects.\nWhat You Will Learn in This Course\nUnderstanding Project Management\nProject management involves using specialized knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to deliver projects successfully. The goal is to create something of value, whether it’s software, infrastructure, services, or business processes. Projects can vary significantly, from developing new products to managing large-scale construction projects or even responding to urgent needs like disaster relief.\nThe core idea behind project management is that projects are temporary, with a distinct start and end date. They aim to produce unique outcomes that deliver value to stakeholders, such as a new product or a process improvement. Understanding the project management lifecycle and how to navigate it is key to becoming an effective project manager.\nDefining a Project\nA project is typically a temporary endeavor aimed at producing a unique product, service, or result. Unlike routine operations, projects are finite and have specific goals and timelines. The key characteristics of a project include:\nTemporary nature: A project has a defined start and end date.\nUnique deliverables: Each project creates something distinctive, such as a software solution, a new building, or a new business process.\nPhases of development: Projects are divided into different phases such as initiation, planning, execution, and closure, ensuring that each step aligns with the project goals.\nThe Project Management Lifecycle\nThe project management lifecycle is a critical concept that outlines the phases a project goes through, from the initial idea to its successful completion. The lifecycle helps in ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to meet the project's objectives while managing risks and resources efficiently. The key stages of the project lifecycle are:\nInitiation: This phase involves defining the project, its objectives, scope, stakeholders, and obtaining approvals to move forward.\nPlanning: In this phase, project goals and deliverables are broken down into manageable tasks, timelines, resources, and budgets are allocated, and risks are assessed.\nExecution: This is where the project team works on the actual tasks outlined in the planning phase to achieve the project goals.\nMonitoring & Controlling: Project performance is tracked to ensure that it stays on course. Any deviations from the plan are addressed here.\nClosure: After achieving the project objectives, the project is formally closed, and outcomes are delivered to stakeholders.\nProject Phases and Project Scope\nOne of the critical elements in project management is understanding project scope. This refers to the detailed description of the work required for the project. A well-defined scope ensures that all stakeholders agree on what will be delivered and helps prevent scope creep (when the scope expands without proper control).\nAdditionally, each project phase (initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure) has specific tasks and deliverables that contribute to the overall success of the project. In this course, you will learn about the input and output for each phase, ensuring that every activity is aligned with the project goals.\nPMBOK® and Project Management Tools\nThis course introduces you to PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge), a comprehensive guide to project management best practices. PMBOK provides standardized processes, tools, and techniques for managing projects effectively. You will learn about:\nProject Management Plans: Essential for structuring the project, including how to develop a clear plan, outline the scope, schedule, and resources.\nProject Management Tools: Various tools are used throughout the project lifecycle, such as Gantt charts, project management software, and risk management frameworks, which help streamline planning, execution, and monitoring.\nBenefits of PMP® Certification\nThe Project Management Professional (PMP®) certification is one of the most respected certifications in the field of project management. It is globally recognized and provides several benefits:\nProfessional Credibility: PMP® certification demonstrates your ability to manage projects effectively, boosting your professional reputation.\nDeep Knowledge: As a PMP®, you will possess a strong understanding of project management principles, techniques, and industry standards.\nIncreased Earning Potential: PMP® certified professionals often earn higher salaries due to their specialized skills and expertise.\nGlobal Recognition: With PMP® certification, you become part of a global community of project managers, which can open doors to new opportunities worldwide.\nCourse Benefits\nComprehensive Introduction: This course will introduce you to the key concepts of project management, including the different phases of a project, project lifecycle, and tools to help you manage projects effectively.\nStructured Learning: You will gain an in-depth understanding of the PMBOK® guidelines, project management processes, and the relationship between scope, time, cost, and quality in delivering projects.\nPractical Application: The course is designed with practical examples to help you apply project management principles in real-world scenarios.\nPreparation for PMP® Exam: Although this course is an introductory guide, it will lay the groundwork for further study and preparation for the PMP® certification exam.\nConclusion\nBy the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of project management principles, the project management lifecycle, and the key tools and techniques used to manage projects successfully. Whether you're interested in earning the PMP® certification or looking to improve your project management skills for your organization, this course will provide you with valuable knowledge and insights to get started.\nThe PMP® certification is a career-advancing credential that not only enhances your professional credibility but also helps improve the success rate of projects you are involved with. With this course, you will be one step closer to mastering the art and science of project management.\nStart your journey towards becoming a certified PMP® and enhance your career prospects today!\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nYelna Yuristiary",

Nothing is worse than wasting months studying for an exam you can’t take or passing an exam that won’t help you get a certification! Our easy search tools are designed to help you find relevant information as well and search for a variety of different exams.\nWhat Is The PMP Focused On?\nThe PMP or as it’s also known, the Project Management Professional, like all tests, there is a bit of freedom on PMI's part to exam an array of subjects. That means knowing the majority of PMP content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they’ve observed the average person and what is required. You can always push past that to succeed with the PMP but it may take some extra work.",

Want to see how tough our questions are? Check out our sample questions now!\n\n\nQuestion 1:\nA project manager is overseeing a large infrastructure project in a region prone to natural disasters. Despite the initial risk assessment, a significant earthquake occurs, causing delays and unexpected costs. The project manager now needs to reassess the risk management plan. Which of the following actions should the project manager prioritize to effectively update the risk management approach?\nA) Conduct a new qualitative risk analysis to reassess the probability and impact of risks.\nB) Increase the contingency reserves to cover the additional costs associated with potential future disasters.\nC) Implement a workaround to immediately address the delays and focus on completing the project as planned.\nD) Engage with stakeholders to revise the project’s risk thresholds and redefine the risk appetite in light of recent events.\nAnswer: D) Engage with stakeholders to revise the project’s risk thresholds and redefine the risk appetite in light of recent events.\nExplanation:\nIn the wake of a significant event like an earthquake that was not fully accounted for in the initial risk assessment, the project manager must prioritize reevaluating the overall risk management approach. Engaging with stakeholders to revise the project’s risk thresholds and redefine the risk appetite (Option D) is crucial because it aligns the project’s risk management strategy with the changed reality and ensures that all stakeholders are on the same page regarding acceptable levels of risk. While conducting a new qualitative risk analysis (Option A) and increasing contingency reserves (Option B) are important, these actions should follow the redefinition of the project's risk appetite. Implementing a workaround (Option C) is a reactive approach that addresses immediate concerns but doesn’t address the underlying need to update the risk management strategy in a holistic way.\nQuestion 2:\nDuring the execution phase of a high-profile IT project, the project team identifies a new risk related to the security of sensitive customer data. This risk was not anticipated during the initial planning phase, and if realized, it could lead to severe reputational damage and legal consequences. What is the most appropriate course of action for the project manager to take in this scenario to manage the newly identified risk?\nA) Immediately halt the project and initiate a full security audit to identify all potential vulnerabilities.\nB) Update the risk register, assign a risk owner, and implement additional security measures to mitigate the risk.\nC) Escalate the issue to the project sponsor and request additional budget to address the security concerns.\nD) Reassess the project scope to eliminate any processes involving sensitive customer data to avoid the risk entirely.\nAnswer: B) Update the risk register, assign a risk owner, and implement additional security measures to mitigate the risk.\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the most appropriate action is to update the risk register with the newly identified risk, assign a risk owner, and implement additional security measures to mitigate the risk (Option B). This approach ensures that the risk is formally recognized, managed, and monitored throughout the project lifecycle. Halting the project for a full security audit (Option A) may be excessive and could cause unnecessary delays. Escalating the issue to the project sponsor and requesting additional budget (Option C) may be necessary if the mitigation efforts require significant resources, but it is not the first step. Reassessing the project scope to eliminate processes involving sensitive customer data (Option D) might not be feasible or practical, as it could compromise the project’s objectives. The best approach is a balanced response that integrates risk management into the ongoing project activities.\n\n\nDon’t Wait If You’re Serious About Success!\nIf you want to be fully confident on exam day, register immediately for our PMI-RMP® Exam Practice Tests course on Udemy.

      "description": "How to make the best use of this simulator  ANALYSIS is the KEY:\nWith the new PMP Exam Syllabus you may need to study quite a few new topics such as Servant Leadership Personality Indicators Minimum Viable Product MVP Agile/Hybrid/Predictive Measurement of Training Outcomes Project Compliance etc. Use the books recommended by PMI to build your capability on these topics Google the new terms as well for quick learning.\n\n\nThe passing score for this simulator is 60%. But you need to know that you should not get demotivated if you score less! DO NOT take the score of this simulator as a representation of your actual PMP exam. Instead, take it as an opportunity to understand your knowledge gap and work on your weak areas. I would suggest that after this 180 mins simulation, you should spend at least 10 hours analyzing each and every question. If you have got a question wrong check the following things:\nIn which domain I am making the most mistakes?\nDid I answer a question incorrectly because I did not know the concept or the application of the concept?\nAre there any repeat mistakes I am making?\nIf a question took 5 mins to solve was there a way to solve it faster?\nAm I making any careless mistakes?\nIs there a common trend of incorrect answers Eg Am I getting more situational-type questions wrong?\nMake notes for your reference as you keep on analyzing the questions?\nIf you prepare like this you will be ahead of your peer group for the new format of the PMP exam prep in no time?\nAll the best for your PMP exam in 2024 and I hope you find this simulation useful.\n\n\nWhat is PMP Certification?\nThe PMP acknowledges candidates skilled at managing the people, processes, and business priorities of professional projects. PMI, the world’s leading authority on project management, created the PMP to recognize project managers who have proven they have project leadership experience and expertise in any way of working.\n\n\nTo obtain PMP certification, a project manager must meet certain requirements and then pass a 180-question exam. The PMP exam was created by project leaders for project leaders, so each test question can be related to real-life project management experiences.\n\n\nPMP certification validates that you are highly skilled in:\n\n\nMotivating people and teams through all phases of a successful project.\nUsing predictive, agile and hybrid approaches to determine which way of working is best for each project.\nHighlighting the success of a project and its impact on overall strategic organizational goals.\n\n\nWhy Earn the PMP now?\nThe PMP is ranked as the top project management certification in North America by CIO Magazine because it demonstrates that you have the specific skills employers seek, a dedication to excellence, and the capacity to perform at the highest levels.\n\n\nIn fact, research indicates that employers will need to fill nearly 2.3 million new project-oriented roles each year through 2030. With demand for project managers at an all-time high, there has never been a better time to earn your PMP certification.\n\n\nFor PMP Exam in 2024, you need to study multiple topics from PMBOK 7th Ed very thoroughly apart from the Process Group Practice Guide (which has now replaced the PMBOK 6th Ed.) and the Agile Practice Guide.\nApart from this this mock simulator also captures all the important aspects from Process Group Practice Guide (previously PMBOK 6th Ed.) and Agile Practice Guide for your PMP Certification Exam in 2024.\n\n\nThis set of +700 Qs is designed as per the updated format of the PMP Certification Exam 2024 by the Project Management Institute (PMI).\n\n\nThis simulator includes questions from the newly published PMBOK 7th Edition by PMI as well. Situational and scenario-based questions are at the core of the PMP certification exam. About 70-80% of the total number of questions in the PMP exam will be situational questions. Hence you must develop your skill of solving these types of questions in the context of the updated syllabus of the PMP Exam by PMI.\n\n\nThis question bank of +700-Q is very carefully designed by me to help you achieve that expertise in solving situational and scenario-based questions as per the new syllabus of the PMP exam. 70-80% of the questions in this simulator are situational type the same as you would experience in your actual PMP exam. The rest 20-30% covers the other important areas of the new PMP exam such as Servant Leadership, Personality Indicators, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Disciplined Agile, Measurement of Training Outcomes, Project Compliance etc.\n\n\nThe following are the top features of this practice test:\nPMP Warm-up/Diagnostic Test 2024: 180 mins | 176 Questions\nPMP New Format 2024 Full-Length Practice Test:180 mins | 176 Questions\nPMP New Format 2024 Bonus Practice Set 1 : 180 mins | 176 Questions\nPMP New Format 2024 Bonus Practice Set 2 : 180 mins | 176 Questions\nQuestions from PMBOK 7th Edition covered\nPractice tricky situational scenario-based questions of varying difficulty levels as per the PMP New Syllabus 2024\nNew syllabus topics covered: Servant Leadership, Personality Indicators, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Disciplined Agile, Measurement of Training Outcomes, Project Compliance, etc.\nPeople (42%), Process (50%), Business Environment (8%) Questions as per new domain distribution.\n50% Questions on Agile Methodology and 50% Questions on Predictive/Hybrid Methodology just like the new pattern of the exam\nDetailed explanations for ALL questions\nNumerical problems on CPM EVM Decision Trees TCPI Communication Channels etc. to develop your understanding\n70-80% of the questions are SITUATIONAL/SCENARIO based.\n\n\n\n\nNew Section 2024 Warm-up/Diagnostic Quiz:\nUse this self-assessment quiz to gauge where you stand before you dive right into solving PMP-style questions this quiz intends to explore the most basic  most important topics of project management in light of the PMP exam so that you are aware of your gaps early in your preparation stage\n\n\nYour Score:  >85% - EXCELLENT Revisit the explanations of the Qs you have got wrong solidify the learnings  proceed to Practice Test2\nYour Score:  60-85% AVERAGE You need to thoroughly analyze the Qs and explanations you got wrong and solidify the learnings before Practice Test2\nYour Score  <60% NEEDS IMPROVEMENT It is prescribed that you analyze ALL the Qs  explanations  in parallel and complete a course on project management basics\n\n\nI reiterate the importance of taking this quiz and analyzing the answers and explanations thoroughly before you move on to Practice Test2 which consists of a higher level of difficulty than actual PMP style questions\n\n\nThe actual PMP Exam will feel much EASIER after you have written this mock. You may find this mock Practice Test 2 3 and 4 more difficult than the actual exam and that is designed intentionally to prepare you in tough conditions so that the actual exam feels much EASIER I do not want you to practice on easy questions and be in a false sense of accomplishment I prepare you the hard way to see you SUCCESSFUL in the end.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nSource of questions in this simulator: Questions in this simulator are created entirely by our team taking into account previous experiences of preparing writing the PMP exam and assessing the difficulty level of the same. Also, the scenarios are developed by us from our clients' project management experiences. We have used ONLY publicly available information regarding the new format of the PMP Exam (ECOs, Crossover Maps, PMI Articles etc.) to develop the questions as per the revised syllabus.

      "description": "Agile implementation is a project management methodology that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Initially popularized in software development, Agile principles are now widely applied across various industries and business processes. It is particularly effective for projects that require iterative development, rapid delivery, and the ability to adapt to changes throughout the project lifecycle.\nCore Principles of Agile\nAgile is guided by a set of core principles that prioritize responsiveness to change, continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction. These principles include:\nCustomer Satisfaction Through Early and Continuous Delivery\nAgile emphasizes delivering valuable work to customers early and frequently throughout the project. This approach ensures that customers see tangible results quickly and can provide feedback early, which helps shape the final outcome.\nEmbracing Changing Requirements\nUnlike traditional methods, Agile welcomes changes in project requirements, even in later stages of development. This flexibility allows teams to adapt to evolving customer needs or shifts in the market, ensuring that the final product remains relevant.\nDelivering Working Software Frequently\nAgile encourages short delivery cycles, known as \"sprints,\" to produce working software or deliverables at regular intervals. This ensures that the project progresses steadily and that customers or stakeholders can review and provide feedback regularly.\nCollaboration Between Developers and Stakeholders\nAgile promotes close cooperation between developers, stakeholders, and end-users throughout the project. This collaboration ensures that all parties are aligned, expectations are managed, and the final product meets the intended goals.\nBuilding Projects Around Motivated Individuals\nAgile recognizes that motivated, skilled teams are key to successful project outcomes. By providing them with the resources and support they need, teams are empowered to produce high-quality work.\nFace-to-Face Communication\nAgile values direct communication, often face-to-face, as the most efficient way to convey ideas, clarify doubts, and ensure that everyone is on the same page. While remote communication tools are used, Agile still prioritizes in-person discussions where possible.\nWorking Software as the Primary Measure of Progress\nIn Agile, progress is measured by the functionality of the product being developed, not by the number of hours worked or the completion of tasks. The focus is on creating valuable, working deliverables that move the project forward.\nSustainable Development\nAgile aims for a consistent pace throughout the project, avoiding burnout by maintaining a sustainable work rhythm. This ensures that developers can maintain high-quality output without sacrificing their well-being.\nContinuous Attention to Technical Excellence and Good Design\nAgile emphasizes maintaining a high level of technical quality and design throughout the project. Teams are encouraged to continuously improve both their code and processes to ensure efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.\nSimplicity\nAgile encourages simplicity in both the product and the process. By focusing on what’s truly essential and avoiding unnecessary complexity, teams can work more efficiently and deliver higher-quality outcomes.\nSprints: The Heart of Agile Implementation\nAgile is often implemented in short, focused work cycles called \"sprints.\" A sprint typically lasts 1-4 weeks (commonly two weeks) and involves the following steps:\nSprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, the team defines the tasks or goals that will be accomplished during the sprint. This helps ensure that everyone is aligned on priorities and expectations.\nDaily Standups: Teams hold brief daily meetings (often called \"standups\") to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming tasks. This promotes continuous communication and allows for quick problem-solving.\nSprint Review and Retrospective: At the end of the sprint, teams review the work completed, demonstrate the deliverables to stakeholders, and gather feedback. They also conduct a retrospective to evaluate what worked well and what can be improved in future sprints.\nBenefits of Agile Implementation\nAgile offers numerous advantages, making it a popular choice for modern project management:\nFaster Time-to-Market\nBy delivering incremental improvements throughout the project, Agile allows teams to release products or services more quickly. This fast-paced approach helps businesses respond to market demands and customer needs faster than traditional methods.\nImproved Quality\nAgile involves continuous testing, feedback, and refinement throughout the project. This iterative process leads to higher-quality deliverables, fewer defects, and better overall performance, as issues are identified and resolved early.\nGreater Collaboration\nAgile fosters a culture of collaboration and open communication. Teams work closely together, sharing knowledge and ideas, which enhances creativity and problem-solving. Stakeholders are also actively involved, ensuring that their needs are consistently met.\nIncreased Customer Satisfaction\nBy delivering value early and often, Agile ensures that customer feedback is continuously integrated into the development process. This leads to products and services that better meet customer expectations and ultimately result in higher satisfaction.\nAgile in a Fast-Paced, Competitive Environment\nAdopting Agile allows organizations to be more responsive to changing market conditions, customer needs, and emerging technologies. Agile’s iterative approach ensures that projects are continually adjusted and improved, enhancing a company’s ability to innovate and adapt quickly.\nIn a fast-paced, competitive environment, businesses need to be able to pivot and make decisions quickly. Agile enables this by breaking down large projects into manageable chunks, delivering value in smaller, more frequent increments. This gives organizations the flexibility they need to stay ahead of competitors, improve customer experiences, and remain relevant in an ever-changing market.\nConclusion\nAgile implementation is a dynamic and flexible project management approach that enables teams to deliver value quickly, collaborate effectively, and continuously improve throughout a project’s lifecycle. By focusing on customer satisfaction, quality, and adaptability, Agile provides businesses with the tools they need to thrive in a fast-paced, competitive environment. Whether applied to software development, product design, or any other business process, Agile can significantly enhance an organization’s ability to respond to change, innovate, and succeed.",

It builds on the foundational knowledge of Scrum and Disciplined Agile, equipping professionals with the skills to lead complex projects and teams using agile methodologies. The DASSM certification is designed for individuals who have a solid understanding of agile practices and have experience working in agile environments. It focuses on advanced topics such as scaling agile across multiple teams, managing risk, and optimizing processes to improve team performance.\nOne of the key aspects of the DASSM certification is its emphasis on leadership and management skills. Unlike the basic Scrum Master role, which focuses on facilitating a single team's agile processes, the DASSM role involves coordinating multiple teams and ensuring that the entire organization is aligned with agile principles. This requires a deep understanding of organizational dynamics and the ability to influence stakeholders at various levels. The DASSM curriculum covers techniques for managing dependencies between teams, fostering a culture of continuous improvement, and implementing governance frameworks that support agile practices.\nFurthermore, the DASSM certification addresses the unique challenges of working in large-scale agile environments. It includes strategies for handling complex projects with numerous interdependencies and for ensuring that agile practices are consistently applied across different parts of the organization. This is particularly important in large enterprises where maintaining alignment and coherence can be challenging. By mastering the skills taught in the DASSM program, professionals can help their organizations achieve greater agility and responsiveness, ultimately leading to better project outcomes and higher customer satisfaction.\nOverall, the DASSM certification represents a significant step forward for agile practitioners seeking to advance their careers. It not only validates their expertise in agile practices but also prepares them for leadership roles that require a higher level of strategic thinking and organizational awareness. For organizations, having DASSM-certified professionals can lead to more effective project management, improved team collaboration, and a stronger alignment with agile principles, driving overall business success.",

Are you interested in implementing scrum best practises for better project outcomes in your organisation? Would it be helpful for you to learn and combat common challenges in scrum implementation for a more streamlined project operation? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this course is for you!\nThe scrum framework was first coined in the 1980s and was developed to create a more streamlined approach for software development projects. The idea behind the scrum approach was to create a systematic framework that could help break down project requirements into smaller parts. These parts would then be assigned to teams who would complete them in “sprints”, a cycle of 1 to 4 weeks. When combined, these parts would form the finished product. Due to its structured approach, collaboration focus and adaptability, the scrum framework became so popular that it would later be adopted across industries for agile project management. A report highlighted that teams using scrum experience a productivity boost of up to 30%. This is largely due to the framework’s focus on continuous improvement and stakeholder feedback, which minimises time spent on non-essential tasks. The scrum framework has been adopted in automotive, manufacturing, software development and even marketing industries and has helped organisations adopt a more agile model for executing projects and achieving innovation. And that is exactly what this course will help you to do!\nOver a series of short video lectures, you will learn how to harness the power of Scrum to drive success in your organisation. You will explore the key Scrum roles and responsibilities, gaining a clear understanding of how each role contributes to a high-performing team. You will also discover why Scrum is favoured by business leaders, and how to implement its core components to enhance efficiency, flexibility and collaboration in your business. We will provide you with the tools to establish best practices for Scrum implementation, ensuring smooth adoption within your organisation. You will also tackle the common challenges businesses face when implementing Scrum and gain strategies to overcome obstacles and ensure a successful transition. Additionally, you will understand how to measure the success of Scrum in your organisation, equipping you with the skills to evaluate its effectiveness and drive continuous improvement.\nBy the end of this course, you will be ready to lead Scrum initiatives with confidence, unlocking greater productivity and delivering value for your business.

Even if your job title isn’t “Project Manager,” the PMP certification validates your ability to drive projects to completion—similar to how a CPA certifies an accountant’s expertise.\nWhat is PMP Certification?\nThe Project Management Professional (PMP) certification, awarded by the Project Management Institute (PMI), is a globally recognized credential for professionals who meet specific education and experience criteria. To earn this certification, candidates must complete a rigorous application process and pass a comprehensive exam.\nWhile not mandatory for most job roles, the PMP certification enhances credibility, strengthens resumes, and demonstrates a standardized level of project management knowledge across industries. Holding this credential proves your expertise and commitment to project management excellence.\nWhat Does a PMP-Certified Professional Know?\nProfessionals who obtain the PMP certification are expected to have a strong grasp of core project management principles, methodologies, and terminology.

The latest requirements and fees can be found on the official PMI website.\nHow to Prepare for the PMP Exam\nMany professionals spend weeks or months preparing for the PMP exam to ensure they fully understand the required concepts. The test consists of 200 multiple-choice questions covering five key areas:\nProject Initiation\nProject Planning\nProject Execution\nMonitoring & Controlling\nProject Closing\nThe exam also includes questions on ethics, conflict resolution, and leadership strategies. A strong study plan, combined with PMP practice tests, increases the chances of passing the exam successfully.\nMaintaining Your PMP Certification\nOnce certified, professionals must earn 60 Professional Development Units (PDUs) every three years to maintain their PMP status. These PDUs can be obtained through:\nProfessional work in project management\nAttending workshops, training, or conferences\nPublishing articles or speaking engagements on project management topics\nKeeping up with continuing education ensures PMP-certified professionals stay updated on industry best practices.\nIs PMP Certification Right for You?\nProject management is an essential skill in virtually every business sector, making PMP certification a valuable asset.

New project managers will enjoy practicing using this new tool to keep people accountable in an objective work oriented way. Current project managers will enjoy this course to validate their skill set, pick up new tips, and get re-motivated to tackle the hard issues.\nWhen you are completed with this course, you will be confident in setting up an issue log, running and updating it real time, and driving reporting from it.",

Without successful accomplishments, a person, a family, a company, or a community would cease to thrive, or even survive.\nMy class reviews seven fundamental principles to create effective and productive practices that lead to successful accomplishments. These fundamentals can be applied to all work, school, sports, and relationships. The ideas are the same. What area of your life would not benefit from less stress and more organization?\nThe classes are:\nFocus\nFocus is an important starting point for anything that you wish to accomplish. Without focus, a person is unable to learn something new or to think through a solution to a problem. It’s almost impossible to be effective without focus.\nSelf-Confidence\nWe know that someone has a better chance of getting into a good school or getting a good job if they have self-confidence. When you ask someone what qualities they would like in a partner, most will include a self-confident person. What does self-confidence mean? It means that no matter what location they will be in, whatever occasion they are attending, they will feel confident. Confident in what will be expected, in what they’re wearing, in how they will be perceived, and in knowing how to decide what to do if they don’t have all of the answers. When a person has self-confidence, it gives other people confidence in that person.\nThe Company You Keep\nWe are born who we are to some extent, and we are what we have lived through to some. We can change ourselves if we take the necessary actions to do so, but we cannot change others. We can influence them, inspire them to change, but they are the only ones who can enact change. Therefore, the people we spend our time with will be a significant influence on how we feel and how we live our lives. We must be careful and thoughtful about the people we include.\nSetting Goals\nSettings goals is a way to create a roadmap from where we are now to something that we want to achieve. It allows us to be able to see what we’ve accomplished as we go along while keeping us motivated.\nPreparedness\nThinking through the possibilities and having the information and resources you will need is giving yourself the best chance of success.\nOrganization\nOrganization saves time, money, and stress. It’s the oil of the wheels of progress.\nGratefulness And A Positive Attitude\nGratefulness is an often overlooked aspect of life. It’s actually hugely important for success. A positive attitude is the number one ingredient for success in anything. Understanding what we have control over and can improve, and what we have no control over and should not be stressing about, is part of how everyone can keep a positive attitude.",

These include updating captions for accessibility, fixing typos and clarifying instructions. These changes are intended to improve the quality and accuracy of the course and provide a better learning experience for our students.\n\n\nWhy is Microsoft Project important?\nProject managers are like the conductor of an orchestra. They are those who adjust the speed (Tempo) of each resource. They have to balance cost, scope, time, risk and of course the quality of the project. To achieve this, project managers require a versatile tool.

You will get insights and real-world experiences working on complex projects and product development focusing on increasing productivity and getting tangible results.\n\n\nThis course helps you to manage your projects differently to be more effective and quick in reaching results, compare to traditional ways that expects you to get it right from the first time. You will get all the tips and tricks you need to acheive your goals timely. How to be result-focus through introducing new laws:\n\n\nthe law of a small team\nthe law of being customer-centric\nthe law of result-oriented\nthe law of feedback & self-organizing\n\n\nThis course will walk you through the Agile project management style in which all work is done by a small team under the direction of a Scrum master, whose primary responsibility is to remove roadblocks. The team meets regularly to discuss ongoing work and any obstacles that need to be removed. Work is done in brief cycles known as sprints.\n\n\nScrum mainly is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:\n\n\n1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.\n2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.\n3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.\n4. Repeat\n\n\nScrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.",

      "description": "We may have good ideas about a new business venture, a new product, or making a strategic change. Often these ideas are not pursued, as they are deemed too risky. Alternatively, they may be implemented but fail as result of insufficient investigation and planning.\nFeasibility studies avoid both of these scenarios by allowing ideas to be developed and tested. They enable options to be explored and aspects, such as costs, timeframes and risks to be determined and quantified. A well-structured feasibility study report makes this information readily accessible and enables decisions on whether the project should be developed or not.\nIf the decision is made to go ahead, the 'trial run' undertaken during the feasibility study provides an excellent basis for planning the project and enables this to be undertaken more efficiently.\nThis course will not only encourage you to have brilliant ideas but also to get them implemented in a structured, planned and effective way.  You will learn how to carry out feasibility studies that provide the following benefits:\n\n\nProvides valuable information for a “go/no-go” decision.\nConfirms the rationale for project.\nInforms how the project should be developed.\nEnhances the success rate of projects by evaluating options and selecting optimum ones.\nIdentifies risks so that these are addressed.\nEstablishes project constraints such as technical, technology, budget, environment, regulation and establishes whether the project can be delivered within these.\nThe 'trial run' enables projects to be carried out with greater focus and efficiency.",

This course is designed to help you achieve both.\nEnglish for Project Managers: Project Risks and Issues is the fourth of the nine modules in the English for Project Managers course. The complete course covers all the topics needed to prepare for the highly recognised Project Management Professional (PMP)® certification from the Project Management Institute (PMI)®.\nTo earn most of the recognised Project Management certifications, such as Project Management Professional (PMP®) from the Project Management Institute (PMI®), PRINCE2 Practitioner from AXELOS, or Certified Project Manager (CPM) from the International Association of Project Managers (IAPM), you have to pass a rigorous exam. The exam questions are based on sophisticated professional texts full of Project Management terminology and complex business lexicon. To get to the gist of a question and answer it correctly, you have to build a solid, specialised vocabulary and develop advanced reading skills. This course’s aim is to help you do exactly that.\nThe course is designed in a way that helps you remember difficult project management-related vocabulary and specific project management terms. It is done not by directly giving you the definitions but by offering a series of specially designed exercises to help you to guess the meanings of the new words and project management terms yourself. This approach makes the definitions stick in your memory.\nThe course is based on professional project management texts adapted from such sources as Project Management Body of Knowledge, Process Groups: A Practice Guide, Governance of Portfolios, Programmes, and Projects: A Practice Guide published by Project Management Institute (PMI), the provider of the highly regarded Project Management Professional (PMP®) certification, and others.\nEach unit contains an introductory case, which describes the project situation, illustrating the importance of some project management concepts. It is followed by a series of articles on specific project management tools and techniques related to the concept. After reading an article and completing related exercises, you will have the opportunity to apply each tool to a like-real project situation by solving a short case study. You will be able to check your solutions by comparing them to the example solutions accompanied by detailed explanations. At the end of each unit, there is a test on the new vocabulary, terms, and project management concepts learnt in the unit.\nGood luck with your studies!",

Explore our sample questions now and experience the rigor of our practice tests!\n\n\nQuestion 1:\nA project manager is leading a project for a company undergoing a significant organizational change, including the introduction of new technology and restructuring of departments. The project is critical to the company's strategy and involves multiple stakeholders. During the execution phase, the project manager discovers that key stakeholders are resistant to the change and have been sabotaging the project's progress by spreading misinformation. What should the project manager do to address this issue effectively?\nA) Ignore the resistance and focus solely on completing the project deliverables.\nB) Conduct a stakeholder analysis to understand the root cause of the resistance and then develop a targeted communication plan to address their concerns.\nC) Reassign the project to a different manager who may be better able to handle the resistance.\nD) Immediately escalate the issue to senior management and request additional resources to overcome the resistance.\nAnswer: B) Conduct a stakeholder analysis to understand the root cause of the resistance and then develop a targeted communication plan to address their concerns.\nExplanation: In this situation, it's crucial to address the root cause of the stakeholder resistance by conducting a thorough stakeholder analysis. This analysis helps identify the reasons behind the resistance and allows the project manager to develop a targeted communication plan that addresses stakeholders' concerns and misconceptions. Ignoring the resistance (Option A) or reassigning the project (Option C) are not practical solutions. While escalating the issue (Option D) might be necessary in extreme cases, it is not the immediate step to resolve the root cause of stakeholder resistance.\nQuestion 2:\nA project manager is working on a project that is heavily influenced by regulatory changes in the industry. The company is required to comply with new environmental regulations that will impact the project's scope and deliverables. Midway through the project, the regulations are revised, necessitating significant changes to the project plan. How should the project manager manage these changes to ensure continued compliance and project success?\nA) Immediately implement the changes to the project plan without consulting the stakeholders to ensure timely compliance.\nB) Evaluate the impact of the revised regulations on the project's scope, schedule, and budget, then update the project management plan and communicate the changes to all stakeholders.\nC) Request a formal exemption from the new regulations to avoid having to revise the project plan.\nD) Continue with the original project plan and address the regulatory changes as a separate issue outside the scope of the project.\nAnswer: B) Evaluate the impact of the revised regulations on the project's scope, schedule, and budget, then update the project management plan and communicate the changes to all stakeholders.\nExplanation: When faced with revised regulations, the project manager should evaluate their impact on the project's scope, schedule, and budget. This evaluation helps in updating the project management plan to ensure compliance with the new regulations. Communicating these changes to all stakeholders is also essential to maintain transparency and manage expectations. Implementing changes without stakeholder consultation (Option A) or requesting an exemption (Option C) are not viable options as they can lead to non-compliance. Continuing with the original plan (Option D) would be inappropriate as it fails to address the regulatory changes affecting the project.\nQuestion 3:\nDuring a Sprint Review meeting, the Scrum Team is presenting the latest increment of the product to stakeholders. A major stakeholder expresses dissatisfaction with the current features, stating that they do not align with the strategic goals of the project. The stakeholder demands significant changes to the product backlog. How should the Scrum Master facilitate the resolution of this issue while maintaining Agile principles?\nA) Instruct the team to immediately prioritize the stakeholder's changes and rework the current sprint's deliverables to accommodate the new requirements.\nB) Schedule a separate meeting with the stakeholder to discuss their concerns and gather detailed feedback, then work with the Product Owner to reassess and prioritize the backlog according to both stakeholder input and project goals.\nC) Ignore the stakeholder's feedback for the current Sprint and address the changes in the next Sprint Planning meeting, assuming that the current Sprint should be completed as planned.\nD) Escalate the issue to senior management to request additional resources and time to handle the stakeholder's demands and ensure alignment with strategic goals.\nAnswer: B) Schedule a separate meeting with the stakeholder to discuss their concerns and gather detailed feedback, then work with the Product Owner to reassess and prioritize the backlog according to both stakeholder input and project goals.\nExplanation: In Agile, particularly in Scrum, it’s important to handle stakeholder feedback constructively. Scheduling a separate meeting to discuss and understand the stakeholder's concerns ensures that the feedback is taken seriously and detailed input is gathered. The Product Owner then reassesses and re-prioritizes the backlog based on this feedback, balancing it with the project’s strategic goals. Immediate rework (Option A) is impractical and disruptive. Ignoring the feedback (Option C) or escalating the issue (Option D) does not align with Agile’s collaborative and iterative approach.\nQuestion 4:\nA Scrum Team is working on a project with a tight deadline. During the Sprint, the team encounters a critical issue with the integration of a new feature that affects the product’s core functionality. The team has to decide between two approaches: fixing the issue immediately at the cost of extending the Sprint or postponing the fix to the next Sprint while delivering the incomplete feature. What should the team do to make this decision while adhering to Agile practices?\nA) Immediately fix the issue and extend the Sprint, even if it means missing the deadline and impacting the delivery date.\nB) Deliver the incomplete feature as planned and prioritize fixing the issue in the next Sprint, ensuring that stakeholders are aware of the incomplete functionality and its implications.\nC) Request an extension of the deadline from senior management to accommodate the immediate fix and complete the Sprint as originally planned.\nD) Modify the definition of \"Done\" to include the incomplete feature and move on to the next item in the backlog without addressing the critical issue.\nAnswer: B) Deliver the incomplete feature as planned and prioritize fixing the issue in the next Sprint, ensuring that stakeholders are aware of the incomplete functionality and its implications.\nExplanation: In Agile, particularly in Scrum, it’s important to balance between delivering working increments and maintaining quality. Delivering the incomplete feature while communicating its limitations to stakeholders allows the team to meet the Sprint deadline and avoid unnecessary delays. Prioritizing the fix for the next Sprint ensures that the issue will be addressed promptly. Immediate fixes (Option A) and deadline extensions (Option C) are not aligned with the Agile focus on iterative delivery. Modifying the definition of \"Done\" (Option D) to accommodate incomplete work compromises quality and does not reflect Agile best practices.\n\n\nDon't Miss Your Chance to Achieve CAPM Certification Success!\nEnroll now in our CAPM Certification Success: Exam Practice Tests - 2024 course on Udemy and take the first step towards passing the CAPM certification exam.

Now it is time to convert this network in a schedule. We need calendars, we need deadlines. We want our project to be as shorten as possible but we want to be reliable.\nIn the first section we are going to learn about uncertainty and estimates.\nIn the second section we are going to see how to build the schedule. If we want to know what determines the length of our project we need to focus on the chain of activities that determines the duration.\nAnd then we are going to see the most important concept of CCPM: the Buffer. How to protect our deadline with less protection.\nAnd you have some exercises to practice the methodology to be sure you understood the concepts and how to do it.",

      "description": "The PRINCE2 Practitioner, 5th edition certificate must undergo renewal within a span of 3 to 5 calendar years from the date of its issuance. To achieve this, 5th edition Practitioners can opt for a re-registration examination, which is conducted at the same proficiency level as the initial Practitioner examination. The re-registration assessment lasts for 60 minutes and adheres to the same standards as the Practitioner exam, with its content based on the PRINCE2 Practitioner, 5th edition Manual.\nHolding a PRINCE2 Re-registration certificate serves as a testament to professionals' ongoing commitment to their professional development, as well as the enduring value of their expertise in PRINCE2 for employers, peers, and colleagues.\nFor individuals who have successfully passed the PRINCE2 Practitioner exam, maintaining their Registered Practitioner status offers several advantages. It demonstrates that they are well-informed about the latest advancements in best practices. It's crucial to bear in mind that PRINCE2 undergoes periodic revisions, and the resources used to pass the Practitioner exam may become outdated over time.\nBeing a Registered PRINCE2 Practitioner can also provide a competitive edge in the job market. Other candidates may possess Practitioner certification, but if their Registered Practitioner status has lapsed, you can highlight that your knowledge of best practices remains current. Moreover, it signifies a commitment to continuous improvement, addressing common concerns shared by PRINCE2 delegates aiming to stay at the forefront of their field.\nIt's worth noting that PRINCE2 certifications themselves do not have expiration dates, whether it's the Foundation or Practitioner level. The only aspect with an expiration date is the status of being a Registered Practitioner.\nThe Registered Practitioner status expires after 5 calendar years from the date of certification. It's possible to take the re-registration exam after 3 years from the date of passing the Practitioner exam.\nThe expiration date can be found on the Practitioner certificate, and AXELOS, the owner of PRINCE2, maintains a register of successful candidates. Unless you have opted out of appearing on this register, both you and potential employers can verify your registered status and its expiration date.\nWhat happens after the expiration date?\nIf the status lapses because you waited longer than 5 years, you can still regain it by taking the re-registration exam. During this interim period, you are not permitted to promote yourself as a Registered Practitioner. Opting for the re-registration exam before the expiration date will save you the hassle of updating your CV and reissuing business cards.\nIt's important to note that there is no requirement to retake the Practitioner exam after you have successfully passed it, as the re-registration exam follows a distinct format. The key takeaway is that the re-registration exam is generally less comprehensive than the initial Practitioner exam.",

With such fierce competition and strong customer demand, organisations have adopted a more agile approach towards software development that allows them to be more receptive to market demand. Lean software development isn’t just a recommended practise but a prerequisite for companies that want to compete and provide continuous value for their customers. Without agile practises and lean software development, companies can struggle to keep up with the competition and deliver high-quality software products that are thoroughly tested and value-driven. This course is designed to teach you lean software development practices and demonstrate how this framework can greatly enhance workflow and operations, leading to higher-value software deliveries.\nOver a series of short video lectures, we will uncover the essential principles of lean software development, helping you to create high-quality software efficiently and sustainably. You will explore the core components of lean development, from value stream mapping to reducing waste, and learn how to apply these concepts to streamline the entire software development process. We will guide you through the practice of delivering “just-in-time” features, enabling you to respond to real-time market demands and avoid overproduction. By learning how to prioritise features based on customer feedback and market requirements, you will gain the ability to build software that meets users' needs exactly when they need it. You will also explore how to empower teams and cultivate a culture of continuous learning. You will understand how to build a collaborative environment where innovation thrives, allowing your teams to work autonomously and make decisions based on shared knowledge. By encouraging continuous learning and adaptation, you’ll help your organisation stay agile and ahead of the curve. We will focus on how to manage rapid market feedback effectively, so you can iterate on your software quickly, minimising risk and maximising value. You'll learn how to integrate feedback loops into your development process, helping you to adjust to changing customer needs and market conditions swiftly.\nLastly, you will learn how to scale lean software development practices across large organisations. We’ll explore strategies for maintaining consistency and alignment when dealing with complex systems, multiple teams, and large-scale projects. Whether you’re working with cross-functional teams or handling global development efforts, you’ll learn how to apply lean principles at scale, driving efficiency, collaboration, and growth throughout the organisation.\nBy the end of this course, you will be equipped with the skills and confidence to apply lean principles to every stage of your software development process.

      "description": "What is PMP Certification?\nThe PMP acknowledges candidates skilled at managing the people, processes, and business priorities of professional projects. PMI, the world’s leading authority on project management, created the PMP to recognize project managers who have proven they have project leadership experience and expertise in any way of working.\n\n\nTo obtain PMP certification, a project manager must meet certain requirements and then pass a 180-question exam. The PMP exam was created by project leaders for project leaders, so each test question can be related to real-life project management experiences.\n\n\nPMP certification validates that you are highly skilled in:\n\n\nMotivating people and teams through all phases of a successful project.\nUsing predictive, agile and hybrid approaches to determine which way of working is best for each project.\nHighlighting the success of a project and its impact on overall strategic organizational goals.\n\n\nWhy Earn the PMP now?\nThe PMP is ranked as the top project management certification in North America by CIO Magazine because it demonstrates that you have the specific skills employers seek, a dedication to excellence, and the capacity to perform at the highest levels.\n\n\nIn fact, research indicates that employers will need to fill nearly 2.3 million new project-oriented roles each year through 2030. With demand for project managers at an all-time high, there has never been a better time to earn your PMP certification.\n\n\nFor PMP Exam in 2024, you need to study multiple topics from PMBOK 7th Ed very thoroughly apart from the Process Group Practice Guide (which has now replaced the PMBOK 6th Ed.) and the Agile Practice Guide.\nApart from this this mock simulator also captures all the important aspects from Process Group Practice Guide (previously PMBOK 6th Ed.) and Agile Practice Guide for your PMP Certification Exam in 2024.\n\n\nThis set of +700 Qs is designed as per the updated format of the PMP Certification Exam 2024 by the Project Management Institute (PMI).\n\n\nThis simulator includes questions from the newly published PMBOK 7th Edition by PMI as well. Situational and scenario-based questions are at the core of the PMP certification exam. About 70-80% of the total number of questions in the PMP exam will be situational questions. Hence you must develop your skill of solving these types of questions in the context of the updated syllabus of the PMP Exam by PMI.\n\n\nThis question bank of +700-Q is very carefully designed by me to help you achieve that expertise in solving situational and scenario-based questions as per the new syllabus of the PMP exam. 70-80% of the questions in this simulator are situational type the same as you would experience in your actual PMP exam. The rest 20-30% covers the other important areas of the new PMP exam such as Servant Leadership, Personality Indicators, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Disciplined Agile, Measurement of Training Outcomes, Project Compliance etc.\n\n\nThe following are the top features of this practice test:\nPMP Warm-up/Diagnostic Test 2024: 180 mins | 176 Questions\nPMP New Format 2024 Full-Length Practice Test:180 mins | 176 Questions\nPMP New Format 2024 Bonus Practice Set 1 : 180 mins | 176 Questions\nPMP New Format 2024 Bonus Practice Set 2 : 180 mins | 176 Questions\nQuestions from PMBOK 7th Edition covered\nPractice tricky situational scenario-based questions of varying difficulty levels as per the PMP New Syllabus 2024\nNew syllabus topics covered: Servant Leadership, Personality Indicators, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Disciplined Agile, Measurement of Training Outcomes, Project Compliance, etc.\nPeople (42%), Process (50%), Business Environment (8%) Questions as per new domain distribution.\n50% Questions on Agile Methodology and 50% Questions on Predictive/Hybrid Methodology just like the new pattern of the exam\nDetailed explanations for ALL questions\nNumerical problems on CPM EVM Decision Trees TCPI Communication Channels etc. to develop your understanding\n70-80% of the questions are SITUATIONAL/SCENARIO based.\n\n\n\n\nNew Section 2024 Warm-up/Diagnostic Quiz:\nUse this self-assessment quiz to gauge where you stand before you dive right into solving PMP-style questions this quiz intends to explore the most basic  most important topics of project management in light of the PMP exam so that you are aware of your gaps early in your preparation stage\n\n\nYour Score:  >85% - EXCELLENT Revisit the explanations of the Qs you have got wrong solidify the learnings  proceed to Practice Test2\nYour Score:  60-85% AVERAGE You need to thoroughly analyze the Qs and explanations you got wrong and solidify the learnings before Practice Test2\nYour Score  <60% NEEDS IMPROVEMENT It is prescribed that you analyze ALL the Qs  explanations  in parallel and complete a course on project management basics\n\n\nI reiterate the importance of taking this quiz and analyzing the answers and explanations thoroughly before you move on to Practice Test2 which consists of a higher level of difficulty than actual PMP style questions\n\n\nThe actual PMP Exam will feel much EASIER after you have written this mock. You may find this mock Practice Test 2 3 and 4 more difficult than the actual exam and that is designed intentionally to prepare you in tough conditions so that the actual exam feels much EASIER I do not want you to practice on easy questions and be in a false sense of accomplishment I prepare you the hard way to see you SUCCESSFUL in the end.\n\n\nHow to make the best use of this simulator  ANALYSIS is the KEY:\nWith the new PMP Exam Syllabus you may need to study quite a few new topics such as Servant Leadership Personality Indicators Minimum Viable Product MVP Agile/Hybrid/Predictive Measurement of Training Outcomes Project Compliance etc. Use the books recommended by PMI to build your capability on these topics Google the new terms as well for quick learning.\n\n\nThe passing score for this simulator is 60%. But you need to know that you should not get demotivated if you score less! DO NOT take the score of this simulator as a representation of your actual PMP exam. Instead, take it as an opportunity to understand your knowledge gap and work on your weak areas. I would suggest that after this 180 mins simulation, you should spend at least 10 hours analyzing each and every question. If you have got a question wrong check the following things:\nIn which domain I am making the most mistakes?\nDid I answer a question incorrectly because I did not know the concept or the application of the concept?\nAre there any repeat mistakes I am making?\nIf a question took 5 mins to solve was there a way to solve it faster?\nAm I making any careless mistakes?\nIs there a common trend of incorrect answers Eg Am I getting more situational-type questions wrong?\nMake notes for your reference as you keep on analyzing the questions?\nIf you prepare like this you will be ahead of your peer group for the new format of the PMP exam prep in no time?\nAll the best for your PMP exam in 2024 and I hope you find this simulation useful.\n\n\nRegards,\nAcumen Academia\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nSource of questions in this simulator: Questions in this simulator are created entirely by our team taking into account previous experiences of preparing writing the PMP exam and assessing the difficulty level of the same. Also, the scenarios are developed by us from our clients' project management experiences.

The complete course covers all the topics needed to prepare for the highly recognised Project Management Professional (PMP)® certification from the Project Management Institute (PMI)®.\nTo earn most of the recognised Project Management certifications, such as Project Management Professional (PMP®) from the Project Management Institute (PMI®), PRINCE2 Practitioner from AXELOS, or Certified Project Manager (CPM) from the International Association of Project Managers (IAPM), you have to pass a rigorous exam. The exam questions are based on sophisticated professional texts full of Project Management terminology and complex business lexicon. To get to the gist of a question and answer it correctly, you have to build a solid, specialised vocabulary and develop advanced reading skills. This course’s aim is to help you do exactly that.\nThe course is designed in a way that helps you remember difficult project management-related vocabulary and specific project management terms. It is done not by directly giving you the definitions but by offering a series of specially designed exercises to help you to guess the meanings of the new words and project management terms yourself. This approach makes the definitions stick in your memory.\nThe course is based on professional project management texts adapted from such sources as Project Management Body of Knowledge, Process Groups: A Practice Guide, Governance of Portfolios, Programmes, and Projects: A Practice Guide published by Project Management Institute (PMI), the provider of the highly regarded Project Management Professional (PMP®) certification, and others.\nEach unit contains an introductory case, which describes the project situation, illustrating the importance of some project management concepts. It is followed by a series of articles on specific project management tools and techniques related to the concept. After reading an article and completing related exercises, you will have the opportunity to apply each tool to a like-real project situation by solving a short case study. You will be able to check your solutions by comparing them to the example solutions accompanied by detailed explanations. At the end of each unit, there is a test on the new vocabulary, terms, and project management concepts learnt in the unit.\nGood luck with your studies!",

      "description": "This fast-paced course is designed to equip project managers with a practical blueprint for leading AI initiatives with confidence and clarity.\nAI projects are fundamentally different from traditional project management—they are complex, iterative, and constantly evolving.\nFixed budgets, rigid timelines, and well-defined requirements rarely apply. Instead, success requires adaptability, strategic thinking, and a deep understanding of the principles that drive AI projects forward.\nIn this course, you won’t get lost in the technical details or coding. Instead, you’ll learn the core leadership principles that matter most: how to navigate uncertainty, manage evolving goals, and align technical teams with business objectives.\nYou’ll gain insight into the importance of data quality and governance, ethical considerations, and trustworthy AI practices, ensuring that your projects are not only effective but responsible.\nYou’ll also explore operational frameworks such as MLOps, which bridge the gap between development and production, helping AI systems perform reliably in real-world environments.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have a clear leadership blueprint that guides you from project conception to full implementation.\nYou’ll be prepared to lead teams confidently, ask the right questions, build trust with stakeholders, and move initiatives from proof-of-concept to impactful outcomes.\nWhether you’re an experienced project manager or stepping into AI projects for the first time, this course provides the knowledge and strategies to thrive in the fast-paced world of AI project leadership.\n\nAlso, one more thing.\n\nThe concepts are presented through my AI avatar (It's my face, but movement and speech are GenAI). Why?\nAs a non-native speaker, I wanted to keep the focus on the content—not on my accent.\nIt perfectly fits the theme: if we’re learning about AI, why not let AI help teach?\n\nLet’s get started—your blueprint for leading AI projects begins now.",

Do your healthcare projects typically run over budget? Do your implementations often take longer than expected?\nIf you answered yes to any of those questions, you may be experiencing issues with risk management. As a healthcare project leader or project manager, it's necessary to be equipped with skills to help you and your team identify and navigate your way around risks.\nIn healthcare, we tend to think of risks in the sense of patient safety risks and outcomes or provider effectiveness and efficiency. However, we may not invest as much thought into risks that impact our projects - things that impact our implementation timelines, costs, and success rates. But when you really think about it, oftentimes the goals of our healthcare projects are to impact patient safety risks and outcomes or provider effectiveness and efficiency.\nYou may have heard \"we can't focus on a new project because we're too busy putting out fires\". Well, maybe if we got to the root of those \"fires\" and  invested in developing a team that was knowledgeable in project management basics and well-educated on risk management practices we could focus more of our efforts on \"fire\" prevention.\nAnd that's the goal of this course! This is a beginner level course to introduce you to risk management as it applies to your healthcare projects. And the hope is that by end of the course you'll have the beginnings of a risk management toolkit that you and your organization can continue to build from.\nAnd with that - let the journey begin!\nCONTINUING EDUCATION NOTES:\nPMP(R) Certificate Holders: This course content is appropriate to be self-logged for 0.5 PDU in Ways of Working under the Education category.

It ensures that all necessary funds are authorized and available for project execution. By creating a cost baseline, project managers can effectively monitor and control project costs, ensuring that the project remains within budgetary constraints. This process is integral to successful project management, as it provides a clear financial roadmap and helps in making informed decisions throughout the project lifecycle.",

Curious about how challenging our questions are? Explore our sample questions now and experience the rigor of our practice tests!\n\n\nQuestion 1 :\nYou are the program manager for a large-scale IT transformation initiative in a global corporation, aimed at integrating various legacy systems into a unified enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform. The program includes multiple projects for data migration, software development, system integration, and user training. Midway through the program, a major cybersecurity breach occurs in one of the legacy systems that are yet to be integrated. This breach has the potential to compromise sensitive corporate data, and the impacted system is critical to daily operations.\nAs the program manager, how should you respond to this crisis while ensuring the successful delivery of the ERP integration program?\n\n\nA) Immediately halt all ongoing projects in the program and shift resources to address the cybersecurity breach, ensuring that the legacy system is secured before proceeding with the integration.\nB) Collaborate with the cybersecurity team to contain the breach and implement immediate security patches, while reprioritizing the program’s projects to focus first on the integration of the compromised system into the ERP platform.\nC) Continue with the current program plan but initiate a parallel project to investigate and mitigate the cybersecurity breach, ensuring that the program's timeline remains unaffected.\nD) Escalate the issue to the program governance board, recommending a temporary suspension of the program to conduct a full security audit of all legacy systems before continuing with the integration.\n\n\nCorrect Answer: B) Collaborate with the cybersecurity team to contain the breach and implement immediate security patches, while reprioritizing the program’s projects to focus first on the integration of the compromised system into the ERP platform.\nExplanation:\nThe most effective response is to collaborate with the cybersecurity team to quickly contain the breach and implement security patches. By reprioritizing the program’s projects to focus first on integrating the compromised system, you can mitigate the risk of further breaches while maintaining the program’s momentum. This approach allows you to address the immediate security concern without unnecessarily halting the entire program.\nOption A suggests halting all projects, which could lead to significant delays and impact the program’s strategic objectives.\nOption C involves continuing with the current plan without addressing the immediate security threat, which could result in further breaches and greater risk to the organization.\nOption D proposes a full suspension for a security audit, which may be overly cautious and cause unnecessary delays, especially if the breach can be contained with targeted actions.\n\n\nQuestion 2 :\nYou are the program manager of a large-scale manufacturing program with multiple production lines and suppliers. The program involves the production of a complex product with multiple components and sub-assemblies. The program is facing several challenges, including:\nDelays in production due to bottlenecks in the production process\nIncreased rework and scrap due to quality issues\nHigh inventory levels due to inaccurate demand forecasting\nSupply chain disruptions due to supplier insolvency\nAs the program manager, you have been tasked with developing a comprehensive program management plan to address these challenges. Which of the following program management strategies would you use to address these challenges?\n\n\nA) Develop a program-wide lean manufacturing initiative to eliminate waste and improve efficiency\nB) Implement a program-wide quality management system to reduce defects and variations\nC) Develop a program-wide supply chain risk management plan to mitigate supplier insolvency risks\nD) Implement a program-wide integrated business planning process to optimize production planning and inventory management\n\n\nCorrect Answer: D) Implement a program-wide integrated business planning process to optimize production planning and inventory management\nExplanation: Implementing a program-wide integrated business planning process is the most appropriate strategy in this scenario, as it involves integrating production planning, inventory management, and supply chain management to optimize the production process and address the challenges facing the program. This approach would involve:\nDeveloping a comprehensive demand forecast to optimize production planning and inventory management\nImplementing a production scheduling system to optimize production workflows and reduce bottlenecks\nDeveloping a quality management system to reduce defects and variations\nImplementing a supply chain risk management plan to mitigate supplier insolvency risks\nThis approach would require collaboration and integration across multiple functions and stakeholders, including production, quality, supply chain, and inventory management.\n\n\nDon’t Wait to Achieve Your Certification Goals!\nIf you're serious about passing the PMI-PgMP certification exam, enroll now in our PgMP Certification Success: Program Management Practice Exams course on Udemy.

This course is designed to help you achieve both.\nEnglish for Project Managers: Project Stakeholders is the first of the nine modules in the English for Project Managers course. The complete course covers all the topics needed to prepare for the highly recognised Project Management Professional (PMP)® certification from the Project Management Institute (PMI)®.\nTo earn most of the recognised Project Management certifications, such as Project Management Professional (PMP®) from the Project Management Institute (PMI®), PRINCE2 Practitioner from AXELOS, or Certified Project Manager (CPM) from the International Association of Project Managers (IAPM), you have to pass a rigorous exam. The exam questions are based on sophisticated professional texts full of Project Management terminology and complex business lexicon. To get to the gist of a question and answer it correctly, you have to build a solid, specialised vocabulary and develop advanced reading skills. This course’s aim is to help you do exactly that.\nThe course is designed in a way that helps you remember difficult project management-related vocabulary and specific project management terms. It is done not by directly giving you the definitions but by offering a series of specially designed exercises to help you to guess the meanings of the new words and project management terms yourself. This approach makes the definitions stick in your memory.\nThe course is based on professional project management texts adapted from such sources as Project Management Body of Knowledge, Process Groups: A Practice Guide, Governance of Portfolios, Programmes, and Projects: A Practice Guide published by Project Management Institute (PMI), the provider of the highly regarded Project Management Professional (PMP®) certification, and others.\nEach unit contains an introductory case, which describes the project situation, illustrating the importance of some project management concepts. It is followed by a series of articles on specific project management tools and techniques related to the concept. After reading an article and completing related exercises, you will have the opportunity to apply each tool to a like-real project situation by solving a short case study. You will be able to check your solutions by comparing them to the example solutions accompanied by detailed explanations. At the end of each unit, there is a test on the new vocabulary, terms, and project management concepts learnt in the unit.\nGood luck with your studies!",

The complete course will cover all the topics needed to prepare for the highly recognised Project Management Professional (PMP)® certification from the Project Management Institute (PMI)®.\nTo earn most of the recognised Project Management certifications, such as Project Management Professional (PMP®) from the Project Management Institute (PMI®), PRINCE2 Practitioner from AXELOS, or Certified Project Manager (CPM) from the International Association of Project Managers (IAPM), you have to pass a rigorous exam. The exam questions are based on sophisticated professional texts full of Project Management terminology and complex business lexicon. To get to the gist of a question and answer it correctly, you have to build a solid, specialised vocabulary and develop advanced reading skills. This course’s aim is to help you do exactly that.\nThe course is designed in a way that helps you remember difficult project management-related vocabulary and specific project management terms. It is done not by directly giving you the definitions but by offering a series of specially designed exercises to help you to guess the meanings of the new words and project management terms yourself. This approach makes the definitions stick in your memory.\nThe course is based on professional project management texts adapted from such sources as Project Management Body of Knowledge, Process Groups: A Practice Guide, Governance of Portfolios, Programmes, and Projects: A Practice Guide published by Project Management Institute (PMI), the provider of the highly regarded Project Management Professional (PMP®) certification, and others.\nEach unit contains an introductory case, which describes the project situation, illustrating the importance of some project management concepts. It is followed by a series of articles on specific project management tools and techniques related to the concept. After reading an article and completing related exercises, you will have the opportunity to apply each tool to a like-real project situation by solving a short case study. You will be able to check your solutions by comparing them to the example solutions accompanied by detailed explanations. At the end of each unit, there is a test on the new vocabulary, terms, and project management concepts learnt in the unit.\nGood luck with your studies!",

While others rely on outdated ITTO memorization, this course is built on extensive research into cognitive science, psychometric analysis, and global PMP trends. We've analyzed thousands of successful candidates to identify the exact strategies that work in today's exam environment.\nAccording to PMI's 2023 Salary Survey, PMP-certified professionals earn a median salary 32% higher than their non-certified counterparts globally. In the United States alone, this translates to approximately $116,000 annually compared to $88,000 for non-certified project managers. But here's what most people don't realize: the path to certification has become increasingly complex.\nThe Modern Reality: Why Traditional Study Methods Fail\nThe 2021 exam overhaul shifted focus from predictive methodologies to a balanced approach emphasizing agile and hybrid frameworks. Today's exam features situational questions requiring deep conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization. Research from cognitive psychology shows that traditional cramming methods achieve only 20% retention after 30 days, while spaced repetition and active recall can increase retention to 85%.\nWhat You'll Learn In This Comprehensive System\nThis course delivers a complete end-to-end system covering every aspect of your PMP journey. You'll master the intricate PMI application process, learning how to document your experience using PMI's specific lexicon to avoid the dreaded audit process that affects 5-10% of applicants. Our proven templates have helped hundreds of students sail through application approval on their first attempt.\nThe accelerated study framework implements cutting-edge techniques like the Feynman method for complex topic deconstruction, spaced repetition for long-term retention, and mind mapping for visual knowledge organization. You'll internalize the \"PMI Mindset\"—the framework that enables you to intuitively select correct answers for complex scenarios involving people, process, and business environment domains.\nWho This Course Is For\nThis comprehensive program is designed for ambitious project managers, team leaders, and professionals seeking accelerated career advancement. Whether you're a seasoned practitioner looking to formalize your expertise or an emerging leader preparing for your next role, this course provides the strategic framework you need.\nThe system works particularly well for working professionals who need maximum efficiency—executives sponsored by their companies, consultants building credibility, and career changers positioning themselves for project management roles.\nAddressing Your Biggest Concerns\nYou might wonder if accelerated certification is too good to be true. The reality is that success depends on systematic preparation, not just speed. Our 30-day framework isn't about cutting corners—it's about eliminating inefficiencies and focusing your effort on high-impact activities that actually matter for exam success.\nConcerned about the application process complexity? Our step-by-step templates and PMI lexicon guidance remove the guesswork. Students report that what seemed impossibly complex becomes manageable with the right framework.\nWorried about the exam's difficulty? The psychometric analysis module gives you insider knowledge about how questions are constructed, validated, and scored. Understanding the test's architecture provides a significant strategic advantage.\nSkeptical about bootcamp alternatives? Our data-driven ROI analysis helps you make informed decisions based on your specific situation, timeline, and budget constraints.\nScientific Foundation And Proven Results\nNeuroscience research demonstrates that accelerated learning occurs through three key mechanisms: focused attention, active engagement, and spaced repetition. This course implements all three systematically. The mind mapping technique activates your brain's visual processing centers, creating stronger neural pathways for information retrieval during high-stress exam conditions.\nStudies from Harvard Medical School show that spaced repetition increases retention by 400% compared to massed practice. Our systematic implementation of these techniques ensures you retain critical PMP knowledge long-term, not just for exam day. The Feynman Technique, developed by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, forces you to explain complex concepts in simple terms—a proven method for identifying knowledge gaps and achieving true mastery.\nPerformance analytics from leading exam simulators show that students using structured preparation frameworks score an average of 15-20 points higher than those using traditional study methods. Our systematic approach to situational questions—based on decision-making frameworks from behavioral psychology—helps students achieve consistent performance across all three exam domains.\nThe course leverages research from cognitive load theory, which demonstrates that humans can only process 7±2 pieces of information simultaneously. Our modular structure and visual learning aids respect these cognitive limitations, ensuring optimal information processing and retention. Each lesson builds systematically on previous knowledge, creating a scaffold that supports accelerated learning without overwhelming your working memory.\nWhy The Fast Track Approach Works\nTraditional certification programs spread content over 6-12 months, creating significant forgetting curves between topics. Research from Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve shows we lose 50% of new information within 20 minutes without reinforcement. Our compressed timeline actually works to your advantage—concentrated exposure creates stronger neural pathways and reduces the total time needed for mastery.\nThe Pareto Principle applies directly to PMP preparation: 20% of the content drives 80% of your exam success. Through analysis of thousands of actual exam questions, we've identified the highest-impact topics that appear most frequently. This isn't about shortcuts—it's about strategic focus on what matters most for certification and real-world application.\nComplete Course Structure And Learning Experience\nModule 1: PMP Fast Track Foundations covering strategy, ROI calculation, and modern exam structure—including analysis of global market demand variations and salary data across different industries and regions\nModule 2: Application mastery including documentation, templates, and audit preparation—featuring real examples of approved applications and common rejection reasons\nModule 3: Accelerated study framework with cognitive techniques and PMI mindset development—implementing scientifically-proven methods for maximum retention and recall\nModule 4: Comprehensive exam content covering People, Process, and Business Environment domains—with deep dives into agile, hybrid, and predictive methodologies\nModule 5: Practical toolkit including simulator analysis, bootcamp comparison, and exam day strategy—featuring performance analytics and time management techniques\nModule 6: Expert-level content covering psychometrics, ethics, and future certification trends—including insights into exam construction and emerging industry developments\nEach module includes practical exercises, downloadable templates, and real-world case studies. You'll receive comprehensive workbooks, mind map templates, application examples, and performance tracking spreadsheets. The course includes over 6 hours of video content and 200+ practice questions.\nExclusive Modules:\n#1: AI-Powered Study Companion with curated prompts and personalized study aids for modern learning acceleration\n#2: Complete Audit Survival Guide with templates, contact scripts, and detailed process maps for the 5-10% who face PMI audits\n#3: Post-PMP Career Blueprint for leveraging your new credential strategically, including resume optimization and LinkedIn profile enhancement\nReal Results From Real Students\nOur systematic approach has helped professionals across diverse industries achieve PMP certification efficiently. Students report significant improvements in confidence levels, study efficiency, and exam performance. The structured framework eliminates the overwhelm that causes many candidates to give up or repeatedly fail the exam.\nThe application templates alone have saved students an average of 40 hours of documentation time while achieving 95% first-time approval rates. Our exam simulation strategies help students finish the exam with 45-60 minutes remaining, providing ample time for review and confidence-building.\nInvestment In Your Future\nConsider the mathematics: If PMP certification increases your salary by just $10,000 annually, the return on investment pays for itself every month for the rest of your career. The median salary increase of 32% means most professionals recover their entire educational investment within the first 2-3 months of certification.\nBeyond immediate compensation benefits, PMP certification opens doors to senior leadership roles, consulting opportunities, and international career mobility. In today's project-driven economy, organizations actively seek certified project managers who can navigate complex initiatives and deliver measurable results.\nTake Action Now And Transform Your Career\nStop wasting time with fragmented advice and outdated materials that don't reflect today's exam reality.

Key topics include implementing and controlling time schedules, understanding lean construction principles, and applying Total Quality Management (TQM). We’ll also dive into cost control techniques, using real-world examples to demonstrate how to monitor and manage project expenses effectively.\nResource allocation strategies will be explored, focusing on optimizing workforce size while staying within budget. As contracts and procurement are often major challenges in construction projects, we'll discuss various strategies to manage these processes and find optimal solutions. A key focus will be on applying the right quality management system, including how to conduct quality control for concrete and steel structures. The methods of QC for concrete and steel will be discuss in detail.\nEffective communication is critical in large-scale projects, where managing a workforce of hundreds or even thousands of employees require strong communication systems and skills. This course will provide practical tips for improving communication management in such environments. All our courses will discuss the practical ways with strong theoretical background.\nAdditionally, attendees will receive a free eBook covering 100 Q&A for PMP preparation.",

But previously, if you share resources between different projects, you have to synchronize them to organize the work of the team to obtain both: the best productivity with the best speed for the project.\nIt is the third of three courses where you will find the basics of Critical Chain Project Management CCPM.\nCCPM was defined by Eli Goldratt, author of The Goal and creator of T.O.C. the Theory of Constraints, at the end of last century.\nIn the first course you saw how to obtain a network. In the second we knew to convert this network in a schedule. And now it’s time for synchronizing and executing.\nIn the first section you will learn how to synchronize different projects that are sharing the same resources. In this kind of situations it’s easy to feel the projects fighting between them to obtain the resources allocation. We need to solve two questions:\n- Every project itself: we want to speed all of them, to obtain the best possible due date.\n- The work organization. Of course the team has to jump between projects. We can’t wait to finish one project before starting the next one. People need good task lists with clear priorities to know how to do it.\nThe second section will show you what happens during the life of the project, during the execution. Previously we saw how to obtain a schedule well protected from the uncertainty. But thinks never are as expected. Then we need a way to control the project in a way that allows us:\n- To receive clear notices about when the project is on risk of not meet their deadline.\n- To identify the causes to know what to solve.\nAnd the third section will deal with the last two subjects:\n- To perfectly understand what we can ask to CCPM. What are the improvements we can expect to achieve.\n- To know some bibliography to continue learning about CCPM.",

      "description": "Do you want to implement a visual framework for making project workflows more manageable in your organisation? Are you interested in learning the core components to harness the full potential of the kanban framework? Would it be helpful for you to implement best practises for the kanban framework to boost productivity and efficiency across departments? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this course is for you!\nThe Kanban Framework is a visual workflow management tool that has been gaining a lot of traction in several industries due to its user-friendly interface and its ability to visualise pending, in progress and completed tasks. Kanban is a Japanese word for “visual signal”. The framework was initially designed to help software developers visualise pending tasks and help them prioritise and manage complex project workflows, but due to its intuitive design, the framework was quickly adopted across marketing, banking, healthcare and even engineering sectors. Due to the visual nature of the framework, teams can easily see the overall status of a project at any given time. The framework also enables employees to practise cross-collaboration since tasks can be assigned to various departments within the organisation. According to research, companies using kanban report up to a 50% increase in team efficiency due to better workflow visualisation, task prioritisation and bottleneck reduction. This is thanks to the framework’s emphasis on tracking and accountability, which makes project tasks much easier to monitor and improve. And that is exactly what this course will teach you to do.\nOver a series of short video lectures, you'll embark on a journey to master the Kanban methodology, a proven system for managing workflows, improving productivity and enhancing team collaboration. Whether you're new to Kanban or looking to deepen your understanding, this course will guide you through every essential aspect of its implementation. You’ll dive into the fundamentals of Kanban, exploring its core components such as visual boards, work-in-progress limits and the principles behind its success. We'll uncover why Kanban is a top choice for business leaders, particularly in its ability to improve efficiency and streamline operations across industries. Throughout the course, we’ll take a close look at the key metrics that drive Kanban success, including cycle time, throughput and lead time. You'll explore the tools needed to track these metrics and leverage them to optimise your workflow. As you progress, you'll uncover strategies for scaling Kanban across larger organisations, learning how to adapt it to fit different team sizes, processes and complexities. You'll also explore the best practices for seamless Kanban implementation, ensuring that your teams can continuously improve their operations.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll have gained practical skills and insights to implement Kanban within your organisation, scale it effectively and drive sustained business success through improved efficiency and collaboration.

To explain this process, we develop comprehensive examples that show in detail how to apply this new methodology step by step. Afterwards, following each exercise, we analyze and compare the results, demonstrating a significant planning’s improvement in terms of deadline, efficiency, and feasibility.\nResources/Constraints Based Planning is such a disruptive technique that it challenges deeply rooted concepts in Project Management, such as the critical path or dependencies between activities; it suggests improvements to essential tools for schedule development, like the Gantt Chart ; and instead of teaching the use of project planning softwares, such as Primavera P6 or MS Project, it highlights their weaknesses and limitations.\nFinally, this course and new methodology automate the planning process, opening the door to the integration of artificial intelligence in Project Management.",

      "description": "¡Bienvenido al curso de Metodologías Ágiles para gestión de proyectos multidisciplinares: Aprende las técnicas de KANBAN y SCRUM!\nEste curso es una oportunidad para aprender sobre una de las metodologías más populares y efectivas utilizadas en la gestión de proyectos en la actualidad. Con recursos descargables y bibliografía interesante en cada unidad, estarás listo para llevar tus proyectos al siguiente nivel. ¡Comencemos!\nDesde sus orígenes en el mundo del software, las metodologías ágiles han evolucionado para abarcar muchos otros campos, incluyendo la gestión de proyectos en general. Aplicable a cualquier campo de cualquier sector (Departamentos de formación, RRHH, Finanzas,...).\n\n\nEl curso está dividido en dos grandes bloques:\n1) El primer bloque del curso tiene como objetivo interiorizar la esencia del mindset agile:\n\n\nExploraremos el mindset agile, los principios y valores fundamentales de las metodologías ágiles, así como el Manifiesto Agile y cómo se aplican en diferentes contextos. Comenzaremos con una discusión sobre la definición, el origen de las metodologías ágiles y cómo han evolucionado con el tiempo.\n\n\nAbordaremos la comparación entre las metodologías ágiles y el enfoque de gestión de proyectos tradicional, conocido como Waterfall. Comentarnos las diferencias clave entre estos dos enfoques y una guía práctica de cuándo es recomendable usar un enfoque u otro. Además de conocer alguna herramienta para ello.\n\n\nTambién cubriremos conceptos importantes como MVP (Producto Mínimo Viable), iterativo e incremental, VUCA, Complejo vs. Complicado, que son fundamentales para comprender cómo funcionan las metodologías ágiles en la práctica. Uno de los recursos descargables del curso es un Glosario los conceptos Agile para que te ayude a adentrarte en este nuevo lenguaje.\n\n\n2) En este segundo bloque profundizaremos en los dos marcos de trabajo más populares: KANBAN y SCRUM.\n\n\nRealizaremos una pincelada sobre las influencias de Agile: System Thinking y Lean.\n\n\nkanban: En esta unidad del curso de Agile, se explorará Kanban de manera exhaustiva. Empezaremos por su definición, los momentos adecuados para su implementación y los beneficios que aporta a los equipos y organizaciones. También se verán las prácticas de Kanban y se trabajará en una práctica que les permitirá a los estudiantes aprender cómo empezar con Kanban.\n\n\nAdemás, se llevará a cabo una demostración en vivo utilizando una herramienta colaborativa para que puedas experimentar cómo trabajar en equipo y en tiempo real utilizando un tablero de seguimiento de tareas.\n\n\nSCRUM: conoceremos la definición, cuándo utilizarlo y cómo se trabaja con dicho marco de trabajo. Seguidamente conoceremos los roles de Scrum y sus principales funciones. Acabaremos navegando y explorando al detalle el ciclo SCRUM con sus ceremonias y artefactos.\n\n\nEn cada unidad del curso, se proporcionan recursos descargables y bibliografía interesante para que puedas utilizar para profundizar aún más en los temas tratados y usar con tu equipo. Las explicaciones del curso se basan en ejemplos prácticos para ayudarte a entender cómo se aplican los principios y metodologías ágiles en la vida real.\n\n\nEste curso de Agile ofrece una experiencia completa y práctica para que puedas adquirir habilidades y conocimientos en este ámbito tan demandado por las empresas. Si quieres formarte en una metodología de trabajo ágil y eficiente que te permita mejorar la gestión de proyectos y equipos, ¡Inscríbete hoy mismo y comienza a transformar la forma en que trabajas!\n\n\nMe encantaría seguir en contacto contigo y apoyarte en tu camino Agile. En el curso te dejo el enlace a mis perfiles para que sigamos compartiendo experiencias, tendencias y conocimientos del mundo Agile. Te invito a seguir mi blog de Medium en el que escribo sobre Management 3.0,Liderazgo,GestiónEquipos,Agile,Facilitación,Motivación.\nMuchas gracias por inscribirte, ¡comencemos a trabajar juntos y a llevar tus habilidades Agile al siguiente nivel!\nExperimentaAgile\nYoTambienSoyAgilist\nAprenderesInnovar",

Por lo tanto se acaba ofreciendo un sistema mas estable, puesto que todo el equipo conoce que quiere hacer el sistema.\nOtra de las ventajas de utilizar Gherkin es que según vamos creando nuestros archivos feature de Gherkin estamos generando documentación viva que describe a la perfección como se comporta el sistema, por lo tanto solventamos uno de los grandes problemas a la hora de crear sistemas informáticos, que es la documentación.\nA lo largo de este curso aprenderás a utilizar la sintaxis de Gherkin:\nFeature\nScenario\nGiven\nWhen\nThen\nAnd\nBut\nBackground\nScenario Outline\nComo se pone el foco en el comportamiento esperado del producto, todo el equipo entiende bien que se ha de hacer y no nos volveremos a encontrar en fases en las que el equipo de desarrollo no hace lo esperado por parte de la gente de producto, por esa falta de precisión.\nCon esta nueva forma de desarrollo se consiguen mejores tiempos, todo el mundo esta centrado en los mismos escenarios.\n¿Por qué Gherkin?\nEl perfil de negocio entiende mucho de retorno de inversión, de funcionalidades, requisitos pero poco de la parte técnica, por otro lado tenemos al equipo de perfil técnico que entiende mucho de tecnología pero poco de negocio. Aquí es donde entra en juego Gherkin, nos soluciona este problema de comunicación que puede haber dentro del equipo. Gherkin hace que la gente de negocio y la gente técnica hablen exactamente el mismo idioma con una sintaxis básica.\nSi como Product Owner quieres mejorar la productividad de tu equipo, evitar problemas de entendimiento y generar documentación viva de tu proyecto este curso es para ti.",

      "description": "This course is part one of four-course series:\nProject Management Career Start - the SPARK Method - 1/4\nProject Management Career Start - the SPARK Method - 2/4\nProject Management Career Start - the SPARK Method - 3/4\nProject Management Career Start - the SPARK Method - 4/4\n\n\nThere is a new, practical method in Project Management that I am going to tell you about in just a minute. The very essence of the method is to answer on a question:\n\n\n“How do I begin a career in Project Management in a fast, practical manner and have a successful career start?”\n\n\nFor centuries, ancient painters and architects used a golden ratio between dimensions inside their master pieces. They tried to find a perfect balance between them and to create the most pleasing pieces for the human eye.\n\n\nTransferring that ancient approach to Project Management, we try to find:\na perfect balance between management and leadership,\nbetween control and trust to your team members,\nso that you can have a perfect Project Management career start and excel even as a beginner!\n\n\nYou absolutely need to know about this as, once implemented into your working system, you can be confident that you are beginning your career in Project Management by delivering great results and being respected as a leader by your team members.\n\n\nThe reason why this method is different from everything else is that finally, we truly concentrate on cooperation between team members and leadership and not on processes and procedures, like most of the courses and official guides do.\n\n\nBy concentrating on cooperation and communication, the most important part of Project Management, you are resolving majority of challenges immediately.\n\n\nThe power is in simplicity and in using knowledge that your team already has, so that you can:\n\n\ndeliver projects on time,\nin budget and\nwith high quality.\n\n\nAs a beginner in Project Manager, you will not know everything, but guess what, you do not need to know everything! It is enough to know how to cooperate with people and create environment in which they are willing to share knowledge.\n\n\nWith that, you can begin and make the next step in your career!\n\n\nAnd you are making a great choice!\n\n\nAccording to PMI’s “Project Management Salary Survey”, only in the US, the demand for Project Management Professionals will grow, by 2020, for more than 12% or 700 000 jobs! That strong demand leads to:\n\n\na higher average salary and\nsalary growth worldwide!\n\n\nFor more than a decade I teach, lead projects and cooperate with people around the globe. I am a certified Project Management Professional (PMP® #1702088), Agile Champion and recipient of several Service Excellence Awards and Manager Choice Awards.\n\n\nIt is my pleasure to present to you, the balanced approach that allowed me to be seen as a great mentor, a leader and a colleague wherever I worked, and to give you the tool that is a result of years spent in mentoring and Project Management.\n\n\nWhen I have begun my career in Project Management, I needed to discover tips and tricks on my own, I was thrown “into the fire” immediately and needed to orient myself in a completely new area, full of procedures, processes, does and don’ts. As a beginner, I made missteps, I had setbacks, worked with angry customers, but eventually I grew out of it with a vast experience.\n\n\nNow, I want to share this knowledge with you so that you do not need to go through the same pains I did.\n\n\nFor that purpose, I’ve created approach that is now called the SPARK Method that finds a perfect balance between control and trust and between management and leadership, necessary for a great career start.\n\n\nOur first task is to reduce complexity, to remove pressure of having to know everything and to start from basics. We are moving together step by step through our method, so you can come to work and be excited while building new relationships and delivering great results!\n\n\nMoreover, by going back to basics and using the knowledge of the whole team, you save a lot of time, avoid misunderstandings and build trust between team members!\n\n\nThe reason our approach works so well is that we take a step back and teach WHY we communicate as we communicate and then we show HOW you can do it by providing you with the practical tooling set.\n\n\nBy cooperating effectively and treating your team members well, you are guaranteed to have more success in your projects. PMI simply states in their paper that: “Organizations that communicate effectively have more successful projects.”\n\n\nNormally, you do not receive a guide how to start in Project Management without stress, with knowledge how to communicate, cooperate and be confident that you will manage. Often, without that kind of help, people resign from a wonderful career. I don’t want that to happen to you. We will help you to understand that Project Management is not too complex, that it is fun and that you can do it too.\n\n\nThat is what our SPARK method is all about.\n\n\nA method that focuses on cooperation and finds a perfect balance, a golden ratio, between control and trust and making sure that you will succeed in your Project Management career.\n\n\nFrom the cooperation centric point of view, the SPARK Method introduces:\ncommunication strategy,\nhow to plan job to be done,\nneed for constant improvement,\nsoft skills and\nleadership necessary to lead your team.\n\n\nThere is nothing more gratifying than, while implementing this approach, you get feedback from your team members like the one you will see below.\n\n\nThat being said, let’s move forward step by step...\n\n\n---- Colleagues and students feedback reffered to in the text above ----\n\n\n\"...you’ve been an inspiration and positively influenced me to\nlearn and work and I will never forget that...\", J.\n\n\n“... a great human, manager, leader, PM in one body. I had a chance to\nobserve his team transformation\nand the outcome was bigger than anyone could imagine. People have started\ncommunicating and talking openly, he builds a situation in this way that people don't have to do something...\nthey just want to do something...”, M.\n\n\n“...leaping off the page on a regular basis by being a mentor,\nby leading internal knowledge sessions within his Department & Unit,\nby receiving approbations for his outstanding PM performance.\nIt is very hard to be a manager but also a coach and mentor\nat the same time but Marko succeeds...”, K.\n\n\n“...very unique example of balance between recognition\nof human in each employee and business results,\nso important in big corporation...”, T.\n\n\n“ ...I could numerate several different merits\nwhich Marko is holding to, which from my perspective\nare the ones each good Manager should follow:\ntrust, loyalty, open and honest communication, positive attitude to people and changes, respect, good listening.\nSuch working environment is the one which I, as an employee\nwas searching for to be efficient and satisfied in...”, K.",

      "description": "Set out on the right path, or course-correct, your agile journey\n\n\nAre you about to embark on your agile journey? Or in the middle of one. Or perhaps, your company states you are already 'fully agile'. Still, you may have this sinking feeling when the alarm clock goes off in the morning. Concepts such as sustainable pace, collaboration, and self-organisation are just not there. (Despite the motivational posters on the office walls.) You spend a lot of time getting stuck in the red tape. Or the opposite - Agile seems to be an excuse for chaos and poor planning.\n\n\nAgile is often misunderstood. Many implementations are focused on doing agile, rather than being agile. Best intentions often end up in common pitfalls. Not only do you fail to reach your full potential or achieve actual change. Worst case - things become even more confusing and difficult.\n\n\nThis course helps you set out on the right path, or course correct, on your agile journey. It introduced the fundamentals and Scrum framework. But it also lets you identify and deal with common pitfalls.\n\n\nWhat’s unique about this course is that it is taught as a story. Follow Adam through the agile implementation in the stock-standard medium-sized company where he works. Recognise and learn from their setbacks and triumphs.\n\n\nThe course is divided into 4 sections:\nBeginning background - a check-in on why many organisations are looking for new ways of working.\nLet's do agile - Introduction to the Scrum framework, taking you through roles, events, artefacts, user stories, relative sizing and agile planning/reporting.\nImplementation - Common, usually unsuccessful, shortcuts to agile implementations\nLet's be agile - talking to the importance of understanding why and not just following frameworks blindly.\n\n\nIt also includes free instructions and templates for you to help your team on their journey.\n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\nDid you know that the story format is not just more entertaining? Our brains are wired to remember stories longer. They activate multiple senses and light up several areas in your brain.\n\n\n'It was a good choice. The understanding of the essential details and how the teams are related correctly, in addition to the well-structured quizzes, make the course enjoyable, simple, and quick to understand all the definitions that are carried out.'\nEly Cruz\n\n\nHere is what a student going thru the previous version said:\n'The training is clear, well structured and presented in a fun way. I consider this training to be very useful and recommend this training, even to people that have some Agile knowledge.'\nJohn Debbaut\n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\nIt is important to me that you get value out of this course, so use the 30-day-money-back guarantee if you did not feel that was the case. Also, I would be grateful for any feedback on how you think it could become more useful.\n\n\nReady to give it a go?
