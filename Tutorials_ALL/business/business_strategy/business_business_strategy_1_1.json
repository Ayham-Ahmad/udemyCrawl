      "description": "The global investment and corporate community has realized that companies that do good in the world also do better in their business. Programs for corporate social responsibility (CSR) were all \"nice to haves,\" but now investors, consumers, and employees are demanding that companies make positive ESG (environmental, social, and governance) impacts and the game has changed. Positively contributing to society and the environment is now a \"must have.\" ESG frameworks have brought transparency, objectivity, and accountability to companies' environmental, social, and governance impacts. But, ESG frameworks are numerous and confusing. Reporting standards are varied and difficult to navigate. And, the ESG landscape is changing rapidly.\nAccording to the Harvard Business Review, there is an \"ESG Reckoning\" taking place.  ESG is the No. 1 topic investors want to discuss with boards of directors. (PWC.) As of 2020, almost 90% of publicly traded companies and 67% of privately-owned companies had embarked on ESG initiatives. (NAVEX Global). Additionally, 88% of institutional investors believe that companies that prioritize ESG initiatives represent better opportunities for long-term returns than companies that do not. (Edelman)\nWhether your company already has an ESG program or is thinking of developing one, this course will help you understand ESG, navigate the alphabet soup of the ESG world, and lead your company in establishing a high-impact ESG program.\nLayli Miller-Muro has a 25-year career as a corporate lawyer with one of the top law firms in the world and as a human rights lawyer with one of the most influential non-profits in the United States. Named as one of Goldman Sachs's Top 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs, Newsweek Magazine's 150 Most Fearless Women in the World, and a winner of the Washington Post's Award for Management Excellence, Layli is an author and frequent lecturer. Currently, she is a consultant helping corporations with their social impact strategies. With both a legal and practical lens, she will demystify ESG and help you establish an effective ESG program.\nWhat students say about the course:\n\"This is one of the best courses on Udemy. The instructor is very knowledgeable, her presentation style is engaging, there are a lot of helpful downloadable resources, and the \"expert interviews\" by ESG leaders in companies like Hewlett-Packard, VISA, etc. are as real as it gets. They are the leading internal practitioners and they know what they are talking about. The course is worth getting just for those interviews. Very well done!\"\n\"The content was amazing and well articulated.\"\n\"Wonderful course, well explained, well guided and summarized so beautifully. Very helpful for a beginner to understand and implement ESG.\"\n\"Excellent course. A lot of sincere effort has been put in by the course instructor Layli and multiple perspectives offered to make it deep while being fair and balanced. The course takes a nuanced view of cultural complexities while implementing ESG programmes and the practical challenges, while emphasising on the positive direction in offers. Largely resting on some stellar interviews by Industry titans from different spheres of activity that gives an inside view of the past, present and future of ESG in organizations, interspersed with interesting lectures from Layli, this is truly a high value course offered at a very competitive price. Anyone interested in ESG should totally lap this up.\"\n\"Thank you very much for creating this course. ESG is complex and rapidly changing, thanks to this training with multiple stories from working professionals and numerous resources it is enormously useful. Highly recommended for all types of professionals; employees, entrepreneurs, producers or consumers.\"\nThis course will enable you to:\nUnderstand the history of ESG and what ESG means (including how it is different from CSR)\nRealize its relevance to you and your company\nBecome an expert in the range of frameworks currently out there, as well as those that are pending and coming down the pipe\nYou will receive a road map for implementing an ESG strategy for your company - whether small or large. (With practical tools, handouts, and exercises to support you in your journey.)\nHave a sense of what is coming next in the industry and keep up with ESG's fast-paced changes.\nThrough Zoom interviews, learn directly from experts from top executives of leading ESG in major corporations (e.g., HPE, Visa, Ben & Jerry's, Mastercard, Twitter, Yeti, etc.) to gain insights by those implementing ESG every day at the highest levels in their corporations.\nMost importantly, this course will support you in ensuring that your company has a competitive edge in both making profit and making the world a better place!",

      "description": "Are you looking for ways to engage and inspire your team? Research shows that employees are more engaged when the mission and purpose of their company makes their job feel important.  In larger organizations the link between the company mission and an individual contributor's work can be tenuous. But team leaders can strengthen that link by creating team-level vision, mission, and values statements that align with the larger organization's vision, mission, and values.\nThis course is designed to prepare and empower you to do just that.\nHaving a vision is important because it paints an inspirational picture of the future that your team can work toward,  providing clarity and purpose for all. Having a mission is important because it supports the vision and communicates what your team will do, for whom, to bring about the vision. The mission is particularly useful when communicating beyond your team to internal and external customers, partners, vendors, and other stakeholders. Finally, values are important because they shape the overall culture of an organization, and guide the day-to-day interactions of team members.\nIn this course, you will...\nConnect with your intention for creating team-level vision, mission, and values statements\nIdentify metrics you'd like to move as a result of having done this work\nDiscover the differences between vision & mission statements and why they're both important\nDiscover what values are & why they're important\nReconnect with the vision, mission, and values for your company so you can be re-inspired and ensure alignment when you do the work with your team\nLearn how to engage your team in the process of creating vision, mission, and values statements in a collaborative, inclusive way\nDevelop a plan to create vision, mission, and values statements with your team\nExplore how to put your team vision, mission, and values into action through communication, aligning work, prioritizing work, and resolving conflicts\nAssess your leadership approach and identify ways to model the behaviors you want to see in your organization\nI’ve been working with leaders and teams for more than two decades as a leadership coach, consultant, facilitator, and human resources professional. The vision I hold for my work is a world where everyone is thriving in their purpose, realizing their boldest visions, and contributing to the greater good.  Join me and learn how to create Vision, Mission, and Values statements with your team today.",

      "description": "Overview\nThis training program helps you leverage methods of design thinking in order to produce new and compelling service and system designs. It serves as a foundation for thinking about the behavioral touchpoints a user may have with your company, and how those touchpoints can be better designed to support a more comprehensive and purposeful brand experience.\nThe training program's primary emphasis is on diagramming and storytelling. You'll learn to create quick, low-fidelity representations of ideas, so you can test these ideas and improve upon them. By embracing diagramming, storytelling, and rapid prototyping, you'll be prepared to introduce a culture of making into your company or organization. You'll understand how to visualize complex ideas, how to minimize complexity, and how to simply illustrate changes in a complex system.\n\nGrounding Principles\n\nExperience. The experiences people have shape their views and perspectives, and the experiences people have with your brand shape the way they think about, judge, and interact with your company. Experience happens over time, and our curriculum focuses on the development of time-based artifacts that help tell stories of behavior. You'll learn to think about narrative structures, and consider products and services in a larger, experiential context.\n\nEmpathy. Often, we look internally at our own company’s processes, attitudes, and perspectives. Empathy means looking outwards, exploring the emotions and perspectives of our users and customers, and trying to see the world through their eyes. Our curriculum emphasizes forms of active empathy: exploring novel situations from a perspective of vulnerability in order to feel what customers feel.\n\nPrototyping. Artifacts ground ideas in reality so that they can be critiqued, examined, and improved. Prototyping is a form of iterative making, in order to see ideas come to life. Prototypes can be collaboratively evaluated, and can be applied to products, services, and systems. Ideas can be developed at a variety of fidelities, and our curriculum emphasizes quick prototyping at rough stages of fidelity, in order to drive rapid improvement.\n\nSkills Developed\nYou'll learn these practical skills:\nScenario development and storyboarding. Written and visualized scenarios act as the underpinnings for time-based interactions. You will learn to craft believable, future-facing stories of how people use new services and systems.\nCustomer journey mapping. Journey maps act as visual representations of how a person explores a service over time, showing connection points between people, products, policies, and interactions. These visuals can be used to illustrate both the problem (or existing) state of a service, as well as the future (or ideal) state of a service design.\nService slices. Many services include human touchpoints, and these touchpoints often shape how we feel about the entire service experience. You will learn how to create various “slices” of a service in order to show information flow, sequences of interactions, and the power dynamics between actors in the system.\nRapid prototyping. You will learn to visualize your ideas in two and three dimensions, showing how new service touchpoints will actually manifest. You will learn to prototype at different levels of fidelity, and to critique designs in order to improve upon them.",

      "description": "Life Cycle Assessment (a.k.a. Life Cycle Analysis) is commonly abbreviated to LCA and is an International Standard. LCA is a methodology used in environmentally-conscious manufacturing and supports the analysis of environmental burden accumulated during the product life cycle, with the intention of driving improvement programmes. There are several benefits of LCA which are discussed throughout the course but they essentially boil down to the improvement of environmental performance of products, systems and the related processes.\nOne key innovation offered by this course is that all the learning of the fundamentals of LCA is done through a powerful visual knowledge model. A visual knowledge model is a formidable asset that logically describes subject matter and it, therefore, captures all the main concepts and their relationships in order to explain the context of LCA. This visual knowledge model is made available for you to download in this course.\nThe curriculum is split into a number of sections starting with the introductory section, followed by an explanation of how to interpret the visual knowledge model, through to the elaboration of the various phases of the LCA methodology. These phases are: goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment and life cycle interpretation. The course also sheds light on the approaches that promote improved environmental performance such as eco-design.\nConsequently, this course is targeted at individuals who are aspiring to become product engineers, manufacturing engineers, industrial designers, etc., or any technology or engineering-related field. The course is also aimed at professionals who work in product-oriented functions like supply chain, buying and merchandising, etc., wishing to learn about LCA as a discipline in product development and improvement. The course can also be taken if you work as project manager, change champion, programme manager, etc., but have no prior knowledge of LCA. Additionally, even if you are not a technical individual, you may take this course if, for example, you would like to learn about a great tool to apply in the context of corporate social responsibility, from an environmental standpoint.\nThe bottomline is: if you care about the topics of sustainability and sustainable product engineering, then this is the one course you would not want to miss out on!",

      "description": "Why Security Awareness?\nData breaches are rising, and it's becoming more dangerous to function online. This is where a good security awareness program is essential. Most importantly, we (the nerds) need YOU to help keep things secure.\n\nThat's right. Security is more than an IT or Security department function, and we haven't been as good at communicating that to you in the past.\nYou may hear professionals claim that everyone is getting compromised over simple attacks that have been around for decades. It starts as something easy to prevent and then launches into an intelligence war. \"It's easy to protect yourself,\" some may claim. \"All you need to do is be careful what you download, who you talk to, and what you allow to happen.\" They give off the vibe that people don't care.\nIf you boil everything down to its barest essence, that could be true. Why do we continue to get hammered with news of more breaches if it's so easy?\nUnfortunately, even the best security awareness programs out there are missing one key part.\nThe WHY.\n\n\nMaking Security Awareness Better\nThis security awareness training course will not only give you the \"what\" to look out for but also the \"why\" and how the \"what\" works. After taking this course, you'll be armed with knowledge on better protecting yourself and your organization from threats.\nSurprisingly, the most significant change will probably not be to start doing but rather to stop doing. You'll be surprised at how some of your behavior is super risky, even without realizing it.\nAnd the best part is, I won't twist your arm or shame you into changing. I sincerely want you to succeed, so there's no victim shaming here. I believe there's a better way to modify your behavior than vehemently shove security terms and nerd speak down your throat.\n\n\nThis Security Awareness Course IS:\na security awareness course meaning it's information and awareness based. We will look at the \"what,\" the \"why,\" and some behaviors.\nEssentially a computer and Internet safety training course.\nFor anyone at work who has a security awareness training requirement.\nFor home users who want to learn more about internet security and privacy.\n\n\nThis Security Awareness Course is NOT:\nA technical or operational security guide.\nA technically charged course with jargon that only your IT or Security department would understand.\n\n\nSince this course is NOT technical, beginners ranging from your co-worker that barely knows how to turn a computer on to your Grandma that uses Facebook too much can take and understand this course. We're simply looking at threats, attack vectors, and behaviors to help reduce the sting of attacks.\n\n\nGenuine Reviews From Amazing Students\nThe instructor was knowledgeable and presented security awareness a bit different than I've seen before... - Rob\n...I learned quite a lot of stuff I didn't know. - Julie\nSmall course. Easy to understand for everybody. - Rey\nThe course is well organized and provides helpful tips on how to be aware of and prevent security issues. - Carlson\nMore fun than I expected! - Scot\n\n\nJoin Me Today!\nI appreciate your interest in this security awareness training course. It means a lot to all the other security professionals and me that you care about your online safety.\nIf you're here because your company requires security awareness training and you're considering choosing this course - awesome. Let me know if you have any questions. If you don't have a security program in place, this course will help get you started.\nTo move forward, please click on the Buy Now button on the right side of the page to enroll in this course. I can't wait to see you on the inside, and I look forward to serving you. Thanks!\n\n\nAll the best,\nRoy\n\n\nCOURSE UPDATES\nI believe in continuous improvement in all my courses and products!

All audio files are available for download! <<\nBRAND NEW COURSE LAUNCHED AUGUST 2023. Contains a timed practice test.\nOver 180,000 students bought the TOGAF 9.1 & 9.2 versions of this course. This version has been completely redone and re-recorded, based on the latest changes to the standard.\nIf you look at the job listings, developers and architects with TOGAF experience are in high demand.\nYou can get certified as an enterprise architect with the TOGAF 10.0 certification exam (OGEA-101), and this course will teach you what you need to know!\nIt takes training to become an Enterprise Architect. Much of that comes through on-the-job skills learned working on software projects larger and larger in scope. However, a specific way to design software at an enterprise scale exists.\nThe Open Group has defined a standard for this method for almost 10 years now, and over 400 companies and government agencies have been involved in crafting that standard. It is called TOGAF - The Open Group Architecture Framework.\nThe truth is:\nThis course helps you become certified in the TOGAF 10.0 specification. By learning the Architecture Development Method (ADM), you will become better at designing systems. If you already architect software for a living, learning an official enterprise architecture framework such as this takes you to the next level of your career.\nYou owe it to yourself:\nIf you are a software developer, this is your chance to learn the proper techniques for assessing the requirements of an enterprise and designing the right solutions for today and tomorrow! While software development is a skill any teenager can acquire, and the salaries paid to software developers fall or are frozen, those who know the complex abilities to design large software projects will still be in high demand.\nSpecifically, this course will teach you:\nThe details of the TOGAF 10.0 Foundation exam (OGEA-101), including how to book it, and my experiences taking the exam\nThe basic and core skills of the TOGAF framework\nThe Architecture Development Method (ADM), all of the phases, and the key information to know to pass the exam\nOther topics covered on the exam, including Architecture Governance, Architecture Capacity, Enterprise Continuum, Capability Assessment, and reference frameworks such as TRM and III-RM\nThis course is focused on passing the exam. In-person classes for this same exam costs $2,000 and take 2 days of intensive training. This course aims to bridge the gap between that level of in-person training and self-study.\nIf you've ever tried to read the TOGAF 10.0 specification or even the official study guides for the exam, you will perhaps agree that they are lengthy and hard to understand. The TOGAF 10.0 spec and related study guides are 500 pages long combined. The official study guide is 265 pages. Both are written in the same style that many official specifications are written in - both very precise and extremely lengthy.\nWatching these lectures, doing the quiz questions, and following up with a reading of the relevant section of the specification will cut your self-study time by hours and will give you the confidence to take the exam and get certified at Part 1!\nSo join me:\nJoin over 180,000 students studying for the TOGAF Enterprise Architecture Foundation certification test in one of my Udemy courses! Many have taken and passed the exam after taking this course! I am confident that this course will save you many, many hours of studying time compared with just reading the 500-page spec yourself. If you are in any way not satisfied for any reason, you can get a full refund from Udemy within 30 days. No questions asked. But I am confident you won't need to. I stand behind this course 100% and am committed to helping you pass. You won't get that commitment from a book, or from any other TOGAF class on Udemy.\nI am a TOGAF Certified architect and a member of the Open Group's Architecture Forum - helping to define the standard going forward. I am using the TOGAF 10.0 specification under a commercial license.\nTOGAF is a registered trademark of The Open Group in the United States and other countries. SoftwareArchitect(dot)ca is a member of The Open Group Architecture Forum and holds a current, valid TOGAF Commercial License.\nThank you for signing up for this course on Udemy.

Every click you make online, every email you open, and every file you download could be a potential target for cybercriminals. Whether you're working from home, running a small business, or simply navigating the web, understanding how to protect yourself from online threats has never been more critical. This course is designed to provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to safeguard your data, your devices, and your organization from cyber threats.\nCreated and taught by Yaz, a seasoned cybersecurity expert, this course dives deep into the mind of the attacker, showing you exactly how hackers think, operate, and exploit vulnerabilities. Yaz is not only a certified ethical hacker and penetration tester, but also a cybersecurity architect and consultant for a major multinational cybersecurity firm. This course is built on real-world expertise and experience.\nWhy Take This Course?\nMost cybersecurity awareness courses focus solely on defense, but this course goes one step further. Here, you’ll learn how to protect yourself by first understanding how hackers launch their attacks. Yaz’s philosophy is simple: you can only defend yourself if you know what you’re up against. Through real-life examples, you'll be exposed to the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by cybercriminals to infiltrate systems.\n\n\nImagine knowing exactly how a phishing email is crafted to fool even the savviest employee. Or how attackers bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Understanding these attacks from the attacker's perspective gives you an edge, arming you with the awareness and best practices necessary to protect yourself, your home, and your workplace.\n\n\nWho is This Course For?\nThis course is for anyone who uses the internet – from individuals working from home to employees in large organizations. Whether you're tech-savvy or a complete beginner, this course provides the foundation you need to stay safe online. It’s particularly valuable for:\nHome office workers who manage sensitive data remotely.\nSmall business owners looking to protect their companies from cyber threats.\nCorporate employees wanting to understand how to avoid phishing and social engineering attacks.\nIT professionals interested in how attackers think to improve their defense strategies.\nYaz’s real-world experience and hands-on approach to teaching make this course accessible to all, no matter your background or technical skills.",

      "description": "Businesses today are often caught in the past, using traditional outdated approaches to design their growth strategies. These methods are not suited to the dynamic, fast-paced environment that characterizes markets today.  This course presents a proven framework, the Outthinker Process, that will move you beyond traditional approaches and allow you to see opportunities others ignore, challenge dogma others accept as truth, rally resources others cannot influence, to unleash new strategies that will disrupt your market.\nA Framework for Developing Innovative Growth Strategy in a Dynamic Marketplace\n·       Learn a proven strategic framework\n·      Become a more innovative and disruptive thinker\n·      Build a strategic business plan\n·      Recognize opportunities to grow your business immediately\n·      Develop skills to make you a more desirable employee\nDevelop a strategy for your business that will accelerate growth, generate profit, and lead to success.\nThis course is based on Kaihan Krippendorff’s proven framework and methodology outlined in his most recent book, Outthink the Competition. The business strategy tools presented in this course have been used with more than 300 clients (including Microsoft, VMware, GE, United Technologies, Red Bull, and L’Oreal) to create innovative growth ideas- ideas that increase revenue, profit, and the trajectory of careers.  Blending together first-hand stories of inspiring business and social innovators, from Elon Musk to Noble Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus, years of research and experience as a McKinsey consultant, Kaihan will teach you the skills you need to develop a disruptive idea to use in your business, workplace, or to make yourself more valuable to employers.\nThis course walks you through a thinking process to help you develop disruptive growth ideas. We have already successfully used this process to train people in Microsoft, GE, J&J, VMWare, Red Bull, Marriott, McDonalds, and numerous start-ups and mid-sized growth firms.\nIt works. People who apply the process consistently generate more innovative, disruptive growth ideas. They become known as more innovative and strategic. Their businesses grow 120% faster as a result.\nYou will master a framework for developing innovative growth strategy in a dynamic marketplace:\n·       Learn a proven strategic framework: we call this the Outthinker Process. You will learn key concepts and tools to methodically produce the kinds of ideas that great business innovators like Elon Musk, Sheryl Sandberg, and Richard Branson dream up every day\n·      Become a more innovative and disruptive thinker: as your colleagues and friends start noticing that you are thinking further out of the box strategically, you will become known as the person they turn to for great growth ideas\n·      Build a strategic business plan: you will finish though the course with a clear, concise strategy that you can implement immediately to generate new growth and profit for your company\n·      Recognize opportunities to grow your business immediately: you will begin seeing new opportunities where others see problems and come up with practical ideas you can move on\n·      Develop skills to make you a more desirable employee: research shows the most important indicator of your leadership potential is your ability to think strategically. As your manager and leaders recognize your strategic thinking skills, you will accelerate your career path\nYou will begin the course completing a diagnostic test to measure your Outthinker Score. This will tell you what your level of competitiveness is today.\nYou will then walk through a process – The Outthinker Process – to set your growth and innovation goal, generate many disruptive ways to get there, and then rapidly identify the best strategies to pursue. You will have clarity on a path to get you to a level of performance that right now may seem unattainable.\n94% of people who complete the course report getting a breakthrough idea that could significantly accelerate their success and potentially disrupt their markets.",

All audio files are available for download! <<\nBRAND NEW COURSE LAUNCHED JUNE 2018. Verified up-to-date as of March 2021. Contains a timed practice test.\nOver 28,000 students bought the TOGAF(R) 9.1 version of this course. This version has been completely redone and re-recorded, based on the latest changes to the standard.\nIf you look at the job listings, developers and architects with TOGAF experience are in high demand.\nYou can get certified as an enterprise architect with the TOGAF 9.2 certification exam (OG0-091), and this course will teach you what you need to know!\nIt takes training to become an Enterprise Architect. Much of that comes through on-the-job skills learned working on software projects larger-and-larger in scope. But there is a very specific way to design software at enterprise scale.\nThe Open Group has defined a standard for this method for almost 10 years now, and over 400 companies and government agencies have been involved in crafting that standard. It is called TOGAF - The Open Group Architecture Framework.\nThe truth is:\nThis course helps you become certified in the TOGAF 9.2 specification. Through learning the Architecture Development Method (ADM), you will become better at designing systems. If you already architect software for a living, learning an official enterprise architecture framework such as this takes you to the next level of your career.\nYou owe it to yourself:\nIf you are a software developer, this is your chance to learn the proper techniques for assessing the requirements of an enterprise, and designing the right solutions for today and tomorrow! While software development is skill any teenager can acquire, and the salaries paid to software developers fall or are frozen, it's those who know the complex skills of designing large software projects that will still be in high demand.\nSpecifically, this course will teach you:\nThe details of the TOGAF 9.2 Foundation exam (OG0-091), including how to book it, and my experiences taking the exam\nThe basic and core skills of the TOGAF framework\nThe Architecture Development Method (ADM), all of the phases, and the key information to know to pass the exam\nOther topics covered on the exam, including Architecture Governance, Architecture Capacity, Enterprise Continuum, Capability Assessment, and reference frameworks such as TRM and III-RM\nThis course is focused on passing the exam. In-person classes for this same exam costs $2,000 and take 2 days of intensive training. This course aims to bridge the gap between that level of in-person training, and self-study.\nIf you've ever tried to read the TOGAF 9.2 specification or even the official study guides for the exam, you will perhaps agree that they are lengthy and hard to understand. The TOGAF 9.2 spec is 500 pages long. The official study guide is 265 pages. Both are written in that same style that many official specifications are written in - both very precise and extremely lengthy.\nWatching these lectures, doing the quiz questions, and following up with a reading of the relevant section of the specification will your self-study time by hours, and will give you the confidence to take the exam and get certified at Part 1!\nSo join me:\nJoin over 28,000 students studying for the TOGAF 9 Part 1 certification test in one of my Udemy courses! Many have taken and passed the exam after taking this course! I am confident that this course will save you many, many hours of studying time compared with just reading the 500-page spec yourself. If you are in any way not satisfied, for any reason, you can get a full refund from Udemy within 30 days. No questions asked. But I am confident you won't need to. I stand behind this course 100% and am committed to helping you pass. You won't get that commitment from a book, or from any other TOGAF class on Udemy.\nI am a TOGAF Certified architect, and a member of the Open Group's Architecture Forum - helping to define the standard going forward. I am using the TOGAF 9.2 specification under a commercial license.\nTOGAF is a registered trademark of The Open Group in the United States and other countries.

      "description": "Description\nFrom our personal to our professional lives, corporations to governments, individuals to nations, projects are the new reality. Welcome to the Project Revolution!\n\n\nThe emergence of projects as the economic engine of our times is silent but incredibly disruptive and powerful.\nProjects are timeless and universal. The construction of the pyramids in Egypt, the development of modern cities, the Marshall Plan, the Apollo space programme, the creation of the European Union – all these achievements were the result of ideas being turned into reality through projects. Project-based work is the engine that generates the major accomplishments of our civilization; it has stimulated society to advance and often go beyond long-established scientific and cultural limits.\n\n\nProjects change the world. Projects make impossible dreams possible.\n\n\nThe behavioural and social sciences endorse the idea that there are a few ways of working and collaborating that are particularly motivating and inspiring for people working on a project. These are that a project should have ambitious goals, a higher purpose and a clear deadline. You have probably noticed that what people tend to remember most clearly from their entire careers is the projects they work on – often the successful ones, but also the failed ones.\n\n\nAccording to recent research, the number of individuals working in project-based roles will increase from 66 million (in 2017) to 88 million (forecast 2027). And the value of economic activity worldwide that is project oriented will grow from $12 trillion (in 2013) to $20 trillion (forecast 2027). Those are millions of projects requiring millions of project managers per year.\n\n\nMy prediction is that by 2025, regardless of the industry or sector, senior leaders and managers will spend at least 60% of their time selecting, prioritizing and driving the execution of projects. We will all become project leaders – despite never having been trained to be so!\nHere are some of the areas we will cover in my course:\nUnderstand how the project revolution is dramatically impacting the way organizations sell their products.\nLearn how Philips and Nike will change the way the bring their products to market.\nExplore a framework that can be used by anyone to succeed in projects and turn ideas into reality.\nLearn how strategic thinking is what differentiates great leaders from good leaders.\nOverview of some of the most relevant strategy concepts and definitions of project management.\nLearn the most frequent challenges you may face when trying to think strategically.\nExplore the most agile organizations that are faster to market, implement strategic thinking and good decision making.\nLearn how to close a project, how to bring the project to an end and how to ensure that the benefits are captured.\nAnd much more!",

      "description": "Hi there!\nI've been doing business analysis for more than a decade, and what I've learnt is that the BA skills are in demand in practically any industry or role. The ability to understand a bigger picture, analyse current state and future state, define the best change strategy and make sure the change is executed in a controlled way are the skills that you will need not only as a business analyst, but also as a project manager, a change manager, an operations specialist, an architect or a strategist.\nIt is an introductory course mostly following the structure of the BABOK® Guide. A great way to learn the ropes of the profession and to prepare for an introductory or an intermediate level IIBA® exam.\nThis course will help you build a holistic understanding of business analysis knowledge areas and techniques that you can apply in your work from day one. It is predominantly following the structure of the Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK® Guide) with occasional extra references and materials to better explain specific concepts or provide with a broader picture.\nYou will also get a list of references to books and standards that will help you build better understanding of particular areas of business analysis, and my personal advice on what to focus on to do specific tasks better.\nAs a bonus, you will get a set of CCBA® sample exam questions with detailed explanations of the answers as your course quizzes to test your knowledge before going for a real exam.\nI hope you'll enjoy!\nHave fun.\nIgor.\n===\nThis course is officially endorsed by the International Institute of Business Analysis™ (IIBA®) and qualifies for 21 professional development units for the purposes of certification. That is all you need to become eligible for a CCBA® exam.\n===\nWhat our students say:\n☆☆☆☆☆ \"I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for the outstanding course you have provided on Full Business Analysis Study Guide on Udemy. Your comprehensive explanations, practical examples, and engaging teaching style have greatly helped me understand and apply the concepts in my work. Once again, thank you for your excellent course and your dedication to helping students learn and grow.\" — Kevin Benjamin\n☆☆☆☆☆ \"Good presentation of BABOK contents. I took the course before I read the book, and it really help to understand the book better. Since the book is very long, this course helped me to understand the essential terms first as a preparation for reading the book. Great work! Thank you!\" — Nhung\n☆☆☆☆☆ \"The course has very good content! I personally <like> that each individual topic is not blocked into very long videos and therefore allows me to maintain focus on the topic. I have been performing as a Business Analyst / Product Owner for over 5 years, but have never been trained. Through this course, I was able to validate all the knowledge and skills I have learned over the years, and I was able to correct the flaws I have had as a Business Analyst. I am now 1 step closer to getting my CBAP. Thanks Igor and Analyst's Corner!\" — Lloyd Benjie\n===\nThis course will offer:\nOverview of business analysis knowledge areas and techniques\nExamples and practical explanations of sometimes complicated definitions from the BABOK® Guide and other resources\nReferences to learning materials such as sections of the Guide, complementary standards and books, articles\nA way to systematize your experience and bring it into a common BA method through IIBA® Core Concept Model™ and the BABOK® knowledge areas\nBite-sized videos to keep learning on the go or when you have time\nQuizzes with detailed explanations of the answers to check your knowledge\nA sample set of CCBA® exam questions with detailed explanations of answers to prepare for the exam\nA way to earn a few extra PDUs/CDUs online: this course has been reviewed by IIBA experts and qualifies for 21 development units.\nAn official IIBA Endorsed Education Provider certificate of completion in addition to the standard Udemy certificate.\n===\nThe course is 100% aligned with the Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK® Guide) - the key standard explaining the business analysis profession. Created by the IIBA, it is probably the best and most comprehensive guide into all the knowledge areas, hard and soft skills required to become a successful business analyst.\nIn addition to the Guide, IIBA offers a set of professional certifications for business analysis professionals:\nThe Entry Certificate in Business Analysis™ (ECBA™) which tests foundational knowledge on how to approach business analysis according to the BABOK® Guide\nThe Certification of Capability in Business Analysis™ (CCBA®) which recognises your 2 - 3 years of experience and tests the ability to take on larger and or more complex project responsibilities\nThe Certified Business Analysis Professional™ (CBAP®) which tests your extensive (5+ years) business analysis experience and in-depth knowledge of the profession. The CBAP® recipients are recognised as the leading, senior members of the BA community.\nThis course provides with foundation and advice to prepare for the certifications listed above and has a set of sample exam questions to test your readiness.\nBut more importantly, it will help you become a better business analyst!\n===\nNote: I am an Endorsed Education Provider™ by IIBA®, which means the materials and references to IIBA® and its publications used in this course are licensed for me to do so.

      "description": "This course explains what is Environmental and Social Governance, and why it is vital for businesses to embrace this new perspective in order to achieve better performance. Traditionally, evaluation of businesses focused on financial performance only. But today, organisations and institutions face new and increasingly important environmental and social evolutionary risks that demand adjusting their activities and governance. Businesses must evolve to prepare for a triple bottom line evaluation, where not only financial, but also social and environmental performance matter.\nTo do this, companies and institutions need to go through a process of self evaluation and identify how they can have a positive impact in people and the planet, and what are the social and environmental risks they are exposed to. This exercise will imply modernizing the companies' Governance, and must involve all stakeholders that relate to the company. There is guidance available to do this and the course helps navigating this process.\nAs Investors and Creditors are increasingly concerned with the environmental and social performance of companies, managing ESG risks and having a proper ESG strategy is becoming essential. While Big Corporations are capable of allocating resources (financial and otherwise) to this task, small businesses have bigger constraints in this area. The course provides guidance and inspiration for smaller businesses to navigate the task of managing ESG risks taking into account the small size of operations and limited resources, while preparing them to face the increased scrutiny from bigger clients, banks or investors.",

You might have at your disposal the best technological systems, publishing applications and the related tools for working and editing your content, but without the proper best practices in place, chances are the processes you implement for taking care of the life cycle of your documentation will not be planned and managed adequately, which means that you will be less successful in your operations.\nYou need best practices for several reasons - for example, they allow you to plan the delivery of your documentation in a more rigorous manner, allow you to cut down on costs, have more visibility of your processes and be able to manage your human and technological resources in a better way, among other benefits. The great thing with best practices is that they allow you to implement your systems, processes, and roles within a framework that is future-proof and that you can reconfigure as, and when required.\nThis course is all about these best practices and is an invaluable reference for anyone wishing to take document management to the next level. You will gain awareness of all the fundamental considerations for turning documentation into, not only a corporate-wide function, but also to improve the way you think about the delivery of your documentation at a personal level. Furthermore, while this course is primarily focused on document management, it is by no means limited to that - meaning you will find it really helpful in any environment where building a successful strategy for the delivery of content is required, whether that be finance, legal, engineering, software and many more. So, dive in and unleash the full potential of your content by adopting these best practices in document management!",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\n\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge of management consulting techniques, tools, and frameworks. It is designed for people who want to become management consultants or business analysts or are dealing with performance improvements as well as strategic projects in their firms. In the course you will learn 3 things:\nWhat consulting techniques, tools, and frameworks there are\nWhen to apply each and every one of them\nHow to use them in practice including examples of how to calculate specific things in Excel\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY,  McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nManagement consulting has been very creative and has produced or popularized the application of many tools, techniques, and frameworks that can be used to improve any business. By putting them in one course and explaining them using real-life examples, I wanted to make this knowledge available to students who are considering joining Management Consulting firms as well as managers who simply need to expand their toolbox with a few useful tools.\nThings you will find in this course will improve your awareness and skills in analyzing problems that you will be facing in business as well as in your private life.  Thanks to this course, you will know what tool, technique, or framework to use and how to use it in practice.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to build or to find improvements in any business you should master the techniques presented in this course. That is why, I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or business analysts who have to advise their customers but also to owners, founders of businesses as well as managers and directors.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed and efficiency of your business. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nWhat management consulting tools, techniques, and frameworks are available\nHow to understand business using management consulting tools, techniques, and frameworks\nHow to apply in practice those techniques, tools, and frameworks to optimize the business and make strategic decisions\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is currently divided into 4 sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on production\nBasic tools, techniques, and frameworks used by management consultants. In the second section, I will discuss the main tools that you can use to analyze and understand a business. We will talk about things like issue trees, bottom-up approaches, top-down approaches, backward reasoning, the 80/20 rule, benchmarking, cost drivers, opportunity trees, and many, many more.\nIntermediate tools, techniques, and frameworks used by management consultants. In this section, I will discuss more advanced techniques such as rankings, scenario analysis, representative element analysis, decision tree, OEE, OLE, theory of constraints, Critical Chain, and many, many more.\nAdvanced tools, techniques, and frameworks used by management consultants. In this section, I will discuss further more advanced techniques such as simulation analysis, decomposition analysis, feasibility analysis, and sensitivity analysis.\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nMaster management consulting tools, techniques, and frameworks\nApply the right elements from your management consulting toolbox\nAnalyze fast problems that are killing your business\nFind fast potential improvements in your business\nPrepare you to move on to intermediate-level management consulting training\nCalculate in Excel the impact of your proposals",

To excel in this role, you've got to develop a value-driven mindset to lead teams in a meaningful direction.\nUnfortunately, you will hardly find a well-established environment to deliver value. Misconceptions are the only certainty on your way. Here are some examples:\nRoadmaps limit teams from focusing on value. Instead, the goal is to deliver features respecting the deadline.\nNo matter what you do, it's never enough. Stakeholders always pressure you for more, yet an overarching goal is absent.\nScaling becomes a nightmare: more people, more complexity, and ultimately sub-optimal result.\nIf any of these points annoy you, no worries, I've got you covered.\nAfter years hitting the wall several times, I learned the key aspects you need to thrive on your journey, and I want to share them with you. During this course, you will find answers to overcome the most dreadful challenges in your journey.\nThis course summarizes 10 years of experience into 4 hours. Let me share with you what I wish I knew when I started my career as a Product Owner. At the end of this course, you can expect to learn the following:\nUnderstand the mindset of outstanding Product Owners\nClarity on what not do during your daily activities\nKnow how to craft roadmaps that focus on the outcome instead of output\nDevelop the required leadership skills to excel in your role\nBe able to scale teams successfully\nBecome a strategic and tactical Product Owner\nThis course is for you who is a Product Owner or a Product Manager who wants to strengthen your skillset and knowledge to become an outstanding professional.

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nNo matter what you do at some point you will be fed up with your boss, your work, and corporate life. Most likely you will start thinking about having your own business - something that you can put your effort into and make great as well as profitable. Maybe, a small restaurant? Maybe, a startup?  If you are working in professional services one of the options you should seriously consider is to start and run a consulting firm. It can be a very profitable business and help you build other businesses on top of that, especially technological startups.\nIn this course, I will show you how to start and run a consulting company fast and efficiently.\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as the owner of a small consulting company (the last 7 years). I have been also a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from the Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. Thanks to my versatile experience I know the subject from all sides including the customers of consulting firms.\nI have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. Based on what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COOs, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 275 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nI do not like to overcomplicate things so in every lecture I will be quite straightforward. Most lectures will have also a lot of additional resources: templates, examples, procedures, list of tools. The idea is that you have everything that you need to start and run a consulting business in one place. If you don’t find something that you need let me know - I will try to prepare something and I will add it to the course.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nFor our teams, we have created courses that help us improve the consultant onboarding and the teaching process. We have started to use them extensively also with customers that we work with and their teams. Since we made them available to a wider public we got many requests, especially on Quora, on how to run a consulting business. We try to minimize repetitive work so we decided to take this course in order to cut down on the questions we are getting.\nThis course is based on our extensive experience in working and running consulting companies. In many cases, we use also a lot of clever solutions from other service companies that we helped set up and improve.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of, tricks, hints, and examples that will significantly speed up your process of starting the company and afterward scaling to a sensible size. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. We intend that thanks to the course you will know:\nWhere to find ideas for consulting business, consulting firm?\nHow to analyze in Excel whether the business makes sense or not?\nHow to get the first customers?\nWhat to concentrate on if you are a 1-man show, a freelancer?\nWhat kind of tools you should have?\nHow and in what way you can set up pricing for your services?\nHow to prepare for scaling, and expanding?\nWhat kind of business you can build based on a consulting firm?\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course  and consulting\nWhere you can get ideas for your consulting businesses. In the second section, we show where you can find ideas on how you can build a consulting business.\nThe business model of a service company.

We start with a general service company and show how to put it in Excel, and how to draw conclusions from this.\n1-man show. The next section will show you what you should concentrate on if you are running a 1-man show, you are forced to be a jack of all trades. This is also very good for freelancers and coaches.\nGetting first customers. In the fifth section, you will learn how to sell your services, where you can get the first customers for your consulting services. For the time being, we show 8 ways but we will constantly update with new ideas\nTools you need in a consulting company. To be successful in consulting you need a lot of tools created in a proper manner. We will show you what you should use and in what way to be successful in your business\nPricing. One of the most important things in the consulting business is pricing. I will show you how you can set your price, what should be your pricing positioning and how you calculate the price and margins of a specific project. We will talk also about dynamic pricing and how to sell cheap projects to your customers with high margins for you\nManaging a consulting company. We have a separate section on the organization of the consulting company.

      "description": "BRAND NEW COURSE LAUNCHED APRIL 2020. Updated September 2022!\nOver 28,000 students bought the TOGAF® 9.1 version of this course. This version has been completely redone and re-recorded, based on the latest changes to the standard.\nIf you look at the job listings, developers and architects with TOGAF experience are in high demand.\nYou can get certified as an enterprise architect with the TOGAF 9.2 certification exam (OG0-092), and this course will teach you what you need to know!\nIt takes training to become an Enterprise Architect. Much of that comes through on-the-job skills learned while working on software projects of larger-and-larger in scope. But very definitely there is a very specific way to design software at an enterprise scale.\nThe Open Group has defined a standard for this method for almost 10 years now, and over 400 companies and government agencies have been involved in crafting that standard. It is called TOGAF - The Open Group Architecture Framework.\nThe truth is:\nThis course helps you become certified in the TOGAF 9.2 specification. Through learning the Architecture Development Method (ADM), you will become better at designing systems. If you already architect software for a living, learning an official enterprise architecture framework such as this takes you to the next level of your career.\nYou owe it to yourself:\nIf you are a software developer, this is your chance to learn the proper techniques for assessing the requirements of an enterprise, and designing the right solutions for today and tomorrow! While software development is skill any teenager can acquire, and the salaries paid to software developers fall or are frozen, it's those who know the complex skills of designing large software projects that will still be in high demand.\nSpecifically, this course will teach you:\nThe details of the TOGAF 9.2 Foundation exam (OG0-091), including how to book it, and my experiences taking the exam\nThe basic and core skills of the TOGAF framework\nThe Architecture Development Method (ADM), all of the phases, and the key information to know to pass the exam\nOther topics covered on the exam, including Architecture Governance, Architecture Capacity, Enterprise Continuum, Capability Assessment and reference frameworks such as TRM and III-RM\nThis course is focused on passing the exam. In-person classes for this same exam costs $2,000 and take 2 days of intensive training. This course aims to bridge the gap between that level of in-person training, and self-study.\nIf you've ever tried to read the TOGAF 9.2 specification or even the official study guides for the exam, you will perhaps agree that they are lengthy and hard to understand. The TOGAF 9.2 spec is 500 pages long. The official study guide is 265 pages. Both are written in that same style that many official specifications are written in - both very precise and extremely lengthy.\nWatching these lectures, doing the quiz questions, and following up with a reading of the relevant section of the specification will save hours off of your self-study time, and will give you the confidence to take the exam and get certified at Part 1!\nSo join me:\nJoin over 28,000 students studying for the TOGAF 9 Part 1 certification test in one of my Udemy courses! Many have taken and passed the exam after taking this course! I am confident that this course will save you many, many hours of studying time compared with just reading the 500-page spec yourself. If you are in any way not satisfied, for any reason, you can get a full refund from Udemy within 30 days. No questions asked. But I am confident you won't need to. I stand behind this course 100% and am committed to helping you pass. You won't get that commitment from a book, or from any other TOGAF class on Udemy.\nI am a TOGAF Certified architect, and a member of the Open Group's Architecture Forum - helping to define the standard going forward. I am using the TOGAF 9.2 specification under a commercial license.\nTOGAF is a registered trademark of The Open Group in the United States and other countries. SoftwareArchitect(dot)ca is a member of The Open Group Architecture Forum and holds a current, valid TOGAF® Commercial License.\nThank you for signing up for this course on Udemy. The course will always be up-to-date here and nowhere else.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nStrategy is one of the most dreaded subjects in any business. There are so many conflicting frameworks that is difficult to decide what to choose. In this course, you will learn a framework that will help you formulate and execute the strategy for your businesses on the level of top consulting firms i.e. McKinsey, BCG, Bain, PwC, and EY. You will also see how others are implementing their strategic choices.\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in creating as well as executing a strategy for your business (or your customers’ businesses). It is designed for people who want to become management consultants, business analysts, or work on creating and implementing the strategy inside the business. In the course you will learn 3 main things:\nWhat strategic choices do you have and how to choose the optimal one?\nHow to calculate the impact of the chosen strategy or tactic?\nHow to implement the strategy and how others are doing it?\nThe course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest companies in the Retail, FMCG, SMG, and B2B sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvements and strategic projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On many occasions, I had to not only formulate the strategy but also make sure that it was implemented. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are CEOs, Board Members, Operational  Directors, COOs, Investment Directors, Directors in Consulting Firms, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through cases so most of the lectures are case studies showing some business problems solved in Excel. In this way, you get a lot of practical insight into how to calculate the impact of strategic changes or how to decide which strategic option is useful. These skills will come in handy during consulting projects. To every lecture, you will find attached  (in additional resources) the Excel files shown in the lecture, so as part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nMost consultants and business analysts are a bit lost during strategic projects. On one hand, you have a business you don’t quite understand as it is new to you. On the other hand, you have a multitude of frameworks that are conflicting with each other and quite often not practical enough. To make matters worse the customer - the business you are working for has problems understanding what you are trying to convey with your thick presentations and thousands of Excel files.\nTherefore, I have gathered all my experience into one framework that is easy to follow not only for you but also for your customers. I believe in the power of data. That is why, I will show you also how to prove, using hard data and calculation in Excel, that a certain strategic choice is good or bad.  In order to make certain strategies easier to understand I have also added plenty of examples of businesses using specific strategies.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to find a way to grow a business you have to become an expert in formulating and executing a proper strategy for this business.  This course has all the materials you need to become one. That is why, I highly recommend this course not only to consultants or business analysts that have to advise their customers but also to owners, founders of businesses as well as board members.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of examples, analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you formulate a strategy. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nWhat strategic choices do you have and how to choose the optimal one?\nHow to calculate the impact of the chosen strategy or tactic?\nHow to implement the strategy and how others are doing it?\nWhat are the consequences of a specific strategic choice for your business?\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on production\nDo what you do but better. In the second section, I will discuss the basic things you can do to improve its profitability without much growth or expansion. This strategic direction is the best for people who are satisfied with the current size of their business\nExpand your business. In this section, I will show you different ways in which you can grow your business or your customers’ businesses in size. This strategic choice is perfect for those businesses that have a winning business model and a lot of room to grow. As always there will be loads of case studies, practical knowledge of how to do in practice the necessary calculations in Excels\nGo niche. In the 4th section, I will show you how you can protect your business by going into a niche. I will devote a lot of time to the Blue Ocean Strategy and Low-Cost Strategy – 2 very powerful strategic concepts that have been disrupting many markets\nTransform. In the 5th section, I will show you how you can transform your business from your current vulnerable position into a better place with better margins and more room to grow.\nDisrupt Yourself. In this section, I will show you the last strategic option you may consider. Here you decide to look for ways to disrupt yourself before somebody else does it.  I will discuss ways in which you can do it and I will show you plenty of examples of successful execution of this strategy\n\n\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nHow to formulate a successful business strategy\nPick the right strategy for your business\nHow to crunch data in Excel\nEstimate the impact of the strategic option you have chosen\nIncrease the value of your business or the businesses that belong to your customers\nHow to structure complex issues\nHow to define key steps needed to achieve the selected strategy\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness Analysts\nSmall and medium business owners\nStartups founders\nControllers\nEnjoy the course and if you have any questions or requests just let me know",

It is the ability to change, to create the process, the organization, the capabilities and culture, that result in performance. This course is a roadmap that will enable you to successfully execute strategy.\n\n\n\"Engaging and enlightening. Larry's wealth of experience allows you to easily apply the subject matter to the real world.\" Neil Shaw\nNote: Now included is the complete ebook Getting to Lean - Transformational Change Management. It is attached to lecture 4.\nBusiness Strategy Execution is a hot topic in management today. The Conference Board's recent Survey of CEOs revealed that chief executives are so concerned about strategy execution that they rated it as both their number one and number two most challenging issue.\nWhy does strategy execution so often fail? Because most strategic plans are little more than a series of vertically integrated objectives. But, the problem is not objectives and it is not vertical. It is the \"whole-system\" and its ability to adapt and align, internally and externally in fast cycles. In other words, to be agile. The problem is the culture and capabilities of the organization and a process to design and deploy those capabilities. This course provides that process and is based on forty years of experience improving the performance of organizations.\nThe problem is developing new capabilities and a new culture that will enable the organization to achieve its goals. The term \"Agile\" implies an iterative process of experimentation, learning, adaptation to the changing environment, and alignment with other business units and support groups. This course is about creating that agility, adaptation and alignment.\nEvery organization has capabilities that are embedded in the culture. This course will take the leader through a process of assessing the current culture, its assets and liabilities, sensing the changing landscape that presents threats and opportunities, and then engaging the organization in the design of those processes and systems that will represent competitive advantage.\n\nThe author of this course is the author of ten books on leadership, lean management and change process. This course includes the text and material from three of his books.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nTime and again you will come across problems that are seemingly unsolvable. In many cases, you don’t even know how to approach them. Luckily, there are a lot of nice management consulting tools, techniques, and frameworks that will help you solve everyday problems. You don’t have to go to a top consulting firm to master them. You can master them by taking my course.\nThis course will help you drastically improve your skills in solving problems using management consulting tools, techniques, and frameworks. In this course, we will mainly concentrate on solving real-life problems like goal setting and defining what and when to do, estimating the cost of a wedding, losing weight and getting in shape, deciding whether to do an MBA or not, choosing the right boyfriend/girlfriend, deciding whether you should buy a car or not, deciding when to retire and many more. If you have a specific problem just let me know and I will give you tips on how to solve it using the tools presented in this course.\nThe course is designed for people who want to become more data-driven and less emotional in the way they solve problems and make decisions.

In the course you will learn 3 things:\nWhat consulting techniques, tools, and frameworks there are\nWhen to apply each and every one of them\nHow to use them in practice including examples of how to calculate specific things in Excel\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion of additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy did I decide to create this course?\nManagement consulting has been very creative and has produced or popularized the application of many tools, techniques, and frameworks that can be used to improve not only your business but also your private life. By putting those tools and techniques in one course and explaining them using real-life examples related to everyday life, I wanted to make this knowledge available to everybody who wants to make better decisions, especially students who are considering joining Management Consulting firms as well as managers that simply need to expand their toolbox with few useful tools.\nThings you will find in this course will improve your awareness and skills in analyzing problems that you will be facing in your private life as well as in business.

Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nWhat management consulting tools, techniques, and frameworks are available\nHow to use them in practice to solve problems and make better decisions\nHow to make decisions and solve problems using available information/data\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly on Udemy.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided into the find the following sections:\nIntroduction.

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nOne of the projects you will participate in during your work in management consulting is the Performance Improvement Project. You will be hired by the owner or the Board of Directors to improve the business. Those projects are extremely interesting because you will be able to make a real change, create a new reality, and improve part of the business or even the whole business. They are also very difficult as you have to not only analyze areas but also find ways to improve the current situation as well as, on some occasions, implement the change. The skills that you will learn during this sort of project will be also very useful once you move to work for regular businesses or set up your own firm. In this course, I will show you how to deliver such projects fast and efficiently. In the course you will learn the following things:\nHow to conduct performance improvement projects\nHow to estimate in Excel savings and improvements\nWhere to look for performance improvements in FMCG and Retail\nWhat frameworks can be used during performance improvement projects\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through cases, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, tools, and end-products of Performance Improvement Projects. To make the course more realistic and applicable we will go over a simplified overall case for performance improvement as well as through a number of typical analyses from Retail and FMCG. I will also show you the frameworks you should use during Performance Improvement Projects to conduct this sort of project fast and efficiently.  To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lecture so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nPerformance Improvement Projects differ greatly from other consulting projects. You have to not only analyze and come up with bright ideas but you quite often also have to implement them. Many Business Analysts and Management Consultants lack the frameworks as well as the fluency in analyzing the right thing fast to deliver the results the customers expect. This course will help you become an expert in the field of performance improvement which will be extremely useful not only in consulting but also later on when you become a director or you move on to build your own business. By giving you exposure to real-life cases and analyses I want to improve your skills in analyzing the right things fast and implementing the improvements that you have identified.  Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do during a Performance Improvement Project to deliver ahead of deadlines high-quality products.\nTo sum it up, the course will help you become an expert in Performance Improvement on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, PwC, Deloitte, EY, and other top consulting firms. That is why, I highly recommend this course not only to Consultants or Business Analysts who have to advise their customers but also to Investment Directors working for PE, Directors as well as owners/founders of businesses that need better to improve their profitability and prepare for scaling.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze the business considered for acquisition. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nHow to conduct performance improvement projects\nHow to estimate in Excel savings and improvements\nWhere to look for performance improvements in FMCG and Retail.\nWhat frameworks can be used during performance improvement projects\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nHow to conduct Performance Improvement Projects. In the second section, I will show you how such projects should be carried out to ensure that you deliver value to the customer quickly and efficiently\nA Case Study in Performance Improvement. In this section, you will be asked to solve a case study on performance improvement. I will also show you the solution and the analyses in Excel. This section will give you a flavor of how the Performance Improvement Projects look like\nPerformance Improvement Projects in Retail. In the 4th section, I show you what kind of frameworks you should use during performance improvement projects in Retail. You will also go through a number of real-life analyses from Performance Improvement Projects in Retail.\nPerformance Improvement Projects in FMCG. In the 5th section, I show you what kind of frameworks you should use during performance improvement projects in FMCG. You will also go through a number of real-life analyses from Performance Improvement Projects in FMCG.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nUseful frameworks and techniques\nList of resources useful during performance improvement projects\nSelected analyses shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations, articles, and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nConduct Performance Improvement Projects\nApply the right frameworks and techniques from your management consulting toolbox\nFind potential improvements in Retail and FMCG\nAnalyze in Excel potential improvements in Retail, and FMCG on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain\nManage efficiently a consulting project devoted to performance improvement\nFind ways to improve the business you manage\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nBusiness Analysts\nManagement Consultants\nDirectors\nInvestment Analysts\nOwners and founders\nFinancial Controllers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

More importantly, ratio analysis empowers us to project future performance and gain insights into an organization's potential trajectory.\nThroughout the course, we will delve into these concepts through a series of practice problems, utilizing Microsoft Excel for practical application. Each problem will be accompanied by a downloadable worksheet with step-by-step instructional videos. You will have access to preformatted Excel worksheets, including answer keys, to work through the problems in a structured manner and reinforce your learning.\nBy the end of the course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of ratio analysis and the renowned DuPont System of analysis. You will be able to apply key ratios, including return on investment (ROI), return on assets, total asset turnover, and profit margin calculations, to various scenarios. Additionally, you will grasp the significance of return on equity, debt-to-equity ratios, accounts receivable collection periods, times interest earned, fixed charge coverage, and return on equity trend analysis in assessing financial performance.\nFurthermore, we will explore how ratio analysis can be used to compare different divisions within an organization, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making. Lastly, you will learn to project future performance by constructing a projected income statement and balance sheet using ratio analysis techniques.\nJoin us on this dynamic journey to master ratio analysis in corporate finance.

      "description": "Winning sustainability strategies are incredibly important to companies.\nStakeholders increasingly consider companies' contribution to sustainable development when making decisions. Aligning ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) practices with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) provides a clear narrative for investors and other stakeholders, demonstrating organizational commitment to addressing global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, depletion of natural resources, poverty and social inequality, etc. and creating positive societal impact. Businesses aligning their strategies with the SDGs have a clear roadmap to address key global challenges, ensuring their actions contribute to broader societal and environmental goals.\nDeveloping winning strategies in Corporate Sustainability and ESG involves a holistic approach that integrates ethical, social, and environmental considerations into business practices. Embedding the SDGs into purpose-driven organizations and ESG practices is essential for creating a positive impact, mitigating risks, fostering stakeholder engagement, and building a sustainable and resilient business model for a better future. By aligning with SDGs, companies can identify areas where innovation is most needed and create business models that address specific challenges and value creation.\nThe circular economy is integral to ESG considerations, value creation, and sustainable development by addressing environmental concerns, improving resource efficiency, fostering innovation, positively impacting social and governance aspects and transforming into resilient businesses. Embracing circular economy principles can position businesses as responsible, resilient, and forward-thinking contributors to a sustainable future.\nBy implementing these strategies, organizations can not only enhance their ESG performance but also create sustainable value for all stakeholders, fostering resilience and relevance in a rapidly evolving business landscape. Companies committed to sustainable development often enjoy a positive reputation and increased brand value. Consumers, investors, and other stakeholders are increasingly prioritizing ethical and sustainable practices, making them key drivers for attracting and retaining customers and investors.\nBusinesses must understand key risks and opportunities for long-term value creation.\nThe climate crisis is a huge business risk in this century. Climate change and environmental degradation are turning into a real operational challenge for many business organizations, from changing harvest periods and seasons that disrupt the operation of factories and production units, which results in shortages of products in the market. These disruptions affect the vulnerability of communities and a high risk of physical loss and damage. It may seriously interrupt supply chains to meet the demand in the market.\nTransforming current businesses into resilient business models that address materiality issues and specific challenges are the greatest opportunities for long-term value creation. Integrating SDGs into core business strategies and ESG programs in business organizations enhances value creation in multiple ways. The SDGs provide a valuable framework for businesses to guide and measure their ESG practices, ultimately contributing to sustainable development and long-term value creation. Aligning ESG initiatives with specific SDGs helps businesses articulate their impact, manage risks, and position themselves as responsible contributors to global well-being.\nMateriality analysis, stakeholder analysis, and stakeholder engagement are integral processes for purpose-driven organizations seeking to embed the SDGs. These processes ensure that sustainability efforts are strategically focused, aligned with stakeholder expectations, and implemented in a transparent and inclusive manner, aiming to contribute to sustainable development. Sustainable business model innovation is instrumental in implementing the SDGs in businesses. It provides a practical pathway for companies to contribute to global goals, address challenges, and create positive impacts on society, the environment, and the economy.\nWhat skills do you need to develop winning strategies in Corporate Sustainability and ESG?\nA combination of skills, knowledge, and commitment is required to develop winning strategies in corporate sustainability for long-term value creation. Creativity, imagination, and problem-solving skills are driving forces to transform business organizations for long-term success. The following competencies are critical. A deep understanding of sustainability and ESG principles and how they apply to business operations, capability to identify industry-specific sustainability challenges and opportunities, strong analytical skills to assess and interpret sustainability data, metrics, and key performance indicators, identify and assess sustainability risks (including specific ESG risks) and integrate them into overall risk management strategies, effective relationships with diverse stakeholders, materiality assessments to identify and prioritize the most relevant ESG issues, strategic thinking with a focus on long-term value creation, develop methodologies for measuring the impact and foster a culture of innovation to find sustainable solutions. This course will enable you to develop your skills and expand your knowledge horizon in the above areas. You will be able to upskill your capability in sustainability relevance analysis, develop strategic measures in business risk management, stakeholder engagement, sustainable business modelling, strategic thinking, and measuring impact to lead your organization.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nDuring many consulting projects, you may be asked to forecast the sales of the firm or check sales forecast models done by the customer. Sales forecasting requires a specific approach to data and also a lot of creativity, thinking outside the box, to address the issue of insufficient data and the changing environment. In this course, I will teach you how to do fast and efficiently basic sales forecast models in Excel. We will create relatively simple sales forecasts. Nevertheless, they will significantly help your customer define strategy, and decide whether he should open a new factory, enter a new field, or buy a business. We will NOT get into complicated models, or forecasts as in most cases you will have neither time nor data to do them. It would also require a wider knowledge of mathematics, statistics, econometrics, and the usage of more advanced tools than Excel. The things you will learn in this course will be sufficient in 70% of the cases and can be done with the knowledge of basic Math. Such basic sales forecasts are especially important during Strategy projects, M&A projects, and business development projects. In such projects, you want to get fast rough sales forecasts using simple methods. A similar approach as we will show in this course can be used as the starting point for budgeting models.\nIn the course, you will learn the following things:\nThe essential concepts in sales forecasting and the main tools that you may need.\nHow to forecast sales in Excel using simple methods fast and efficiently\nWhat drivers of sales you should take into account for selected industries?\nWe will look at different case studies to see how you can move from drivers to a working model in Excel\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in McKinsey, EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. For every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures. Therefore, as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nMost management consultants avoid the topic of sales forecasting due to insufficient knowledge of mathematics, probability, and statistics. To make advanced models you need those things. However, in most cases, a simple approach using Excel can produce pretty good results. For that, you don’t have to spend 5 years studying math.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students understand or refresh the main skills and tools that they need during consulting projects to do basic sales forecasting. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do during the consulting project, when you will be asked to forecast sales. You will see how to identify what drivers are important in specific businesses and how to use them to build simple models in Excel.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of how to do essential sales forecasting. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants and Business Analysts, especially those that did not finish, mathematics and econometrics. The course will help you become pretty good at doing simple sales forecasting models in Excel on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nThe essential concepts in sales forecasting and the main tools that you may need.\nHow to forecast sales in Excel using simple methods fast and efficiently\nWhat drivers of sales you should take into account for selected industries\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into 3 sections. Currently, you will find the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nBasics of Sales Forecasting. In sales forecasting, you can use different approaches. We will discuss them in this section and I will give you some tips on which one you should use in a specific situation.\nUseful Tools for Sales Forecasting. In sales forecasting, you can use different tools. We will discuss them in this section. We will talk about disaggregation, simulations, sensitivity analysis, and random variables. We will, later on, need those concepts to solve case studies\nCase Studies in Sales Forecasting. Finally, in the 4th section, we will move to case studies devoted to specific industries. We will look at 6 case studies and I will show you how to move from general drivers for the business to a model in Excel that you can use\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\n1. Useful frameworks and techniques\n2. Analyses shown in the course\n3. Additional resources\n4. Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies\n5. Links to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nIdentify the main drivers for a specific business\nTranslate the drivers into basic sales forecast models\nCreate the sales forecast models in Excel\nCreate simple simulations & sensitivity analysis\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants and Business Analysts\nFinancial Controllers\nInvestment Analysts\nStartup Founders\nProject Managers\nManagers responsible for Acquisitions and Mergers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics\nBasic or intermediate knowledge of finance & accounting",
