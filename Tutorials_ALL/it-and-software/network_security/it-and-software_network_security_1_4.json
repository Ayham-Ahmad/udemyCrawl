Tabletops are also a great way to review plans and procedures and doing so before an incident occurs allows businesses to detect any issues or gaps in plans. Reviewing ahead of time also permits businesses to identify the resources necessary to work through business disruption. Not to mention, tabletops are an opportunity for leaders to practice their incident management leadership skills in a controlled environment.  This course will go over some recent cyber incidents that have occurred to give you real-life examples of the tactics that malicious actors are using.  Then will go into a couple of exercises to see how your organization would stack up, with levels so that your organization can make improvements to your plans and come back and see if you can tackle the next level.  Detecting a cyber incident before it happens can save your organization a lot of headaches, so it's important to know your plans stand up to possible real-life events.  You want to make sure your teams and communications are in place, to make sure that even when a cyber incident does occur, that you know who to contact and what is needed to remediate it quickly.",

This will help you start with search and reporting.Also help you do understand the basics about the fields. You can create complex search queries by following the best practise.\nBy default, Splunk Enterprise provides the Search and Reporting app. This interface provides the core functionality of Splunk Enterprise. The Splunk Home page provides a view to the app when you first log into Splunk Web.\n\n\nIt has default app as search and reporting by which you interact with the data, and create reports, alerts, Dashboard etc.\nLog processing is one of the core competencies of Splunk. It stores all your logs and provides very fast search capabilities roughly in the same way Google does for the internet device log files.\nThe Search Processing Language (SPL) for Splunk is an extremely powerful tool for extracting meaning out of vast amounts of data and performing statistical operations on what is relevant in a specific context.\nSplunk indexes any kind of machine data that can be represented as text and there is no need to define tables and fields before you can store data. Splunk does not have a fixed schema. In fact, it performs field extraction at search time. This aspect allows for great flexibility.\nIt does not reduce the granularity of older events, compressing many data points into one because of capacity limits. It can seamlessly index hundreds of terabytes per day and keep practically unlimited amounts of data.\nSplunk dashboards allow you to monitor all of your systems at once, so when a problem occurs you can start looking for a solution even before the problem starts bothering the system, or even better, its dashboard allows to clearly look for signs of a possibly arising problem.",

Many Data Centers are using MikroTik switches in their environment and have a very high uptime for their customers.\nSince RouterOS v7, MikroTik has included a new feature on its switches which is MLAG (Multi-Chassing Link Aggregation Group). This feature is very much used in Switching data center environment allowing 2 or more switches to be seen as a virtual 1 switch. This would help that in case one of the switch goes down, then the network remains connected because the traffic will move to the 2nd switch. MLAG is a feature that is well known for many engineers working on Data Centers, and fortunately it is now available on MikroTik Switching environment using RouterOS v7,\n\n\nIn this course, I will be running same setup as it is run on Data Centers. I will surely have to explain 1st about what MLAG is all about in details, then I will start doing the configuration. I will be using VLANS as well because all Data Centers run VLANS. The MLAG will be configured on 2 MikroTik CRS3xx series switches, and at the end we are going to make a test to check if the failover happens in case one of the switches go offline.\n\n\nThe course will be based on LABS, and you are required to have at least 2 MikroTik CRS3xx switches and other 2 routerboards to be able to follow the LABS.\nIt is highly recommended for any students to repeat the LABS at home so at the end he can understand how to configure MLAG on MikroTik Switches.\n\n\nFinally, if you wish to understand all about MLAG on MikroTik Switching, I advise to enroll in this course and I will go with you step by step to make this mission happens.",

      "description": "Do you want to quickly build web applications that are highly scalable and secure by design? Are you keen on using your existing Python skills for web development instead of learning a completely new language?\n\nThis carefully structured course combines text, video and assessment content. It focuses on Python, starting out with core coverage of the Django framework. You'll learn how to build web applications from the ground up, in a responsible and scalable way. The latter sections then detail how you can take your web application and run it through a suite of comprehensive tests that prepare it for real-world security threats and exploits.\nBy taking this course you will not just learn about web development with Python. You'll understand how to build web applications properly, in a manner that lets you test and improve them responsibly to a professional standard.\nWhy should I choose this course?\n\nWe've spent the last decade working to help developers stay relevant. The structure of this course is a result of deep and intensive research into what real-world developers need to know in order to be job-ready. We don't spend too long on theory, and focus on practical results so that you can see for yourself how things work in action.\nWhat details do you cover?\n\nThis course makes use of Django, which is one of the world's leading web development frameworks. As it sits within the Python ecosystem, it makes your application development experience extremely easy to approach without compromising on efficiency.\nWe start off by learning about class-based views, so that you can start building pages that respond to specific requests and URL structures. We’ll then dive into creating custom middleware, which will help us reuse code, resulting in a more complete introductory web application.\nHave you ever wanted to build a complete REST API? Our next step is to do just that. Starting out with basic read-only functionality, we'll also add key-based authentication so that we can properly implement a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) feature set.\nThe latter part of the course will start with an overview of the web application penetration testing methodology. We also dive into the suite of tools used by real-world professionals so that you can start compiling your very own toolkit.\nWe don't just cover the background to penetration testing. We'll show you how to intercept HTTP techniques and interact  directly with web applications using Python and the requests library. We'll also show you several web crawling techniques, on top of highly sought after SQL injection methods. You'll also lean how to write and develop your own custom tooling and reference scripts to save you time, just like the professionals.\nBy the time you reach the end, you'll have gone through the entire process of building and validating web applications with Django and Python. We've complied this into one easy reference that reflects the working habits of actual penetration testers to deliver the most accurate learning experience as possible.\nWe combine the best of the following Packt products:\nMastering Django Web Development by Kevin Veroneau and Matthew Nuzum\nPython Web Penetration Testing Cookbook by Cameron Buchanan et al.\nLearning Python Web Penetration Testing by Christian Martorella\nTestimonials:\nThe source content have been received well by the audience. Here are a couple of reviews:\n\"Excellent videos with real case scenarios and code examples. Good explanations (e. g. how to find SQL code injection gaps).\"\n\n- Anonymous Customer.\n\"I loved the books and learnt new skills.\"\n\n- Jatandar\nMeet your expert instructors:\n\nChristian Martorella has been working in security testing for more than 10 years.

We will write Python deobfuscation scripts, embed assembly algorithms into C++ libraries, analyse steganography tricks and encryption flaws and many many more.\nThe course is very practical and exercises have been designed and tested for an updated Windows 8.1 operating system. There are no pre-requisites for this class other that a Windows virtual machine and the will to learn. All the 3rd party tools discussed are freely available online. Familiarity with Python and C/C++ is beneficial because these two are heavily used throughout the modules.\nAssessments:\nTo get the most out of this course, I recommend doing all the assignments.\nAll the 6 practical assignments can be solved using information from the course.\nThere are no solutions provided, because I believe we learn best by doing.\nI'm asking each student to send in their solutions to all the exercises at the end of the course.\nIf you stumble or have any questions, I'm more than happy to help anytime. Reach out directly or via the Q&A section.\nFeel free to discuss the assignments with other students in the Q&A section, but please don't post the solutions or answers online.",

This leaves a critical gap between basic tool familiarity and the deep operational mastery required for real-world engagements.\nSolo Purple Teaming closes that gap. It trains you to think and operate as both an attacker and a defender, where your limits aren’t dictated by step-by-step lab manuals, but by your creativity, problem-solving skills, and willingness to push beyond your comfort zone and explore new tactics.\nThe course is built around four focused phases designed to level up your skills: Layout, Engage, Explore, and Trace.\nIn Layout, you prepare like a professional operator—balancing maximum effectiveness with strict operational security. From initial reconnaissance to privilege escalation, you’ll learn to bypass defenses such as Windows Defender, AMSI, and others, setting the stage for success.\nIn Engage, you execute your attack path with precision—moving carefully through the network, maintaining stealth, and accomplishing your objectives.\nIn Explore, you switch to the defender’s mindset—identifying telemetry gaps, spotting blind spots, and uncovering detection opportunities others might miss.\nIn Trace, you reverse engineer payloads, analyze attack mechanics, and craft high-fidelity detections designed to withstand sophisticated evasion attempts.\nThis advanced and demanding course is intentionally built to foster independence and true mastery. If you’re ready to sharpen both your red and blue skills, Solo Purple Teaming is the course for you!",

      "description": "CTF is no longer merely a pastime for hackers—it is evolving into a unique blend of cutting-edge cyber education, national defense strategies, and futuristic gaming.\n\n\nThe First Question will be what is The \"Capture the flag (CTF)\"?\nCapture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and mixed.\n\n\nJeopardy-style CTFs has a couple of questions (tasks) in range of categories. For example, Web, Forensic, Crypto, Binary or something else. Team can gain some points for every solved task. More points for more complicated tasks usually. The next task in chain can be opened only after some team solve previous task. Then the game time is over sum of points shows you a CTF winer. Famous example of such CTF is Defcon CTF quals.\n\n\nAttack-defence is another interesting kind of competitions. Here every team has own network(or only one host) with vulnarable services. Your team has time for patching your services and developing exploits usually. So, then organizers connects participants of competition and the wargame starts! You should protect own services for defence points and hack opponents for attack points. Historically this is a first type of CTFs, everybody knows about DEF CON CTF - something like a World Cup of all other competitions.\n\n\nMixed competitions may vary possible formats. It may be something like wargame with special time for task-based elements (e.g. UCSB iCTF).\n\n\nCTF games often touch on many other aspects of information security: cryptography, stego, binary analysis, reverse engeneering, mobile security and others. Good teams generally have strong skills and experience in all these issues.\n\n\nA truly grand and universal event\nDEF CON CTF\nEuropean Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC)\nInternational Cybersecurity Challenge\n\n\nAt present, numerous organizations (such as Google, HackerOne, BugCrowd, Palo Alto) recognize CTF performance as a criterion for employment. These competitions reveal a skilled individual's problem-solving abilities, logical thinking, and cybersecurity mindset.\n\n\n\n\nSo, If you want to Plag games with earn skills then join today & in a year you can make a carrear as a Ethical Hacker or cyber Security reachercher",

      "description": "Welcome to AWS Networking with Virtual Private Cloud for beginners. If you are new to computer networking and want to build solutions in AWS that involve networking, then this course is for you. You don’t need any prior knowledge in networking or AWS to follow this course.\nComputer networking is a way for computers to communicate with one another. While we may take this for granted, it’s important to understand the fundamentals of networking when you build your solutions. In AWS, the virtual private cloud is the primary service that provides networking capabilities. So in this course, we’ll learn about networking concepts and apply them using AWS virtual private cloud.\nWe’ll begin with AWS infrastructure to lay the foundation for the course. Then we’ll get into what exactly is a virtual private cloud. Along the way, we’ll cover many fundamentals topics such as public and private IP addresses, CIDR notation, protocols, ports and subnets.\nThere will be a lot of demonstrations to illustrate the core features of Virtual Private Cloud including internet gateway, elastic IP address, elastic network interface, route table, security group, NAT gateway and VPC peering. If these terms don’t mean anything to you right now, don’t worry. By the end of the course, you’ll have a firm understanding of what they mean and how to apply these features to your solution.\nI encourage you to go through the lessons in sequence as they build upon each other. Also try the examples yourself as there’s no substitute for learning by doing when it comes to building your AWS skills. You can sign up for an AWS account with a free tier. I’ll provide several resources in the lectures to help you. Finally, don’t feel rushed to cover all of the materials quickly. Feel free to take a break to reflect on what you learned and explore any topics deeper if you want. Now, put yourself in a comfortable and relaxed state of mind and let’s get started!",

Why you may ask? Well let me explain to you:\n- JunOS has an intuitive CLI, show commands and protocol configuration is pretty easy to understand.\n- Documentation is short and on point most of the time.\n- Configuration is easy to see and understand and it makes sense.\n\n\nWhile creating this course, my focus was to show you the most used protocols and technologies in the actual working place, using as close to real-life scenarios as possible.\nThe focus of my lessons is the practice part, but you will find easy-to-understand lectures on how protocols and Juniper devices work, also I made sure to include topics that are liked by the interviewers when targeting a Network engineer role.\n\n\nThis course is targeted for beginner to intermediate level, the curriculum will take you slowly and will gradually increase its complexity, it is created in a way that you will immediately have to use the protocol/technology that we touched by assigning to you \"homework\" in form of practice labs after each Chapter and more complex multi-technology assignments once we learn more.\nIn my experience the best way to learn something is by practising it and playing with different scenarios it will for sure make you read more closely networking documentation and in return make you a better engineer.\n\n\nWhat this course is proposing:\n- Network and JunOS Fundamentals\n- Firewall, Switch and Router handling\n- LACP and MC-LAG\n- Static routing and GRE Tunneling\n- STP\n- VRRP\n- NAT\n- OSPF, ISIS and BGP\n- IPSec\n\n\nHop in and let's go!\n\n\nUpdate 07/2024: BGP RouteReflectors, BGP Confederations, IPSec -> all with corresponding labs",

The details of the SNMP components such as the Structure of Management Information (SMI) and Management Information Base (MIB) are discussed in detail. The principles of operation of SNMP and SNMP UDP ports are also discussed.\nThe UDP port 161/162 is used by the application layer protocol known as SNMP, which is used to monitor networks, identify network issues, and occasionally even set up remote devices. The various components of SNMP. i) SNMP Manager - It is a network monitoring system that is centrally located. Another name for it is an NMS, or Network Management Station. An agent is a router that runs the SNMP server program; a manager is a host that runs the SNMP client application. ii) SNMP Agent - Installed on a controlled device, it is a software management module. While the agent keeps the data in the database up to date, the manager has access to the values kept there. For example, a manager can look at the pertinent variables that a router keeps, like the number of packets received and transferred, to determine whether or not the router is congested. The Management Information Base (MIB): It houses data about resources that require management. The arrangement of this data is hierarchical. It is made up of instances of objects, which are just variables. Every agent has a different MIB, which is a collection of all the items the manager is in charge of. The eight categories that comprise MIB are system, interface, address translation, IP, UDP, ICMP, and TCP. These groups reside in the MIB object.\n\n\nThere is a hands-on practical session on the installation and working of SNMP.\n\n\nThe course completion quiz appears at the end.",

Why it exists, How it it works, What happens to packets as they get translated. This module will explain every type of translation: Static NAT, Static PAT, Dynamic PAT, and Dynamic NAT. You'll learn about each of these in a way that is completely vendor agnostic -- the concepts you learn here will apply to any vendor and any platform.\nNAT Types\nThere are three different types of NATs. People use them for different reasons, but they all still work as a NAT.\n1. Static NAT\nWhen the local address is converted to a public one, this NAT chooses the same one. This means there will be a consistent public IP address associated with that router or NAT device.\n2. Dynamic NAT\nInstead of choosing the same IP address every time, this NAT goes through a pool of public IP addresses. This results in the router or NAT device getting a different address each time the router translates the local address to a public address.\n3. PAT\nPAT stands for port address translation. It’s a type of dynamic NAT, but it bands several local IP addresses to a singular public one. Organizations that want all their employees’ activity to use a singular IP address use a PAT, often under the supervision of a network administrator.",

The student will be using the latest tools, such as Saint, Metasploit through Kali Linux and Microsoft PowerShell. Mile2 goes far beyond simply teaching you to “Hack”. The C)PTE was developed around principles and behaviors used to combat malicious hackers and focuses on professional penetration testing rather than “ethical hacking”. Besides utilizing ethical hacking methodologies, the student should be prepared to learn penetration testing methodologies using advanced persistent threat techniques. In this course, you will go through a complete penetration test from A-Z! You’ll learn to create your own assessment report and apply your knowledge immediately in the workforce. With this in mind, the CPTE certification course is a complete upgrade to the EC-Council CEH! The C)PTE exam is taken anytime/anywhere online through mile2’s MACS system, making the exam experience easy and mobile. The student does not need to take the C)PTE course to attempt the C)PTE exam.\nThe Certified Penetration Testing Engineer exam is taken online through mile2®’s Assessment and Certification System (“MACS”), which is accessible on your mile2® account. The exam will take 2 hours and consist of 100 multiple choice questions. The cost is $400 USD and must be purchased directly from mile2®.",

In simple terms, the Site-to-Site method connects two offices to a single network, and the Point-to-Site method connects remote employees to the office. In this video lecture, we will consider an example of connecting two existing networks - physical and virtual.\nYou can configure your Site-to-Site VPN over the Peer-to-Peer (Shared Key), Peer-to-Peer (SSL/TLS), and IPsec VPN Tunnel.\n\nPlease note: OpenVPN has deprecated the “Peer-to-Peer (Shared Key)” mode as it does not meet recent security standards. The shared key mode will be removed from future versions. So, you should convert any existing “Peer-to-Peer (Shared Key)” VPNs to SSL/TLS and avoid configuring any new “Shared Key” OpenVPN instances.\nSetting up your pfSense network and satisfying all the prerequisites are fairly very straightforward, if you want to know how to install and configure the pfSense firewall in your network then watch my related video created earlier.\n\nNetwork Diagram & the Scenario\nFirst, we will discuss all possible network scenarios in detail and identically install and run pfSense firewall 2.7.0, the latest version, at all of our branches.\nWe will create several sites, “Head Office, Numerous Branch Offices,” or we could have more sites. They might be located in the same city, out of the region, maybe countrywide, or on different continents, but out of your LAN premises.\nSo how could you be connected to each remote site and access the resources equally the same as you are working in your internal LAN, to deliver timely and effective remote support and share IT resources between the servers, desktops, and printers across the networks?\nNonetheless, if you connect your sites or branches over the “Site-to-Site VPN” then your network will be in your complete control egregiously, you could also enforce the centralized corporate policy to control internet activities, implement Active Directory Group Policies all over your interconnected branches, and so much indefinite viable controls.",

      "description": "overview :\nyou will learn about creating an arp spoofing program which will make you able to put yourself in the middle of a communication so that you could listen to all the clients data and capture their username and passwords . then you could launch the dns spoofing to redirect victims to other places one of which is you own malicious website that you would know how to create . you would also know how to create a sniffing program yourself and how to get different packets from clients and change the to meet your own purpose which is to hack them and get access to them because you are forwarding them to places which have been provided with malwares like backdoor that you would know how to create too .\n\n\nwhy this course :\nthere maybe plenty of other courses with the same subjects as this course . the difference of this course is that rather than how something is done (which most courses are about) , you would know why something is done. in order to fine the answer of this question you should know all the details about a subject . thats why that instead of teaching you about different modules and codes we will introduce you the most important and low level module in python which is raw socket . because don't forget if you just want to copy/paste code you could search it online. but you would want to know all the knowledge behind what you are doing .\n\n\nin this course , first we will teach you about linux important command so you will be familiar and comfortable to work with the kali linux as the most important operating systems for hackers. after that we will teach you about basic python so that you will be ok with some basic command as we go along . after that in each section we will first learn about networking concepts by going to the deepest level and after that we start to create the security tools for network hacking using python different modules . at first we will implement our security tools using scapy which is a high level library in python and after that we go deeper by creating them using sockets and at last the raw sockets .our different sections of security tools includes :\n1- arp spoofing :  we will learn about all the details of how client starts to work in a network and also everything about different protocols like dhcp and arp . we learn about different sections and fields in an arp packet . somehow that you will completely learn why a protocol would have some vulnerability . after that we will create our arp spoofing program using scapy . and after that we will introduce you to sockets and raw sockets . and at last we will be creating our arp spoofing program using raw sockets .the difference about raw sockets with other modules is that you as the programmer should take care of everything so you have to know a high level of knowledge .and after that we will spy on victims by capturing their usernames and passwords.\n2- sniffing program : in this section first we tell you how we could capture packets in general and we show a demo about it to you using scapy. but after that again we will go deep by using raw sockets . we start to capture packets in raw binary format and we will introduce you to different libraries and modules to how to convert them in a more human readable form . such modules include binascii , struct , chr ,  ord and so on. and after that in each section we will unpack and parse one section header until we get to the application layer data . by doing this section you will learn why packet sniffers like wireshark or libraries like scapy work as they do . because the important thing is the answer to why questions and not how.\n3- dns spoofing program : in this section first we will teach you about dns protocol . how it works and all the different headers and fields in this protocol . after that you will understand yourself that why there is a vulnerability in this protocol so that you exploit it as dns spoofing  . but again we won't be using already made modules but rather we will start to implement the application ourselves using python .\n4- client-server communications : we will teach you about what a client-server based communication is . and how to setup a server by listening at specific port numbers while you have created and bound your socket with a nic(network interface card) .\n5- http redirection and manipulation : you will learn the format of a http packet and how you could forward the http packets that you have received from other victims which you have launched the arp spoofing attack against and therefore you have access to their packets to other location including your malicious website .\n6- creating a backdoor : in this section first we will take a look at how we could create a backdoor using metasploit , after that we explain that how a backdoor works the way that it works . so give you some example that how we could create our own backdoor using python .",

Get ready to level up your networking game. Join us now and let the subnetting fun begin!\n\n\nThis well organized course will has the following modules:\nWelcome and Getting Started: Prepare yourself for efficiently and successfully completing the course. You’ll get an overview of what the course is all about and what you should expect out of it.\n\n\nBinary Numbers: Subnetting requires a deep understanding of how binary numbers work. In this module, You’ll get an in-depth look at binary numbers and practice working with those numbers.\n\n\nIP Addresses: You’ll dive deep into IP addresses, how they are used, be introduced to networking, practice identifying IP address classes, and be able to identify address types.\n\n\nSubnetting: Time for the main event. In this module, you’ll gain a deep understanding of subnetting. We’ll figure out how to break apart a network into subnetworks so we can better utilize the IPv4 addressing space.\n\n\nSubnetting Ranges: We’ll be figuring out how to determine the range of any given network and subnetwork. You’ll get lots of practice subnetting class A, B, and C addresses.\n\n\nVLSM: Now that you understand subnetting, it’s time to take it to the next level. VLSM stands for Variable Length Subnet Mask. It’s the same as subnetting, but each subnet can vary in length. As a bonus, you’ll also get some insight and practice into summarization.\n\n\nHexadecimal: Many computer functions are displayed in hexadecimal format, to include IPv6. You’ll get a great understanding of Hexadecimal numbers and how to work with them. A big part of this module will go over converting between hexadecimal numbers and binary and decimal numbers.\n\n\nIPv6 Addresses: You’ll study the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and how IPv6 addresses work.\n\n\nIPv6 Subnetting: Time for subnetting IPv6 addresses. Spoiler: Once you understand subnetting and hexadecimal numbers, subnetting IPv6 networks are a breeze.\n\n\nNetwork Architecting: Understanding how to subnet IPv4 and IPv6 is a crucial part to passing certification tests and proficiently engineering networks. However, understanding the fundamentals does not always translate to real world situations. In this module, you’ll get insight into what you’ll find in the outside world.\n\n\nWrap Up: Time to wrap up the course and provide any final thoughts.\n\n\nInstructor Bio\nTechKnowSurge (Andrew Grimes) been in the tech industry since 2000 and even longer as an Instructor.

      "description": "From handling versioning to enhancing security and portability, technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes have benefitted application development and cloud deployments. Microsoft offers excellent containerization services with its Azure Container Services, and also supports both Docker and Kubernetes. With the tool docker-compose, developers can then run, scale, test and debug the application, simulating a production like an environment on their development workstations. Docker allows you to package the many application services that are part of your distributed application into self-contained standard packages called containers. If you’re looking to ship and run distributed applications with Docker as well as manage container workloads at scale with Microsoft Azure then this Course is perfect for you!\nThis comprehensive 2-in-1 Course follows a step-by-step approach and focuses on how to use Docker and Kubernetes to package application services into standardized units of deployment. These units are easy to deploy and run on any platform on-premise and in the cloud. Initially, you’ll write Dockerfiles for each of the application services, develop, test and run service code running inside a container and optimize your Dockerfiles to use multi-stage builds to minimize the size of the resulting Docker images used in production. Moving further, you’ll learn to make an informed decision on Container orchestration in Azure. You’ll also learn to deploy, configure and manage Azure Kubernetes service clusters. Finally, you’ll learn to deploy applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and manage Container workloads at Scale!\nBy the end of this course, you'll learn all about Docker and Kubernetes and will be able to configure, manage, and deploy applications on Azure Cloud.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 2 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Hands-On Kubernetes, and Docker for Distributed Applications covers shipping and running distributed applications anywhere with Docker. This course shows you how Docker can be used to isolate your application services and their dependencies into a single self-contained unit that can reliably run anywhere. You will learn to build, ship and run distributed applications on any platform using Kubernetes as the orchestrator. By the end of this course, you will be able to use Docker and Kubernetes to build distributed applications that are scalable, resilient, fault-tolerant and secure. Furthermore, you will be able to deploy these applications to any Kubernetes cluster running on any platform on-premise or in the cloud.\nThe second course, Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes in Azure, covers getting real with container orchestration in Microsoft Azure. The course focuses on application containerization using a combination of the dynamic duo, Docker and Kubernetes. It will show you how to get hands-on and take advantage of these two tools, alongside Azure Container Services, and improve the configuration and deployment of your applications on Azure Cloud. By the end of this course, you'll learn all about Docker and Kubernetes and will be able to configure, manage, and deploy applications on Azure Cloud.\nBy the end of this course, you'll containerize your applications to build a production-class container infrastructure in the ‘Kubernetes way’.\nAbout the Authors\n● Gabriel N.

      "description": "Welcome to the third and the final course on “Automobile Hacking and Security v3.0”. This is the continuation of our previous two courses “Automobile Hacking and Security v1.0 and v2.0”. It has been a long journey. We covered so many important topics in the previous two courses like CAN protocol, OBD2 protocols, ECU Models and many other things.\nBut this course is going to be very different because this is a fully researched base course. If you have taken our previous course you should know that CAN is a protocol used in almost all vehicles nowadays and it's a wired base protocol but we are going to combine it with another protocol to make it wireless and receive wireless CAN data.\nWe are going to use an ESP32 board in this course, so first we will cover the basics of the ESP32 board which are required for this course. Then we will look at the MQTT protocol which is a very popular protocol in the IOT world. We are going to combine CAN protocol and MQTT to create our own device which will be a wireless device. And this device will be based on an ESP32 board. We will test this device on a real car to get CAN-BUS data wirelessly. Then we will also use the same device on the ECU Model to perform ECU Remote Based Attack. So this course is a cutting edge technology course which will help find vulnerabilities in modern day vehicles and also help in your thesis and research paper.",

      "description": "In recent years, the international order from the Ukraine to the United States has been seriously impacted by botnets, the remotely controlled networks of computers with nefarious intentions. The virus, ransomware, and disruptive services offered by various botnets have a variety of unique consequences and characteristics.\nTherefore, strengthening the defenses against them is crucial. To more or less successfully combat botnets, one should examine their code, communication, kill chain, and other technological characteristics. However, the Business Model for Information Security asserts that in addition to technology characteristics, their skills and behavior also have a human and organizational component.\nThe purpose of this course is to describe the elements of various attacks and to give a framework for analysing the technical and human characteristics of botnets. Five botnet attacks were used as case studies for testing the specified framework. ElectrumDoSMiner, Emote, Gamover Zeus, Mirani, and VPNFilter were the botnets that were selected. The comparison concentrated on the following factors: motivation, the used business model, cooperation readiness, capabilities, and attack source. Due to the dynamic behavior of cyberspace and botnets, it is difficult for defending organizations to achieve the target level of defending capabilities with a one-time development. The methods described in this research should be used to construct cyber defense and gather threat intelligence on botnets. According to the BMIS paradigm, this framework combines human and technology characteristics, giving the defender a uniform classification system.\n\n\nThis is a beginners course that is aimed at explaining what BotNets are, how they are built and operated. It also discusses how BotNets attack and have avoided detection in the past by Anti Virus solutions. This course starts with the basics then moves on to more details and then finally shows examples of BotNets and how to detect if clients are infected with BotNet clients.\nAfter the course you will be able to:\nExplain what a BotNet is\nExplain and describe the components and architecture of BotNets\nExplain the ecosystem of BotNets\nExplain BaaS (BotNet as a Service)\nExplain different types of BotNets\nExplain the difference between SocialBots and \"normal\" BotNets\nDiscover infected clients that are part of a BotNet\nUnderstand different types of attacks that BotNets can do\nThis course is meant to give any student that takes it critical knowledge and skills to understand the unique threats that BotNets pose to an entity.",

FortiSOAR runs best on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or CentOS, with prerequisites like Python 3.6+, PostgreSQL, and Docker configured during installation.\nConnector Configuration\nConnectors integrate FortiSOAR with external systems like SIEMs, firewalls, EDR, and CTI platforms. You can deploy them via the UI under Settings → Connectors, supplying API endpoints, credentials, and custom parameters as needed.\nEach connector supports a specific protocol (e.g., REST, syslog, SMTP). After configuration, always run Test Connection to validate integration. For unsupported tools, FortiSOAR provides a Python-based Connector Development Kit (CDK) to build custom connectors.\nUse dedicated, least-privilege service accounts and store secrets securely in the FortiSOAR vault.\nPlaybook Development\nPlaybooks automate incident handling by chaining actions based on triggers, conditions, and logic. FortiSOAR’s visual playbook editor allows engineers to:\nTrigger workflows on alert ingestion or user actions.\nInclude branching, loops, delays, and error handling.\nLeverage out-of-the-box actions from connectors or custom scripts in Python or JavaScript.\nModular playbook design improves reusability and scalability. Always test playbooks in staging and include rollback or exception paths.\nTogether, architecture, connectors, and playbooks form the operational backbone of FortiSOAR, driving intelligent, automated security response across your environment.",

      "description": "***** Very Similar to my INE Course:  MTA : Networking Fundamentals (Exam 98-366) *****\nWhen you learn or teach Computer Networking, you might wonder about how topics should be explained. Should theory concepts such as OSI and TCP/IP models be explained first? Then how students will fully understand and comprehend ideas related to these models such as MAC and IP addresses and how they work in networks? Should they try to imagine this in their minds? And if the addressing concepts were explained first, then how can students fully understand these concepts without seeing them in action before moving to other concepts? Here we see that some practice is needed along with the theory explanation of these concepts. And should the students practice with individual mini labs or with full network from the start that would terrify them with its looking? This course progresses through concepts and topics using step-by step theory & project-based logical and systematic methods which is the solution for these issues. Students should learn with a mixture of theory and practice that moves from one topic to another related one while their network or project grows little by little. So as an example for this step-by-step learning method, in the first lectures, you will learn about what is a computer network, and what are local area networks or LANs, since those are the most basic form of a network you will encounter in real world. After that we have to understand network addresses in order to assign them to devices in our network, and thus enable communication between those devices.  But before that, we have to understand numbering systems, such as binary and hexadecimal, since network addresses such as IPv4, IPv6, and MAC are implemented using these numbering systems.\nNow as you have understood the concepts of network addressing, it is time to practice with them, and we will use Cisco packet Tracer for that purpose. Afterwards, you have to understand how to map between different types of addresses using ARP, or the Address Resolution Protocol, and why this mapping is needed. Also ICMP or the Internet Control Message Protocol  will be explained to demonstrate how communication in computer networks works. And again will we practice both ARP and ICMP using Packet Tracer in order to understand the concepts, and start establishing our hands on expertise. The same logical order of topics or lectures will continue to the end of the course. We will use the the MTA: Networking fundamentals curriculum to learn about Computer Networking and build our network through this course.\nMTA or Microsoft Technology Associate is an entry-level certification that provides the fundamentals of a certain technology based on Microsoft products. The MTA: Networking Fundamentals (exam 98-366) is one of these certifications that will provide essential networking knowledge and skills to you. This certification can be your first step in networking and towards other advanced Microsoft certifications such as MCSA and MCSE. It can be considered as the Microsoft version of Network+ or Cisco ICND1/CCENT. This course will help you to prepare for this certification through building a network step by step, going from LAN, addressing, switching, topologies, media types, and networking models to WAN, routing, remote access, security, and network services. With each step, you will learn the theory and practical skills related to it.\nI hope that you will join me in this course and start your journey of leaning or teaching computer networking. Happy learning and inspirational teaching!",

      "description": "It is crucial for network engineers to understand how networking protocols work in depth. This will help them to configure and operate networks effectively and be distinguished from other engineers who do not possess this understanding.\nThis type of knowledge is also important for network architects. It will allow them to design networks that consist of parts that work together in harmony.\n\n\nThis course will help you understand some behaviors that seem strange or unusual in networking, such as hosts that do not use a default gateway to communicate with other subnets. You will understand how such things happen.\nYou will understand the mechanisms of some important IP features, such as Proxy ARP, IP redirects, and IP directed Broadcasts.\nYou will understand the disadvantages and security issues related to these features, the attacks that they allow, and how to mitigate them.\nThis course focuses on the practical side as much as possible, using Cisco routers emulated in GNS3. We will deep dive into protocols' behaviors with show and debug commands.\nFor example, we will see how the Proxy ARP feature allows hosts that do not have a default gateway configured to communicate with other subnets or to use a default gateway that is located outside their own subnet. We will see how this feature affects the cache of the devices and therefore will understand what is the best way to configure static routing. Additionally, we will see how both the DOS (denial of service) and MiTM (Man in the middle) attacks take advantage of the Proxy ARP feature. However, this feature was not there without a reason, so its usage cases will be explained.\nAnother example is how the IP directed Broadcast feature allows for the IP Smurfing attack to occur and how we can mitigate this attack using the uRPF (unicast Reverse Path Forwarding) mechanism.",

      "description": "Automotive hacking is the exploitation of vulnerabilities within the software, hardware, and communication systems of automobiles. Modern automobiles contain hundreds of onboard computers processing everything from vehicle controls to the infotainment system. These computers, called Electronic control units (ECU), communicate with each other through multiple networks and communication protocols including the Controller Area Network (CAN) for vehicle component communication such as connections between engine and brake control; Local Interconnect Network (LIN) for cheaper vehicle component communication such as between door locks and interior lights; Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) for infotainment systems such as modern touchscreen and telematics connections; and FlexRay for high-speed vehicle component communications such as active suspension and active cruise control data synchronization. Firstly this course is for everyone who has basic knowledge of Linux and ethical hacking. In this course, you will learn about the basics of car hacking, Why it came to a trend, How to install a virtual car simulator, how to set up, basic history of car hacking, Cansniffing, CAN & ECU, and lots more of practical. As you all know how ethical hacking and cyber security had become a trend so in that case, I launched a fresh course on car hacking which is very rare to be found on the internet. This course is in the Hindi language and very easy to grab all the things I taught in this course. Also, all the videos are downloadable and the materials is at the end of the course.",

We will start by understanding what a Thick Client is and then progress towards mastering Thick Client pen-testing, including how to intercept and analyze its security.\nThick client pen-testing, cybersecurity professionals, often known as ethical hackers or penetration testers, simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential security risks in the application. The process typically involves a combination of manual testing and the use of specialized tools to analyze the application's code, communication protocols, data handling mechanisms, and other components.\nWhile we cover the Thick Client Pentest, we will see the demo on the below tools.\nEcho Mirage\nJavasnoop\nJadx\nMITM-Relay\nSysinternal-suite/strings64.exe\nWireshark\nDnspy/ Dot Peek/ VB decompiler/ ILspy\nFiddler\nJD-GUI\nNmap\nSysinternal-suite\nMeterpreter\nWinhex\nImplusive DLL/ Auditor/ DLL SPY\nProcess hacker\nHxD hex editor\nSnoop\nWinSpy++/Windows detective\nUispy\nRegshot\nMany more.\nThe listed security tools function differently, allowing us to adopt a modern approach and utilize various techniques to identify weaknesses within thick client applications. Through their combined usage, we can perform comprehensive assessments and apply advanced methodologies to ensure a thorough examination of the application's security posture.",

In summary, we compared and contrasted each framework and its use.\nWe conclude the training by looking at other risk management frameworks and reviewing if the CRISC is used since this is one of the certification frameworks rather than an actual risk framework.\nThe NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework) and ISACA CRISC (Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control) course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of risk management in information security.\nThe course covers the NIST RMF, a process for managing and mitigating risks to information systems. It includes an overview of the six steps in the NIST RMF process, including categorization, selection, implementation, assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring. Additionally, the course covers how to implement the NIST RMF in an organization, including how to select appropriate security controls and how to assess the effectiveness of those controls.\nThe course also covers the ISACA CRISC certification, designed to demonstrate expertise in identifying, assessing, evaluating, and managing information system risks. It includes an overview of the CRISC domains, including IT risk identification, assessment, response, and monitoring. Additionally, the course covers how to prepare for and pass the CRISC exam, including study tips and best practices.\nOverall, this course provides a comprehensive understanding of risk management in the context of information security, including both the NIST RMF and ISACA CRISC. It is ideal for information security professionals who want to enhance their knowledge and skills in managing and mitigating risks to information systems.",

Technology plays a major role in facilitating all functions of business in this era, not just in transaction capturing and processing but even in lesser known areas like Corporate Governance and Risk Management. There is no doubt that Chartered Accountants with ISA qualification will play a major role in Information Systems Audit (ISA) in the coming years. The technology revolution in the 20 century, particularly last 10 years, is a re-enactment of the Industrial Revolution that happened 150 years ago- with lessons that are valid even today. The Industrial Revolution was propelled by innovations but now the rules are being rewritten, powered by silicon chips and Internet bandwidth. With changing paradigms, knowledge and experience in technology are not merely desirable, but basic requirements for growth and even survival in the evolving global village. With the new challenges threatening the traditional domain, the council of the Institute - by commissioning ISA course - is not just coping with the demands of IT dynamics. It also seeks to leverage technology to enhance the professional skills of its members. This course prepares members to offer value added services of Information Systems Audit, which are in increasing demand.",

As it is a step-by-step process, from zero to high level, we encourage you to try to understand exclusively the part one; then after, jump into the next parts to get what you need to know about cryptology, network establishment, firewall, hacking, eavesdrop, empower the security, etc...(as if you were sitting in a Master & PhD cryptology classroom).\nTherefore, after completing our courses (parts 1 - 4), you will meet with the most used encryption techniques, methods used to mitigate the probability of being hacked by Black-Hat hackers.\n-The most recent ways of hacking into a wireless network, no matter what protocols the Wifi was set with by its administrator. Furthermore, no matter how strong the Wifi password is, so that we dupe someone's network. We explain the reasons behind the scene of such attacks. Exploitation of the existed holes that the most used Operating Systems contain, such as (Linux based, Windows, Mac OS, Android)\nWe deeply explain why RSA is that so strong and why it is highly used in real-life cybersecurity, as well as AES encryption.\nMost Well-known Encrypting Algorithms, such as ElGamal, RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and so on forth (Encryption and Decryption steps) are well described. It is crucial for cybersecurity engineers in Master and in PhD classes.\nNote:\nIn this course, we supply to you not only videos for the practice, but also we provide a light text file for each part of the tutorial which is exclusively self-explanatory (a step-by-step process) so that we make it easier to learn according to the obligations that you might face while you want to continue with your practice.\nExample of a situation: you might need to continue with your tutorial where you are at a specific place, and don't want to disturb anybody while you forgot your earphone/headphone.",

It provides the ability to scale a Layer 2 broadcast domain at a larger scale while utilizing the full bandwidth of the network without blocking ports due to spanning-tree. It provides the following advantages • Uses a Layer 3 network to tranfer Layer 2 frames • Allows for ECMP through the Spine Switches • Limits spanning-tree to the host facing Leaf switch ports • Uses BGP to transfer the Layer 2 reachability information • Provides Multi-tenancy to have different customer networks reside in the same fabric\n\n\nSection 02:\n\n\nCustomers are looking more and more to network fabrics to offer them simplicity in design and operation. By creating network segments, logical networks can be built independent and without the constraint of the physical topology and addressing, offering additional flexibility in design.\nThese fabric-based architectures are ideal for offering a balance of optimal routing and forwarding performance, while also allowing for security and policy to be integrated as fundamental aspects of the design.\nBGP EVPN VXLAN is a popular standard networking technology that combines the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) with Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) to provide scalable and efficient communication between devices in a network.\nThis approach lets organizations build large, flat Layer 2 networks that can span across multiple physical locations, making it easier to manage and scale their network infrastructure while better managing the concerns of legacy Spanning Tree based networks. It is designed to provide a unified overlay network solution and address the challenges and drawbacks of existing technologies.\n\n\nSection 03:\n\n\nCisco rebranded Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) as Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) 12.\nCisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) offers a network management system (NMS), support for traditional or multiple-tenant LAN, and SAN fabrics on a single window. Cisco NDFC can:\nWork across all Cisco Nexus and MDS switching families\nManage large numbers of devices while providing ready-to-use control, management, and automation capabilities including Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) control and automation for Cisco Nexus LAN fabrics\nSupport automatic configuration for multi-tenant automation\nOffer integrated storage visualization, provisioning, and troubleshooting\nOffer intuitive, multifabric topology views for LAN fabric and storage\nIntegrate with Cisco UCS Director, vSphere, and OpenStack\nNDFC Feature Management provides the ability to dynamically enable feature sets and scale applications. The first time that you start NDFC from Cisco Nexus Dashboard, NDFC displays the Feature Management screen. If you do not configure the installer and features at this point, NDFC Feature Management only performs backup and restore operations. To enable features later, select the Feature Management option in Settings as shown in the following image.",

An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker. Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications. The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack. An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client. They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them. This is what gray hat hackers do. Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission.\n\n\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network. An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them. In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years. However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods. An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before. When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration. This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals.\n\n\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting. Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C. Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems. Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code.\n\n\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it. It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS. Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer. While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software. Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software. Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers.\n\n\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system. An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement. An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer. They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them. With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles.\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals. With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking. You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards. You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking. The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program.\n\n\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk. For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration. The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies. The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack.\n\n\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain. There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly. Some call new hackers green hat hackers. These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers. State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy. Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices. There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers. A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks. When a script kiddie gets angry at…\n\n\nFAQ regarding Penetration Testing :\nWhat is penetration testing?\nPenetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched. Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and exploit them. Someone who has no previous knowledge of the system's security usually performs these tests, making it easier to find vulnerabilities that the development team may have overlooked. You can perform penetration testing using manual or automated technologies to compromise servers, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices, and other exposure points.\n\n\nWhat are the different types of penetration testing?\nThere are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an enterprise's internal network. This test can determine how much damage can be caused by an employee. An external penetration test targets a company's externally facing technology like their website or their network. Companies use these tests to determine how an anonymous hacker can attack a system. In a covert penetration test, also known as a double-blind penetration test, few people in the company will know that a pen test is occurring, including any security professional. This type of test will test not only systems but a company's response to an active attack. With a closed-box penetration test, a hacker may know nothing about the enterprise under attack other than its name. In an open-box test, the hacker will receive some information about a company's security to aid them in the attack.\n\n\nWhat are the different stages of penetration testing?\nPenetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used. Security experts will also gather intelligence on the company's system to better understand the target. The second stage of a pen test is scanning the target application or network to determine how they will respond to an attack. You can do this through a static analysis of application code and dynamic scans of running applications and networks. The third stage is the attack phase, when possible vulnerabilities discovered in the last stage are attacked with various hacking methods. In the fourth stage of a penetration test, the tester attempts to maintain access to the system to steal any sensitive data or damaging systems. The fifth and final stage of a pen test is the reporting phase, when testers compile the test results.\n\n\nWhy do you want to take this Course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you sign up, you will feel the Instructor's expertise.

      "description": "In this course, we're going to deploy AKS clusters using different Infrastructure as Code approaches. Some of the key topics that we'll cover include:\nCreating a cluster with Azure CLI\nUsing the Azure CLI in an idempotent way, so you can run and re-run the code without generating warnings and errors\nWe'll switch to using Terraform, and see how useful the module for Azure AKS is, which may be all you need to spin up some test clusters\nWe'll spend the bulk of the course on walking through the AKS Baseline Cluster from the Azure Architecture Centre, but converted from a massive Azure Bicep file into individual Terraform resources which are considerably easier to understand. This will enable you to use Terraform variables to toggle the creation of the resources you need in your own context.\nLaunch your first AKS cluster in 15 minutes with Azure CLI. We turn the steps in the Azure quickstart tutorial into idempotent bash shell scripts, so you can run them again and again. We'll run through the full process, including deploying an application to the cluster, and then deleting the cluster, resource group and Kubernetes context.\n\n\nCreate an Azure storage account and container to store Terraform state. We'll use bash shell scripts to wrap Azure CLI commands to create a backend for Terraform, and set up the storage firewall to allow access from your IP address.\n\n\nCreate the Minimum Viable Product in Terraform - using a remote backend to maintain state, take an Azure resource group through the Terraform lifecycle of init, plan, apply, destroy.\n\n\nA cluster in 15 minutes - this time via Terraform. Use the official Azure Terraform Module to create a cluster in minutes. Similar to creating a cluster with Azure CLI, the Terraform code will create a resource group, virtual network, subnet, and AKS cluster.\n\n\nSplit code into subscription, hub, spoke, and cluster. Use Terraform's count keyword, combined with boolean variables to control the creation of resources. Prepare your code for production by a separation of concerns into hub and spoke networking, and choose whether to use the expensive Azure Firewall for your outbound routing.",

I meet so many intelligent individuals every day who would do great in Information Technology or Cybersecurity career fields. However, they are shell-shocked by all the geeky terminology and jargon we use.\nMy goal in developing these series of courses is to use common analogies to explain more complex skills. Hence, the slogan you will see in these lessons \"There is nothing New under the Sun\"\nI employ several hilarious analogies and vignettes such as \"Buying my parents a new computer\" to show how the 6-step Risk Management Framework (RMF) is used to \"Aida's Kitchen\" which explains the inter-workings of computer hardware. Managing risk is something that every human on the plant does daily. Cybersecurity is not just a bunch of technical jargon; it is really a time-tested method of managing security risk.\nIf you are looking for someone with an accent teaching a lot of high-tech jargon, this is NOT the course for you. However, if you are looking for a course to help you understand the core tenets of Cybersecurity, then I think you will enjoy the journey as we Keep Cyber Simple!",

As it is a step-by-step process, from zero to high level, we encourage you to try to understand exclusively the part one; then after, jump into the next parts to get what you need to know about cryptology, network establishment, firewall, hacking, eavesdrop, empower the security, etc...(as if you were sitting in a Master & PhD cryptology classroom).\nTherefore, after completing our courses (parts 1 - 4), you will meet with the most used encryption techniques, methods used to mitigate the probability of being hacked by Black-Hat hackers.\n-The most recent ways of hacking into a wireless network, no matter what protocols the Wifi was set with by its administrator. Furthermore, no matter how strong the Wifi password is, so that we dupe someone's network. We explain the reasons behind the scene of such attacks. Exploitation of the existed holes that the most used Operating Systems contain, such as (Linux based, Windows, Mac OS, Android)\nWe deeply explain why RSA is that so strong and why it is highly used in real-life cybersecurity, as well as AES encryption.\nMost Well-known Encrypting Algorithms, such as ElGamal, RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and so on forth (Encryption and Decryption steps) are well described. It is crucial for cybersecurity engineers in Master and in PhD classes.\nNote:\nIn this course, we supply to you not only videos for the practice, but also we provide a light text file for each part of the tutorial which is exclusively self-explanatory (a step-by-step process) so that we make it easier to learn according to the obligations that you might face while you want to continue with your practice.\nExample of a situation: you might need to continue with your tutorial where you are at a specific place, and don't want to disturb anybody while you forgot your earphone/headphone.",

      "description": "Enhance your career with a course in Masterclass OpenStack Mitaka # 2\nOpenStack began in 2010 as a joint project of RackSpace Hosting and NASA. More than 500 companies have joined the project since.\nOpenStack is an open source software for building private and public clouds. This is a cloud operating system that controls a large pool of compute, storage and networking resources throughout a data center.\nOpenStack boosts business agility, availability, and efficiency by providing a platform with on-demand, resource pooling, self-service, highly elastic, and measured services capabilities. OpenStack has certain capabilities, like Self-service life cycle management, for example, the run, reboot, suspend, resize and terminate instances. We don’t need manual introduction to perform all these tasks. It will automatically do it using the different OpenStack services.\nNow, why would you want to do that? Can’t you just subscribe with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Salesforce, Google or some other cloud services provider? You certainly can. However, if you are not comfortable entrusting sensitive data to a third party and you have tons of it, then an on-premise or private cloud infrastructure would be the better choice. By building your own cloud in your own data center, you will have more control of your data. OpenStack enables you to do just that.\nLet me take you through the basics which we will be covering in the course-\nFirstly, you will be introduced to OpenStack Series-I and few of its components or services as we call it here.\nNext, you will deep-dive into each of the components. You will learn their basic architecture.\nYou will learn how to install and configure these components with informative demonstrations. They will be explained in simple, easy language.\nAssessment quizzes at the end of each module will help you test your knowledge of the module.\nPrerequisites for the course.\nBefore you start the course, you need to have a good understanding of the following –\nBasic understanding of what virtualization is and how it helps a cloud owner ,to start with\nBasic knowledge of programming languages, such as Python, YAML, Bash etc.\nWorking knowledge of Microsoft Visual Studio Code.\nBasic networking experience and full understanding of the OSI model.\nWho will benefit from this course?\nThe New Stack and the Linux Foundation ranked OpenStack as the most popular open source project. This course will benefit you if you are a software engineer or system administrator interested in planning, deploying and even operating the company’s production and development clouds. This course will help you gain relevance in the industry of software development and deployment. The good news is that as of October 2017, LinkedIn listed almost 6,000 jobs, Indeed 2,500 jobs and Glassdoor 2,600 jobs with OpenStack as a title or a requirement. Learning OpenStack will definitely scale up your business profitability!\nGrab your copy of the OpenStack Course, today!\nHappy Learning!",

Though I knew the concept but when I had to configure on cisco router and I was just confused and fingers just did not move ( Moreover Desktop Session was being Shared). :-) . It was just like I never practiced in real routers\nSo, Then I decided to cover such topics so that we are aware what we have to do. Concepts like NAT , PAT , GLBP , VRRP have been covered with in depth detail.\nI will be adding more lectures in this course. Once you are enrolled then any new addition of lecture will be FREE for you.\nIn this course, You will understand DHCP configuration on Cisco Routers, NAT , PAT , DYNAMIC NAT , Gateway Redundancy Protocols like HSRP, VRRP and GLBP etc.\nI guarantee that you will start loving Netwoking after  this course.\n30 Days refund in case you are NOT satisfied. :-)",

Actually, it is seen with multi-brunches customers to connect their network to central. But, as a network engineer, you have to know background of this technology  even if you are not in service provider team.\nThis course starts with labeling mechanism and will continue with labeling signalling protocols such as LDP and RSVP. RSVP has more complexity comparison to LDP and you will learn all details of them.\nWe will build together large MPLS topology  and configure all router by starting IGP protocol OSPF and advertise routes of loopbacks.\nThen we will enable MPLS and try to communicate customer end sider in MPLS L3VPN. In last chapter, we will touch on VPLS also.\nVPLS provides you point-to-multipoint communication as if your clients in same broadcast LAN network. We will work VPLS using BGP and VPLS using LDP configuration. Also we will mention about their difference and why we use for which reason.\nI will add some small  quiz for you in order to make you understand concept of technology\nI hope this course will help you and you will like it.\nHave an enjoy!\nRegards,",

      "description": "Jenkins is one of the most popular Continuous Integration servers on the market today. It is designed to maintain, secure, communicate, test, build, and improve the software development process. Setting up Jenkins and running build jobs is not enough for a production infrastructure.\nFor optimal performance and results, architecting, designing, and implementing a production-grade Jenkins deployment is essential. In agile development practices, developers need to integrate their work to fix bugs or to create a new feature or functionality. Jenkins is used for continuous integration, helping to enforce the principles of agile development.\nThis comprehensive 3-in-1 course is a step-by-step approach to get you up-and-running with Jenkins and then quickly moves on to implement a scalable and production-grade infrastructure. Implement a scalable, stable, and robust production grade infrastructure. Combine multiple services to create optimal code delivery workflows and pipelines. Discover the process of using Jenkins to build, test, and package Java applications. Create a Git repository and Docker images using a local development environment, and other DevOps configuration tools. Get equipped to deploy a modern Jenkins System by provisioning slave nodes to the cloud with Ansible and Docker.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Practical Jenkins, covers automation of Jenkins deployment in no time!. Get up and running with Jenkins and deliver an optimal Jenkins deployment. Explore and configure features such as high availability, security, monitoring, and backing up/restoring data, which are basically all of the things you need to implementing a scalable and production grade infrastructure. Learn how to implement distributed builds, automate build pipelines, and integrate your Jenkins deployment with external services, thus showing you how to increase your team's productivity with pipeline as a code building advanced pipelines faster and easier. By the end of this video course, you will be able to automate, implement, secure, and manage your Jenkins deployment in no time.\nThe second course, Hands-On Continuous Integration and Automation with Jenkins, covers building, testing, and packaging applications with Jenkins in this hands-on video course supported by practical real-world examples. Delve into the installation of the required software dependencies and libraries and demonstrates the workflow you'll need to follow to perform continuous integration for a sample application. Learn how to integrate code repositories and build tools in order to build code pipelines to implement both continuous integration and continuous delivery. Finally, you will also learn to automate deployment to a cloud platform such as AWS.\nThe third course, Deploying Jenkins to the Cloud with DevOps Tools, covers professional practices, techniques, and solutions for using Jenkins in cloud environments. Explore different AWS services and use them for Continuous Integration. Customize and configure your Jenkins master automatically on boot-up with Groovy code in order to achieve the build process we want. This includes adding secrets to the credentials store, installing and configuring plugins, and setting some basic values within the Jenkins main configuration. Once we are able to interact with Gitlab, we will then configure a way to run Jenkins nodes on Kubernetes so that we can actually build our software. When everything looks good in our development environment, we will then see what an almost production-ready CI system in the cloud looks like, especially with regard to security aspects.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll implement and manage your production - grade Jenkins deployments to build, test, and package applications, supported by practical real-world examples.\nAbout the Authors\nAnirban Saha is an infrastructure professional with more than seven and half years' experience in infrastructure management at various industries and organizations ranging from early startups to corporate environments.

The data packet helps in network analysis that is by analysis the data one can know the security status of the net.\n\n\nExplain packet sniffers or network analyzers work?\nPacket sniffers work by intercepting into a network that they can \"see.\" What a packet sniffer can capture depends on the structure of the net. Ones a packet sniffer or network analyzer captures a packet they analyze it and present it in human readable form so that the user of packet sniffer can make use of the data.\nIt is wise to note a packet sniffer gets set into two ways. Some can be configured to capture all the data in this way we say they are unfiltered. There are those that are set to capture specific packets. We describe them as filtered.\n\n\nWhat is the standard software tool that is used for packet sniffing or network analysis?\nThe most known network analysis or packet sniffing tool is called WireShark. It was known as Ethereal in the past and gathered datagram in real time have them in a form that you can read. It has color coding, filters, and other great features. It helps you analyze individual data packets and helps you go deeper in network matters.\n\n\nWhat is Cisco Packet Tracer used for?\nPacket Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks.

      "description": "In today’s workplaces, technology moves fast—and so do the threats that come with it. From emails and chats to online forms and AI-powered tools, every click and interaction now carries more risk than ever before. And while cybersecurity may sound like something for IT to handle, the truth is, every employee plays a role in keeping the organization safe.\nEmployee Cybersecurity Awareness in the Age of AI is a practical, people-first course built for real professionals navigating real digital environments. Whether you’re in HR, finance, sales, customer support, engineering, or leadership—this course is designed to help you spot threats early, protect what matters, and make smart decisions in an age where AI has changed the game.\nWe won’t bombard you with jargon or technical deep dives. Instead, we’ll show you how everyday tasks—like opening emails, sharing files, using chatbots, or signing into apps—can open the door to sophisticated threats if you’re not paying attention. And more importantly, we’ll give you the tools and confidence to shut those doors before anything gets through.\nYou’ll learn how phishing scams have evolved to sound exactly like your manager. How deepfake videos and voice clones are being used to trick even the most careful teams. How cybercriminals are using AI to create fake resumes, fake vendor requests, fake conversations—all designed to look and feel real. This course will open your eyes to just how convincing these attacks have become—and how you can stay one step ahead by staying alert, asking questions, and following a few smart habits.\nWe’ll also talk about how to use AI safely in your own work. If you’ve ever dropped content into a writing assistant or shared sensitive info with a chatbot to “make it sound better,” this course will help you understand the risks of where that data might go—and how to use those tools responsibly.\nEach module is short, clear, and focused on real-life scenarios—not hypothetical threats. You’ll hear about situations happening in companies just like yours, and walk away knowing what to do when something feels off.\nBy the end of the course, you won’t just understand modern cybersecurity—you’ll feel empowered to be part of it. You’ll be more confident in your ability to recognize red flags, speak up when something doesn’t look right, and help build a workplace where security isn’t scary or complicated—it’s just something we all do, together.\nBecause in this new digital era, it’s not about being perfect .\nIt’s about being prepared.",

If yes, then you are not the only one facing this issue. But I have a good news for you that MikroTik company has addressed this problem and provided to us a solution to reduce the CPU usage using the Layer 3 Hardware Offloading feature starting RouterOS version 7, and that's what I am going to show you in this course.\n\n\nOf course most ISPs use VLANs in their core network, and they require to make the Layer 3 Hardware Offloading workable with VLANs, and that's exactly what I am going to do in this course.\n\n\nIn the first part of the course, I am going to explain to you what is the Layer 3 Hardware Offloading, what is its advantages/disadvantages, and which MikroTik Routerboard models can be used for the Layer 3 Hardware Offloading.\nOnce done with that part, I will show you in a LAB how the CPU on the core MikroTik router will go high on very high traffic when Layer 3 Hardware Offloading is not enabled.\nThen, I will show you in another LAB how to enabled Layer 3 Hardware Offloading with VLANs on MikroTik RouterOS, and will redo the test by sending high traffic and will check if the CPU on the core router will go lower.\n\n\nThat's all what we will be done in this course, just focusing on 1 topic which is Layer 3 Hardware Offloading with VLANs.\n\n\nBy end of this course, you will have the complete knowledge how to run Layer 3 Hardware Offloading with VLANs in your production network and you finish from the high CPU usage on your MikroTik Routerboard when high traffic is being used.\n\n\nI see you in the course.",

      "description": "SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behaviour.\nIn some situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack.\nA successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user information. Many high-profile data breaches in recent years have been the result of SQL injection attacks, leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period.\n\n\nThere are a wide variety of SQL injection vulnerabilities, attacks, and techniques, which arise in different situations. Some common SQL injection examples include:\n\n\nRetrieving hidden data, where you can modify an SQL query to return additional results.\nSubverting application logic, where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.\nUNION attacks, where you can retrieve data from different database tables.\nExamining the database, where you can extract information about the version and structure of the database.\nBlind SQL injection, where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.\n\n\nMost instances of SQL injection can be prevented by using parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) instead of string concatenation within the query.",

      "description": "Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the standard that routes Internet traffic and other packet-switched networks introduced in 1982 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). IPv4 is the most widely used version of the protocol despite the limitations of its 32-bit address space. With slightly less than 4.3 billion available unique addresses, the available number of addresses quickly began to run out. With some clever ingenuity over the years that extended the life of the protocol, the pool of available addresses didn’t dry up until 2011.\n\n\nAn Internet Protocol address is a unique identifier for devices connected to a network. The unique identifier makes it possible for devices to find and communicate with each other. Initially, the main types of devices that required an IP address included network devices, such as computers, servers, routers, and printers. However, with the Internet of Things, the list includes cell phones, televisions, refrigerators, automobiles, light bulbs, or anything else capable of receiving or exchanging information over a network.\n\n\nAn IPv4 address is a series of four eight-bit binary numbers separated by a decimal point. Although you may use any numbering system to represent a unique 32-bit number, most commonly you see IP addresses expressed in dot-decimal notation.",

      "description": "The Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge or MITRE ATT&CK is a guideline for classifying and describing cyberattacks and intrusions. It was created by the Mitre Corporation and released in 2013. The framework consists of 14 tactics categories consisting of \"technical objectives\" of an adversary.\nMITRE’s ATT&CK is populated mainly by publicly available threat intelligence and incident reporting, as well as by research on new techniques contributed by cyber security analysts and threat hunters. It is used by those same professionals to better understand the different ways bad actors might operate so adversarial behavior can be detected and stopped.\nSpecific adversaries tend to use specific techniques. The MITRE ATT&CK Framework catalogs information that correlates adversary groups to campaigns, so security teams can better understand the adversaries they are dealing with, evaluate their defenses, and strengthen security where it matters most.\nAdversarial tactics are specific technical objectives that an adversary intends to achieve, such as lateral movement, defense evasion, or exfiltration. Tactics are categorized according to these objectives. For instance, there are currently 14 tactics cataloged in the enterprise matrix.\nA technique describes one specific way an adversary may try to achieve an objective. A multitude of techniques are documented under each “tactics” category. This is because adversaries may use different techniques depending on factors such as their skills sets, targets’ system configuration aned availability of suitable tools.\nEach technique includes a description of the method, the systems and platforms it pertains to, which adversary groups use it (if that is known), ways to mitigate the activity, and references to its use in the real world.",

      "description": "Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. The technique was originally used to bypass the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced, but could not route the network's address space. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.\nThis course describes how to configure Network Address Translation (NAT) for IP address conservation and how to configure inside and outside source addresses. This course also provides information about the benefits of configuring NAT for IP address conservation.\nNAT enables private IP internetworks that use nonregistered IP addresses to connect to the Internet. NAT operates on a device, usually connecting two networks. Before packets are forwarded onto another network, NAT translates the private (not globally unique) addresses in the internal network into legal addresses. NAT can be configured to advertise to the outside world only one address for the entire network. This ability provides more security by effectively hiding the entire internal network behind that one address.",

      "description": "Vo5G, or Voice over 5G, refers to the voice and video communication services enabled by the 5G mobile systems. While 5G's evolution is primarily driven by data services, voice and video communication remain crucial for its success.\nIn the initial phase of 5G deployment, voice and video services are delivered over LTE networks using the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) platform. This technology is known as VOLTE (Voice Over LTE) in 5G non-standalone deployment. As 5G advances, the focus shifts to the new 5G radio access technology,  known as NR (New Radio), which enables VoNR (Voice over New Radio) as the next-generation solution for delivering voice and video services.. VoLTE and VoNR represent different access modes for delivering IMS-based voice and video communication services.\nThe transition from VoLTE to VoNR marks the evolution of Vo5G, which goes beyond traditional calls. With Vo5G, improved voice and video services will integrate seamlessly into a variety of 5G-enabled applications, such as augmented reality (AR), remote robotics, and immersive entertainment platforms like gaming and streaming.\nThis course delves deep into the technical intricacies of Vo5G, providing a comprehensive understanding of how voice and video services are evolving alongside 5G technology.

      "description": "Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. The prefix \"crypt-\" means \"hidden\" or \"vault\" -- and the suffix \"-graphy\" stands for \"writing.\" This short course will run you through the a few of most important cryptographic protocols.\nThis course will not make you a security expert but it is the first step towards the same.\nLearning the inner working of the techniques and the mathematics is what this course focusses on.\nCryptographic algorithms are used for important tasks such as data encryption, authentication, and digital signatures, but one problem has to be solved to enable these algorithms: binding cryptographic keys to machine or user identities. Public key infrastructure (PKI) systems are built to bridge useful identities (email addresses, Domain Name System addresses, etc.) and the cryptographic keys used to authenticate or encrypt data passing among these identities.\nCryptography is everywhere.\nIt has become an integrated layer of defense within all of the digital transformation initiatives now collectively referred to as digital business. As the foundation of modern security systems, cryptography is used to secure transactions and communications, safeguard personal identifiable information (PII) and other confidential data, authenticate identity, prevent document tampering, and establish trust between servers. Cryptography is one of the most important tools businesses use to secure the systems that hold its most important asset – data – whether it is at-rest or in-motion. Data is vital information in the form of customer PII, employee PII, intellectual property, business plans, and any other confidential information. Therefore, cryptography is critical infrastructure because increasingly the security of sensitive data relies on cryptographical solutions.\nWeak or hidden crypto can expose critical infrastructure to vulnerabilities. Public attention to exposed data leads to brand erosion. This modern environment requires organizations to pay attention to how cryptography is being implemented and managed throughout the enterprise.\nWhen wrapped within the invisible layers that form cryptography, sensitive data becomes unreadable and unmodifiable, preventing bad actors from carrying out nefarious activity.",

Since then I had many thousands of students taking my courses and most of them are either Internet Service Provider (ISP) owners, or engineers working for ISP's.\nBecause of this, I have decided to make a new course speaking about Splynx which is one of the most famous Radius server when it comes to ISP's, and it is widely using with a lot of ISP's espcially those who are running MikroTik router in their core networks.\n\nSo what is Splynx Radius and why it is important to use it?\nAs an ISP, you need to create accounts to your customers to get connected to the internet. This can be using PPPoE, DHCP, Hotspot, Static IP's ect.\nWhen you do not use a Radius server, then everything need to be done on the router its without the capability to be able to manage invoices, do billing, have a ticketing system etc....\nWith Splynx, all of those things as well as many other stuff can be done on the same system. So for example, you can create new accounts to new customers, manage their billing, set up PPPoE or DHCP, have a ticketing system for support, CRM to handle leads and oppotunities, provide portal access to your customers, manage the customers CPE with the help of ACS (TR-069) and much more than that.\nSo as you can see, it is a complete solution for an ISP to run smoothly and and it an All-in-one Software.\n\n\nIn this course, I will be focusing on the Networking part behind Splynx. So I will show you step by step what you can do on Splynx as for the Networking part. Think of PPPoE, DHCP, FUP, CAP, TR-069 and much more than that.\nI hope you will enjoy the couse and if you have any question please feel free to contact me.",

Confused by all the many parts involved with ensuring everything's secure (including security groups, ACLs, IAM roles and policies, and VPC configurations)?\nYou definitely need to make sure you're not missing any important details. But that's something you definitely can do!\nBeing able to provision and launch a fully-functioning, enterprise-quality cloud server in just a minute or two with no up-front costs is something we could barely have imagined even a decade ago. But all that cloud goodness doesn't change an admin's primary responsibility: to protect infrastructure from attack. The easier Amazon EC2 makes it to push out more and more applications, the more we're exposed to a lot of hostile - and scary - threats.\nIf you're responsible for Amazon EC2 instance workloads - or even if you're just considering the possibility - you need to understand what defensive skills and tools are available and how you can use them.\nThis course will review the current threat landscape and some general server security best practices. I'll introduce you to the significant security measures AWS themselves have taken on our behalf, and how to make the best use of their security groups, IAM roles, and VPC design architectures. We'll also learn about how AWS offers networking tools like VPNs and instance connectivity to help us push back against the bad guys.\nI've also included everything you might need to follow along with the practical demos on your own laptop or work station.

      "description": "Learn the fundamentals of Computer forensics (also known as computer forensic science) is a branch of digital forensic science pertaining to evidence found in computers and digital storage media. The goal of computer forensics is to examine digital media in a forensically sound manner with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analyzing and presenting facts and opinions about the digital information.\nAlthough it is most often associated with the investigation of a wide variety of computer crime, computer forensics may also be used in civil proceedings. The discipline involves similar techniques and principles to data recovery, but with additional guidelines and practices designed to create a legal audit trail.\nEvidence from computer forensics investigations is usually subjected to the same guidelines and practices of other digital evidence. It has been used in a number of high-profile cases and is becoming widely accepted as reliable within U.S. and European court systems.\nIn the early 1980s personal computers became more accessible to consumers, leading to their increased use in criminal activity (for example, to help commit fraud). At the same time, several new \"computer crimes\" were recognized (such as cracking). The discipline of computer forensics emerged during this time as a method to recover and investigate digital evidence for use in court. Since then computer crime and computer related crime has grown, and has jumped 67% between 2002 and 2003. Today it is used to investigate a wide variety of crime, including child pornography, fraud, espionage, cyberstalking, murder and rape. The discipline also features in civil proceedings as a form of information gathering (for example, Electronic discovery)\nComputer forensic investigations usually follow the standard digital forensic process or phases which are acquisition, examination, analysis and reporting. Investigations are performed on static data (i.e. acquired images) rather than \"live\" systems. This is a change from early forensic practices where a lack of specialist tools led to investigators commonly working on live data.",

You will understand how data flows between “real” and virtualised environments, and how it is all programmed to create new-generation networking services.\nTo better understand this, the course will take you though the technical aspects of both software defined networking (SDN) and network functional virtualisation (NFV), which will include a discussion of the protocols and technologies that are involved. You will understand SDN and NFV architecture, and how data is managed across the networking infrastructure.\nIf you’ve wondered about protocols such as OpenFlow, this will be an excellent introduction. Further, you will get to understand why terms such as “programmable”, “agile”, and “central management” as so often used to describe software defined networks. Discussions around network functional virtualisation will take you though the intricacies of what network infrastructure can be virtualised, and how these virtualised resources are managed or “orchestrated” to provide networking services. These discussions will be followed with a look at how all this is implemented at a data centre.\nThe course would be incomplete without a look at who is behind all this. You will get to understand the various industry standardisation and guidance bodies and how they work together to regulate and inform all players in the industry. The course concludes with a look at how to get certified for a career in this exciting industry.",

We have created this course for the Network engineers. However the basics are going to be same. You can learn the ansible starting from the basics and become master of it.  We are going to start from very basic and then reach the state where you can automate the devices and use the other tools on your own. If you are of any other field you can still use this course to master your basics of Ansible. The only difference you will face is diffferenet modules which you will need for your environment. For example if you want to work on the Linux environment then you need to use the shell module. Similarly cloud people can explore the multiple cloud modules. Do you know what is the best thing about the ansible? If there is no ansible module for your platform then you can create your own ansible module. Now this too much in depth study of ansible and this is beginners guide however that is possible to achieve. But believe me Redhat has done the great work and created the ansible modules for all of us already. Now since this course is for the network engineers, I am assuming you know some basics of Networking. So we have not covered basic concepts of Networking. If you are not aware about the basics of Ansible then try spending few hours in learning basics of Networking. You don't need to have in-depth knowledge of Networking, Basics are good enough.",

Yet, how well are they understood by society? Unlike the perception offered by Hollywood, hackers are not a monoculture, hooded at a basement computer clenching a sugar-rich drink and plotting to destroy society. Hackers are a diverse community, with their order encompassing those who spend their days using technology to improve the world to others who exploit digital systems to enrich themselves. This course delves into the history of hackers to offer a more comprehensive picture of the community and its cultural legacy.\nStarting at MIT after the Second World War, hackers drove technological innovation with emerging computing technology. We explore these early origins and trace the stories of hackers through to their modern incarnation. During our journey we meet digital titans hacking phone networks (Steve Jobs and Wozniak), rock lyricists advocating for the independence of the Internet (John Perry Barlow), and hactivists challenging those they perceive to be acting unjustly.\nFinally, we assess hackers today, from those working to keep our digital world safe to cybercriminals who threaten to disrupt our societies.\nWhilst this course covers a technical subject matter, this is not a technical course and is accessible to all.",

These web applications are often very complex and yield a high attack service.  Often these web applications are accessible from the internet. Additionally, these web applications are handling sensitive data, which will seriously harm a company's reputation if leaked. Even though given these facts, many web applications are still poorly secured. It was never easier for attackers to hack confidential company data and seriously harm a business.\n\n\nTherefore there is a high need for cyber security professionals that protect these web applications from malicious attackers. To be proficient in web application security, a student needs to know the fundamentals of the web, before diving into web application vulnerabilities. Also, a student needs to practice their skills in a dedicated lab.\n\n\nThis course goes over common web application vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. In this course you will learn about:\nWeb Application Penetration Testing\nWeb Application Technologies\nBuilding a dedicated web application penetration testing lab\nCommon web vulnerabilities, why they occur, how to exploit them, and how to remediate them\nExploiting vulnerabilities with Kali Linux and Burp Suite\nWhat to learn next\n\n\nThis course is suited for beginners in cyber security who want to make their first learning steps toward web application security.",

      "description": "Microsoft Intune is an excellent Mobile Device Management and Mobile Application Management product but getting started can be a pain. The official Intune documentation is confusing and most students find it inconsistent.  This course aims to solve all your troubles in getting started with Microsoft Intune.\nSome of the topics covered in this course are:\nCreating a Microsoft account and signing up for an Intune Trial\nEnrolling users manually as well as bulk enrollment using CSV files\nCreating Device as well as Application Policies\nUpdates Management\nWhen I was starting my Microsoft Intune journey, The major challenge I faced was not being able to follow the material provided by websites. Most of them covered things from a superficial level. It took me more than four months and over three live training sessions to get experienced with Intune. Now after two years, I am teaching this course on Udemy.\n\n\nI am confident that you would love this course and my approach of teaching only what matters. The course is small and easy to implement. It's is build up on practical case studies of challenges most Intune Administrators face in their everyday job.\n\n\nStill by any chance you ever feel things are not as you expected, Then this course is covered under Udemy's 30 Days No Question Asked Money Back Guarantee!\n\n\nI spend about 4 hours of my daily time to support my students and answer their queries. In case there is a challange that I am unable to solve, I take help from my friends working in Microsoft itself and together we solve your problems. So the level of support you can expect from this course is above standard.\n\n\nThank you so much for reading this far. I am sure you really want to get started with Intune and I can understand where you are coming from. Just remember that I was once at your place and I did the handwork for you by learning it from so many resources. All you have to do is enroll and start this journey.\n\n\nI wish you the best of luck and I can not wait to get started teaching you!",

      "description": "In today's digital age, security is paramount, especially when it comes to web-based applications and APIs. With cyber threats and hacking incidents on the rise, it's essential to have a robust and reliable security mechanism in place to safeguard your system and users' data.\nThis is where OAuth 2.0 comes in. OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted authorization standard that enables secure and scalable authorization for web-based applications and APIs. By using OAuth 2.0, users can grant limited access to their resources without sharing their login credentials, providing an extra layer of security against unauthorized access.\nOur comprehensive course on OAuth 2.0 provides you with a deep understanding of its fundamentals, including its components, flows, and security considerations. You'll learn how to implement OAuth 2.0 in your web-based applications and APIs, allowing your users to authenticate and authorize third-party applications securely.\nOur course also focuses on social login, a popular use case for OAuth 2.0. We'll show you how to integrate with popular social login providers like GitHub, Facebook, and Google, enabling your users to easily and securely log in using their existing social media credentials.\nBy enrolling in our OAuth 2.0 course, you'll gain the knowledge and skills necessary to build secure, scalable, and user-friendly web-based applications and APIs that rely on OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization. Don't leave the security of your system and users' data to chance. Invest in your knowledge and enroll in our OAuth 2.0 course today.",

It is intended for individuals who have already completed the KCNA, CKA, or CKAD certifications. If you fall into this category, you will find the content more aligned with your existing knowledge and skills. However, if you’re still curious and wish to try the course without these prerequisites, you are welcome to join, but please note that success or full comprehension cannot be guaranteed.\n\n\nThis course is not about providing practice labs, building a strong foundation, or guaranteeing success in the KCSA exam. Instead, it is an invitation to study Kubernetes security together, learn collaboratively, and grow our knowledge as a community. I want to be upfront: I have not taken the KCSA exam myself. This course reflects my personal journey of studying Kubernetes security, and I’m inviting you to join me along the way.\n\n\nThe content is designed for learners who already have some familiarity with Kubernetes. We’ll cover essential concepts and explore ideas that spark discussion and understanding. While this course does not include hands-on practice or certification guarantees, it aims to provide insights and encourage critical thinking about securing Kubernetes clusters, managing access, handling secrets, and mitigating potential threats.\n\n\nAlthough I have worked diligently to keep the information accurate and up to date, there may still be areas for improvement. If you come across inaccuracies or feel certain content could be refined, please let me know. Your feedback is invaluable and will contribute to improving the course for everyone.\n\n\nThis course does not claim to make you exam-ready or provide all the tools needed to pass the KCSA. Instead, it’s an opportunity to engage with Kubernetes security concepts and think critically about cloud-native security. The KCSA exam, if you choose to take it, will be one potential milestone in your journey, but not the sole focus here.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have a better understanding of Kubernetes security concepts and a shared sense of growth through learning together. Let’s embark on this collaborative journey and expand our knowledge as we explore the world of Kubernetes security.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Detection Engineering Masterclass: Part 2!\n\n\nDon't Purchase if you haven't gone through Part 1!\n\n\nTwo Part Course Overview\nThis course will first teach the theory behind security operations and detection engineering. We’ll then start building out our home lab using VirtualBox and Elastic’s security offering. Then we’ll run through three different attack scenarios, each more complex than the one prior. We’ll make detections off of our attacks, and learn how to document our detections. Next we’ll dive more into coding and Python by writing validation scripts and learning out to interact with Elastic through their API. Wrapping everything up, we’ll host all our detections on GitHub and sync with Elastic through our own GitHub Action automations. As a cherry on top, we’ll have a final section on how to write scripts to gather important metrics and visualizations.\n\n\nThis course takes students from A-Z on the detection engineering lifecycle and technical implementation of a detection engineering architecture.\n\n\nWhile this course is marketed as entry level, any prerequisite knowledge will help in the courses learning curve. Familiarity with security operations, searching logs, security analysis, or any related skillset will be helpful (but ultimately not required).\n\n\nPart Two Overview\nThis is part two of a two part series on Detection Engineering! This course is meant to kickstart anyone interested in security analysis, detection engineering, and security architecture.\n\n\nThe first part is the meat of the course, where we will go over:\nDetection Engineering Theory\nSetting Up our Lab\nWorking with Logging and our SIEM\nRunning Attack Scenarios to generate logs and create alerts\nLearn how to use Atomic Red Team for testing\n\n\nThe second part deals with detection as code philosophies, which will be very Python and GitHub heavy (but don't worry! I'll walk you through everything step by step.)\n\n\nBy the end of this two part course, you'll have a full stack detection engineering architecture. You'll be able to:\nRun offensive tests\nReview the logs\nMake alerts\nSave alerts using a standardized template\nEnforce template data through code\nProgrammatically push the alerts to the SIEM\nRun periodic metrics off the detection data\n\n\nThe entire course runs ~11 or so hours in length, but should take ~20-40 hours to complete fully. All code written will be available on the course GitHub in case you'd like to skip the Python heavy sections.\n\n\nRequirements\nThe ability to run 2-3 VMs on a local machine:\nUbuntu Linux\nParrotOS\nWindows 11\n\n\nMinimum Requirements\nCPU Cores: 4\nRAM: 8gb\nHard Drive Space: 50GB\n\n\nRecommended Requirements\nCPU Cores: 6+\nRAM: 16GB+\nHard Drive Space: 50GB+\n\n\nYou can technically get by with the main host having only a couple cores and 8 gigs of RAM, but any additional resources that can be assigned to your VMs will make the process smoother.\n\n\nThanks for stopping by!",

      "description": "The rapid advancement of quantum computing presents both opportunities and significant cybersecurity risks. As quantum computers become more powerful, they threaten traditional encryption methods, making it imperative for organizations to prepare for a post-quantum world. This course provides a comprehensive framework for understanding Quantum Cybersecurity Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), equipping professionals with the knowledge and strategies needed to protect sensitive data and ensure regulatory compliance in the quantum era.\nWe begin with an introduction to cybersecurity and cryptography fundamentals, covering key concepts such as encryption, hashing, and secure communications. From there, we explore quantum computing fundamentals, explaining how quantum principles like superposition and entanglement impact computational power and security protocols.\nThe course then delves into quantum cybersecurity, focusing on post-quantum cryptography (PQC)—new encryption techniques designed to withstand quantum attacks—and quantum key distribution (QKD), an advanced cryptographic approach leveraging quantum mechanics for ultra-secure communication.\nBuilding upon this technical knowledge, we introduce the principles of governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), including regulatory frameworks, security policies, and enterprise-wide risk assessment models. As we transition into quantum-specific GRC, we examine quantum cybersecurity governance, outlining best practices for integrating quantum resilience into corporate security policies. The course also covers quantum cybersecurity risk management, offering in-depth insights into threat modeling, risk assessment methodologies, and response strategies tailored for quantum-era threats. Finally, we address quantum compliance, analyzing how organizations can align with evolving regulations and develop strategies to maintain compliance with emerging global standards.\nBy the end of this course, learners will gain a strategic, well-rounded understanding of quantum cybersecurity risks and compliance mandates. They will be equipped to implement effective governance models, conduct quantum risk assessments, and ensure regulatory adherence in a rapidly changing technological landscape.\nThis course is ideal for cybersecurity professionals, risk managers, compliance officers, policymakers, and technology leaders preparing for the inevitable transition to quantum-secure frameworks.",

When combined, they supply a strong Threat Prevention solution. Data from malicious attacks are shared between the Threat Prevention Software Blades and help to keep your network safe.\n\n\nIPS: A complete IPS cyber security solution, for comprehensive protection against malicious and unwanted network traffic, which focuses on application and server vulnerabilities, as well as in-the-wild attacks by exploit kits and malicious attackers.\n\n\nAnti-Bot: Post-infection detection of bots on hosts. Prevents bot damages by blocking bot C&C (Command and Control) communications. The Anti-Bot Software Blade is continuously updated from ThreatCloud, a collaborative network to fight cybercrime. Anti-Bot discovers infections by correlating multiple detection methods.\n\n\nAntivirus: Pre-infection detection and blocking of malware at the gateway. The Anti-Virus Software Blade is continuously updated from ThreatCloud. It detects and blocks malware by correlating multiple detection engines before users are affected.\n\n\nThreat Emulation: This innovative solution quickly inspects files and runs them in a virtual sandbox to discover malicious behavior. Discovered malware is prevented from entering the network. The Emulation service reports to the ThreatCloud and automatically shares the newly identified threat information with other customers.\n\n\nThreat Extraction: Protection against incoming malicious content. The extraction capability removes exploitable content, including active content and embedded objects, reconstructs files to eliminate potential threats, and promptly delivers sanitized content to users to maintain business flow. To remove possible threats, the blade creates a safe copy of the file, while the inspects the original file for potential threats.",

I then took it upon myself to create this course and have tremendous, absolute faith in its value. No prerequisites but you'll leave with tons of new information.\n\n\nWe cover nuances and don't just gloss over topics. For example, we help you understand when SaaS is considered part of your organization's portion of \"shared responsibility\", or why computers have both a unique MAC Address and IP Address when you in theory only need one identifier (the answer is NOT because one is layer 2 and one is layer 3!).\n\n\nAt a little less than 2 hours in length, this course delivers a tremendous amount of information in a short amount of time and manages to do so extremely clearly. Knowledge of the material in this course will make you extremely employable in the cloud, computer networking and cybersecurity spaces.\n\n\nIf you want to take your career to a stratospheric new level, take this course, apply the wealth of knowledge that you gain, and never look back!",

I actually used these tests for my own preparation and made use of this portal to format them into multiple choice that I could refer too. I have now decided to publish them.\n\n\nI have designed these tests to help anyone preparing to gain this accreditation and to hopefully provide questions that are in keeping with what is considered in scope when it comes to studying for the PCIP. My goal is to help learners feel more confident by providing questions that will help them ensure they have covered various topics/requirements.\n\n\nThe questions are designed around the new PCI DSS version 4 requirements and ask specific questions around some of the changes that have recently come into affect. Please be aware that the questions vary in regards to difficulty and this has been purposely done to ensure fundamentals of knowledge are included. I would rate each test as slightly different levels of difficulty, with practice test 3 being the hardest. I am aware that there are some duplicate questions which have different wording and/or possible answers, this has been done to ensure key points (especially around how often something is done) are remembered.\n\n\nMy personal advice is to go over these multiple times as revision.\n\n\nThe tests included are designed to replicate the format of the real exam, which means there are 75 questions and a 90 minute timer.\n\n\nRegardless of whether you are using these tests to help you prepare.

On average every 39 seconds there is a hacker attack affecting one in three Americans every year!\nFACT! 43% cyber-attacks target small business\nDid you know that the average pay of an Ethical Hacker is approx. 88k/year in US. In this course we will learn the practical approach which Ethical Hackers follows in real world scenarios.\nOur primary focus on this course is showing practical approach but we will NOT Ignore any theoretical concepts as well. We will start this course from very basic and setup Ethical Hacking Lab Environment then we will look some basics of Networking and investigate Internal Networking. In which we will cover scan types, port scanning, advance scanning then we will spend time on vulnerability scanning of internal network. After that we will see how Red Team generates report for executives and for technical department.\nAfter covering these topics, we will move to the second phase of our course which is based on exploitation and we will start with network exploitation and networks sniffing in which we cover ARP Protocol, ARP poisoning and MITM based attacks\nIn the third phase of this course we will look Web Servers and Web Applications starting with Web Server Information Gathering and Reconnaissance following with File upload vulnerability on Server then we will look brute force attack on Web Applications after we that we will cover SQL Injection and OWASP ZAP\nIn the end we will look Social Engineering and cover Social Engineering Scenario based attack strategy.\nNotes:\nThis Course is created for educational purpose only, all the vulnerability assessment and exploitation are done in our own lab environment which we have fully permissions.\nThis course is fully copy right of Arsalan Saleem & SecureTechware no other organization is associated with it or any certificate exams.

      "description": "Welcome to this complete course about web application penetration testing. The course doesn't require any prior knowledge of testing web applications for security vulnerabilities nor it requires any level of coding knowledge although it's preferred.\nThis course covers web application vulnerabilities in a practical fashion using practical labs designed for demonstrations. The course contains a theoretical part to explain the concepts and a practical part for demonstration. Course theoretical part is packed into a downloadable PDF file as well.\nYou will learn everything by doing and the course shows practical demonstrations on vulnerable systems designed for practicing your skills in web application penetration testing.\nAt the end of this course learners should achieve the below objectives:\n\n\n· Understand Web application penetration testing methodology\n· Understand the concepts of web application vulnerabilities\n· Be able to conduct manual testing of web application vulnerabilities\nThe course is divided to cover 10 most common web application vulnerabilities covered in the OWASP top 10 list as of 2022.\n1- Injection vulnerabilities: Injection vulnerabilities are very common in today's websites. In this section you will get to understand what causes an injection vulnerability and be able to uncover its existence by looking through and testing the right parts in any web application. In injection vulnerabilities we cover the below categories\n· SQL Injection: Most common vulnerabilities against databases. You will learn the different types of SQL injection vulnerabilities in addition to the ability to test and uncover a SQL injection by performing practical exercises against vulnerable pages.\n· SQLmap: After you learned how to manually test for SQL injection, here you will learn how to automate your testing using one of the most popular tools used in SQL injection\n· Command Injection: Command injections comes as one of the most dangerous web application vulnerabilities as it allows for complete takeover the system. In this section, you will learn how to spot a command injection vulnerability and how to perform a proof of concept.\n2- Broken Access Control: This vulnerability also comes in the OWASP top 10 list as of 2022. We will cover to reveal weakness areas in a website that would allow unrestricted access to sensitive resources.\n3- Broken Authentication: This section will teach you how to bypass authentication methods such as login forms.\n4- JSON Web Tokens: JWTs are not considered as a web application vulnerability rather a kind of cookies used for authorization. In this section we will go through the process of showing the mechanisms of testing and exploiting these tokens.\n5- Sensitive Data Exposure: This section will reveal techniques that are used to see if a website has security measures against data leaks.\n6- SSRF aka server side request forgery: One of the recently added vulnerabilities to the OWASP top 10 list. You will learn how to use it make a website reveal sensitive resources and load internal running services.\n7- SSTI aka server side template injection: not commonly talked about but this section explains how such vulnerability may lead to devastating outcomes such as command injection and full system takeover.\n8- XSS aka Cross Site Scripting: Very well known and popular web application vulnerability. In this section we will practically explain Stored, Reflected and DOM-based XSS.\n9- XXE aka XML External Entity Injection: a vulnerability that occurs as a result of poor XML implementation. We will explain how XML works and see different techniques to exploit XXE.\n10- CSRF aka Cross Site Request Forgery: Very popular vulnerability that when exploited allows for unauthenticated actions against users. We will learn practically how to perform and setup a testing environment to uncover CSRF.",

      "description": "Welcome to the \"Encryption Academy for Beginners\" course. Encryption is an important part of cybersecurity because it can protect data from unauthorized access.\n\n\nCOURSE LAUNCHED IN Juli 2023\n\n\nBeginners welcome: no need to know anything about Encryption!\n\n\nEncryption Academy for Beginners\nThis complete academy consist of the following 4 courses:\n\n\n\"Introduction to Encryption\"\nIn this course you will get an introduction to three important topics to better secure your data.\nAs Bonus: \"Password based Authentication\" and \"2-Factor Authentication\"\nAs a bonus, I added the topics \"Password based Authentication\" and \"2-Factor Authentication\" in this first course. When we digitally authenticate ourselves on the Internet, we usually use a password. In this course I show you the disadvantages of passwordbased authentication and how a second factor can improve the security of your access.\nIn the practical exercise, I will show you the USB device YubiKey, which can be used for 2-factor authentication.\nBut the Yubikey can do even more. I'll show you how to store your certificate with key material on it, for example, to digitally sign a PDF document in Adobe Acrobat.\n\n\n\"Hard- and Softwareencryption\"\nNowadays we store important data on our notebooks and often we use portable USB devices to transport data. What happens if you lose these devices? Encryption can protect you from others being able to use your data. I will give you a short introduction to what encryption means and how it works in general. In the practical exercises, I will show you how to use a few small tools to encrypt your data quickly and easily.\n\n\n\"Digital Signature\"\nThe second big topic is digital signature. For example, when you send emails to your customers, how do they actually know that your emails are authentic? Any email format can be copied these days. In the SPAM folder we often get emails that look like they were sent by real companies but were created by hackers.\nHow do your recipients know that your emails are really from you?\nIn the course \"Introduction to Encryption\" you will learn how a digital signature works and how any data can be protected against manipulation.\nIn the practical exercise I already show you in the first course how you can calculate hash values over any files.\nIn this course I will also show you how to protect your PDF documents in Adobe Reader with a signed timestamp. With a timestamp you can have your document signed and thereby prove that your document existed at that time. I'll show you how to do that in this tutorial.\n\n\n\"Digital Certificate\"\nThe third major topic you will learn in this academy is called \"Digital Certificate\". How can you actually protect your digital identity? When you sign your e-mails or documents, for example, you need a confirmed digital identity. Each of us has an ID card, which we use to authenticate ourselves in the analog world. In the digital world, we can legitimize ourselves with digital certificates.\nIn the course \"Introdcution to Encryption\" I explain briefly how a digital certificate works. In the practical exercises I already show you how you can get a free digital certificate quickly and easily. This certificate is only for testing purposes. But you will already learn what is actually contained in it. You should already understand what information about you is secured. Additionally, I will show you how to sign a PDF document in Adobe Acrobat with this certificate.\n\n\n-----------------------------------\nInstructor\nI'm Mike Kurtze, an engineer from Germany and a senior software developer in the area of encryption since 2005. With my Encryption Academy for Beginners I want to show you with my knowledge and experience how encryption works and which tools you can use to protect your sensitive data.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nThis course also comes with:\nLifetime access to all future updates\nA responsive instructor in the Q&A Section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nA 30 Day \"No Questions Asked\" Money Back Guarantee!\nJoin me in this course if you want to learn how encryption works and and which tools you can use to protect your sensitive data.",

      "description": "This course, Google Cloud Security Best Practices, is an in-depth, practical guide designed for cloud professionals, security engineers, architects, system administrators, and compliance officers who want to secure their workloads on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). As cloud environments grow increasingly complex, adopting a proactive and structured security posture is no longer optional—it is essential. This course equips learners with both the conceptual understanding and the technical implementation skills needed to build, manage, and scale secure cloud environments in GCP.\nWe begin by demystifying the Shared Responsibility Model in GCP, establishing a clear understanding of which security controls are managed by Google and which fall under the customer's responsibility. This is followed by an overview of GCP’s native security services, such as Cloud IAM, Cloud KMS, VPC Service Controls, Cloud Audit Logging, and Security Command Center, each designed to strengthen different aspects of the cloud security architecture.\nThe course dives deep into the foundational pillars of cloud security—Identity, Network, Data, and Operations—and teaches how to apply key principles like least privilege, defense in depth, and zero trust across GCP services. Students will gain hands-on knowledge through modules that include ensuring IAM policies don’t allow access to personal email accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforcing security keys for admin accounts, and preventing the use of user-managed service account keys.\nWe also cover crucial topics such as service account permission restriction, automated KMS key rotation, and preventing public access to Cloud Storage and BigQuery datasets. Network-level best practices include enabling VPC Flow Logs, blocking project-wide SSH keys, and disabling serial port and IP forwarding on VM instances. Additionally, students will learn how to enable OS Login for centralized SSH access, configure Cloud Audit Logs, set up log sinks, and define log retention policies.\nData protection topics cover enforcing HTTPS for App Engine, requiring SSL for Cloud SQL, restricting public IP access, and enabling automated backups to safeguard against data loss. Each module includes clear implementation steps, ensuring students can directly apply what they learn using the GCP Console or gcloud CLI.\nBy the end of this course, learners will be able to design and maintain a secure GCP environment that aligns with modern cloud security frameworks and compliance standards such as CIS Benchmarks, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA. This course is essential for any team seeking to operationalize security at scale within GCP.",

IPsec includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to use during the session. IPsec can protect data flows between a pair of hosts (host-to-host), between a pair of security gateways (network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host (network-to-host). Internet Protocol security (IPsec) uses cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IPsec supports network-level peer authentication, data-origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection.\n\n\nPKI - A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.\n\n\nWeb Encoding - URL Encoding (Percent Encoding) URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. Since URLs often contain characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted into a valid ASCII format. URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a \"%\" followed by two hexadecimal digits.\n\n\nSymmetric Crypto - Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext. The keys may be identical or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys.\n\n\nAsymmetric Crypto -    Asymmetric Encryption is a form of Encryption where keys come in pairs. ... Frequently (but not necessarily), the keys are interchangeable, in the sense that if key A encrypts a message, then B can decrypt it, and if key B encrypts a message, then key A can decrypt it.",

A malicious cyber actor might take advantage of flaws in device management and configurations to establish presence and maintain persistence within a network. Adversaries are increasingly focusing on targeting specialized and embedded devices, such as routers and switches, rather than only standard endpoints. They achieve this by managing routing protocols, exploiting configuration flaws, and introducing malware into the operating systems.\n\n\nIn the cybersecurity world, that means making that device more secure and resilient to attacks. By hardening a device, you are making it more difficult to break into for hackers.\nMinimizing attack surface, or surface of vulnerability, and potential attack vectors\nHardening the Firewall Configuration\nHardening the Network devices Firewalls, Routers and Switches etc\nThe possibility of unwanted access to a network's infrastructure is decreased by hardening network equipment.\nManagement interface is kept secure, and access is limited to only those administrators that need access.\nAccessing internet resources from offline management\nAdmin accounts also need to be set so they only have access to the sections of the configuration they need to access and use external authentication.\nPassword security\nKeep Content and Software Updates Current Patch vulnerability\nSet up notifications for system and configuration log messages\nMonitor system and configuration logs\n\n\nPractical Firewall Penetration Testing\nFirewall penetration testing is the process of locating, investigating and penetrating a certain firewall in order to reach the internal trusted network of a certain system.\nMostly considered to be a key part in external network penetration testing, firewall In this video we discussed the below points.\nLocating The Firewall\nConducting Traceroute\nPort Scanning\nBanner Grabbing\nFirewall Enumeration Testing\nThe Firewall Policy\nFirewalking\nHow to identify Firewall Specific Vulnerabilities\nFirewall Penetration Test Process/Checklist\nBelow Tools used during:\nNMAP\nHPING3\nFirewalk\nNetwork audit tool\nTracert\nTraceroute\n\n\nThis course also covered the Best Deployment practices Hardening Network Devices used in the industry and some real-world scenarios including the Tips and Tricks.

      "description": "Cyber security; In information systems, we can define it as the protection of the security, integrity and confidentiality of our communication, life, integration, tangible or intangible assets and even our data in the electronic environment.\nIn today's technology age, we have begun to reflect and live a large part of our lives in electronic media. Not just us individuals! States, public institutions, social platforms, SMEs, and all private companies, large and small, have also started to communicate with the services and products they offer to us consumers or other companies and institutions through virtual environments.\nThis world, which we describe with concepts such as the virtual world and the cyber world, now takes place with the data we have produced with our virtual and real assets and our lives. We do most of our communication with other people in electronic media. In all this virtual life we have mentioned, we have to protect ourselves and our institutions against cyber attackers. At this point, we come across the definition of “Cyber Security”.\nThe word cyber is the name given to networks whose infrastructure is information systems. It can also be defined as virtual reality in general. In short, Cyber Security is the protection of the integrity and confidentiality of the life lived on cyber networks, the infrastructure of which is information systems.\nInformation security and cyber security are often used interchangeably but are different from each other. Information security is defined as the protection of the integrity, security and confidentiality of information and its boundaries are drawn with globally accepted standards such as ISO 27001, ITIL, COBIT. However, it is a much broader concept that includes information security, the infrastructure of which is information systems.\nWhat is Cyber Security for Institutions? How is Data Security Provided?\nWhen we look at the concept of cyber security from the perspective of institutions, companies and SMEs, the concept of information security comes first. “Data / information” comes first among the assets owned by institutions. Organizations can compile, process, sell, rent or use the knowledge they have to produce a product/value. Many standards have been established in the global world for information security, which is of critical importance for institutions. ISO 2701 is the first and only auditable information security standard globally produced for organizations. They are responsible for protecting their confidential data and their most important asset, \"information\", by ensuring information security.\nIn this course, you'll learn all about cybersecurity, with lessons for the uninitiated. Necessary warnings and precautions will protect you from possible future dangers.\nYou will learn basic and general security measures related to informatics and computers with experience and solid knowledge.\nThis course includes lessons that everyone of all ages and genders should know.",

A security vulnerability is a technological weakness that enables attackers to compromise a system, device, network, database, or application and the information these assets hold.\nA corporate network may contain many vulnerabilities at different levels. Vulnerability management helps achieve continuous visibility into the vulnerabilities within the corporate environment, identifying the most critical vulnerabilities and prioritizing remediation efforts to minimize the attack surface efficiently and appropriately.\n\n\nHow Does a Vulnerability Management System Work?\nA vulnerability management system works to immediately flag the most critical vulnerabilities. It takes contextual input, such as business, exploitation, threat, and risk data, and generates mitigation recommendations for identified vulnerabilities.\nA vulnerability management program continuously assesses, evaluates, repairs, and reports on vulnerabilities to help organizations manage and address security vulnerabilities daily. It enables organizations to discover vulnerabilities quickly, address the most critical issues first, and avoid overlooking serious weaknesses.\n\n\nEvaluating Vulnerability Management Tools\nVulnerability management tools scan corporate networks for vulnerabilities that potential intruders could exploit.
