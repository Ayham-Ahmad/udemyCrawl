      "description": "Let me be honest: \"This course may not cover 100% of the MCIA content, but it comes very close, offering comprehensive coverage of most key topics to help you get started and excel in your certification and practical integration architect journey., It provides a path to get started on your MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect (MCIA) journey. You would need to explore little more on different runtime configurations.\"\nHowever, while I’ve tried to cover most sections in full, certain areas like practical setups for runtime options such as CloudHub DLB (Dedicated Load Balancer), RTF (Runtime Fabric), etc. could not be executed practically. The reason is straightforward: I do not have access to a MuleSoft Enterprise account, when i tried to get on for practice I realized it is expensive.\n\n\nWhy I Created the MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect (MCIA) Course: TWO REASONS-\nThe journey to achieving the MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect (MCIA) certification is both rewarding and challenging. As someone who has been through this process, I understand the hurdles and costs involved, which inspired me to create a course that makes this path more accessible and practical for learners.\nREASON 1. Certification Preparation: A Costly Challenge & Material Wasn’t Available In One Single Place Challenge\nPreparing for the MCIA certification self is not easy, it needs a lot of R&D and exploration where as the Salesforce MuleSoft Trailhead training for the MCIA certification costs $4,500 USD. This price tag is steep for many professionals, especially those self-funding their certification journey.\nWhen I embarked on my preparation, I realized that the complete MCIA material wasn’t available in one single place. To truly understand the certification’s requirements and concepts, I had to spend months conducting extensive research and development (R&D), gathering information, exploring various resources, and building a comprehensive understanding of the topics.\nAfter successfully passing the MCIA exam, I reflected on the time, effort, and challenges I faced. This motivated me to create a course that consolidates the information I gathered, helping others by saving them countless hours of effort. The course compiles the MCIA content I explored, along with practical Proof of Concepts (POCs) I built to understand the concepts better.\nHowever, I want to be honest with my audience: This course does not cover 100% of the MCIA content. While I’ve covered most sections in full, certain areas like practical setups for runtime options such as CloudHub DLB , RTF (Runtime Fabric), etc. could not be executed practically. The reason is straightforward: I do not have access to a MuleSoft Enterprise account, which is prohibitively expensive. Although I explored how these runtime options work conceptually and included that information in the course, practical execution in those areas is limited.\n\n\nREASON 2. To Help You Work as an Integration Architect\nWhile the course serves as a valuable resource for MCIA certification preparation, its benefits go beyond just passing an exam. I firmly believe that this course can equip you to work as an integration architect in real-world scenarios.\nHere’s why:\nStandards and Best Practices: The course dives deep into MuleSoft's recommended practices, ensuring that you design solutions that are scalable, maintainable, and efficient.\nDesign Patterns: You’ll learn integration design patterns that are crucial for making informed decisions while designing and implementing solutions.\nPractical Application: The concepts and POCs included provide a solid foundation for understanding the role of an integration architect.\nReusable Frameworks: The course includes examples of reusable frameworks that streamline development, promote consistency across projects, and reduce effort when implementing repetitive tasks. These frameworks can be adapted to various use cases, allowing you to work smarter and faster.\nThe key to excelling as an architect is the ability to make key decisions whether it’s choosing the right integration pattern, optimizing performance, or ensuring security and scalability. This course is designed to help you develop those decision-making skills.\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe journey to becoming a MuleSoft Certified Integration Architect is about more than just passing an exam it’s about developing the skills, knowledge, and mindset needed to excel in the integration space. This course is designed to help you take the first step, providing you with the resources and guidance needed to succeed.\nWhether you’re preparing for the certification or striving to become a better architect, I hope this course serves as a valuable resource on your journey. Let’s make learning accessible, practical, and impactful together.\nThank you, and I wish you success in your journey!",

Synapse contained very rich features, not only to the engine itself to increase performance, but also to add new functionality in providing a unified analytics experience for diff data teams.\nIn the most recent study conducted by GigaOm in January 2019 for the TPC-H benchmark report shows that Synapse Analytics is 14 times fast and still 94% cheaper than any other leading service in the market.\nAnd that's why clients are shifting to Azure and Azure is growing at nearly twice the rate of Amazon Web Services. Azure Synapse Analytics truly is a game-changer in Data processing and Analytics.\nAccording to a 2019 Dice report, there was an 88% year-over-year growth in job postings for data engineers, which was the highest growth rate among all technology jobs. If you are interested in this domain, there cannot be a better time to start learning Azure Synapse Analytics Data Warehouse then now.\nI hope you will join me on this exciting journey of learning this technology.\n\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics Service\nWhy we should consider warehousing solutions in the cloud?\nAnd then we'll discuss Microsoft's brand new Azure Synapse analytics service, and how this service brings together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics, and provide a unified experience to ingest, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.\nAdvantages of Synapse analytics service over other cloud-based analytics services.\nWe will discuss the difference between Traditional vs Modern vs Synapse Architecture.\nYou will also see Azure Synapse studio which provides a unified experience for all Data Professionals. So, whether you are Data Engineer, Data Scientists, Database administrator, business analysts or any other IT professional, you will find your space in Synapse studio.\nAnd then finally in Demo, we'll provision new Azure Synapse Analytics Service, we will see how to pause or resume compute node which is very important, and how to set firewall rules and connect with SQL Server Management studio\n\n\nInternal and Architecture\nIn this module where you are going to learn Azure Data Warehouse famous MPP or Massive parallel processing architecture.\nAnd then we'll discuss various cloud data warehousing internal but important concepts like storage and data distribution through Hash, round-robin and replicated tables\nWe will learn not only different Data types and table types like columnstore, heap and Clustered B-tree index, but we will also learn best practices around, how to partition our data into these diff table types.\nWe will discuss in detail about distribution key and how to analyses the table to find the best distribution key according to partition.\nThen we'll discuss how to apply these concepts in dimensional modeling.\nAnd then finally we'll take a case of Microsoft's famous Adventure works DW, we will download and restore it in our on-premises management studio, and we will analyze the distribution and the data types for Data Warehouse and we will prepare it to migrate to Cloud data warehousing.\n\n\nData Migration\nIn this module, we will learn about data loading or data migration in the Azure Data warehouse service\nWe'll start with learning the best practices of loading data in MPP architecture\nThen we'll learn about different loading methods and we will learn the difference between Single client loading methods and Parallel readers loading methods\nWe will see specifically the difference between SSIS and PolyBase loading methods, and why PolyBase is preferred for large tables.\nWe will learn the PolyBase process in detail and go through all steps to set up the PolyBase environment.\n\n\nSecurity\nIn this module, we will take a look at how we can secure our azure SQL data warehouse\nActually, without security, nothing else really matters and that's why Microsoft Azure provides 5 layers of defense to secure your Azure SQL Database\nFirst is Threat Protection - This is a most outer layer of security, and in this Microsoft Azure constantly monitor the traffic to your Azure SQL Database and look for suspicious patterns.\nThen the next comes to Network Security - Network security is to make sure only requests which are coming from valid IP addresses can access your database.\nAuthentication and Access control are part of Access Management\nAuthentication - Authentication is about validating your credentials like User Name/User ID and password to verify your identity.\nAnd Access control or Authorization determines what kind of access the authenticated user has over particular resources.\nAnd finally comes the Data Protection layer - Microsoft provides different information protection and encryption technologies to protect our data in your Azure SQL Database.\n\n\nConfiguration and Optimization\nIn this module, we'll examine configuration settings and common tasks that are available to us inside the Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics service portal.\nWe will see it is how incredibly easy to backup and restore data warehouse in the Synapse Analytics service portal.\nThen, we will take a look at price optimization and will see how you evaluate different configuration suits best for your needs.\nWe will learn about Managing workload, which helps solution Architects to ensure that data warehouses always have enough resources to hit SLA for classic data warehousing activities like loading, transforming and querying data.\nWe will learn different monitoring tools like query activity, alerts, metrics, diagnostic settings and resource health provided by Synapse portal. We will also look at the option to submit a support ticket to Microsoft in case you are not able to resolve the issue at your end.\nAnd Finally, we are going to delete all the resources we created during Demo, this is very important to avoid any charges when you are not using the system.\n\n\nData Warehouse Crash Course\nIn this module, you will learn, what is Data Warehouse, Why we need it and how it is different from the traditional transactional database.\nWe will learn the concept of dimensional modeling which is a database design method optimized for data warehouse solutions.\nThen I will explain what we mean when we say facts and their corresponding fact tables. What are dimensions and their corresponding dimension tables\nhow are these special kinds of tables joined together to form a star schema or snowflake schema.\nThis section will establish the foundation before you start my course on Azure Synapse Analytics or formally known as Azure SQL Data Warehouse.\nSome students Feedback (from other courses)\nOne of the most amazing courses i have ever taken on Udemy. Please don't hesitate to take this course. The instructor is really professional and has a great experience about the subject of the course. - Khadija Badary\nVery nicely explained most of the concepts. a must have course for beginners - Manoranjan Swain\nI appreciate this course explaining everything in great detail for a beginner.

I have taken a couple of his courses on various aspects of databases and he never disappoints.\"\nKaren says: \"This course helped me to clear the exam with 903.\"\n\n\nWe'll start off with looking at relational data. We'll create an Azure account, install an Azure SQL Database and query it. We'll then look at the 6 different clauses of the SELECT statement - SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY. After this, we'll have a look at other relational databases, including Azure Databases for PostgreSQL, MariaDB and MySQL.\nAfter that, we'll look at non-relational data using semi-structured and non-structured data. We'll look at the five different Cosmos DB database  interfaces or APIs, and which one you should use for your particular needs. We'll also look at Table, Blob and File storage.\nWe'll then look at analytics workloads, including Azure data services for modern data warehouses such as Azure Data Lake, Synapse Analytics, Databricks and HDInsight.\nFinally, we'll look at Microsoft Power BI and how to create basic reports and dashboards.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get a free Azure trial!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have finished this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of core data concepts and how they are implemented using Microsoft Azure data services. And with some practice, you could even go for an official Microsoft certification - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume? And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.",

Our complete Practice Tests have helped 15,000+ students get certified.\nAll questions are crafted by cybersecurity specialists and reviewed by an experienced professor. The commitment to excellence and the quality of our content is unmatched.\n\n\nFEATURES & BENEFITS\n1. Authentic exam experience.\nQuestions are written in the same tone and format as the real exam (which is distinct from the ISC² preparation exam and quizzes).\nPlease note: At the time of writing, some questions of the real CC exam relate to topics that are not properly explained in the (ISC)² Study Guide. At present, our preparation tests are THE ONLY AVAILABLE STUDY RESOURCE that specifically helps you tackle those topics. These questions will be marked in with a star in the practice exams.\nOur 6 full practice exams also have the same number of questions, covering all the domains of the CC course with the same relative weight of the official exam:\nChapter 1 - Security Principles (~26%)\nChapter 2 - Incident Response, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Concepts (~10%)\nChapter 3 - Concepts of Access Control (~22%)\nChapter 4 - Network Security (~24%)\nChapter 5 - Security Operations (~18%)\n2. Detailed explanations of each question.\nAt the end of each answer, you get a detailed explanation that includes references to the study material. Notably, each correct option is justified, and (very important) each incorrect choice is also justified. You will learn to explain WHY the correct answer is the right answer, as well as why the remaining options (even though they may sometimes appear similar) are wrong.\n3. High-quality and relevant questions.\nExam questions are written and reviewed by an experienced professor, and then further reviewed by Cybersecurity specialists who have taken the CC exam themselves, so as to further guarantee quality and relevance.\n4. Full control throughout the entire exam.\nPause or stop the exam whenever you like and practice on your own time, at your own pace and as many times as you want.\n\n\nPlease check out our Spanish and Chinese versions of the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) Full Practice Exam on Udemy.\n\n\nTESTIMONIALS\nDon't take our word for it, hear some of the many inspiring testimonies from our successful students:\n\"A great addition to the (ISC)2 course, got me used to the more complex questions with a lot of variety in the different tests.

Also all my questions were answered ! Amazin course 110/100 - María Fernanda Villegas CascoU\n\nThe course was really helpful in learning data cleaning, data manipulation and data visualization. Newer library of plotly was something very new to me. while practizing with the dataset I got to know the pros of using plotly (simple, clear and interactive plots). Overall the coverage of the course with dataset from various industries and their problem set was very comprehensive and I think would match the industry scenario well. Also, I learned a whole new plethora of methods that are being called on class objects which I wasn't familiar with before taking this course.Thanks for your support in Q&A as well.- Abhishek Gajbhiye\n\n\n\n\nCan you start right now?\nA frequently asked question of Python Beginners is: \"Do I need to become an expert in Python or R coding before I can start working on Data Analytics Projects ? \"\nThe clear answer is: \"No!\nYou just require some Python or R Basics like data types, simple operations/operators, lists and numpy arrays that you can learn from my Free Python course 'Basics Of Python'\nAs a Summary, if you primarily want to use Python for Data Science/Data Analysis or as a replacement for Excel, then this course is a perfect match!\n\n\nWhy should you take this Course?\nIt explains Projects on Real Data and real-world Data Science/Data Analytics Problems. No toy data! This is the simplest & best way to become a Data Analyst/Data Scientist\nIt shows and explains the full real-world Data. Starting with importing messy data, cleaning data, merging and concatenating data, grouping and aggregating data, Exploratory Data Analysis through to preparing and processing data for Statistics, Data Analytics , Machine Learning and Data Presentation.\n\n\nProfessionals who are exposed to data but can't yet leverage its power\n\n\nProduct managers who want to make data-driven decisions\n\n\nIt gives you plenty of opportunities to practice and code on your own.

You’ll also hone your hands-on skills to succeed as a network engineer in the real world. I’m a professional instructor who has been entrusted by Cisco since 2007 to develop and deliver training courses for their own engineers and partners. I’ve also designed multiple training courses for the largest service providers in the Asia Pacific region such as IBM, Verizon, and the Australian National Broadband Network.

When you take my course you can learn anytime you want in the comfort of your own home, and I’m always here for you whenever you need any help.\nNot sure about the best way to pay for this course? Ask your manager at work if they’ll expense it. They won’t have to pay the large fees of traditional classroom learning or have to cover your absence for a week. They get huge value from this investment in your future.\nI’m excited to share all of my knowledge with you.\nJoin me on this journey to turbocharging your career!",

Was nice that it included some of the more important material to help review instead of just leaving the previous certification information as all \"assumed knowledge\" and passing the buck. As always, these courses continue to be the best training I have used so far. (Jonathan B., 5 stars)\nI have been in the industry for between 5 and 10 years, and needed a refresher on several of these topics before taking the exam. Course is designed well, so you can focus on those areas that you need to, while listening to the others in the background as a refresher for the others. (Jamie R., 5 stars)\nI would recommend it to anyone aspiring to complete your examinations at the end, I completed the course and successfully passed my exams on the first attempt (Bankole K., 5 stars)\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will earn 46 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA Tech+, A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",

      "description": "Complete preparation for the Azure AZ-305 exam.\nCOURSE BONUS: Free study guide PDF available for download inside the course.\nMicrosoft Azure is a skill in high demand in today's large business marketplace.\nAccording to Microsoft, Azure is being used by 85% of the Fortune 500 companies, particularly with their hot Office 365 suite\nUse of Azure has grown 51% year-over-year\nSalary survey sites report that Azure Architects earn up to US$170,000 per year across the United States\nMicrosoft has more than 100 data centers, across 60+ regions and 10 geos, making it one of the largest data centers in the world.\nThis course also goes through the requirements of the Azure AZ-305 exam: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions, section by section.\nI'm quite confident that this is the most complete training course targeted specifically at the exam.\nWhile the technology world is full of \"buzzwords\" and \"flavors of the month\", the cloud is a real paradigm shift in the way solutions are designed and architected. There are now so many reasons why you should include Azure cloud technology in the design of your solution that there are almost no reasons why not to do it.\nCost savings is the one that catches the attention of businesses. Some companies are spending millions of dollars per month of their IT infrastructure, and every few years that hardware needs to be repaired and upgraded. Being able to reduce capital investment and essentially rent powerful equipment on demand is quite a lot of upfront savings.\nIf you add in the scalability, flexibility, and worldwide reach of the cloud and the technology group sees the potential as well. You can truly do more with less.\nThis course goes through all of the requirements of the Microsoft exam AZ-305 exam: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions. Multiple videos are devoted to each sub-objective, and we cover the topic thoroughly.\nMost of the courses and content you find online assume you already have expert knowledge of Azure and just tells you what to study, spending only seconds covering entire objectives. I can confidently say this course goes deep on everything you need to know.\nIf you ARE already an expert at many Azure topics, you can easily skip the sections that you already know and focus on the ones you have not yet had much exposure also. This is the benefit of having the complete course.\nEach section has additional web-based resources for you to do further research and expand your knowledge beyond the requirements of the exam.\nEnroll today!\nVersion history\nV1.0 Launched Aug 2019\nV1.1 OCT 2019 - Updates to audio quality. English closed captions added.\nV1.2 DEC 2019 - Review of exam updates. Course updated for the latest requirements.\nV2.0 SEP 2020 - AZ-304 updates have started. New and updated videos being added.\nV2.1 JAN 2021 - New videos added - JIT access, Azure Policy, Azure Blueprint, Resource Graph, Storage Migration Service.\nV2.2 MAY 2021 - Course update with new content - Cost Optimization, Storage Management, Maintainability.\nV3.0 NOV 2021 - Updated with AZ-305 content.\nV3.1 JUN 2022 - Updated\nV3.2 AUG 2023 - Updated\nV3.3 SEP 2023 - Updated\nMicrosoft, Windows, and Microsoft Azure are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.

Very well done!\"\nDavid says: \"Philip takes time to explain things on a basic level so a novice to the topic can start building knowledge from scratch, following it up by in-depth explanations and details. The practice activities are also a very nice touch!\"\nWarren says: \"This course is absolutely phenomenal in preparation for the DP-700 but also learning if you have zero experience. Microsoft Fabric is quite a large platform, and the exam can be very broad. Phillip does an outstanding job of covering an incredible amount of content in an easy-to-understand manner. The practice activities are well thought out and actually quite helpful in applying what is being taught.\nThere are other resources out there, but this tops them all. Phillip is also incredibly responsive to any questions out there. I cannot understand why anyone would not give this course 5 stars.\"\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\nFollowing a quick look around Fabric, we will look at using Dataflow Gen2 and pipelines - ingesting and copying data, and scheduling and monitoring data pipeline runs.\nNext we'll manipulate data using PySpark and SQL in a notebook.\nWe'll have a look at loading and saving data using notebooks.\nWe'll then manipulating dataframes, by choosing which columns and rows to show.\nWe'll then convert data types, aggregating and sorting dataframes,\nWe will then be transforming data in a lakehouse, merging and joining data, together with identifying missing data or null values.\nWe will then be improving notebook performance and automate notebooks, together with creating objects, such as shortcuts and file partitioning.\nFollowing this, we'll look at using a data warehouse - transforming data, creating an incremental data load, and managing and optimizing them.\nWe'll then create an eventhouse, and find out how to transform data using KQL:\nWe'll select, filter and aggregate data.\nWe'll manipulate data using string, number, datetime and timespan functions.\nWe'll end these sections by transforming data, merging and joining data and more.\nFinally, we will look at ingesting and transforming streaming data, including revising KQL knowledge from the DP-600 exam, workspace settings and monitoring.\nNo prior knowledge is assumed. We will start from the beginning for all languages and items, although any prior knowledge of PySpark, SQL or KQL is useful.\nOnce you have completed the course, you will have a good knowledge of using notebooks to manipulate data using PySpark. And with some practice and knowledge of some additional topics, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification DP-700 - wouldn't the \"Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate\" certification look good on your CV or resume?\nI hope to see you in the course - why not have a look at what you could learn?",

The trial period can be further extended up to 90 days.\nPlease note,\nThe trial ABAP system is optimized for cloud usage; therefore, not all the features of an on-premise ABAP system are available. For example, SAP GUI and ABAP report programs are not available since screen processing is not suitable for cloud operations.\nWe have used a proper on-premise ABAP system with a HANA database and not a trial ABAP system for the explanations of all the practice examples discussed in this course. It's recommended to use a proper on-premise ABAP system with the HANA database, but if you don't have such a system, as a secondary option, you can use a free trial ABAP system on the SAP cloud platform.\n\n\nTo make the best of this course\nGet access to an ABAP on the HANA system and practice on it\nAnswer quiz questions for self-evaluation\nFollow the order in which lectures are arranged\nBased on the title, feel free to skip certain parts\nUse the given code for fast and correct results\n\n\nLatest Updates:\n11 April 2024: Added videos on BTP, and RAP\n15 Aug 2025: Added videos on CDS built-in functions\n\n\nOther Courses :\n1.

Any content herein is explicitly my own based on publicly available information about the exam contents.\nDo you need to earn your Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v10) certification? If so, you've come to the right place.\nHi, my name is Ric Messier, and I’m an information security (IS) expert with decades of professional experience as a programmer, system administrator, network engineer, security engineering manager, VoIP engineer, and consultant. I’m also an adjunct instructor at Harvard University and a best-selling tech book author who has personally trained thousands to pass various IS certification exams including CEH.\nThe CEH is an entry point to part of the broad world of information security. This course covers the range of topics that are covered in the CEH certification. This includes:\nthe importance of ethics\nbasic testing methodology\nwireless networks\nsocial engineering attacks\nweb application testing\nThe importance of ethical hacking isn't in the breaking, it's in the fixing. To that end, you will need to understand remediations, like good software development practices, remediating web application vulnerabilities as well as policies and standards that should govern all information security practices within an organization.\nThe CEH is a very dense exam. It covers a very broad range of material. This course will be a good resource for you to understand not only the material but the breadth of the material. As EC-Council expects you to have two years of experience before you can even register to take the exam, I don't expect this course alone will be enough for you to pass the test. Hands-on experience will help a lot. While this course is an excellent way to start preparing for the exam, I will also mention other resources you can use to set yourself up for success.\nThere is a lot to learn, so let's get started!\nCertified Ethical Hacker and CEH are registered trademarks with EC-Council.

This is THE practice exams course to give you the winning edge.\nThese practice exams have been co-authored by Stephane Maarek and Abhishek Singh who bring their collective experience of passing 18 AWS Certifications to the table.\nThe tone and tenor of the questions mimic the real exam. Along with the detailed description and “exam alert” provided within the explanations, we have also extensively referenced AWS documentation to get you up to speed on all domain areas being tested for the AIF-C01 exam.\nWe want you to think of this course as the final pit-stop so that you can cross the winning line with absolute confidence and get AWS Certified! Trust our process, you are in good hands.\nAll questions have been written from scratch!\nYou will get FOUR high-quality FULL-LENGTH practice exams to be ready for your certification\n\n\nQuality speaks for itself:\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nWhich of the following are valid model customization methods for Amazon Bedrock? (Select two)\n1. Continued Pre-training\n2. Fine-tuning\n3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n4. Zero-shot prompting\n5. Chain-of-thought prompting\n\n\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 1,2\nExplanation:\nCorrect options:\nModel customization involves further training and changing the weights of the model to enhance its performance. You can use continued pre-training or fine-tuning for model customization in Amazon Bedrock.\nContinued Pre-training\nIn the continued pre-training process,  you provide unlabeled data to pre-train a foundation model by familiarizing it with certain types of inputs. You can provide data from specific topics to expose a model to those areas. The Continued Pre-training process will tweak the model parameters to accommodate the input data and improve its domain knowledge.\nFor example, you can train a model with private data, such as business documents, that are not publicly available for training large language models. Additionally, you can continue to improve the model by retraining the model with more unlabeled data as it becomes available.\nFine-tuning\nWhile fine-tuning a model, you provide labeled data to train a model to improve performance on specific tasks. By providing a training dataset of labeled examples, the model learns to associate what types of outputs should be generated for certain types of inputs. The model parameters are adjusted in the process and the model's performance is improved for the tasks represented by the training dataset.\n\n\nModel customization - reference image\nvia - reference link\n\n\nBenefits of model customization - reference image\nvia - reference link\n\n\nIncorrect options:\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows you to customize a model’s responses when you want the model to consider new knowledge or up-to-date information. When your data changes frequently, like inventory or pricing, it’s not practical to fine-tune and update the model while it’s serving user queries. To equip the FM with up-to-date proprietary information, organizations turn to RAG, a technique that involves fetching data from company data sources and enriching the prompt with that data to deliver more relevant and accurate responses. RAG is not a model customization method.\n\n\nZero-shot prompting\nChain-of-thought prompting\nPrompt engineering is the practice of carefully designing prompts to efficiently tap into the capabilities of FMs. It involves the use of prompts, which are short pieces of text that guide the model to generate more accurate and relevant responses. With prompt engineering, you can improve the performance of FMs and make them more effective for a variety of applications. Prompt engineering has techniques such as zero-shot and few-shot prompting, which rapidly adapts FMs to new tasks with just a few examples, and chain-of-thought prompting, which breaks down complex reasoning into intermediate steps.\nPrompt engineering is not a model customization method. Therefore, both these options are incorrect.\n\n\nWith multiple reference links from AWS documentation\n\n\n\n\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course. I teach about AWS certifications, focusing on helping my students improve their professional proficiencies in AWS.\nI have already taught 2,500,000+ students and gotten 800,000+ reviews throughout my career in designing and delivering these certifications and courses!\nI'm delighted to welcome Abhishek Singh as my co-instructor for these practice exams!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nThis is a huge original question bank\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-days money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\nWe hope that by now you're convinced!

There are ample jobs. They only need skilled individuals. They are ready to hire individuals with hands-on knowledge and those who outshine the interview process.\nA little more detail on Six Sigma Certification and its Benefits\nWhat is the Six Sigma Certification?\nSix Sigma is a strategically designed set of tools and techniques that help improve business processes within an organization. The primary goal of Six Sigma certification is to validate individuals (like you) who possess the skills to identify variations, defects, or errors in a business process and mitigate or eliminate them.\nThe Six Sigma Certification comes in various skill levels: Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, and Master Black Belt. These certifications can be obtained through an accreditation body like Advanced Innovation Group Pro Excellence (AIGPE) which trains and certifies professionals in 176+ countries.\nThese certifications also help you become a specialist in process improvement and will enhance your career's standard and credibility.\nWhat is Six Sigma Green Belt Certification?\nSix Sigma Green Belt is a certification course wherein you will receive a hands-on understanding of 100+ tools and techniques. These methods are essential for participating in DMAIC improvement projects. DMAIC stands for Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, and Control. These are the 5 Phases of a Six Sigma Improvement project. This is the only course that teaches these 5 Phases in 15 structured steps helping you understand the entire methodology in thorough detail. By taking up this certification course, professionals (like you) can identify the problems and implement solutions to eradicate them.\nWhat are the Benefits of Six Sigma?\nSix Sigma helps your organization reduce variation and eliminate errors\nAn organization has several business processes. Each business process has its own unique set of procedures followed by individuals working in that business. Acquiring Six Sigma certification enables YOU to become crucial to your organization's ability to identify and eliminate variation and repeatable process errors.\nWith a Six Sigma certification, you can help to transform and enable your organization to increase revenue by identifying and eliminating errors that would otherwise have brought poor customer satisfaction and losses to the business. Certified Six Sigma professionals can help reduce variation, errors, customer complaints, cycle time, cost, schedule delays and spending/revenue leakages.\nFor example: Between 1986 and 2001, Motorola saved 16 billion dollars using the Six Sigma methodology and General Electric (GE) saved 4.4 billion dollars between 1996 and 1999.\nImprove your business and sustain the gains\nOnce you attain the Six Sigma certification, you'll be able to prove you have the knowledge to identify gaps in an organization's business process and you will be able to measure, analyze and improve those gaps. You will also have the ability to conduct complete review of the current process and gain a very clear understanding of their impact on the output.\nYou'll also develop the ability to achieve exceptional improvements in your business and sustain them by monitoring processes closely to ensure there is little or no deviation from the mean and taking corrective measures to improve your implemented actions.\nSix Sigma is applicable across industries\nWhat is the value of Six Sigma certification? As an industry independent methodology, Six Sigma techniques are applied in aerospace, electronics, telecom, banking and finance, IT, HR, marketing, and many more industries.\nGetting a Six Sigma certification can lead to better job opportunities and improved salary - even though its not easy to attain. One of the reasons Six Sigma professionals get so much respect is that the practical applications of Six Sigma tools and techniques require creative and out-of-the-box thinking - and executives and hiring managers at major companies are well aware.\nWith a Six Sigma certification, you will be able to position yourself as a change agent within the organization, spearheading quality improvement throughout your team or organization, showcasing your leadership skillset. When you get certified in Six Sigma, you become knowledgeable in dozens of different methods to streamline business processes, improve employee acceptance, reduce costs, and increase revenue - all of which lead to better bottom line, no matter the industry.\nAs a professional, you need to adapt yourself to the changing demands of your industry. No matter what industry you are a part of, you need to learn to adapt your knowledge to different situations.\nEnsure Compliance\nWith the stringent quality standards of Six Sigma, manufacturing and service errors are reduced to less than mediocre figures. This has meant that a number of vendors, procurers, and oversight organizations apply Six Sigma standards when evaluating products or accounts. As a certified Six Sigma professional, you will be able to help your organization comply with international standards, as well as maintain profitable contracts.\nImprove Your Managerial and Leadership Ability\nSix Sigma training also prepares you for leadership roles, with the techniques and knowhow to cut costs, increase revenue, and ways to improve the efficiency of the business process. Those who achieve Six Sigma Green Belt are not only educated on the methodologies of Six Sigma, they are also prepared to become a change agent within their organization, leading efforts to improve processes and the quality of products and services delivered to customers.\nOnce you complete your Six Sigma course and obtain your certification, you will have a clear understanding of measuring and quantifying financial benefits from executing any Six Sigma project. Because financial management and risk assessment are highly desirable skills for middle and top-level management, certified Six Sigma professionals stand a very good chance of rising to senior managerial positions.\nMind-blowing Salary\nAccording to a survey carried out by a well known Salary Analyzing website, the salary for Six Sigma certified individuals routinely break into the $100,000+ pay bracket, and are among the highest-paid professionals globally.\nGain Hands-On Experience In Quality Management\nUnlike a few other certifications, the Six Sigma certification process includes hands-on work on industry projects and experience with implementation of theoretical principles to real-life scenarios. As a certified Six Sigma professional, you will gain valuable experience even before you enter the workforce.\nReady to get started on the path to Six Sigma Green Belt? AIGPE's Lean Six Sigma Green Belt program is taught by a Certified Six Sigma Master Black Belt with an industry experience of over two decades in implementing Quality Management and will help you become a successful Lean Six Sigma Practitioner.\nSo why wait?

      "description": "UPDATED FOR 2024 with updated questions & answers, more detailed explanations, and more realistic questions.\nNervous about the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty exam? You should be! It's arguably the toughest certification exam AWS offers, as it not only tests AWS-specific knowledge, but your practical experience in machine learning and deep learning in general. It's tough to know what to expect on the exam before going in.\nThis practice exam offers a realistic, full-length simulation of what you can expect in the AWS MLS-C01 exam. It's not a \"brain dump,\" but a complete, 65-question, 3-hour practice exam with original questions of the same style, topics, difficulty, and breakdown of the real exam. It's a great test of your readiness before you decide to invest in the real exam, and a great way to see what sorts of topics the exam will touch on. We also include a 15-question warmup test that will give you a rough idea of your readiness in just a half an hour.\nThe author of this exam, Frank Kane, is a popular machine learning instructor on Udemy who passed the AWS Certified Machine Learning exam himself on the first try - as well as the AWS Certified Big Data Specialty exam, which the Machine Learning exam builds upon. Frank spent over 9 years working at Amazon itself in Seattle, as a senior manager specializing in some of Amazon's early machine learning development.\nJust like the real exam, this practice exam tests four different domains:\nData Engineering\nExploratory Data Analysis\nModeling\nMachine Learning Implementation and Operations\nYou'll need deep and broad knowledge of SageMaker and AWS's other machine learning services, including Rekognition, Translate, Polly, and Comprehend. You'll need to know how to process big data using Kinesis, S3, Glue, and Athena. And you'll need a strong knowledge of AWS security, including use of KMS and IAM.\nBut AWS knowledge is not enough to pass this practice exam, or the real thing! You also need deep knowledge on data science, feature engineering and tuning your machine learning models. Do you really understand regularization techniques and how to use them? Do you really understand precision, recall, and AUC? Do you know how different deep learning models work, and how they are used? This practice exam will let you find out. Every question includes an explanation of the correct answer as well.\nDon't risk hundreds of dollars and hours of your time on the AWS Certified Machine Learning Exam until you're sure you're ready for it. This practice exam is a good test of that readiness, and a good taste of what to expect. It's worth the effort - this AWS certification is the most elite one there is right now!\nThis practice exam is a bargain compared to the official AWS practice exam, and it's three times as long! Buy it now, and get some extra peace of mind as you head into your testing center.",

Your company is mid-way on their journey of migrating all of their applications to GCP. For now, some of the resources are present on-premises and the rest are on GCP. The VMs on Compute Engine communicate with on-premise servers through Cloud VPN over private IP addresses. A database server running on-premises is used by several applications running on GCP. You want to make the GCP applications don’t need to do any configuration change in case the IP address of the on-premise database changes. What should you do?\n\n\nA. Configure Cloud NAT for all subnets of your VPC, which will be used by VMs for egress traffic.\nB. Create a private zone on Cloud DNS. Configure the applications using the DNS name.\nC. Store the IP of the database as a custom metadata entry inside each instance, and query the metadata server.\nD. Write code in applications to query the Compute Engine internal DNS to retrieve the IP of the database.\n\n\n\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because Cloud NAT is used to provide internet access to resources and that’s not the requirement here. Configuring Cloud NAT for all subnets of the VPC would only handle egress traffic from the VMs. It does not address the issue of the on-premise database IP address changing and the GCP applications needing to be reconfigured.\n\n\nB is correct because:\n- Cloud DNS forwarding zones let you configure target name servers for specific private zones. Using a forwarding zone is one way to implement outbound DNS forwarding from your VPC network.\n- In our case, it is mentioned that we have a hybrid, VPN, VPC, etc and the only thing we need is not to be dependent on IP change. From Google documentation private zone on Cloud DNS (Option-B) will help us to solve this issue.\n- Creating a private zone on Cloud DNS and configuring the applications to use the DNS name allows for dynamic resolution of the database IP address. By using the DNS name instead of the IP address directly, any changes to the IP address can be managed by updating the DNS record, without requiring any configuration changes in the GCP applications.\n\n\nC is incorrect because the custom metadata will need to be updated whenever the IP address of the database changes. Storing the IP of the database as a custom metadata entry inside each instance would still require the GCP applications to reference the metadata server and retrieve the IP. Any changes to the IP would still require updating the metadata entries and potentially updating the applications as well.\n\n\nD is incorrect because querying the Compute engine DNS does not help because the database server is on-premises. Writing code in applications to query the Compute Engine internal DNS to retrieve the IP of the database would still require manual changes to the applications if the IP address of the database changes. It does not provide a dynamic solution to handle changes in the database IP address.\n\n\n\n\n**See you inside the course and hope to see you too build the core certification knowledge!",

Very easy to follow.\" - Linda Shen\n\"Excellent course, valuable lessons, very well taught at a great pace.\" - Shane Tanberg\n\"Must get tutorial. Love it\" - Hayford I Osumanu\n\"Perfect step by step guide to learning. Best I've seen.\" - Charles Schweiger\n\"This course is very well thought out. Its one of the better 70-461 courses on Udemy.\" - Isrrael M\n\n\nThis course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate 70-461: \"Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012\" and 70-761 \"Querying Data with Transact-SQL\".\nPlease note - these certificates are no longer being offered by Microsoft. However, the exam requirements allow you to have a good understanding of T-SQL.\nIt also will help with the current exams DP-300 (Azure Database Administrator Associate) and DP-600 (Implementing Analytics Solutions Using Microsoft Fabric)\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\n\n\nSession 1\nThe basics presented are: how to install SQL Server, and how to create and drop tables.\nWe then try to create a more advanced table, but find that we need to know more about data types - so we go into some detail about data types and data functions, the foundation of T-SQL.\nSession 2\nWe'll create tables which use these, and then INSERT some data into them. Then we'll write queries which will retrieve and summary this data, using SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY.\nWe'll then JOIN these tables together to find where we are missing data and where we have inconsistent data. We'll then UPDATE and DELETE data from the tables.\nSession 3\nWe'll now use that data to create views, which enable us to store these SELECT queries for future use, and triggers, which allow for code to be automatically run when INSERTing, DELETEing or UPDATEing data.\nWe'll look at the database that we developed in session 2, and see what is wrong with it. We'll add some constraints, such as UNIQUE, CHECK, PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints, to stop erroneous data from being added some data.\nSession 4\nWe will further encapsulate our routines by creating procedures, allowing us to EXECUTE parameterised commands with just one statement, and we'll add some error handling with TRY, CATCH and THROW.\nWe'll also combine datasets together, by looking at UNION and UNION ALL, INTERSECT and EXCEPT, CASE, ISNULL and Coalesce, and the mighty MERGE statement.\nSession 5\nWe'll will now be creating aggregate queries. We'll be reviewing the ranking functions ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK and NTILE. We'll look at the 8 analytic functions news to SQL Server 2012, such as LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE.\nWe'll look at alternative ways of grouping and adding totals, using ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS and GROUPING_ID. We'll also look at the geometry and geography data types, plotting locations on a grid, together with functions and aggregates.\nSession 6\nWe'll will now be creating sub-queries and correlated subqueries, where the results of the subquery depend on the main query. We'll be looking at Common Table Expressions using the WITH statement, and we'll be using what we have learned to solve a common business problem.\nWe'll be looking at functions, including the three different types of User Defined Functions (UDF): scalar functions, inline table functions, and multi-statement table functions. We'll then look at synonyms and dynamic SQL, and the use of GUIDs. We'll also look at sequences.\nWe'll have a look at XML and, for SQL Server 2016 and later, we'll examine JSON and Temporal Tables.\nSession 7\nIn this session we'll be looking at transactions, seeing how to explicitly start and end them, and finding out how they can block other users in the database. Then we'll see about how to indexes and their role in optimising queries.\nWe'll also see how we can use Dynamic Management Views to see how we can improve our use of indexes. We'll then look at how to write a cursor, and when to use this row-based operation, and the impact of using scalar UDFs.\nNo prior knowledge is required - I'll even show you how to install SQL Server on your computer for free!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information.\nOnce finished, you will know what how to manipulate numbers, strings and dates, and create database and tables, create tables, insert data and create analyses, and have an appreciation of how they can all be used in T-SQL.",

I had some difficulties with some of the topics of the exam and this whole course and videos made a lot of them more clear. The course is a must for people looking to pass the exam, the test exams reinforce the knowledge gained but of course do not include actual exam questions.\"\nSteven says: \"Great course at showing the content tested in the DP-300 course. The practice tests and quizzes were not at all similar to the actual DP-300 exam, but through taking this course (and applying the knowledge gained) I was able to get my certification on the first try.\"\nPardeep says: \"Must say i didn't expect to to provide such thorough Azure flavor from DBA standpoint\nmost of the courses on Udemy do have azure courses but they are from system admin standpoint(with dba portion added here n there)\nthis course is nicely crafted and most of nuances are explained clearly\nalso, there's a pdf in resources which has the notes & its something to hold on to for quick reference for future.\nThank you much for the course!!!\"\n\n\nThis course teaches the requirements for the Microsoft Certificate DP-300 \"Administering Relational Databases on Microsoft Azure\", and focuses on administrating Azure SQL Databases, Azure SQL Managed Instances, and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. We concentrate for most of the course on Azure SQL Databases, and then look at the additional functionality for Managed Instances and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.\nIn the first part of this course we will be concentrating on the Azure SQL Database. We'll start off with getting a free trial of Azure, installing SQL Server Management Studio, and briefly reviewing the 6 principal clauses of the SELECT statement. We will then look at how to optimize query performance and evaluate performance improvements.\nWe will then look at the various Data Platform Resources and how they compare. Following this, we will have a deep dive into configuring Azure SQL Database resources for scale and performance, including serverless and provisioned, vCore and DTU, and database partitioning techniques. We will then evaluate strategies for migrating to Azure.\nThen we look at how to implement a secure environment for your Azure SQL Database. We will look at how to configure database authentication and authorization by using platform and database tools; how to Implement security for data at rest and in transit; and how to implement compliance controls for sensitive data.\nAfter this, we will look at how Monitor and Optimize Operational Resources. This includes Monitoring activity and performance, implementing performance-related maintenance tasks, and identifying performance-related issues.\nLastly for Azure SQL Database, we will look at how to Automate tasks and Perform backup and restore a database by using database tools, Recommend an HADR strategy for a data platform solution, and more about Performing Administration by Using T-SQL.\nIn the second part of the course, we will turn to Virtual Machines and Managed Instances and those features which are not available in Azure SQL Database. We will start by configuring them and access them, either in SSMS or using a Remote Desktop Connection. Then we’ll look at strategies for configuring database authentication, and filegroups.\nWe’ll Evaluate and implement an alert and notification strategy, Identify performance-related issues using tools we couldn’t use in Azure SQL Database, and Create scheduled tasks. Finally, we’ll Perform backup and restore a database in Virtual Machines by using database tools, and Recommend, test and configure High Availability and Disaster Recovery strategies.\nSome prior knowledge is required, but not much. You’ll need to know how to use the Select statement; and it would be helpful, but not essential, if you had a little background in Microsoft Azure.\nSome prior knowledge of SQL Server is required. Specifically, you need to know:\nHow to create a SELECT statement,\nHow to create views and stored procedures,\nHow to create backups and restore a database.\nThis content is available in \"98-364: Database Fundamentals\", which is published on Udemy.\nAdditionally, prior knowledge of Azure, such as that shown in Microsoft's DP-900 exam is helpful, but is not required.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good knowledge of how to administer Azure SQL Databases, Azure SQL Managed Instances, and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. And with some practice, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification DP-300 - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume? And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.\nI hope to see you in the course - why not have a look at what you could learn?",

This course will help prepare you to take and pass the exam.  Specifically, this course will help you understand the details of:\n\n\nBuilding and deploying ML models to solve business challenges using Google Cloud services and best practices for machine learning\nAspects of machine learning model architecture, data pipelines structures, optimization, as well as monitoring model performance in production\nFundamental concepts of model development, infrastructure management, data engineering, and data governance\nPreparing data, optimizing storage formats, performing exploratory data analysis, and handling missing data\nFeature engineering, data augmentation, and feature encoding to maximize the likelihood of building successful models\nUnderstand responsible AI throughout the ML development process and apply proper controls and governance to ensure fairness in machine learning models.\nBy the end of this course, you will know how to use Google Cloud services for machine learning and just as importantly, you will understand machine learning concepts and techniques needed to use those services effectively.\n\n\nUnlike courses that set out to teach you how to use particular Google Cloud services, this course is designed to teach you services as well as all the topics covered in the Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Exam Guide, including machine learning fundamentals and techniques.\n\n\nThe course begins with a discussion of framing business problems as machine learning problems followed by a chapter on the technical framing on ML problems.  We next review the architecture of training pipelines and supporting ML services in Google Cloud, such as:\nVertex AI Datasets\nAutoML\nVertex AI Workbenches\nCloud Storage\nBigQuery\nCloud Dataflow\nCloud Dataproc.\nMachine learning and infrastructure and security are reviewed next.\nWe then shift focus to building and implementing machine learning models starting with managing and preparing data for machine learning, building machine learning models, and training and testing machine learning models. This is followed by chapters on machine learning serving and monitoring and tuning and optimizing both the training and serving of machine learning models.\nMachine learning operations, also known as MLOps, borrow heavily from software engineering practices. As a machine engineer, you will use your understanding of software engineering practices and apply them to machine learning.  Machine learning engineers know how to use ML tools, build models, deploy to production, and monitor ML services. They also know how to tune pipelines and optimize the use of compute and storage resources.\nMachine learning engineers and data engineers complement each other.  Data engineers build services and pipelines for collecting, storing, and managing data while machine learning engineers use those data services as a starting point for accessing data and building ML models to solve specific business problems.",

This course covers the additional content required for the PL-400 certification exam, current as per the PL-400 exam update of 29 August 2025.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\n\n\nWhat do people like you say about this course?\nAssia says: Very interesting content ! and like always, the explanation way is amazing !\nElijah says: Matches the quality of all of Phillip Burton's other lessons. So far I have passed several exams using his courses in-tandem with MS learn modules.\nRanjith says: Crystal clear explanation with standard english and quality practical, I wish I had this course earlier...\nAnuli says: Awesome course, the explanations were easy to understand, thank you. Consider updating some parts of the course.\n\n\nThis course teaches the requirements for the Microsoft Certificate PL-400 \"Power Platform Developer\", and focuses on programming in JavaScript/TypeScript and C# to expand the Power Platform.\nWe'll start off by looking at extending the user experience. Using Visual Studio Code, we will create some JavaScript code that will run when our model-driven app is opened. We'll then create some command buttons, along code to run when the user clicks these. We will then concentrate on create code components, replacing existing parts of the model-driven app.\nWe'll then look at creating a plug-in. The code that we'll write in Visual Studio will be attached to messages created by Power Platform, allowing our code to run when Dataverse rows are created, updated or deleted. We'll also look at creating our own custom messages as well.\nNext up is Custom Connectors. We will create an Azure Function, and find out when it can run. We will then integrate that Function into our Power Platform by creating a custom connector. We'll also register external endpoints, including in Azure, so that messages can be automatically sent to other apps, reducing the burden on the Power Platform.\nWe'll finish off by looking at creating a technical design, and any other requirements not covered in previous exams, such as advanced Power Automate flows and implementing Application Lifecycle Management (ALM).\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get a free Power Platform trial!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good knowledge of how to make extend Power Platform using JavaScript and C#. And with some practice, and knowledge gained when studying for the PL-200 exams, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification PL-400 - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume? And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.\nSo, without any further ado, let's have a look at how you can use Udemy interface, and then we'll have a look at the objectives for the exam and therefore the syllabus for this course.",

      "description": "The amount of information and concepts that you need to understand in order to pass the Administrator exam is massive. This course is the most in-depth and complete course you'll find and I encourage you to not settle for a lightweight course that glosses over or entirely skips key concepts that you need to know.\nI have authored a book for this certification by a major tech publisher, so you can trust that I have thought through your learning journey thoroughly. I don't teach trivia - I teach conceptually, so that you succeed on the exam and in your career.\nI am the best-selling Saleforce instructor on the Udemy platform because I get results for you and know and understand the platform.  There are no shortcuts, so don't be fooled by someone selling you a happy/easy path. You are on the correct course right now and here you will learn all that you need and be well thoroughly equipped for the exam.\nAlso, there is a better way to learn Salesforce now. And that better way is leveraging the power of ChatGPT to deepen and broaden your Salesforce learning and understanding. I am the only Salesforce instructor teaching how to use ChatGPT to prepare for certification exams.\nThe reason this is is because ChatGPT makes many certification prep and resume/job sites and services OBSOLETE.\nYou can now create your own practice test questions, study guides, flash cards, and even get massive help on your resumes and interview prep, LinkedIn presence and more, for free, with AI.\nRather than trying to hide this new reality from you, I am embracing this revolutionary technology to take your learning and potential earning to the next level.\nThat is why I recorded a brand new and updated version of this course to leverage the power of ChatGPT to help you prepare for and pass the Salesforce Certified Platform Administrator Exam in record time!\nThis course includes a ChatGPT Prompt Library. You can copy and paste all of the prompts I use inside this course into your own free ChatGPT account. This ChatGPT Prompt Library will help you to learn the now in-demand skills for Prompt Engineering!\nWith the power of ChatGPT you can now do amazing things such as creating apex code to mass update records, create formula fields, validation rules, and so much more.\nI have worked on the Salesforce platform for well over a decade. I have helped hundreds of thousands of students attain one or multiple Salesforce certifications.\nI have been teaching on the Udemy platform since 2016 and this is my fourth full revamp of this course. I continually work in the latest Salesforce release to remain current and am constantly updating this course.\nIn addition to the hundreds of in-depth video lessons inside this course, you will also find a Practice Test at the end of this course. It contains 60 questions, and is timed at 90 minutes. You receive Section Level Feedback, just like in the real test. I provide further details and explanations as to why your answers are either correct or incorrect.\n\"I'm at (Salesforce's) Destination Success right now and your course goes more in-depth than the classroom courses here, and for 1% of the cost!\" - Ben L.\nThe Complete Salesforce Platform Administrator Certification Course is for anyone interested in passing the Administrator Certification exam. This course is designed with the new Salesforce administrator in mind. I cover each section of the Administrator Study Guide in-depth, giving examples in the interface, as well as hands-on experience so you  can apply the concepts you are learning.\nAfter 90,000+  Survey ratings for my courses, the students have spoken:\n\"Are you learning valuable information?\" 99.6% answered YES\n\"Are the explanations of the concepts clear?\" 99.8% answered YES\n\"Is the instructor knowledgeable about the topic?\" 99.9% answered YES\nIf you are interested in becoming a Salesforce Platform Admin, take this course. Here are some recent reviews and feedback this course has received:\n\n\"Mike, your course was great! I took the Admin Essentials class by Salesforce in which my company paid over 2000 dollars for in person live training and the training did not come close to anything on the exam. Your course helped me to get properly prepped and covered all the pertinent aspects of the 201 exam in which I passed.\" ~ Harris L.\n\"Very well presented, excellent video quality, incredibly easy to follow. Covers more than what is necessary (not a criticism), Creator is a legend, I've contacted him multiple times and had a response within 5 minutes. Could not rate any higher ! Definitely the best choice out of the courses offered for this qualification. Amazing.\" ~ Paul R.\n\"I'm amazed that a training program of such great quality is available for such a reasonable price! Mike is a wonderful trainer and the material covered is excellent!\" ~ Rick A.\n\"Mike is awesome and learning so much so far! Mike thanks so much for the really awesome course! I am sure that when I take the admin exam soon that I will pass with flying colors!!\" ~ James W.\n\"This is the best course so far. Thank you for your video.\" ~ Christian M.\n\"I have been using SF as a rep, not an admin and while I already had a working knowledge of the product and it's capabilities this is very insightful material and I have learned a lot of new things.\" ~ Alexis K.",

It is the students responsibility to have these to practice with.\nThe Cisco Packet Tracer & VIRAL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab) are Cisco proprietary software and can only be obtained through Cisco.\nHowever, students have more options that those. They can create their own lab with real equipment, get BOSON or GNS3.\nIt is up to each student to obtain the simulator/emulator of their choice to study along with this course.\nPlease also NOTE:  .pkt files are not up-loadable to UDEMY's site.\nThis means you would have to replicate my labs here in order to practice and follow along.\n\nThis course will give students an in-depth understanding of networking, using routers and switches and their various configurations and connections. Students will learn how to configure; default, static and dynamic routing. Students will comprehend how to manipulate each of the routing protocols attributes to meet the requirements of the network.\nThis course will also prepare the student in Layer 2 technology and its various configurations, such as; VLAN’s, VTP, STP, PortFast, EtherChannel, Port-Security, Inter-VLAN communication & Trunking; plus the newest requirements for the CCNA (200-125) certification exam as well.\nStudents will also acquire the knowledge needed to secure their routers through the use of Access-list, configuring the different types of NAT & will be able to manage the router’s components.\nStudents will also be able to thoroughly grasp the concepts of both Internet Protocols; IPv4 & IPv6.\nWide Area Network Protocols will also be covered; HDLC, PPP & Frame Relay. The student will also learn how to create redundancy in their networks through the use of Redundancy Protocols such as HSRP which is just as important. Also, within the WAN, the student will also learn how to create VPN’s and GRE Tunnels.\nThis is a full comprehensive course that will take you from A-Z in your quest for the CCNA (200-120) & now includes Cisco's NEW CCNA (200-125).\nAbout \"the book\":\nThroughout the course, you will hear me mention \"your book\", \"a book\" or \"the book\"...and if you're wondering why I don't mention a name...it's because this was done on purpose.\nI don't want anyone to purchase a book if you already have one...all CCNA study guides cover the same thing in different manners. So if you already have a CCNA book, you can use it with this course.\nHowever, for those that wonder which book I use in this course...here they are:\nSybex book by Todd Lammle  - CCNA 200-120\nAmazon book by Lazaro Diaz - The Only IP Book You Will Ever Need!\nHope you enjoy the course!\nLaz ;)",

A completely fresh course recorded in September 2020!\nCOURSE BONUS: Free study guide PDF available for download inside the course.\nGet your questions answered inside the course. A great value, since this course is updated as Microsoft changes the exam requirements over time. This course will be ready for you when you are ready to take the exam.\nWhat students are saying:\n5 stars, “Detail-oriented approach with specific objectives identified and tailored to a realistic, achievable goal.” - Robert G.\n5 stars, “Excellent for exam preparation!” - Sebastian R.\n5 stars, “Clear and crisp explanation by the instructor” - Vishwanath P.\nThis course has been continually improved and covers the AZ-303 Azure Architect exams.\nV4.3 Jan 2021 Updates. Covers the JAN 2021 changes to the AZ-303 exam. Added Azure Firewall Manager topic. Added  new videos about Firewalls.\nMicrosoft Azure is a skill in high demand in today's large business marketplace.\nAccording to Microsoft, Azure is being used by 85% of the Fortune 500 companies, particularly with their hot Office 365 suite\nUse of Azure has grown 60% year-over-year\nSalary survey sites report that Azure Architects earn US$130,000 to US$170,000 per year across the United States\nMicrosoft has more than 100 data centers, across 60+ regions and 10 geos, making it one of the largest data centers in the world.\nThis course is the complete study preparation course for the AZ-303 exams: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies.\nI'm quite confident that this is the most complete training course targeted specifically at the exam.\nWhile the technology world is full of \"buzzwords\" and \"flavors of the month\", the cloud is a real paradigm shift in the way solutions are designed and architected. There are now so many reasons why you should include Azure cloud technology in the design of your solution that there are almost no reasons why not to do it.\nCost savings is the one that catches the attention of businesses. Some companies are spending millions of dollars per month of their IT infrastructure, and every few years that hardware needs to be repaired and upgraded. Being able to reduce capital investment and essentially rent powerful equipment on demand is quite a lot of upfront savings.\nIf you add in the scalability, flexibility, and worldwide reach of the cloud and the technology group sees the potential as well. You can truly do more with less.\nThis course goes through all of the requirements of the Microsoft exam AZ-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies. Multiple videos are devoted to each sub-objective, and we cover the topic thoroughly.\nMost of the courses and content you find online assume you already have expert knowledge of Azure and just tells you what to study, spending only seconds covering entire objectives. I can confidently say this course goes deep on everything you need to know.\nIf you ARE already an expert at many Azure topics, you can easily skip the sections that you already know and focus on the ones you have not yet had much exposure too. This is the benefit of having the complete course.\nEach section has additional web-based resources for you to do further research and expand your knowledge beyond the requirements of the exam.\nEnroll today!\nVersion history\nV1.00-V1.19 - 19 updates to the course over a 2 year period of the 70-534 exam\nV2.00-V2.03 - 4 updates to the course over a 4 month period of the 70-535 exam\nV3.00-V3.60 - Course revised for AZ-300 content.\nV4.00 July 2020 Updates. Began complete re-recording for AZ-303, with videos being updated as I go.\nV4.1 Aug 2020 Updates. More fresh AZ-303 content added. 2.5 hours of new video added to the course.\nV4.2 Sep 2020 Updates. More fresh AZ-303 content added. Now 7.5 hours of brand-new video with AZ-303 content.\n\n\nMicrosoft, Windows, and Microsoft Azure are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.

EC-COUNCIL CEH CERTIFICATIONS\nThe CompTIA PenTest+ is your quickest and most cost-effective route to a pen testing certification\nThe PenTest+ includes the latest mobile and cloud penetration testing skills, including IoT, as well as traditional desktop & server systems (CEH covers only traditional desktop & server systems)\nThe PenTest+ better matches employer needs by covering not just technical topics, but also business processes, project flow, best practices, and professionalism in pen testing (CEH is strictly technical)\nThe PenTest+ exam voucher costs 381USD (compared to the CEH 1,150USD non-member plus application fee)\n\n\nTake a look at these student reviews:\n- “This is an excellent course!! Even in earlier chapters, the instructor gets you going on sample exercises to chop up the theoretical content a little, which always helps. With a course like this, hands-on is everything. I also appreciate that the theoretical parts are NOT TOO LONG AT ONCE!! Total Seminars did a fantastic job of breaking the content up in just the right places. LOVE this course!” – Chris N\n- “Amazing. Well Explained. Detail description for all the fundamental terms.” – Nisarg T\n- “Instruction was excellent. Including notes as resources was a big help! I reviewed the notes while watching the videos and I think that is really going to help me with information retention. The instructor used real-world examples to demonstrate points. Overall, I feel confident I can pass the test after studying the materials and doing the exercises the instructor emphasizes. The instructor also highlighted several key points to study for the exam for maximum preparation.” - Tim W\n- “This is what I was hoping for and it's much more upbeat than most of the lulling video series' I've seen before.” – John G\n- “This course covers everything in the approved CompTIA PenTest+ certification test. The presenter knows his stuff, has done real work pentests and does a good job of showing off the tools you'll be quizzed on and how to manipulate and analyze the results. Highly recommend this for anyone with Security+ that is looking to specialize as a pentester. Great place to start!” – Casey D\n- “Very well thought out course. The instructor is very knowledgeable, and the course is laid out in a great way! A lot of time was put into this and it shows!” – Luke P",

The course will help you understand how to backup multiple environments .\nVeeam was among the first vendors to develop backup software tailored to VMs. Before Veeam, backup applications failed to recognize the difference between protecting physical and virtual machines.\nVeeam Backup & Replication software is compatible with a variety of backup targets and can be used with VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V. The product works on the virtualization layer and is agentless. According to the vendor, the software has a recovery time objective of less than 15 minutes for all applications and uses built-in WAN acceleration to replicate data off-site up to 50 times faster than a raw data transfer.\n\n\nIn addition to backing up and recovering VMs, Veeam Backup & Replication can protect and restore individual files and applications for environments such as Exchange and SharePoint. It can also provide transaction-level restores of Oracle and Microsoft SQL databases.\n\n\nVeeam Benefits and Options\nThe Veeam Availability Suite provides five main capabilities. They are:\nRapid recovery: Choose exactly what you want to recover and how you want to recover it.\nAvoidance of data loss: Near-continuous data protection coupled with streamlined recovery methods\nVerified recoverability: Veeam stands by its ability to recover every application, file or virtual machine, with no exceptions.\nHigh visibility: Receive alerts and enjoy continuous monitoring to become aware of issues before they can affect operations.\nThe Veeam Availability Suite combines two products into a single solution: Veeam Backup & Replication for restoring and replicating information and Veeam ONE for monitoring and reporting. A smaller version of the Veeam Availability Suite, known as Veeam Backup Essentials, is available for smaller businesses that may not need the suite’s full capabilities.",

And to reinforce what you see and hear, you can follow along and work with the cloud console or command line utility to get hands-on experience with Google Cloud.\nIn this course, you will learn how to:\nCreate and configure virtual machine instances in Compute Engine using the Cloud Console and command line\nDive into Identity and Access Management (IAM), an important part of the exam\nDevelop decision making skills for choosing among compute, storage, and networking options\nFamiliarize yourself with the structure of the test and how to study for it, including tips on other study resources\nImprove your system management and DevOps skills by understanding how to monitor applications in the cloud\nUnderstand how machine learning and AI are incorporated in Google Cloud services, such as BigQuery\nThe Google Associate Cloud Engineer exam is two hours in length and contains 50 multiple-choice and multiple-select questions.

This is THE practice exams course to give you the winning edge.\nThese practice exams have been co-authored by Stephane Maarek and Abhishek Singh who bring their collective experience of passing 18 AWS Certifications to the table.\nThe tone and tenor of the questions mimic the real exam. Along with the detailed description and “exam alert” provided within the explanations, we have also extensively referenced AWS documentation to get you up to speed on all domain areas being tested for the SAP-C02 exam.\n\n\nWe want you to think of this course as the final pit-stop so that you can cross the winning line with absolute confidence and get AWS Certified! Trust our process, you are in good hands.\nAll questions have been written from scratch! And more questions are being added over time!\n\n\n=======\nQuality speaks for itself...\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nA silicon valley based unicorn startup recently launched a video-sharing social networking service called KitKot. The startup uses AWS Cloud to manage the IT infrastructure. Users upload video files up to 1 GB in size to a single EC2 instance based application server which stores them on a shared EFS file system. Another set of EC2 instances managed via an Auto Scaling group, periodically scans the EFS share directory for new files to process and generate new videos (for thumbnails and composite visual effects) according to the video processing instructions that are uploaded alongside the raw video files. Post-processing, the raw video files are deleted from the EFS file system and the results are stored in an S3 bucket. Links to the processed video files are sent via in-app notifications to the users. The startup has recently found that even as more instances are added to the Auto Scaling Group, many files are processed twice, therefore image processing speed is not improved.\nAs an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional, what would you recommend to improve the reliability of the solution as well as eliminate the redundant processing of video files?\nRefactor the application to run from Amazon S3 instead of the EFS file system and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket via an API Gateway based REST API. Configure an S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda function each time a file is uploaded and the Lambda in turn processes the video and stores the processed files in another bucket. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to send an in-app notification to the user containing the links to the processed files\nRefactor the application to run from S3 instead of EFS and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket. Configure an S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda function on each video file upload to S3 that puts a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the video processing instructions. Change the video processing application to read from the SQS queue and the S3 bucket. Configure the queue depth metric to scale the size of the Auto Scaling group for video processing instances. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to the user containing the links to the processed files\nRefactor the application to run from S3 instead of EFS and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket. Set up an EventBridge event to trigger a Lambda function on each file upload that puts a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the video processing instructions. Change the video processing application to read from SQS queue for new files and configure the queue depth metric to scale instances in the video processing Auto Scaling group. Leverage EventBridge events to trigger an SNS notification to the user containing the links to the processed files\nCreate an hourly cron job on the application server to synchronize the contents of the EFS share with S3. Trigger a Lambda function every time a file is uploaded to S3 and process the video file to store the results in another S3 bucket. Once the file is processed, leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to send an in-app notification to the user containing the links to the processed files\n\n\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 2.\nRefactor the application to run from S3 instead of EFS and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket. Configure an S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda function on each video file upload to S3 that puts a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the video processing instructions. Change the video processing application to read from the SQS queue and the S3 bucket. Configure the queue depth metric to scale the size of the Auto Scaling group for video processing instances. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to the user containing the links to the processed files\n\n\nFor the given use-case, the primary way to address the issues related to reliability, as well as redundant processing of video files, is by introducing SQS into the solution stack. SQS offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components. SQS locks your messages during processing, so that multiple producers can send and multiple consumers can receive messages at the same time. Using the right combination of delay queues and visibility timeout, you can optimize the solution to address use-cases where the consumer application needs additional time to process messages such as the one in this scenario. Messages are put into the SQS queue via a Lambda function that is triggered when a new video file is uploaded to S3 for processing.\n\n\nTo ensure that the consumer applications running on the video processing instances can scale via an Auto Scaling group, you could use the SQS queue depth (known as the CloudWatch Amazon SQS metric - ApproximateNumberOfMessages) as the underlying metric. However, the issue with using a CloudWatch Amazon SQS metric like ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible for target tracking is that the number of messages in the queue might not change proportionally to the size of the Auto Scaling group that processes messages from the queue. An optimized solution would be to use a backlog per instance metric with the target value being the acceptable backlog per instance to maintain.\n\n\nIncorrect options:\n\n\nRefactor the application to run from Amazon S3 instead of the EFS file system and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket via an API Gateway based REST API. Configure an S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda function each time a file is uploaded and the Lambda, in turn, processes the video and stores the processed files in another bucket. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to send an in-app notification to the user containing the links to the processed files - API Gateway supports payload size of only up to 10 MB therefore this option is incorrect for the given use-case since you need to support file sizes of up to 1GB for video processing.\n\n\nRefactor the application to run from S3 instead of EFS and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket. Set up an EventBridge event to trigger a Lambda function on each file upload that puts a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the video processing instructions. Change the video processing application to read from SQS queue for new files and configure the queue depth metric to scale instances in the video processing Auto Scaling group. Leverage EventBridge events to trigger an SNS notification to the user containing the links to the processed files - You can certainly configure an EventBridge event to handle a new object upload on S3, which in turn triggers a lambda function. However, this is a roundabout way of propagating the object upload event to the Lambda function. So this is not the best fit option.\n\n\nCreate an hourly cron job on the application server to synchronize the contents of the EFS share with S3. Trigger a Lambda function every time a file is uploaded to S3 and process the video file to store the results in another S3 bucket. Once the file is processed, leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to send an in-app notification to the user containing the links to the processed files - The issue with this option is lack of reliability. In case the Lambda function (which is triggered when a video file is uploaded to S3) fails to process a given video file, then the source video file would always remain unprocessed as there is no queue-based mechanism to re-process failed events. So this option is incorrect.\n\n\n< with reference links>\n=======\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

Plus bonus cheat sheets to help you better understand the concepts.\nEXAM STUDY GUIDE - this is added as a reference in the explanations in the practice tests. They are based on our own exam experience and intense research on the most important topics and the most helpful resources to help you pass the exam.\nACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD - with inputs from the instructors and exam feedback from our students, our Q&A board gives you the opportunity to know which topics recently appeared on the exam and better understand the AWS services and concepts covered in the test.\nVERY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTORS - our friendly team of AWS experts is able to address all your issues and questions within 3-5 business days.\nCONTAINS A TEST REPORT - to track your progress and show you which Knowledge Areas you need improvement.\nMOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\nCLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has a reference link that can validate the answer but you can also post to the QA section so we can discuss any issues.\nPrepared by an AWS Certified DevOps and Solutions Architect Professional who actually passed the AWS DevOps Engineer Pro exam! (Please see my LinkedIn profile to view my AWS Certificates)\nSome people are using brain dumps for the AWS DOP-C01 exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge, but these can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.\nPlease also note that these AWS practice tests are not exam dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the AWS certification exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional practice tests are meant to do.\nThese AWS DevOps Engineer Professional practice exams are designed to focus on important exam domains such as SDLC Automation, Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code, and Incident and Event Response, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic was carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official AWS DOP exam guide.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your DevOps exam. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional practice exams have a passing score of 70% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 85% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these DOP practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment of which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!",

I started with Amazon's free self-study video series, but there is no way that the information contained in that series would have been enough. I also purchased a video course provided via Udemy, it was very helpful in filling in some details about the terminology in services that AWS offers, it still wouldn't have been enough. These practice exams are exactly what I needed.\nThese practice exams are worded very similarly to what you'll see on the exams, but are not verbatim. In fact, I found the that way these questions are worded lead me to learn more about the technology areas that the exam focuses on, helping ensure a positive result.\nAlso, and this is very important. The instructor(?) is very active in the Q&A area. S/He responds quickly to questions, and provides clear answers, often with links to the material that supports the answer.\nThis is the practice exam series you want!\nTracy Norrell\n\n\n5 STARS: Yesterday, I passed this exam on my first attempt. This is a great course to pass the cloud practitioner exam. Highly recommended to all. I noticed that all the questions were in the exam was totally covered in this course. Without this material I won't be able to pass my exam. Thank you so much. Waiting for CSA Practice test.\nMaulik Patel\n\n\n5 STARS: 1. Buy this course 2 -3 weeks before your AWS-CCP exam. 2. Take one, 65-question quiz every other day. 3. Pass or fail, review your results, read (and research) the explanations. Watch your scores dramatically improve. 4. Repeat the exam/review/retake cycle six times (6-exams) leading up to your proctored exams. 5. You WILL pass the CCP. Best >$50 career spend ever.\nLance Johnson\n\n\n5 STARS: Excellent practice tests. They are the closest I have found to the real thing. Helped me pass the Practitioners Exam the first time.\nDavid Glowacki\n\n\n5 STARS: Passed the Cloud Practitioner Exam today on my first attempt and i must say these practice tests really helped me a lot.

It's much appreciated.\"  - Ron\n\"It was insightful and innovative.\"  - Ranjit\n\n\n**NOTE - The VCA-DBT certification is retired.**\nAre you looking for VMware Certified Associate training? Do you want to learn from an experienced trainer who makes complex concepts simple and easy to understand? Do you need to prepare for the VCA-DBT exam?\nI am a VMware Certified Instructor who has taught thousands of hours of live training directly for VMware. Most lectures in this course are 5 - 15 minutes long. A few deeper topics are slightly longer. This course gives you an understanding of key VMware products and concepts.\nVMware vSphere is everywhere. Non-virtualized datacenters are a thing of the past, and in order to stay relevant you must understand virtualization and cloud concepts.\nThis course features a few different sections. I have included 28 lessons teaching you the basics of vSphere, because that is the most important VMware product, and is core to understanding NSX, vSAN, and other products. However, understand that much of this vSphere knowledge is not directly applicable to the VCA-DBT exam. Learning it is important to have a strong foundation. Key vSphere topics covered include vCenter, ESXi, Host Clusters, Availability, DRS, Storage, Networking, and Fault Tolerance.\nAfter that we take a deep dive into the topics of the VCA-DBT exam. vSAN, NSX, Horizon, and vRealize are key knowledge areas that are covered. You will understand the use cases for all these products and will learn everything you need to know to pass the VMware Certified Associate - Digital Business Transformation (VCA-DBT) exam.",

This is THE practice exams course to give you the winning edge.\nThese practice exams have been co-authored by Stephane Maarek and Abhishek Singh who bring their collective experience of passing 18 AWS Certifications to the table.\nThe tone and tenor of the questions mimic the real exam. Along with the detailed description and “exam alert” provided within the explanations, we have also extensively referenced AWS documentation to get you up to speed on all domain areas being tested for the DVA-C02 exam.\n\n\nWe want you to think of this course as the final pit-stop so that you can cross the winning line with absolute confidence and get AWS Certified! Trust our process, you are in good hands.\nAll questions have been written from scratch! And more questions are being added over time! You can see for yourself some of the amazing testimonials from our students who have aced the real exam:\n\n\nFEATURED REVIEWS:\n5 stars: These exams should definitely be a part of everyone's study material, they were extremely helpful and packed with information. I got a 43% on the first exam before taking his course, then after taking the course I got 76, 78, 84, 89, 86 on all 5 tests, and was able to pass with a 959/1000 on the real exam\n5 stars: I recommend you take this practice exam with Stephane's hands-on course. For your reference, I passed a real exam over 900 points.\n5 stars: Passed with 914 on the exam. This is exam was very good in comparison to the real exam\n\n\n\n\nQuality speaks for itself...\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nYou have migrated an on-premise SQL Server database to an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) database attached to a VPC inside a private subnet. Also, the related Java application, hosted on-premise, has been moved to an Amazon Lambda function.\nWhich of the following should you implement to connect AWS Lambda function to its RDS instance?\nUse Lambda layers to connect to the internet and RDS separately\nConfigure lambda to connect to the public subnet that will give internet access and use Security Group to access RDS inside the private subnet\nUse Environment variables to pass in the RDS connection string\nConfigure Lambda to connect to VPC with private subnet and Security Group needed to access RDS\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 4.\nCORRECT OPTION\nConfigure Lambda to connect to VPC with private subnet and Security Group needed to access RDS - You can configure a Lambda function to connect to private subnets in a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your account. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services. Connect your lambda function to the VPC to access private resources during execution. When you connect a function to a VPC, Lambda creates an elastic network interface for each combination of the security group and subnet in your function's VPC configuration. This is the right way of giving RDS access to Lambda.\n\n\nINCORRECT OPTIONS\nUse Lambda layers to connect to the internet and RDS separately - You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers. A layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies. Layers will not help in configuring access to RDS instance and hence is an incorrect choice.\nConfigure lambda to connect to the public subnet that will give internet access and use the Security Group to access RDS inside the private subnet - This is an incorrect statement. Connecting a Lambda function to a public subnet does not give it internet access or a public IP address. To grant internet access to your function, its associated VPC must have a NAT gateway (or NAT instance) in a public subnet.\nUse Environment variables to pass in the RDS connection string - You can use environment variables to store secrets securely and adjust your function's behavior without updating code. You can use environment variables to exchange data with RDS, but you will still need access to RDS, which is not possible with just environment variables.\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course. I teach about AWS certifications, focusing on helping my students improve their professional proficiencies in AWS.\nI have already taught 1,500,000+ students and gotten 500,000+ reviews throughout my career in designing and delivering these certifications and courses!\nI'm delighted to welcome Abhishek Singh as my co-instructor for these practice exams!\n\n\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your AWS Certified Developer Architect Associate exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nThis is a huge original question bank\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-days money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\nWe hope that by now you're convinced!.

      "description": "DISCLAIMER\nThis course requires you to download the following softwares\nDocker\nVisual Studio Code\nIf you are a Udemy Business user, please check with your employer before downloading software\n\n\nAs part of this course, you will learn all the key skills to build Data Engineering Pipelines using Spark SQL and Spark Data Frame APIs using Python as a Programming language. This course used to be a CCA 175 Spark and Hadoop Developer course for the preparation for the Certification Exam. As of 10/31/2021, the exam is sunset and we have renamed it to Apache Spark 2 and Apache Spark 3 using Python 3 as it covers industry-relevant topics beyond the scope of certification.\nAbout Data Engineering\nData Engineering is nothing but processing the data depending upon our downstream needs. We need to build different pipelines such as Batch Pipelines, Streaming Pipelines, etc as part of Data Engineering. All roles related to Data Processing are consolidated under Data Engineering. Conventionally, they are known as ETL Development, Data Warehouse Development, etc. Apache Spark is evolved as a leading technology to take care of Data Engineering at scale.\nI have prepared this course for anyone who would like to transition into a Data Engineer role using Pyspark (Python + Spark). I myself am a proven Data Engineering Solution Architect with proven experience in designing solutions using Apache Spark.\nLet us go through the details about what you will be learning in this course. Keep in mind that the course is created with a lot of hands-on tasks which will give you enough practice using the right tools. Also, there are tons of tasks and exercises to evaluate yourself. We will provide details about Resources or Environments to learn Spark SQL and PySpark 3 using Python 3 as well as Reference Material on GitHub to practice Spark SQL and PySpark 3 using Python 3. Keep in mind that you can either use the cluster at your workplace or set up the environment using provided instructions or use ITVersity Lab to take this course.\nSetup of Single Node Big Data Cluster\nMany of you would like to transition to Big Data from Conventional Technologies such as Mainframes, Oracle PL/SQL, etc and you might not have access to Big Data Clusters. It is very important for you set up the environment in the right manner. Don't worry if you do not have the cluster handy, we will guide you through support via Udemy Q&A.\nSetup Ubuntu-based AWS Cloud9 Instance with the right configuration\nEnsure Docker is setup\nSetup Jupyter Lab and other key components\nSetup and Validate Hadoop, Hive, YARN, and Spark\nAre you feeling a bit overwhelmed about setting up the environment? Don't worry!!! We will provide complementary lab access for up to 2 months. Here are the details.\nTraining using an interactive environment. You will get 2 weeks of lab access, to begin with. If you like the environment, and acknowledge it by providing a 5* rating and feedback, the lab access will be extended to additional 6 weeks (2 months). Feel free to send an email to support@itversity.com to get complementary lab access. Also, if your employer provides a multi-node environment, we will help you set up the material for the practice as part of the live session. On top of Q&A Support, we also provide required support via live sessions.\nA quick recap of Python\nThis course requires a decent knowledge of Python. To make sure you understand Spark from a Data Engineering perspective, we added a module to quickly warm up with Python. If you are not familiar with Python, then we suggest you go through our other course Data Engineering Essentials - Python, SQL, and Spark.\nMaster required Hadoop Skills to build Data Engineering Applications\nAs part of this section, you will primarily focus on HDFS commands so that we can copy files into HDFS. The data copied into HDFS will be used as part of building data engineering pipelines using Spark and Hadoop with Python as the Programming Language.\nOverview of HDFS Commands\nCopy Files into HDFS using the put or copyFromLocal command using appropriate HDFS Commands\nReview whether the files are copied properly or not to HDFS using HDFS Commands.\nGet the size of the files using HDFS commands such as du, df, etc.\nSome fundamental concepts related to HDFS such as block size, replication factor, etc.\nData Engineering using Spark SQL\nLet us, deep-dive into Spark SQL to understand how it can be used to build Data Engineering Pipelines. Spark with SQL will provide us the ability to leverage distributed computing capabilities of Spark coupled with easy-to-use developer-friendly SQL-style syntax.\nGetting Started with Spark SQL\nBasic Transformations using Spark SQL\nManaging Tables - Basic DDL and DML in Spark SQL\nManaging Tables - DML and Create Partitioned Tables using Spark SQL\nOverview of Spark SQL Functions to manipulate strings, dates, null values, etc\nWindowing Functions using Spark SQL for ranking, advanced aggregations, etc.\nData Engineering using Spark Data Frame APIs\nSpark Data Frame APIs are an alternative way of building Data Engineering applications at scale leveraging distributed computing capabilities of Apache Spark. Data Engineers from application development backgrounds might prefer Data Frame APIs over Spark SQL to build Data Engineering applications.\nData Processing Overview using Spark or Pyspark Data Frame APIs.\nProjecting or Selecting data from Spark Data Frames, renaming columns, providing aliases, dropping columns from Data Frames, etc using Pyspark Data Frame APIs.\nProcessing Column Data using Spark or Pyspark Data Frame APIs - You will be learning functions to manipulate strings, dates, null values, etc.\nBasic Transformations on Spark Data Frames using Pyspark Data Frame APIs such as Filtering, Aggregations, and Sorting using functions such as filter/where, groupBy with agg, sort or orderBy, etc.\nJoining Data Sets on Spark Data Frames using Pyspark Data Frame APIs such as join. You will learn inner joins, outer joins, etc using the right examples.\nWindowing Functions on Spark Data Frames using Pyspark Data Frame APIs to perform advanced Aggregations, Ranking, and Analytic Functions\nSpark Metastore Databases and Tables and integration between Spark SQL and Data Frame APIs\nApache Spark Application Development and Deployment Life Cycle\nOnce you go through the content related to Spark using a Jupyter-based environment, we will also walk you through the details about how the Spark applications are typically developed using Python, deployed as well as reviewed.\nSetup Python Virtual Environment and Project for Spark Application Development using Pycharm\nUnderstand complete Spark Application Development Lifecycle using Pycharm and Python\nBuild zip file for the Spark Application, copy to the environment where it is supposed to run and run.\nUnderstand how to review the Spark Application Execution Life Cycle.\nAll the demos are given on our state-of-the-art Big Data cluster.

The CTO would like to get an estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the AWS services that the startup wants to use. As a Cloud Practitioner, which AWS service would you suggest for this use-case?\nAWS Pricing Calculator\nAWS Cost Explorer\nAWS Budgets\nAWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR)\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 1.\nCorrect option:\nAWS Pricing Calculator\nAWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set of instances and services. AWS Pricing Calculator can provide the estimate of the AWS service usage based on the list of AWS services.\nYou should also note AWS is in the process of deprecating a similar tool called the Simple Monthly Calculator. This calculator provides an estimate of usage charges for AWS services based on certain information you provide. It helps customers and prospects estimate their monthly AWS bill more efficiently.\n\n\nIncorrect options:\nAWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) - The AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available, including additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, credit, fees, taxes, discounts, cost categories, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans. The AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) itemizes usage at the account or Organization level by product code, usage type and operation. These costs can be further organized by Cost Allocation tags and Cost Categories. The AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) is available at an hourly, daily, or monthly level of granularity, as well as at the management or member account level. The AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.\nAWS Cost Explorer - AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report that helps you visualize the costs and usage associated with your top five cost-accruing AWS services, and gives you a detailed breakdown of all services in the table view. The reports let you adjust the time range to view historical data going back up to twelve months to gain an understanding of your cost trends. AWS Cost Explorer cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.\nAWS Budgets - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount.

      "description": "This course covers the content required for the PL-300 certification exam. It has been updated in line with the March-June 2023 User Interface update for Power BI Desktop on-object interaction, the updated Power BI Service User Interface, and the PL-300 exam updates as of 21 October 2024 and 21 April 2025.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\n\n\nWhat do students like you say about this course?\nGirma says: \"This is another great course taught by the instructor – well-paced, every important aspects of Power BI are discussed in detail. I gained the real power of Power BI in this course.\"\nMohan says: \"Another Excellent course by Mr Burton. This course can be used as a refresher , manual reference to review, understand and use Power BI tools efficiently. Explanations are very clear and crisp. Can help from Beginner to Intermediate level learning.\"\nAndrew says: \"I took a similar Power BI course through my work and I think this one is better. Highly recommend this training. I am a Lead ERP Financial Systems Analyst who worked mostly with Oracle BI tools. Company wants to go in a different direction so I am learning Power BI.\"\n\n\n\n\nDo you already use reporting software such as Access, SSRS, Tableau or WebI? Or is this your first reporting software tool? Either way, welcome.\nIn this course, learn the skills that Microsoft want you to know, and add another tool to your CV, and even go for the Microsoft Power BI certification.\nPower BI is one of the most requested reporting tools that are requested in the job market, and the ability to being able to use it now could be very useful for your current work, and your next job hunt.\nThis course comes in four parts:\nPart 1 - Creating Visualizations (also known as Visualize and Analyze the Data)\nWe'll download and install for free Power BI Desktop. We'll start by creating our first visualizations (visuals) and investigate the Power BI interface.\nWe'll look at the various visualisations available, and go through their common properties. We'll create maps, hierarchies, KPIs, gauges, and all sorts of chart types.\nPart 2 - Get and Transform Data (also known as Prepare the Data)\nWe see how data can be transformed, saving you time in analysing the data. We'll look at sorting and filtering, split columns, and other transform activities. We'll merge, append and combine queries together. We'll Pivot and Unpivot, and transform text, numbers, dates and times, and create custom columns using the M language.\nPart 3 - Refining the model (also known as Model the Data)\nWe'll see how relationships can be made through multiple tables, and refine the data with custom columns and measures using the DAX language.\nPart 4 - Power BI Service\nWe'll then publish our visualisations onto the Power BI Service (which you can sign up for free), and then from your reports create dashboards. With the Power BI Pro (for which you can get a free trial), you can also create workspaces and apps.\nThe course will take around 28 hours to complete, but completing this will enable you to create visuals, transform and refine the model, and use the Power BI Service.\nThe course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll create for instance a table or basic bar chart, then turn it into a stacked bar chart, and investigate more of their properties, step by step.\nThe course is fairly relaxed - there will be a few \"wrong turns\", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual analysis will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on.\nAt the end of the course, you can download a certificate of completion, so you can show everyone your new-found skills, and be able to start creating analyses for yourselves. And with a bit of practice, you could also go for the official Microsoft PL-300 exam - wouldn’t that certificate look good on your CV or resume?",

        "No prior experience in reporting tools or creating formulas is required.",

This will help you to practice tasks after you complete a section.  You don't need to watch the lectures again in case you forget something while practicing.\n\n\nLAB SETUP\nFor LAB Setup, Two VM's are setup using Oracle VirtualBox Manager, One VM (named IPA Server) to provide required services e.g. DNS,LDAP,NTP,NFS and SAMBA to other machine named System .\nYou don't need to know how to configure these services for RHCSA Exam because this is not part of RHCSA Objectives.\nOther Linux VM (named System) will be used to practice all Objectives of RHCSA Exam.\n\n\nIPA Server machine is preconfigured to provide all required services and you will be able to download .ova file for this VM  to import the machine in Oracle Virtual Box in 5-10 minutes.\nYou don't need to configure this Machine and only in few minutes you will have machine up and running.\n\n\nHowever one extra section is included to describe how to configure IPA Server machine to provide different services needed to practice RHCSA Objectives. You can install & configure IPA Sever machine yourself if you want to do it yourself.\n\n\nLast but not least and also important  ,I would expect positive or negative ratings/reviews depending on your experience ,expectations and outcome.\nBoth positive and negative reviews are most Welcome but constructive review would help me better , as Course creator and other Students .\nFor any questions/queries , You can post in Q & A section of this course or you can message me. You would get reply to your queries within 2 days.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nPrince Bajaj",

      "description": "What is this course about?\nWhen we want external parties to consume our applications (be it on-premises or cloud) then the federation comes into the picture. Federation allows external identities (from partner organizations or individual contractors) to access the published applications in another organization using their own organization's user account or using their personal social media accounts.\nThis course primarily talks about the federation of identities using the old horse Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and Entra ID formerly known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). In this course, students will gain a step-by-step understanding of implementing ADFS infrastructure in Azure IAAS, and in later sections, they'll get to know how Azure AD works as a federation broker.\nStudents will also learn how to register a custom domain in Azure AD and sync their On-Premises user objects to Azure AD using Azure AD Connect. This course will be explaining in detail how Azure B2B Collaboration and Azure B2C work.\nIf you are preparing for the exam SC-300, this course covers a subset of the exam SC-300.\nDisclaimer: This course does not cover any web application coding to make the application claim aware. We have used ready-made sample applications for demonstration.\n\n\nWho is the perfect Audience?\nThis course is perfect for students who-\n1. Have basic knowledge of Azure and Active Directory\n2. Have no prior knowledge of ADFS or Federation\n3. Students who are working as Windows or Azure Administrators or Identity Management Administrators.\n\n\nWhy take this Course?\nThere are many reasons to take this course.\nThis course is taught by Microsoft Certified Trainer.\nThis course covers lots of Hands-On which will make you practically sound and make your understanding better about the concepts.\nAnd moreover, Identity federation for collaboration is a hot subject in today's digital age and this course has explained the topic using Microsoft ADFS and Azure AD.\nAt last, I am eager to see you succeed, I am offering you my help, assistance wherever required in learning this course. You can drop your queries in the Q&A section of the course and I'll make sure they will be responded promptly.",

This was done to align the course with any newer changes to the exam objective. And to also align the videos with any changes to the Azure services.\nAll diagrams that have been shown in the videos have also been updated to have a more seamless and refreshed look with the Azure services.\nPractice Tests have also been updated. All older questions have been removed and replaced with newer questions.\nThis course is designed for students to prepare for the AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure exam.\nThe various objectives and chapters that will be covered include\nDevelop Azure compute solutions\nThis course breaks this topic into multiple sections. We will first cover how to deploy applications onto Azure virtual machines as the first compute solution method. Then we will look at the PaaS service , i.e. Azure Web Apps. We will see how to publish web applications onto the Azure Web App service. Then we will see how we can connect a web application to an Azure SQL database instance. And finally we will look at the Azure Function App service. We will look at hosting functions. And see how to connect the Functions onto an Azure SQL database.\nDevelop for Azure storage\nAgain , we will break this topic into 2 sections. One is for the Azure Storage Account service and the other is for the Azure Cosmos DB service. We will look at each service in detail. And then we will see how to use .NET 8.0 to interact with each service.\nImplement Azure security\nAgain , we will break this topic into 2 sections.  In the first section, we will focus on understanding Azure Active Directory and how we assign permissions. Then we will see how to work with Application Objects and then with Managed Identities.\nMonitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Azure solutions\nIn this section, we will first cover monitoring. We will look at aspects such as working with Azure Monitor and then Application Insights. And then finally look at the caching services like Azure Redis Cache and Azure CDN.\nConnect to and consume Azure services and third-party services\nIn this final section, we will cover important aspects services like Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Grid and Azure Event Hubs.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Complete Salesforce Certified Platform Developer I Course!\nI have designed and built this course to be 100% aligned with the official exam Study Guide of the latest Salesforce Certified Platform Developer I release, and I will be updating it on each subsequent release if necessary. Currently, this course fully covers the latest Winter 20 release, and I am updating the course to cover the latest Spring 20 release.\n\nThe official Exam Outline has many Sections; each Section has many topics within it and has its own number of questions weighting (in percentage) out of a total of 60 questions. These are the different sections with the number of questions weighting:\nSalesforce Fundamentals - 7%\nData Modeling and Management - 13%\nProcess Automation and Logic - 38%\nUser Interface - 25%\nTesting, Debugging, and Deployment Tools - 17%\n\n\nEach topic mentioned in the Study Guide under each Section above is covered in this course, and each topic has at least a video lecture that is divided into a presentation, and a demo on the Salesforce environment. Some topics have up to 5 lectures, like the SOQL, SOSL and DML topic that is under Section 3!\nI am sharing all the slides in PDF so that you could download them and read them offline, and I am also sharing a lot of reference links in each lecture. These references include links to Trailhead modules, links to the sources I have used to build the slides, links to official Salesforce documentation related to the topic, and links to official Salesforce guides and eBooks.\n\nThis course also contains more than 100 quiz questions, none of them are from dumps. I HATE dumps, I have never used them in my IT certifications, and I don't want you to pass this exam based on a bunch of questions from dumps! The questions in this exam are 100% dump free, and they are all designed based on the course content and on real-life scenarios.\nFinally, I have been there, I spent hours and hours preparing for this exam, I dissected each and every topic of the Study Guide, and took tons of notes, just like I did when preparing for my other certifications. I guarantee that after completing this course, and after practicing on the Salesforce environment, you will pass this exam, and you will become Salesforce Platform Developer I Certified!\n\nGood Luck!\nWalid",

      "description": "FULLY UPDATED TO THE LATEST DVA-C02 EXAM VERSION!\n\n\nThe AWS Certified Developer Associate ( DVA-C02 ) is consistently among the top-paying IT certifications, considering that Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud services platform in the world with almost 50% market share.\nThe AWS Certified Developer Associate exam is specifically designed to validate the technical knowledge of those in a DevOps role who must demonstrate proficiency in developing, deploying, and debugging cloud-based applications using AWS. Take your career and salary to the next level with an AWS Developer Associate certification!\nThis AWS Certified Developer Associate Practice Exam course is for anyone who is looking for study material that provides the following:\n335 TOP-NOTCH Questions - has 1 set of 5 diagnostic questions and 5 sets of full AWS Practice Tests with 65 UNIQUE questions and a 130-minute time limit.\nSIMULATES ACTUAL EXAM ENVIRONMENT - mimics the actual, and the latest AWS Certified Developer Associate exam to help you pass and even ace the AWS exam!\nDETAILED EXPLANATIONS, REFERENCE LINKS, AND CHEAT SHEETS - our answer keys at the end of each set have full and detailed explanations along with complete reference links so you can check and verify that the answers are correct. Plus bonus cheat sheets to help you better understand the concepts.\nEXAM STUDY GUIDE - this is added as a reference in the explanations in the practice tests. They are based on our own exam experience and intense research on the most important topics and the most helpful resources to help you pass the exam.\nACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD - with inputs from the instructors and exam feedback from our students, our Q&A board gives you the opportunity to know which topics recently appeared on the exam and better understand the AWS services and concepts covered in the test.\nVERY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTORS - our friendly team of AWS experts is able to address all your issues and questions within 5 business days.\nCONTAINS A TEST REPORT - to track your progress and show you which Knowledge Areas you need improvement.\nMOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\nCLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has a reference link that can validate the answer but you can also post to the QA section so we can discuss any issues.\nPrepared by an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional who also actually passed the CDA exam! (Please see my LinkedIn profile to view my AWS Certificate)\nSome people are using brain dumps for the AWS CDA exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge, but these can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.\nPlease also note that these AWS practice tests are not brain dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with 1000++ questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the AWS certification exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Developer Associate practice tests are meant to do.\nThese AWS Developer Associate practice exams are designed to focus on important exam domains such as Development, Deployment, and Security, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic was carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official AWS CDA exam guide.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS Certified Developer Associate practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your CDA exam. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese AWS Certified Developer Associate practice exams have a passing score of 72% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 90% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these CDA practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment of which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!",

Snowflake is a fantastic tool to handle huge volumes of data. You can load, query and export, and run transactional queries on TB's and PB's of data easily.\nYou don't have to worry about infrastructure setup, security, performance, tuning, Garbage collection, node failures etc etc...\nif you have already worked with Spark with EMR or with Data bricks you will be amazed by snowflake performance and simplicity.\nBut there is a catch, if you are not fully aware of how things works in snowflake, you will easily loose control and end up writing costly queries and end up using many of snowflake features wrongly.\nI mentioned costly queries because  snowflake is build for performance.\nCostly queries and wrong design decisions in snowflake will sky rocket your snowflake bill. I have made lot of such mistakes and learned from those mistakes.\nThis course is an effort to walk you through such experiences so that you don't end up doing same mistakes which i did!!!\nFew things can only be learned by experience you can't find them in documentations this course will expose such details to you.\n\n\nHope you join me in this journey...................\n\n\nThe course is broadly divided into 3 modules,\nModule#1\nLectures ------------>: 38\nReal time Demos----->: 11\nAssignments--------->: 10\nQuiz------------------>: 6\n\n\nThis module will concretize snowflake fundamental concepts and architecture.\nBy the end of this module you will be having very strong foundation about snowflake.\nModule#2\nLectures ------------>: 46\nReal time Demos----->: 31\nAssignments--------->: 14\nQuiz------------------>: 2\n\n\nIn this module i will walk you through, different techniques and options to load and unload data\nin snowflake.\nBy the end of this module, you will be having great confidence in using COPY command and\ndifferent data processing objects in snowflake.\nModule#3\nLectures ------------>: 45\nReal time Demos----->: 35\nQuiz------------------>: 3\n\n\nIn this module, we closely evaluate important features of snowflake.\nThis module helps you to understand, how each feature works under the hood.\nThrough this knowledge you will be in a better position to decide, when to use the feature and when not to use the snowflake features.\n\n\nHigh level overview of all modules with sections details is given below,\nIn module#1,\n> Snowflake environment setup.\n> Snowflake architecture.\n> Snowflake caching , micro-partitions, clusters.\n> Snowflake clustering deep dive.\n> Snowflake virtual warehouse layer.\n> Performance tuning and DB characteristics.\nIn module#2,\n> Loading data in snowflake.\n> Loading data using internal stage.\n> Load data from aws s3.\n> Load data from google gcs.\n> Load data from Azure.\n> Copy command options.\n> Working with copy command.\n> Assignments.\n> Loading unstructured data\nIn module#3,\n> Snowpipe in snowflake.\n> Data sharing in snowflake.\n> Time travel.\n> Fail safe.\n> Clone feature.\n> Data sampling.\n> Tasks in snowflake.\n> Streaming in snowflake.\n> Continuous data load.\n> Materialized views.",

It assumes that you're new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control, and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.\nMaster the fundamentals of writing Javascript scripts\nLearn core Javascript scripting elements such as variables and Objects\nDiscover how to work with lists and sequence data\nWrite Javascript functions to facilitate code reuse\nUse Javascript to read and write files\nMake their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly\nSearch text using regular expressions\nThe topics covered in this course are:\n* javascript course contents:\nJavascript introduction\nJavascript array\nJavascript variables\nJavascript functions\nJavascript objects\nJavascript control statements\nJavascript cookies\nJavascript loop statements\nJavascript data structures\nJavascript error handling\nJavascript regular expressions\n\n\nSection 4- python programming language.\nThis course section provides an introduction to programming and the python language. students are introduced to core python programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. this section includes an overview of the various python aspects. It also provides hands-on coding exercises using commonly used writing custom functions, and reading and writing to files. this section or whole course may be more robust than some other courses, as it delves deeper into certain essential programming topics.\nwhat you will learn in this section:\nIdentify core aspects of programming and features of the Python language\nUnderstand and apply core programming concepts like conditionals, loops, variables, and functions\nUse different ways for writing and running Python code\nDesign and write fully-functional Python programs using commonly used data structures, custom functions, and reading and writing to files\npython various operator types\npython methods\npython conditional statements\npython loops\npython function statements\npython decision making\npython file Input and Output\npython datatypes.\nand more..\n\n\nThank you see you inside the course",

It covers the additional content required for the PL-200 certification exam, current as per the PL-200 exam update of 12 January 2024, with minor revisions from 26 December 2024.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\n\n\nWhat do people like you say about this course?\nAnonymous says: Very detailed and clear. It is easy to understand, practice and prepare for the exam.\nManny says: If you have reached this level of Power Platform that you are thinking about attempting the PL-200 exam, Phillip's course is the only deal in town. He takes you through every topic that is required learning as part of the exam. There's simply no one better than him at this stuff.\nRainier says: I work as a CRM consultant and these courses teach me 'the new stuff' or 'the new way' of doing things. Great courses! I did the PL 100 and now the PL 200.\nDaniel says: I passed the PL-200 exam and got the certification for Power Platform Functional Consultant. Thank you Phillip! Your course was excellent and definitely played a huge part in achieving my goal.\n\n\nThis course teaches the advanced requirements for the Microsoft Certificate PL-200 \"Microsoft Power Platform Functional Consultant\", and builds on the skills you will have learnt from either the Part 1 course or the three Microsoft Applied Skills for Power Platform. It focuses on configuring the Microsoft Dataverse, creating Power Pages web sites, and creating business process flows and classic Dataverse workflows.\nIn the first part of the course, we look at topics that were covered in the Part 1 course, namely Power Apps, Power Automate and Power BI, and see how they can work with each other. We'll also look at some additional details for canvas apps, model-driven apps and flows, including classic workflows.\nWe will then look at add a new solution with sample data, and create a Power Pages site. We will look at configuring portal web pages, forms and navigation, portal security, details, actions and authentication, together with exposing Dataverse data.\nFinally, we will look at Configure Microsoft Dataverse, Managing Solutions, and Manage interoperability with other services.\nPrior to taking this course, you'll need to know how to create canvas, model-driven apps, Power Automate flows, implement other reports, configure Microsoft Dataverse, and Design business solutions. This content is available in my course \"PL-200:Microsoft Power Platform Functional Consultant Part 1\".\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good knowledge of Configuring Microsoft Dataverse, Managing solutions, creating portal apps, desktop flows, Power Virtual Agents chatbots and how they interact with each other. And with some practice, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification PL-200 - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume? And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.\nI hope to see you in the course - why not have a look at what you could learn?",

The content goes into great detail for the exam. Passed on my first try with this plus a video course. (Eric S., 5 stars)\nIt's good that it's a bit harder than the actual exams. The PBQs were somewhat different than the exam, but similar enough to give you enough information on what to expect. Would recommend, helped me pass at 760+ first attempt. (Habib F., 5 stars)\nI passed the Network+ exam on my first attempt yesterday. I used these exams and the full course for my studies. The exams cover 99.99% of the real CompTIA Network+ test. I was not surprised by all the questions in the real CompTIA Network+ exam because Jason Dion's materials cover them all. (Man H., 5 stars)\nThese practice exams were integral in my preparations to pass the Net+ exam. If you are serious about passing the exam, I cannot recommend these enough. (Brandon W., 5 stars)\nThese tests are perfect to test your skills. Personally, I thought they had harder questions than the actual CompTIA test. I highly recommend.

All the videos have accurate closed captions!\nEach section focuses on a core service, its purpose, and how you would use them\nWe then look at an integrated view of how you can use all these various services to build an order processing system\nWe will compare the architecture of a server-based and serverless solution.\nAnd how to decouple components\nMigration of data to the cloud is a complex exercise\nWe will walk through several real-life scenarios on how you can approach them\nCourse Q&A Forums\nFor support, the course has an active Q&A forum, and we generally answer questions within a few hours\nWith the knowledge you gain in this course, you will become a better Solutions Architect and easily clear the certification exam!\nHappy Learning!\nChandra Lingam",

We're not going to just discuss theory with slides (we'll do that too, of course...) but we're going to do a lot of hands on in Azure, including creating IoT resources and devices, configuring services, developing modules, monitoring health, analyzing data streams and lots more.\n\n\nNow, if you don't know anything about the cloud or IoT - don't worry!\nYou don't have to know anything about the cloud or IoT. We're going to cover everything, from the very beginning. So even if you don't know what's the point of IoT - we cover that too.\n\n\nAnd in order to make this course even more practical, I created the Azure IoT Handbook, a summary of the content of the course, which condenses all you need to know about Azure IoT in an easy to read format, and is great for memorizing the huge information about IoT in Azure. This will greatly help you when designing your IoT system in Azure.\n\n\nThere's no other course like this! This is the only course that takes you all the way for becoming an Azure IoT expert. It's practical, comprehensive, focused, and, most important - fun.\n\n\nSo take it now and become an Azure IoT Expert.",

Through the completion of our six practice exams, you will gain all the necessary knowledge to successfully pass your Azure qualification exam. This course is in line with the latest updated Azure content, as of 1, 2025.\n\n\nAZ900 exam  latest updated version\n\n\nThe English version was updated on May 5, 2022.\nThe test range corresponding to the latest version is reflected in Sep 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of questions on the AZ900 is 38~45, and the time limit is 45 minutes ( 60 minutes including pre-exam instructions etc.).\nAbout one-third of the questions are TRUE\" and \"FALSE, questions, matching the real-world exam scenario as best as possible.\nSince Udemy cannot set three TRUE and FALSE type questions as one question (like in the Azure exam), it is necessary to set multiple individual \"TRUE\" and \"FALSE\" type questions. The total number of questions is 70.\n\nThe content of these practice exams are the fundamentals required of all Azure professionals. The benefits of completing this Azure qualification exam course are not only limited to only IT engineers alone, as this is perfect for all whom interact with Azure in their daily work, in any capacity. Even for those new to cloud-based solutions and services will find this an incredibly useful course for their future career.\n\n\nAll participants of the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam are required to have a basic understanding of cloud services and an understanding of how these unique services are offered on Microsoft Azure.\n\n\nThe Azure Fundamentals exam requires:\nNote: To see the changes in the content of this exam, please download the exam skill summary below.\n\n\nDescribe cloud concepts (25–30%)\nDescribe Azure architecture and services (35–40%)\nDescribe Azure management and governance (30–35%)\n\n\nIn this collection of exam questions, we have made it as close as possible to match the latest updates of Azure services. However, the following types of questions cannot be answered in Udemy's online test environment format.\n- Udemy does not allow the question format in which you match multiple services. We have substituted this question format with the \"service name matching\" type questions.\n- Udemy cannot make a set of three connected \"True\" or \"False\" format questions , so we will split each of these into individual questions, still testing the same overall content.\nDue to Udemy's specifications, the above two question formats are not possible so we have done our best to facilitate a substitution that will still test the same Azure understanding.",

It's highly recommended that you complete Part 2 of my 1Z0-819 exam course after completing this one.\nOracle helpfully publishes the complete list of topics that questions in the exam come from.  I've taken extreme care to ensure that a full 100% of the material you need to know, in order to pass the exam is covered in either this course or Part 2.\nThere are only two courses you need to get Java certified, this one, and my Part 2.\nI won't waste your time on any Java features that are not going to come up as a question on the exam.\nWhy Get Certified in Java 11, aren't there newer versions available?\nJava 11 is designated as the LTS or Long Term Support version of Java - it's going to be supported by Oracle and JDK vendors until at least 2026, unlike Java 9, Java 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, etc all of which are no longer supported by Oracle.\nLarge companies have large codebases, and it takes them a long time to upgrade that code to new versions of Java - for years Java 8 was the main version used by companies, and with the release of Java 11, and Oracle's commitment to supporting it for many years as well as them designating it as the long term support version, this means that the majority of the industry will be moving, or already have moved to Java 11.  Particularly now that Java 8 support is ending soon.\nOracle does not have a certification program for Java 9, 10, 12, or Java 13, etc.  This is by design. Because Java 11 is Oracle's long term supported version of Java.  For this reason, Java 11 is the version of Java you need to become certified in. And this course will help you achieve that.\nWhat's the difference between this course and your Part 2 1Z0-819 exam course?\nFirstly, the courses have completely different content, there is pretty much no overlap of content in the two courses.  Think of this course as the \"Core Java\" concepts, and my Part 2 course, as the \"Advanced\" content.  Both courses are targeted for the 1Z0-819 exam and help you to pass it.\nWhy are there two courses for the 1Z0-819 exam?\nIn October 2020, Oracle decided to move from their old exams, the 1Z0-815 and 1Z0-816 to a single exam, the 1Z0-819.\nThe thing is, the 1Z0-819 exam, still targets the exact same topics that were in the old 1Z0-815 and 1Z0-816 exams, minus a few topics that have removed.\nPreviously you needed to pass both exams to get Java certified.  Now, you only need to pass the 1Z0-819 exam.  So that's a bonus for you.\nThis Part 1 course originally targeted the 1Z0-815 exam, and my other just released Part 2 course, was originally going to target the 1Z0-816 exam.  What I've done now is updated and renamed both courses, and ensured they are both targeting the material you need to pass the new 1Z0-819.\nHopefully, that makes sense as to why you need to take two courses.\nDo I really need to take a \"Java exam course\" to pass the exam?\nBeing completely upfront, it is possible to pass the exam without studying a specific exam course like this one.  But it's not easy.  Keep in mind that the exam does not just test your knowledge of Java, but actively tries to trip you up by asking questions that sometimes use obscure, rarely used syntax that you may never have come across before.   The sorts of things that most Java courses or textbooks will never teach you.\nThis course shows you all the standard Java stuff you need to know, as well as this more obscure stuff to ensure you really are ready to pass the exam.\nWho is this course suitable for?\nIf you have been through at least some of my Java Masterclass on Udemy, or another Java course and/or have some professional programming experience in Java or another programming language then this course is for you.\nThis course is definitely NOT for beginner programmers.  If you are a beginner, you will struggle with this course.  In that case, grab my Java Masterclass and go through all or a significant amount of that course before attempting this one.\nYou don't teach Java in this course?\nThat's right, I don't teach you Java as such.  The course assumes you know Java, and are looking for the knowledge to pass the exam.  It's a subtle but important distinction.\nAnd remember, the course only focuses on topics that may come up as a question in the 1Z0-819 exam.\nYes, you will learn a ton of new things by going through this course.  But I do assume you know Java, and won't waste your time by having you watch me type in code.\nRather, I paste in a code snippet, explain its purpose, and execute it.  This is the best way to pass on the required knowledge to me.  As an aside, the\nIt's designed to give you the exact information and skills you need to pass Oracle's Java 11 1Z0-819 exam.\nIf you already have Java 7 or Java 8 certification and want to upgrade your skills to Java 11, this is for you.\nThe great thing about the course is that it's relatively short (at least compared to my almost 80 hour Java Masterclass), so it's great if you need to cram before taking the exam.\nWhat this course is not.\nThis course is not a  \"rebadged\" Java 8 Certification course - the 1Z0-819, Java 11 certification is a lot different from the 1Z0-808 (Java 8) exam (for starters it covers many features not included in Java 8, a few of which are listed above).\nIf you only have Java 8 experience it's going to be pretty hard for you to pass the Java 11 exam.  You need to be up to speed with Java 11 features (as well as the older stuff) and that's what you will learn in this course.\nI created this course, from scratch, in Java 11 to give you the tools you need to pass Oracle's 1Z0-819 exam (formally the 1Z0-815 and 1Z0-816 exams).\nWho Am I?\nMy name is Tim Buchalka, a professional software developer with close to 40 years of experience, starting out with Java way back in the 1990s.  I am the creator of the biggest and most comprehensive Java course on Udemy, the Java Masterclass which has been a best seller for many years and has close to 500,000 students and literally tens of thousands of glowing reviews.\nI'd like to think I know a thing or two about Java!\nYou can be assured that the quality of the course is second to none and that the information contained in it will help you pass the 1Z0-819 exam.\nReady to get started?\nClick on the enroll button and get started on your road to Java certification, better job opportunities, and more pay!",

If they don't, they perish.

You will get promotions and pay hikes, year after year, surpassing all qualification barriers.\nYou don't have to shred your core strengths and become a Lean Six Sigma professional. Lean Six Sigma supplements core strengths that you already have. So, it's like a 'booster'.\nSo whatever be your industry, if you take this course, your managers will want to recognize and promote you!\nThere are many Lean Six Sigma Certification courses, but you first need to know what is relevant to you. You should learn practical tips that can be readily applied not mere academic stuff that you will find in any book. Most courses view Lean Six Sigma as a 'Quality Management Training'. However, the real power of Lean Six Sigma is in transforming businesses, and not mere 'quality improvements'!\nThis course is specifically designed for professionals like you, who want to fast track your career.",

      "description": "This practice tests reviewer has been updated to the latest CLF-C02 exam version and will continue to be updated to capture the latest changes in the exam.\n\n\nThe AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner ( CLF-C02 ) is one of the top-paying IT certifications and your gateway to learning Amazon Web Services and acquiring more AWS Certifications.\nThe AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is intended for individuals who have the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively demonstrate an overall understanding of the AWS Cloud, independent of specific technical roles addressed by other AWS certifications (for example, AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate, AWS Certified Developer Associate, or AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate). It is recommended to take the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam first before getting any Associate level certification, especially for those who are new to Cloud Computing. Take your career and salary to the next level with an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification!\n\n\nThis AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Practice Exam CLF-C02 course is for anyone who is looking for study material that provides the following:\n335 TOP-NOTCH Questions - has 1 set of 10 diagnostic questions and 4 sets of full AWS Practice Tests with 65 UNIQUE questions and a 90-minute time limit.\nSIMULATES ACTUAL EXAM ENVIRONMENT - mimics the actual, and the latest AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam to help you pass and even ace the AWS exam!\nDETAILED EXPLANATIONS, REFERENCE LINKS, AND CHEAT SHEETS - our answer keys at the end of each set have full and detailed explanations along with complete reference links so you can check and verify that the answers are correct. Plus bonus cheat sheets to help you better understand the concepts.\nEXAM STUDY GUIDE - this is added as a reference in the explanations in the practice tests. They are based on our own exam experience and intense research on the most important topics and the most helpful resources to help you pass the exam.\nACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD - with inputs from the instructors and exam feedback from our students, our Q&A board gives you the opportunity to know which topics recently appeared on the exam and better understand the AWS services and concepts covered in the test.\nVERY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTORS - our friendly team of AWS experts is able to address all your issues and questions within 5 business days.\nCONTAINS A TEST REPORT - to track your progress and show you which Knowledge Areas you need improvement.\nMOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\nCLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has a reference link that can validate the answer but you can also post to the QA section so we can discuss any issues.\nPrepared by AWS Certified Professionals who actually passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam! (Please see our LinkedIn profile to view our AWS Certificates)\nSome people are using brain exam dumps for the AWS CCP exam, which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge but can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.\nPlease also note that these AWS practice tests are not brain dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with 1000++ questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the AWS certification exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 practice tests are meant to do.\nThese AWS Cloud Practitioner practice exams are designed to focus on important exam domains such as Cloud Concepts and Technology, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic was carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official AWS CCP exam guide.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your CCP exam. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner practice exams have a passing score of 70% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 85% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these CCP practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment of which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!",

      "description": "Preparing for the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) and passing your first ISTQB certification can be a challenging journey. If you ask a colleague who has already passed the exam and received the certificate, whether it was difficult to prepare and pass it, you will get very different feedback from different people. Some will say that they passed it without preparation on the first attempt, without even opening the syllabus once. Others will say that this is a very difficult exam, for which they prepared for many weeks, studied the syllabus by heart, answered all the questions that are on the Internet, and failed the first attempt. Due to the fact that the ISTQB foundation level candidates receive such controversial reviews, they have many questions like:\nHow do I prepare to pass the ISTQB Foundation level exam (CTFL)?\nHow can this course help me prepare for the exam?\nWhat is the ISTQB and ISTQB foundation level?\nHow much does ISTQB certification cost?\nHow long will it take to prepare for the ISTQB foundation-level exam?\nWhat are the relevant study materials for preparation for the ISTQB foundation-level certification?\nWhere to register for the exam online?\nWhat does the exam look like?\nPeople do not find simple answers to these and many other questions, which is why we created our \"ISTQB Foundation Level preparation course+1000quiz examples\". The course is designed to answer all your questions and clear all your doubts, to make the preparation journey easier for you, to make it clearer, more structured, less controversial, less stressful, maybe even enjoyable, but still challenging. Because the ISTQB exam is difficult it doesn't matter what others say. We have made a simple and clear approach to preparing for the exam that has already been used by more than 10,000 people who have successfully passed the exam.\nThe course consists of three simple steps:\nStep 1. Get familiar with the structure and rules of the exam. you must clearly understand and know what you are preparing for, the exam structure and rules, what study materials to use, and what kind of questions to expect. In our course, you will find videos on these topics: Study materials for V4.0[NEW!]; Where to register for the online exam and what does the exam look like?; Tips and tricks for the real exam; etc.\nStep 2. Read relevant study material. In our course, you will find information and links to the latest versions of the ISTQB syllabus and ISTQB glossary. We will also tell you which books can be used to prepare for the exam, the authors of these books are the authors of the exam.\nStep 3. The practice of answering questions similar to those that will be on the exam. It is the most important step in preparation for the istqb certification. There are about 1000 questions in the course, divided according to the syllabus paragraphs. There are 6 chapters in the ISTQB syllabus. In our course, there are 100-200 questions per chapter and 20-50 questions per paragraph. It is done this way so that you can learn the theory in small pieces, step by step. After reading 5 pages of the syllabus, you will be able to practice 20-50 questions related to that particular paragraph similar to those that will be on the exam.\nBonus. At the end of the course, you will have 20 ISTQB certification exams, and you will be able to practice before taking the real exam. Each exam sample consists of 40 questions.\nIf you want to pass the exam successfully on the first try, we invite you to join us on a controversial journey of preparation for the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0!",

This is THE practice exams course to give you the winning edge.\nThese practice exams have been co-authored by Stephane Maarek and Abhishek Singh who bring their collective experience of passing 18 AWS Certifications to the table.\nThe tone and tenor of the questions mimic the real exam. Along with the detailed description and “exam alert” provided within the explanations, we have also extensively referenced AWS documentation to get you up to speed on all domain areas being tested for the SOA-C03 exam.\nWe want you to think of this course as the final pit-stop so that you can cross the winning line with absolute confidence and get AWS Certified! Trust our process, you are in good hands.\nAll questions have been written from scratch! You can see for yourself some of the amazing testimonials from our students who have aced the real exam:\n== == == ==\nYou will get THREE high-quality 65-questions practice exams to be ready for your certification\n== == == ==\nQuality speaks for itself...\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nA retail company stores its business critical files on an Amazon S3 bucket that is also configured as a website endpoint. The company needs a robust configuration that will allow access only through CloudFront. No user or team member should be able to access the files directly from Amazon S3 URL.\nAs a SysOps Administrator, which of the following would you suggest to address this requirement?\nCreate an Origin Access Identity (OAI) and configure S3 bucket permissions so that CloudFront can use the OAI to access the files in your bucket\nConfigure a Security Group with CloudFront to restrict access to users\nConfigure a Network Access Control List (ACL) with CloudFront to restrict access to users\nSetup the Amazon S3 bucket as a custom origin with CloudFront. Restrict the access to content by setting up custom headers\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 4.\nCorrect option:\nSetup the Amazon S3 bucket as a custom origin with CloudFront. Restrict the access to content by setting up custom headers\nIf you use an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website endpoint, you must set it up with CloudFront as a custom origin. You can’t use the origin access identity feature. However, you can restrict access to content on a custom origin by setting up custom headers and configuring your origin to require them.\nTo require that users access content through CloudFront, change the following settings in your CloudFront distributions:\n1. Origin Custom Headers : Configure CloudFront to forward custom headers to your origin.\n2. Viewer Protocol Policy : Configure your distribution to require viewers to use HTTPS to access CloudFront.\n3. Origin Protocol Policy : Configure your distribution to require CloudFront to use the same protocol as viewers to forward requests to the origin.\nAfter you've made these changes, update your application on your custom origin to only accept requests that include the custom headers that you’ve configured CloudFront to send.\nMore info on restricting access to files on custom origins:\n<reference links in the practice exams>\n\n\nIncorrect options:\n**Create an Origin Access Identity (OAI) and configure S3 bucket permissions so that CloudFront can use the OAI to access the files in your bucket** - As explained above, if you use an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website endpoint, you can’t use the origin access identity feature.\n**Configure a Security Group with CloudFront to restrict access to users** - A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for Amazon EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Security Groups cannot be used with CloudFront.\n**Configure a Network Access Control List (ACL) with CloudFront to restrict access to users** - A Network Access Control List (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. Network ACLs are not used with CloudFront.\n\n\nAnd reference links to help you learn further!\n== == ==\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course. I teach about AWS certifications, focusing on helping my students improve their professional proficiencies in AWS.\nI have already taught 1,500,000+ students and gotten 500,000+ reviews throughout my career in designing and delivering these certifications and courses!\nI'm delighted to welcome Abhishek Singh as my co-instructor for these practice exams!\n== == ==\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your AWS Certified CloudOps Administrator Associate exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nThis is a huge original question bank\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-days money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\nWe hope that by now you're convinced!

      "description": "== As of Feb 2025 ==\n\n\n2187 Students Passed PSM 1 --> On 1st Attempt -->  98% Pass Rate\n\n\nWelcome to Agile Scrum Mastery: Certification + Project Simulation.  The only course you need to\n\n1) Get Professional Scrum Master (PSM 1) certification &\n2) Succeed in your first role as Scrum Master\n\n\nAs you consider my course, I suggest asking yourself these questions.\n\n\n\n== Do I want to become a Scrum Master? ==\n\nThe Scrum Master role is one of the most promising and highest-paying careers today, offering an opportunity to dramatically improve your career and quality of life.\n\n\nCheck out some data that shows that becoming a Scrum Master is a great opportunity for you:\nGoogle Search Trends shows an 84% increase in searches for \"Scrum Master\" worldwide, with a particularly strong interest in countries such as United States, India & Singapore.\nGlassdoor indicates Scrum Master is one of the highest-paying entry level jobs, with an average of $78,000 per year.\nA study by Scrum. org in 2023 showed that the average salary of a Scrum Master is $98,000+, ranging up to $150,000+, per year.\nLinkedIn included Scrum Master in its 2023 Fastest Growing Jobs list.\n\n\n\n== But why is the Scrum Master role in demand? ==\n\nScrum is the most popular Agile framework in the world. It is used for building and delivering complex products. Most modern companies use it today. But while the framework is simple, adopting it successfully in a company can be challenging. The Scrum Master is the valued \"Scrum Expert\" who helps teams use Scrum correctly, as per the Scrum Guide.\n\n\nThe key to breaking into the Scrum Master role is 1) getting PSM 1 certification & 2) learning to perform the Scrum Master role well. While other courses focus only on PSM 1 certification, my course has been designed specifically to help you succeed in both areas.\n\n\n\n== Can I pass PSM 1 on my first try? ==\n\nYes! 98% of my students have done just that, passing the exam on their first attempt. [based on my 2023 survey of 2239 of my students who took the PSM 1 exam].\n\n\n\n\n== Why PSM 1 ? ==\n\nThere are many certifications available, but the best cost-benefit for you is, unquestionably, getting the Professional Scrum Master level 1, by Scrum. org!\n\n\nHowever, it costs $150 per attempt, which is not cheap.\n\n\nTherefore, a smart move is to make a small investment in this course. But why take my course?\n\n\n\n== How is this course different? ==\n\n\nYou'll get:\n\n1) A proven formula developed and refined over 4 years, that maximizes your chance of passing PSM 1 on your first attempt [my students experience 98% pass rate]\n\n\n2) The only course that covers both a) how to pass PSM 1 certification & b) how to succeed in a Scrum team via real world project simulations run in JIRA, Confluence & Physical Scrum boards.\n\n3) The only course that lets you ask questions in a Live Chat format via our Discord community.\n\n\n4) 6.5 hours of courses taught in a fun & engaging format, with a focus on learning by doing.\n\n\n5) Over 500 exclusive practice exam questions that let you study in both a) learning mode & b) exam simulation mode.\n\n6) Access to our community of over 3,800 professionals for networking, collaboration & group study.\n\n7) Detailed PSM 1 study notes designed to help you quickly review and revise study material, before taking the PSM 1 exam.\n\n8) The instructor, Raj Elakkara, has over 15 years of experience coaching Agile teams in both large Fortune 500 companies (such as  FedEx, GE, Canva & Atlassian.) & startups. This course is the result of extensive research into Passing Scrum certification & learning real-world Agile in an online study format.\n\n\n\n== What if I want a refund? ==\n\nIf after taking the course, you want a refund, thats totally ok. I want you to be happy with your decision to purchase this course.\n\n\nThis course has a 30-day money-back guarantee policy!\n\n\nNo questions asked!\n\n\nThere is no risk for you!\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\nJoin now and take a step further into becoming a Professional Scrum Master™ and uplift your career!\n\n\n\n\n==What are students saying? ==\nHere is a small preview of what my students have reported.\n\n\nIt is a very well composed course, everything is logical and easily understandable. I have started it with zero knowlede about Scrum and within 2 weeks I managed to pass the PSM1. [Adrienn Braun - Scrum Master @ Verizon]\n\n\nI recently completed the \"Agile Scrum Mastery\" course on Udemy, and I must say it was an exceptional learning experience. The course content was comprehensive, providing a deep dive into the world of Agile and Scrum methodologies. What stood out for me was the emphasis on practical application.

I've taught in-person seminars for the DEA and the FBI, and now I'm going to teach you.\nI'm joined by my buddy, Steve Nicholson, who brings a ton of knowledge and experience to this course. He's taught thousands of college students, worked as a Chief Technical Officer, and even had a stint in the Marine Corps. Oh, and don't forget to ask him about the chickens at his house!\n\n\nThis is the first of a two-course series and is designed to prepare you to take and pass the CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) exam. It's an internationally-recognized, fundamental IT training certification. Not interested in certification? No problem! Even if you just want to learn about the basics of IT and computers, I've got you covered.\nCourse 1: TOTAL: CompTIA A+ Certification (220-1101) (this course)\nCourse 2: TOTAL: CompTIA A+ Certification (220-1102)\nTo become fully A+ certified you will need to pass both the 220-1101 and 220-1102 exams.\n\n\nWHAT OUR STUDENTS ARE SAYING:\nOVER 25,000 5-STAR REVIEWS!\n\n\n\"I used these courses to pass the A+, Security+, and Network+ in a span of 2.5 months. I had no IT experience 4 months ago. Now I am a network engineer at a managed service provider with a great salary and solid upward mobility.\" - Ryan D.\n\n\n“Mike is an incredible instructor and very engaging. Actually teaches you about technologies and how they work rather than just what you need to know to pass an exam. Can't recommend highly enough.” - Dylan T.\n\n\n'First impressions - Blown away by the quality of the material! Especially the live demonstrations with real components really give one a far superior learning experience compared to ppt slides. I hope this style of teaching becomes the norm.' -Krishnamohan C.\n\n\n“Awesome! As an IT student, I already knew about PCs & related hardware and so on...this is an awesome course & Mike described everything nicely. If you are new to IT industry (less than 5 years) this is a must course for you!” – Muhammad T.\n\n\n“[Mike] Meyers is amazing when it comes to explaining. His fun little bits, such as when he explains common problems and how to troubleshoot them, keep you engaged and help it stick so much better. I went from barely understanding little bits here and there to passing the 1001 on my first try with the help of this course. …If you have tried reading the books and listening to lectures from people who sound like the teacher from Ferris Bueller then I would highly recommend this course paired with his practice tests.” – Robert F.\n\n\n“This course was above my expectations! 1/2 way through and it is NOT boring, drilling information AT ALL!!! A positive, knowledgeable instructor who clearly speaks. Not only is the instructor positive, but fun and engaging. Very easily relays information in an easy to understand and easy to remember format. Perfect category breakdowns and great resources available too!!! THANK YOU (and your team) SO MUCH for all your hard work putting this course together!!! Looking forward to passing my CompTIA A+ with ease!!!” – Kerri O.\n\n\nWHY SHOULD I TAKE THIS COURSE?\nTechnology is ranked as the #1 source of U.S. jobs.

We need to revisit important aspects such as Application Objects, Enterprise Applications, Conditional Access , Privileged Identity management etc.\n\n\nEvaluate Governance Risk Compliance (GRC) technical strategies and security operations strategies\nIn this section, we need to cover important aspects when it comes to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. How we can use the tool to evaluate the security posture of our resources. And how we can use the various compliance policies available from within the tool. We also will have a touch base when it comes to working with Azure Blueprints as well.\n\n\nDesign security for infrastructure\nIn this section, we will learn aspects on how to secure our infrastructure. For example, how can we enhance security for services like Azure Web Apps, Azure SQL databases, Azure Storage Accounts etc.\n\n\nDesign a strategy for data and applications\nIn this section we have to look into aspects on how we can protect our data. How can we enable data at rest and in transit when it comes to services that store data.",

      "description": "Continually being updated with SOA-C03 exam simulation questions!\n\n\nThe AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer Associate ( SOA-C03 ) is consistently among the top paying IT certifications, considering that Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud services platform in the world with almost 50% market share!\nThe AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer Associate exam is specifically designed to validate the technical knowledge of AWS SysOps Administrators, Systems Administrators, and those in a DevOps role who create automatable and repeatable deployment of applications, networks, and systems on the AWS platform. Take your career and salary to the next level with an AWS CloudOps Engineer Associate certification!\nThis AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer Associate Practice Exam course is for anyone who is looking for study material that has the following:\n300_ TOP-NOTCH Questions - has 1 set of Diagnostic Tests with 5 questions and 5 sets of Full Practice Tests with 65 UNIQUE questions and a 130-minute time limit for each set.\nSIMULATES ACTUAL EXAM ENVIRONMENT - mimics the actual, and the latest AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate exam to help you pass and even ace the AWS exam!\nDETAILED EXPLANATIONS AND REFERENCE LINKS - our answer keys at the end of each set have full and detailed explanations plus complete reference links so you can check and verify that the answers are correct.\nEXAM STUDY GUIDE - this is added as a reference in the explanations in the practice tests. They are based on our own exam experience and intense research on the most important topics and the most helpful resources to help you pass the exam.\nACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD - with inputs from the instructors and exam feedback from our students, our Q&A board gives you the opportunity to know which topics recently appeared on the exam and better understand the AWS services and concepts covered in the test.\nVERY RESPONSIVE INSTRUCTORS - our friendly team of AWS experts is able to address all your issues and questions within 3-5 business days.\nCONTAINS A TEST REPORT - to track your progress and show you which Knowledge Areas you need improvement.\nMOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\nCLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has a reference link that can validate the answer but you can also post to the QA section so we can discuss any issues.\nPrepared by an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional who has actually passed the exam! (Please see my LinkedIn profile to view my AWS Certificate)\nSome people are using brain dumps for the AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer Associate exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge, these can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.\nPlease also note that these AWS practice tests are not brain dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with 500++ questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the AWS certification exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer Associate practice tests are meant to do.\nThese AWS CloudOps Engineer Associate practice exams are designed to focus on important exam domains such as Monitoring and Metrics, Security and Compliance, Networking, and Deployment and Provisioning, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic is carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official AWS SysOps exam guide.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer Associate practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your exam. All the best!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer Associate practice exams have a passing score of 72% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 90% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment of which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!\n\n\nNotice of the AWS Certification Name Change:\n\n\nThe \"AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate\" is now called the \"AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate\" effective September 2025. This reflects evolving industry terms and the broader scope of modern cloud operations.\nTake note that this is mostly a name change and there's almost no major change in the exam domains nor its content.\n\n\nWhy the Change?\nThe rename to \"CloudOps Engineer\" aims to enhance the relevance and credibility of the certification, better highlighting the skills certified professionals have in deploying, operating, and maintaining AWS workloads.\n\n\nIs this course still valid for the new SOA-C03 version?\nAbsolutely yes! Again, the content change is mostly on the name to \"CloudOps Engineer\" as AWS aims to enhance the relevance and credibility of the certification, better highlighting the skills certified professionals have in deploying, operating, and maintaining AWS workloads. No changes as well on the exam domains.\nWe will continually add more relevant lessons for this course to reflect the new SOA-C03 topics.\n\n\nExam Update:\nThe exam content (moving from code SOA-C02 to SOA-C03) is being refreshed to cover current best practices for monitoring and maintaining AWS workloads.\n\n\nKey Content Additions:\nThe new SOA-C03 exam explicitly includes containers. It also features:\nMore modern AWS services/features.\nGreater focus on multi-account and multi-Region architectures.\nIncreased emphasis on automation and infrastructure as code (IaC).\n\n\nNotes:\nNo Removals: All previous task areas from SOA-C02 are still covered in SOA-C03, though the content outline is more detailed and has been reorganized.\nTransition Timeline:\nRegistration for the new CloudOps Engineer (SOA-C03) exam opens September 9, 2025 (new exam guide available then).\nThe old SysOps Administrator (SOA-C02) exam will retire on September 29, 2025 (last day to take it).",

Note that although there is a focus on these topics, the questions are all still unique, to ensure that you fully grasp the topic.\nSome people are using exam dumps for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because using an AWS exam dump will not only hinder you to attain in-depth AWS knowledge, these can also result in you failing the actual AWS exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.\nPlease also note that these AWS practice tests are not brain dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with 500++ questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional practice tests are meant to do.\nThere are a lot of existing AWS Practice Tests in the market however, most of them contain both technical and grammatical errors that are not only annoying but may also cause you to fail the actual exam. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional SAP-C02 practice tests are meant to do.\nJust like in the Associate exam, when I was reviewing for my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional exam, I again had a hard time finding comprehensive AWS practice tests to help me pass my exam. I bought some of them in the market but I was disappointed because there are a lot of technical and grammatical errors in the questions. This is why I created these AWS practice tests - to help my fellow IT professionals in the industry.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your exam. All the best!\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional practice exams have a passing score of 75% but I highly encourage you to repeat taking these sets again and again until you consistently reach a score of 90% or higher on each exam. Note that the AWS Certification exam passing score is not published by Amazon as it is set by using statistical analysis which may change without notice.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these AWS practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment on which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!",

      "description": "This course will help you prepare for the Snowflake SnowPro Core certification exam COF-C02, which is a foundational exam in the SnowPro certification exam series. Being a foundational certification exam, this exam covers all the basics including Snowflake architecture, virtual warehouses, storage, security, Time Travel, cloning, data sharing, and data loading. So even if you are not aiming to sit in the exam, preparing for the certification is a great way to get familiarized and become an expert at Snowflake. Please note that this course assists in preparing for the exam but does not guarantee exam success.\n\n\nThis course is organized into several sections. Each section focuses on a particular area related to the exam. As we progress through this course, we will first go through a very important section covering Snowflake’s architecture. Once we have understood the architectural and foundational basis of Snowflake, we will explore user interfaces & connectivity options to understand how we can connect to our Snowflake instance and which tools we can use. Continuing in a logical manner, we will then have a series of sections covering data loading into Snowflake, processing of semi-structured and unstructured data, and the data pipelines in Snowflake. Then we will cover some features unique to Snowflake such as Failsafe, Time Travel, Zero copy cloning, and data sharing. We then look into performance optimization techniques and management of account costs through resource monitors before embarking on our second last section on Security.\n\n\nTowards the end of each section, we have lectures that summarize the learnings of the section and, finally, a quiz to test and reinforce your knowledge.\n\n\nThe final section that you wouldn’t want to miss are two Practice Exams which will test your knowledge of the concepts learned in this course. The practice exams included in this course are not a guarantee of exam success, but they will give you an assessment of your preparedness.\n\n\nSnowflake offers a variety of certifications. SnowPro Core certification is at the foundation level and is a prerequisite for other advanced certifications such as data engineering, administration, and data science certification. Because the SnowPro Core certification is a prerequisite for advanced certifications, it’s the perfect way to start your Snowflake adventure.",

Watching live demo's while paying attention to lecture carefully, helped me to answer many questions. Hands on browsing on Azure portal is needed to pass AZ-900.\"\nBranko says: \"This mash up presentation approach giving the both windows - presentation theoretical slide and practical Azure platform view of actions together with presenter's explanations are a well done way in efficient and pleasant learning! Congrats\"\nSrishti says: \"Great course! Kudos to Phillip! I passed my exam (AZ-900) just by thoroughly referring this course and practice test. Keep up the good work, Phillip!\"\n\n\nThis course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate AZ-900 \"Azure Fundamentals\", and focuses on Azure services in general, together with cloud concepts, Azure workloads, security and privacy, as well as Azure pricing.\nWe'll start off with looking at Virtual Machines. We'll create an Azure account, quickly create a Virtual Machine, log into it, and then shut it down. We'll then start creating the Virtual Machine more slowly, and look at the concepts behind Azure, such as Architectural components and what can affect costs.\nAfter that, we'll take a step back and look at cloud computing generally. We'll identify the benefits and considerations of using cloud service, such as High Availability, Disaster Recovery, and the difference between Capital Expenditure and Operational Expenditure. We'll then see what the three main cloud models are, how they vary, and when Microsoft takes responsibility for various aspects of cloud computing.\nIn the middle part of this course, we'll have a  look at around 20 different Azure services, and look at the benefits of usage of them. We'll be looking at services for Compute, Networking and Storage, including how to move or migrate files.\nIn the last part of the course, we'll look at other considerations for using Azure. We'll examine Azure management tools, security features and network security, identity services, governance features, and privacy and compliance resources.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get a free Azure trial!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of cloud services and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure. And with some practice, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification AZ-900 - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume? And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.",

This course used to be a CCA 175 Spark and Hadoop Developer course for the preparation of the Certification Exam. As of 10/31/2021, the exam is sunset and we have renamed it to Spark SQL and Spark 3 using Scala as it covers industry-relevant topics beyond the scope of certification.\nAbout Data Engineering\nData Engineering is nothing but processing the data depending on our downstream needs. We need to build different pipelines such as Batch Pipelines, Streaming Pipelines, etc as part of Data Engineering. All roles related to Data Processing are consolidated under Data Engineering. Conventionally, they are known as ETL Development, Data Warehouse Development, etc. Apache Spark is evolved as a leading technology to take care of Data Engineering at scale.\nI have prepared this course for anyone who would like to transition into a Data Engineer role using Spark (Scala). I myself am a proven Data Engineering Solution Architect with proven experience in designing solutions using Apache Spark.\nLet us go through the details about what you will be learning in this course. Keep in mind that the course is created with a lot of hands-on tasks which will give you enough practice using the right tools. Also, there are tons of tasks and exercises to evaluate yourself.\nSetup of Single Node Big Data Cluster\nMany of you would like to transition to Big Data from Conventional Technologies such as Mainframes, Oracle PL/SQL, etc and you might not have access to Big Data Clusters. It is very important for you set up the environment in the right manner. Don't worry if you do not have the cluster handy, we will guide you through support via Udemy Q&A.\nSetup Ubuntu-based AWS Cloud9 Instance with the right configuration\nEnsure Docker is setup\nSetup Jupyter Lab and other key components\nSetup and Validate Hadoop, Hive, YARN, and Spark\nAre you feeling a bit overwhelmed about setting up the environment? Don't worry!!! We will provide complementary lab access for up to 2 months. Here are the details.\nTraining using an interactive environment. You will get 2 weeks of lab access, to begin with. If you like the environment, and acknowledge it by providing a 5* rating and feedback, the lab access will be extended to additional 6 weeks (2 months). Feel free to send an email to support@itversity.com to get complementary lab access. Also, if your employer provides a multi-node environment, we will help you set up the material for the practice as part of the live session. On top of Q&A Support, we also provide required support via live sessions.\nA quick recap of Scala\nThis course requires a decent knowledge of Scala. To make sure you understand Spark from a Data Engineering perspective, we added a module to quickly warm up with Scala. If you are not familiar with Scala, then we suggest you go through relevant courses on Scala as Programming Language.\nData Engineering using Spark SQL\nLet us, deep-dive into Spark SQL to understand how it can be used to build Data Engineering Pipelines. Spark with SQL will provide us the ability to leverage distributed computing capabilities of Spark coupled with easy-to-use developer-friendly SQL-style syntax.\nGetting Started with Spark SQL\nBasic Transformations using Spark SQL\nManaging Spark Metastore Tables - Basic DDL and DML\nManaging Spark Metastore Tables Tables - DML and Partitioning\nOverview of Spark SQL Functions\nWindowing Functions using Spark SQL\nData Engineering using Spark Data Frame APIs\nSpark Data Frame APIs are an alternative way of building Data Engineering applications at scale leveraging distributed computing capabilities of Spark.

(Duncan, 5-stars).\nHi Thor, I used your test and videos and passed the exam at first attempt. (Shan, 5-stars)\nI just cleared my CISSP and all thanks to this course. This set of course from Thor Pedersen is all inclusive of everything that the exam can ask you. (Shashank, 5-stars).\nThor Pedersen's content is one of the most referenced by those who have passed the CISSP. (David, 5-stars).\nI just passed my CISSP and used your question banks for study. All domains were covered and explanations on the questions were through. (John, 5-stars).\nThank You Thor. I recently passed my exam. These practice questions assisted me in identifying where I needed to up my game in the domains. Thank You again. (Kevin, 5-stars).\n\n\nIn this course you get all my easy and mid difficulty CISSP questions for:\nCISSP DOMAIN 1: Security and Risk Management (16% of the weighted questions - 160 questions)\nCISSP DOMAIN 2: Asset Security (10% of the weighted questions - 100 questions)\n\n\nAt the end of each test, you can see your total percentage score for that domain, as well as get an explanation for each question, explaining why the right answer is the right answer.\nYou can review each question and sort them by CISSP knowledge area, correct answers, wrong answers, skipped questions and questions marked for review.\nDo multiple CISSP certification practice tests like this one, do the full 3 hours and 100-150 questions to see how you handle it, this is as much mental stamina and reading the questions right, and answering from an IT Security managers point of view, as it is the actual knowledge.\nMany students do 3,000 - 5,000 CISSP certification practice questions, when I did my CISSP certification I was around the 3,500 mark.\nYou can take this CISSP certification practice test as many times as you want, the questions and the answer order is randomized.  I would suggest 80%+ of right answers consistently on all CISSP domains using multiple practice tests before booking the exam.\n\n\nPrepare for the 2025 version of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Certification Exam.\n\n\nYou'll Also Get:\n• Lifetime Access to the course and all course updates.\n• 30-days no questions asked, money back guarantee.\n\n\nStart your certification journey today, let me help YOU get certified.\n\n\nThor Pedersen",

Torrez  - Ashish is a very good instructor. Once you get used to his accent it's an enjoyable experience. Personally, it wasn't hard to get used to. I like that he provides labs that can be created in virtual environments such as GNS3 and can be applied to live equipment if provided on your own. I'm thankful that the instructor took the time to create this course which is full of hands on examples that you can retake as many times as you need in order to drill the concepts home. He communicates often and has added labs along the way which is just icing on the cake. I highly recommend this instructor and his courses. 5 STARS!\nFarshid Miri - The course is very informative, right on the point, no unnecessary information and entirely a hands-on course.\nIt is good for someone who would like to learn Cisco networking in action and be capable of DOING rather than just be able to pass Cisco exams! It might be still very useful for Cisco exams, but it might not cover all the details for that matter.\nI personally enjoyed this course a lot and I can apply all the knowledge I learned from it in my workplace on a daily basis.\nRegarding the language and accent, if the trainee has lived his entire life with one single accent around him in a small town, this course might be a bit challenging to follow, but if one is coming with an international mind-set, he can follow every single line of the course.\nThe only negative comment could be that the course pace might be very fast for new learners and before each session, a bit of definitions, terminology and concepts could be helpful.\nthe course starts with a list of tasks and then goes right away to terminal and commands. Good for me, but for new people in Cisco world, it might be a bit challenging to follow.\nOverall I recommend this course a lot and will buy more courses from Ashish :-)\nKenel Doantien  - I'm impressed with how the teacher is explaining EIGRP in a simple and short way.\nAbbe katerega - Personally, no reservation i love the instructor . You make this course so simple and then you give students take to listen to each of your words. I appreciate and HIGHLY recommend other students to join\nDaniel Ramsay - The content is right to the point and simple to follow and Lab yourself. Many times we don't spend time testing our troubleshooting abilities. This course, and, the way it's taught allows me strengthen this critical skill.\nMark fruge  - Practical knowledge of the subject matter with clear and concise instructions. Being able to simultaneously watch Ashish guide me while I do the labs myself help a ton! Plus, if I'm feeling confident enough to figure something out on my own, I can try in my own lab and then watch the video afterwards should I run into any obstacles.\nTim Pastick - This is a great course which I haven't been able to find anywhere else. Well layed out and easy to understand and follow. IF you work in a large Database Environment I would definitely recommend\nWallace Nelson - Great Video so far. Clear Teacher and instructional videos. I'm really enjoying it. Plus it gets right to the point! Not all the fluff that's some of the other videos have.\nJose Antonio Alejos Bravo - Exelente con GNS3 se entiende todo =) , espero que NEXUS lo haga lo mismo\nAdam Foots - It has lot of Labs and every lap has v important Information.\nJohn Elliott -Very clear and precise. Also goes at a good pace. Thanks!!\nIt has rating of 4.5+ . If you have any question, Always post to me or in forum. I will try to jump on it as soon as possible.

This course is quite up-to-date with all the new terminologies included. It was just what I needed to pass the PL-900 exam on first attempt. Thank you : )\"\nVibhaw says: \"Pin point course to crack Pl-900 exam. Today i write the exam and got 807 marks. Thanks for your teaching.\"\nMadeline says: \"Scored a 740 out of 700 with this course and a few weeks of hands on power BI. It was my very first MS test. Thanks for the course!\"\nThis course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate PL-900 \"Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals\", and focuses on the various apps which make up the Power Platform, together with how they can be used by other programs, apps and services.\nWe'll start off by looking at Power Apps. We'll get a free Developer edition and or free trial of Power Apps, and get some sample data using the Dataverse (previously known as the Common Data Service). We'll then create both a canvas and a model-driven Power App, while looking at the various types of connectors you can use to connect to different data sources.\nNext up is Power Automate. Using our free Developer edition, we'll create several automated flows, and the different triggers and actions you can use.\nThe next app is Microsoft Copilot Studio. We'll create a basic chatbot (now called a \"Copilot\") which can ask and answer a few questions.\nWe will have a brief look at the AI Builder, and how models such as the business card reader, object detection model, form processing model and prediction model can be integrated into Power Apps and Power Automate.\nWe'll finish off by looking at how Power Platform can extend other business solutions, and some Power Platform administration and security.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get a free Power Platform trial!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of Power Platform and what the capacities of these different apps are. And with some practice, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification PL-900 - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume? And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.\nSo, without any further ado, let's have a look at how you can use the Udemy interface, and then we'll have a look at the objectives for the exam and therefore the syllabus for this course.",

All 180 questions have been written from scratch, based on the actual distribution of topics and tone in the real exam. The questions cover all themes being tested for in the exam, including specifics to Python and Apache Spark 3.0.\nMost questions come with detailed explanations, giving you a chance to learn from your mistakes and have links to the Spark documentation and expert web content, helping you to understand how Spark works even better.\nThese practice exams come with valuable exam tips & tricks and code snippets that you can execute for free on the Databricks Community Edition. These supplemental materials will help you understand the many tricky details of the exam and the Spark syntax, giving you the knowledge and confidence you need to be a top performer in the real exam!\n\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION\nCurious about what a high-quality question looks like? Here is an example from the DataFrame API section of the practice exams!\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following code blocks returns approximately 1000 rows, some of them potentially being duplicates, from the 2000-row DataFrame transactionsDf that only has unique rows?\n1. transactionsDf.take(1000).distinct()\n2. transactionsDf.sample(False, 0.5)\n3. transactionsDf.take(1000)\n4. transactionsDf.sample(True, 0.5)\n5. transactionsDf.sample(True, 0.5, force=True)\n\n\nCorrect Answer:\n4. transactionsDf.sample(True, 0.5)\n\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this question, you need to know that \"DataFrame.sample()\" is not guaranteed to return the exact fraction of the number of rows specified as an argument. Furthermore, since duplicates may be returned, you should understand that the operator's \"withReplacement\" argument should be set to \"True\". A \"force=\" argument for the operator does not exist.\nWhile the \"take\" argument returns an exact number of rows, it will just take the first specified number of rows (\"1000\" in this question) from the DataFrame. Since the DataFrame does not include duplicate rows, there is no potential of any of those returned rows being duplicates when using \"take()\", so the correct answer cannot involve \"take()\".\nMore info: [Link to the Spark documentation for DataFrame.sample(), available in the practice exams once purchased]\n\n\nCOURSE CONTENT\nThe practice exams cover the following topics:\nSpark Architecture: Conceptual understanding (ca. 17 %): Spark driver, execution hierarchy, DAGs, execution modes, deployment modes, memory management, cluster configurations, fault tolerance, partitioning, narrow vs. wide transformations, executors, Python vs. Scala, Spark vs. Hadoop\nSpark Architecture: Applied understanding (ca. 11%): Memory management, configurations, lazy evaluation, action vs. transformation, shuffles, broadcasting, fault tolerance, accumulators, adaptive query execution, Spark UI, partitioning\nSpark DataFrame API Applications (ca. 72%): Selecting/dropping columns, renaming columns, aggregating rows, filtering DataFrames, different types of joins, partitioning/coalescing, reading and writing DataFrames in different formats, string functions, math functions, UDFs, Spark configurations, caching, collect/take\nAll questions are original, high-quality questions, not anything like Databricks Spark certification dumps.\nThese practice exams are specifically for the Python version of the exam. If you have been preparing to the take exam in Scala, only the 51 included Spark Architecture questions will apply to you, as the DataFrame API Applications questions focus on Python syntax exclusively.\n\n\nLET'S GET YOU CERTIFIED!\nReady to pass your Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark 3.0 exam? Click “Buy now” and immediately get started with these benefits:\nGet 3 practice exams with 180 high-quality questions in total, mimicking the original exam\nTake the exams as many times as you would like\nGet support from the instructor if you have questions\nDive in deeper with the detailed explanations and links to additional resources for most questions\nAccess the exams anywhere, anytime on your desktop, tablet, or mobile device through the Udemy app\n30-days money back guarantee if you are not satisfied\nI am excited to have you as a student and to see you pass the exam, taking your next career step as a Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark 3.0!\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Neither this course nor the certification are endorsed by the Apache Software Foundation.

I actively respond to Q&A with explanations if you still have questions.\n\n\nThese practice tests for Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate are designed to help you understand all of the exam topics so you can pass the exam but also help you learn the concepts of the Databricks platform. It is very important to finish all 5 practice exams because each exam focuses on certain features of Databricks so you don't want to miss out on those prior to taking the exam. My goal here is not just to help you pass the exam but help you learn the Databricks platform along the way.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a summary of the Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate certification exam:\n\n\nThe exam assesses an individual’s ability to use the Databricks Lakehouse Platform to complete introductory data engineering tasks. This includes an understanding of the Lakehouse Platform and its workspace, its architecture, and its capabilities. It also assesses the ability to perform multi-hop architecture ETL tasks using Apache Spark SQL and Python in both batch and incrementally processed paradigms. Finally, the exam assesses the tester’s ability to put basic ETL pipelines and Databricks SQL queries and dashboards into production while maintaining entity permissions. Individuals who pass this certification exam can be expected to complete basic data engineering tasks using Databricks and its associated tools.\n\nThe minimally qualified candidate should be able to:\nUnderstand how to use and the benefits of using the Databricks Lakehouse Platform and its tools, including : 24 % (11/45)\nData Lakehouse (architecture, descriptions, benefits)\nData Science and Engineering workspace (clusters, notebooks, data storage)\nDelta Lake (general concepts, table management and manipulation, optimizations)\nBuild ETL pipelines using Apache Spark SQL and Python, including: 29% (13/45)\nRelational entities (databases, tables, views)\nELT (creating tables, writing data to tables, cleaning data, combining and reshaping tables, SQL UDFs)\nPython (facilitating Spark SQL with string manipulation and control flow, passing data between PySpark and Spark SQL)\nIncrementally process data, including: 22% (10/45)\nStructured Streaming (general concepts, triggers, watermarks)\nAuto Loader (streaming reads)\nMulti-hop Architecture (bronze-silver-gold, streaming applications)\nDelta Live Tables (benefits and features)\nBuild production pipelines for data engineering applications and Databricks SQL queries and dashboards, including: 16% (10/45)\nJobs (scheduling, task orchestration, UI)\nDashboards (endpoints, scheduling, alerting, refreshing)\nUnderstand and follow best security practices, including: 9% (4/45)\nUnity Catalog (benefits and features)\nEntity Permissions (team-based permissions, user-based permissions)\nDuration\nTesters will have 90 minutes to complete the certification exam.\nQuestions\nThere are 45 multiple-choice questions on the certification exam. The questions will be distributed by high-level topic in the following way:\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform – 24% (11/45)\nELT with Spark SQL and Python – 29% (13/45)\nIncremental Data Processing – 22% (10/45)\nProduction Pipelines – 16% (7/45)\nData Governance – 9% (4/45)",

Thank you. (Collin P., 5 stars)\nI found it useful to have both lectures and live demonstrations. I have used different distros over the years but always for specific purposes so never learned a solid baseline. For this course, I built some VMs using a virtual box to follow along with and eventually moved toward a KVM solution on an old machine to practice with a hypervisor for containers and other VMs. I think this course along with practice and understanding concepts will get you through the exam and started in Linux Administration roles. (Justin S, 5 stars)\nI have a bit of Linux knowledge, through school, and choosing Linux to be my primary OS. I am about halfway or so through the course and have learned a lot. As for the poor reviews on this video, take notes, study, and implement, repeat. I did not have any issues with either instructor in this course. I also recommend additional study material while you're not at the computer, to keep your knowledge well rounded. Great course! (Gregory C., 5 stars)\nUpon completion of this course, you will earn 36 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA Tech+, A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",

Even if you are totally new to Networking.\nSo, whether you are a novice, need to pass the CCNA or just need a refresher for your current job, this course has everything you need.\nDon't doubt the Instructor with the proven record, but rather embrace his knowledge and his experience when it comes to this; after all...his reputation depends on your success!\nYou will acquire the knowledge in this course to make it transferable to real world use, as a Cisco and/or IT Professional.\nDISCLAIMER:   Please note that the simulators/emulators used in this course are not part of the course. It is the students responsibility to have these to practice with. The Cisco Packet Tracer & VIRAL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab) are Cisco proprietary software and can only be obtained through Cisco. But students have more options that those. They can create their own lab with real equipment, get BOSON or GNS3. It is up to each student to obtain the simulator/emulator of their choice to study along with this course. Please also NOTE:  .pkt files have been up-loadable to UDEMY's site via a ZIP folder. However, I would like to stress that replicating my labs will help students to practice, follow along and will drive down the information in a more precise manner where the students will retain more of the information for the test.\nBOOKS USED IN THE COURSE:  CCNA R/S by Cisco Press, Sybex CCNA Study Guide by Todd Lammle & The Only IP Book You Will Ever Need!, by Lazaro J. Diaz - These are ALL available on AMAZON\nThis course will give you an in-depth understanding of networking, using routers and switches and their various configurations and connections. You will learn how to configure; default, static and dynamic routing. You will comprehend how to manipulate each of the routing protocols attributes to meet the requirements of the network.\nThis course will also prepare you in Layer 2 technology and its various configurations, such as; VLAN’s, VTP, STP, PortFast, EtherChannel, Port-Security, Inter-VLAN communication & Trunking; plus the newest requirements needed for CISCO's NEW CCNA (200-125) certification exam as well.\nYou will also acquire the knowledge needed to secure the routers through the use of Access-list, configuring the different types of NAT & will be able to manage the router’s components.\nAs a students, you will also be able to thoroughly grasp the concepts of both Internet Protocols; IPv4 & IPv6. These are KEY to any Network!\nPlease keep in mind that Laz has his own book called \"The Only IP Book You Will Ever Need!\" that will further help those that need a more in-depth understanding of IPv4 & IPv6.\n\nAlso covered in this course is Wide Area Network Protocols like HDLC, PPP, Frame Relay, HSRP, BGP, MPLS, NHRP, MGRE among other things.\nYou will also learn how to create redundancy in  networks through the use of Redundancy Protocols such as HSRP which is just as important. Also, within the WAN, you, the student, will also learn how to create VPN’s and GRE Tunnels among other things that are crucial in passing the new CCNA.\nGreat achievements and success is at your grasp!\nAll you need to do is let this course guide you through it.\nThe possibilities are going to be endless once you take this CCNA certification course.\nAnd now, with UDEMYS Pilot program for Certification TEST Courses (which this course is part of), your odds of succeeding has just skyrocketed!",

If you wish to take the exam, and have it on your Microsoft Learn transcript, you need to do it by then. This certification will not expire.\n\n\nWhat do people like you say about this course?\nNick says: I think this is a Great course specially if your targeting the exam since all of the objectives here are discuss ... I successfully passed the exam and this training was very helpful\nAbdul says: Voice is so clear and proficient in English which can understand clearly. Thank you.! It's very helpful Mr. Burton. Your explanation is awesome..! Thanks again.!\nJackson says: Fantastic course, the way everything is explained is so clear, especially in comparison to a lot of the other Dynamics material that exists out there which is either very hard to understand or completely off the point. This course gives the clarity and focus in spades. This course has been instrumental in grasping the concepts and tackling the exam for me.\nSilas says: Mr Phillip Burton this is the best course. I cleared mb 910 exam with 980 points today. Thank you very much.\n\n\nThis course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate MB-910 \"Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals (CRM)\" for Microsoft's Customer Relationship Management apps.\nWe'll start off with looking at Dynamics 365 generally, and all of features shared between the different apps. We'll look at the built-in reporting capabilities, customers and activities, and the integration of Microsoft Dataverse and Teams.\nWe'll then look at Dynamics 365 Customer Insights (which used to be called Dynamics 365 Marketing). We'll look at the Dynamics 365 principles behind generating and scoring leads, segments and subscription lists, email marketing, event managing, and more.\nNext up is Dynamics 365 Sales. This includes the principles behind qualifying leads, the opportunity management process, the quote lifecycle, and the sales pipeline forecasting concepts.\nThen we'll briefly look at Dynamics 365 Customer Service, examining how to use queues to manage work, the case lifecycle, and Knowledge Management.\nThe final item is Dynamics 365 Field Service. We'll look at the work order lifecycle, the Inspections feature, customer asset management, and resource and scheduling processes.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get a free Microsoft Dynamics 365 trial!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of the customer engagement features and capabilities of Dynamics 365 apps. And with some practice, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification MB-910 - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume? And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.\nSo, without any further ado, let's have a look at how you can use the Udemy interface, and then we'll have a look at the objectives for the exam and therefore the syllabus for this course.",

      "description": "These AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 practice tests are patterned after the latest exam format and were crafted based on the feedback of our 300,000+ students on what appeared in the actual exam.

Alternatively, you can directly log in to your AWS Certification account to schedule the exam.\nIs this an exam dump for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 exam?\nNo, it isn't. AWS is always updating its exam content, and thus, the exam dumps you are seeing over the Internet are mostly inaccurate and outright illegal. The provided answers are wrong, and you are not provided with the proper explanations as to why an option is correct or not.\nWe write our own practice exam content based on the official SAA-C03 Exam Guide and on our own AWS exam experience. If you are looking for exam dumps for the SAA-C03 exam, please look somewhere else because this course is definitely NOT for you.\n\n\nThe AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate is consistently among the top-paying IT certifications, considering that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading cloud services platform in the world with almost 50% market share! Earn over $150,000 per year with an AWS Solutions Architect certification!\nBut before you become an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional, it is recommended for you to pass the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification exam first, and this is where AWS practice tests come in. It is possible that you have read all of the available AWS documentation online yet still fail the exam! These AWS practice tests simulate the actual certification exam and ensure that you indeed understand the subject matter.\n\n\nThis AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C03 ) Practice Exam course offers the following features:\n\n\nFULLY UPDATED TO THE  SAA-C03 version-  Most practice tests out there are already obsolete and advertised as \"updated\", but in reality, they are not! We have already integrated the new SAA-C03 topics such as Amazon Detective, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon EKS Anywhere, AWS Proton, and many more in our sets. The content of this practice test will also be updated to reflect the new SAA-C03 topics.\n\n\n390 TOP-NOTCH Questions - has 6 sets of AWS Practice Tests with 65 UNIQUE questions and a 130-minute time limit for each set.\n\n\nSIMULATES ACTUAL EXAM ENVIRONMENT - mimics the actual and the latest AWS Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 certification exam to help you pass and even ace the AWS exam!\n\n\nDETAILED EXPLANATIONS, REFERENCE LINKS, AND CHEAT SHEETS - our answer keys at the end of each set have full and detailed explanations along with complete reference links so you can check and verify that the answers are correct. Plus bonus cheat sheets to help you better understand the concepts.\n\n\nACTIVE Q&A DISCUSSION BOARD - with inputs from the instructors and exam feedback from thousands of our students, our Q&A board gives you the opportunity to know which topics recently appeared on the exam and better understand the AWS services and concepts covered in the test.\n\n\nRESPONSIVE INSTRUCTORS - our friendly team of AWS experts is able to address all your issues and COMPREHENSIVELY answer all your questions within 5 business days.\n\n\nCONTAINS A TEST REPORT - to track your progress and show you which AWS knowledge areas you need improvement.\n\n\nMOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!\n\n\nRANDOMIZED QUESTIONS - The scenarios and options on all 6 practice tests are randomized. This prevents the unconscious memorization of the answers and ensures that you fully understand the concepts.\n\n\nCLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS - Each item has reference links to the official AWS Documentation that can validate our provided answer, but you can also post in the QA section so we can discuss any issues.\n\n\nPrepared by an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional who has actually passed the actual SAA-C03 exam! (Please see my LinkedIn profile to view my AWS Certificate)\nThese practice exams are designed to focus on the important exam topics (such as EC2, EBS, S3, and many others) hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other AWS knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic is carefully selected based on the 4 domains of the actual AWS certification exam.\nSome people are using brain dumps or exam dumps for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 certification exam, which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because those exam dumps will hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge. It can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.\nPlease also note that these AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate practice tests SAA-C03 are not exam dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds to thousands of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03 practice tests are meant to do.\nWhen I was reviewing for my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam, I had a hard time finding comprehensive practice tests to help me pass my exam. I bought some of them in the market, but I was disappointed because there were a lot of technical and grammatical errors in the practice questions. This is why I created these AWS practice tests to help my fellow IT professionals in the industry.\nWe gave a considerable amount of effort to creating and publishing these AWS practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your SAA-C03 exam. And we don't need to trash or slander other AWS practice test courses here on Udemy just to make a sale because we are confident that our AWS practice tests are simply the BEST.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThese AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate practice exams for the new SAA-C03 version have a passing score of 72%, but I highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 90% or higher on each exam.\nRemember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the AWS exam, as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these Amazon Web Services practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment of which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!\nAWS always updates the content of their AWS Certification exam. This is why we regularly update the content of this practice tests reviewer to be on par with the new SAA-C03 version.",

      "description": "All questions are based on the Exam Objectives for the SY0-701 exam for all 5 domains of the exam, so you can take and pass the actual CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification exam with confidence! These questions are completely different from the practice exam questions set two.\n\n\nIn this course, we fully prepare you for what it is like to take the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification exam. These 6 full-length practice exams with 90 questions (including simulation-style questions or PBQs as CompTIA calls them) are timed for 90 minutes to help you pace yourself for the real exam. We have carefully hand-crafted each question to put you to the test and prepare you to pass the certification exam with confidence.\n\n\nYou won't be hoping you are ready, you will know you are ready to sit for and pass the exam. After practicing these tests and scoring a 90% or higher on them, you will be ready to PASS on the first attempt and avoid costly re-schedule fees, saving you time and money.\n\n\nYou will receive your total final score, along with feedback on each and every question, telling you exactly why each answer is correct, and which domain (and objective) you need to study more in order to pinpoint the areas in which you need to improve and perform some additional study.\n\n\nWe cover all five domains of the SY0-701 exam, including:\n1.0 General Security Concepts (12%)\n2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations (22%)\n3.0 Security Architecture (18%)\n4.0 Security Operations (28%)\n5.0 Security Program Management and Oversight (20%)\n\n\nOur CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) practice exams provide you with realistic test questions and provide you with interactive, question-level feedback.\n\n\nWe have some of the highest-rated CompTIA training courses on the Udemy platform and we invite you to visit my instructor profile to learn more about me, the certifications that I hold, and read the reviews of my courses. This course is consistently updated to ensure it stays current and up-to-date with the latest release of the CompTIA Security+ exam, and also provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked!\n\n\nWhat others are saying about my CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701): Practice Exams with Simulations course:\n\n\nThese questions are unique and well-conducted to prepare for security+ with relevant information. I am using multiple resources and this is definitely one to have. (Valdrin, 5 stars)\n\n\nI passed and these practice tests were a very important tool in my success. The details: the questions in these practice tests require very careful reading. For me, that was key as the actual exam's questions were more concise, so I felt well-prepared. To use these practice exams effectively (at least for me), I recommend taking the first one, determine what areas are the weak and emphasize your study in those areas for a number of days. Then take the next test and see what progress - or lack of - and then the study again. Repeat this until you complete all six. Then start the process again. If you have hit your study targets consistently, you should be able to get to 90% and above on the next or subsequent round of sample exams. I found that I was easily getting above 90% on my last week of studying before my exam. I did find the simulated questions to be inadequate, however. You may need to find an additional source for performance-based questions to supplement what you are learning here with the multiple choice questions. Don't overlook the PBQs! They were a challenge on the exam but I prepared well outside of Dion's tests and I think that's what allowed me to pass (honestly, who knows; there isn't any detailed feedback when the results are displayed and I don't know how much the PBQs are weighted in the total point calculation). Good luck! (Edward Valizan, 5 stars)\n\n\nAnother quality piece from Jason Dion. Honestly, if you want to pass any CompTIA exams, just buy Jason's practice exams. I have just bought the CySA+ practice exams, I am sure I will pass for the first time. Edit: I see a lot of people are complaining that it is not like the real exam questions and it does not cover all the topics. Of course you use other training materials too. I have read the Chaplle-Seidl book by Sybex. I have done all the online tests included with the book. I had the official CompTIA notes as well. I have watched a full video course from a wrong source it was so boring and dry, it was just a waste of my time. All in all, to me these tests covered all the topics I did not cover from the other materials, they are difficult but similarly worded than the exam, so your brain is trained for the real exam. I did not have time to go thorugh them 3 times so I have never done 90% on any of them, still passed the Sec+ exam easy. Anyways if you want to go down that route and want the real exam questions; exam dumps are readily available for free after some googling. Unfortunately, I don't see the point of that.  (Gabe Laszlo, 5 stars)\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will earn 6 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",

Now, I know that sounds simple, but there is a method to this that many students don't know.\n\nHave you ever taken an IT Certification exam and scored only 695 but needed 700 to pass?

It is very clear and easy to understand and the explanations of tackling test questions should prove very useful. I will definitely be using these techniques in my next exam.

      "description": "Learn Everything You Need to Get Certified From Scratch in Less Than 3h - From The Highest-Rated Terraform Instructor on Udemy\n- Do you know what order Terraform loads variables?\n- Do you know the 5 ways you can load variables?\n- How many providers can you use in your projects?\n- Why would you use Terraform Cloud vs Terraform locally?\n\n\nIf you want to pass the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate Certification but don’t know where to start, don’t fret.\n\n\nBecause trying to pass the necessary exam can be a daunting task. Especially with all the confusing documentation out there.\n\n\nWith no idea of WHAT to learn and HOW to learn it, preparing for the certification can become a chore in the back.\n\n\nThis course solves that. It helps you pass the exam by giving you everything you need to know and cutting out all the unnecessary stuff.\n\n\nWith lots of hands-on demos that show you exactly how to apply everything you learn.\n\n\nIt takes you from absolute beginner to ready to sit the exam in less than 3 hours.\n\n\nHi, I’m TJ Addams\n\n\nWith nearly 10 years in IT project roles, I spent a lot of time teaching over 16,000+ people on- and offline. So they can become ready to use their skills in production, even without prior experience.\n\n\nI simplify all the processes new students need to understand. And I provide a clear roadmap on what to learn to produce results fast.\n\n\nEverything I teach is based on what is used in industry and cutting out what isn’t.\n\n\nI operated in lead support roles to Project Sponsors, Platform Engineers, Solutions Architects, Developers, and Testers & have worked with partners to develop real-time systems underpinned by Terraform. I also have operated in diverse sectors including consulting, technology services and digital transformation; private online healthcare; and biomedical research.\n\n\nThis allows me to bring you unique insights way beyond the trivial \"hello world\" type of examples...\n\n\nCoupled with lots of demos, tips, and advice on how it’s used in industry. I cover the nitty-gritty to help you stand out from the crowd and learn the things most engineers don't even know about.\n\n\nFrom Zero to Certified Terraform Hero\n\n\nWhether you’re a beginner or expert… this hands-on course will teach you everything you need to pass the exam in less than 3 hours. If you want, you could watch the course in the morning and get certified by the afternoon.\n\n\nI’ve gone through all the criteria, summarized it, and condensed all the information you need. And I put it into simple step-by-step videos.\n\n\nIt also includes a crash course for those with no experience with Terraform or not familiar with the new 0.12 syntax that’s used.\n\n\nOnly the Exact Knowledge You Need to Pass the Exam\n\n\nDon’t waste time on unnecessary topics you don’t need to know about.\n\n\nFor example, you don’t need to learn how to set up a DB server when the certification asks you about state file management practices and variable loading orders.\n\n\nWhat you need to know are the key concepts, best practices, and the ways HashiCorp wants you to “use” Terraform versus how you would in industry.\n\n\nSpecifically, you need to know the best practices for state management, secret management, module management, versioning, the Terraform workflow for individuals, teams, and Terraform Cloud, as well as the new changes in Terraform 0.12.\n\n\nAnd this course will teach you all of it.\n\n\nAlso, this certification course is cloud agnostic. It doesn’t matter whether you’ve worked with AWS, Azure, GCP or even Alibaba Cloud before as it doesn’t lean towards a particular platform.\n\n\nIt’s made so that anyone can use it to pass the certification exam and also how HashiCorp wants you to go about it.\n\n\nWith Lots of Demos Showing What You Need To Do And Know … Without A Brain Dump.\n\n\nFollow along and gather real hands-on experience. Complete challenges and exercises while you go through this course. It’s designed to be engaging and fun, instead of putting you to sleep. And it explains to you exactly how to use what you learn and why to use it.\n\n\nYou will get a much better understanding of all the concepts involved in actual work. You’ll be able to pinpoint the areas you’re lacking in and fix them immediately by seeing how they work in action.\n\n\nThis way you’ll be ready to pass the exam with confidence.\n\n\nAnd of course, all the code used in demos is hosted for you on GitHub for quick access.\n\n\nSo you can reproduce everything you see in the demos and get a clear understanding of every lecture.\n\n\nYou'll be comfortable and well prepared for what will come up on the exam.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Get Inside The Course:\n\n\nDemos of what is in the certification\nHandy links to useful resources\nCondensed information to prepare you for the exam\n115 videos and 3 hours of material\nAll the code used in demos hosted for you on GitHub\n\n\nWhat Others Are Saying About My Terraform Courses:\n\n\n“This is a fast track, but for that cannot be considered as a rushed introduction to the Terraform concepts and practices, instead you can expect to be a fast and very accurate pass through the concepts, tips and trick necessaries for starting to produce results today”\n\n\n“I have taken Terraform course because I might need it in my DevOps role. It is very informative and contents is very details. Love it. Thanks!”\n\n\n“Hey TJ, Brilliant course. I like the small step by step videos but I loved the way you got stuck into the exercises pretty much off the bat. I found it far easier to digest Terraform and learn about its true capabilities having been through some more complex training. A great course for newbies!!! I hope you have some more courses in the pipeline. Thanks again.”\n\n\nBy The End of This Course You’ll…\n\n\nBe some of the first engineers to get the certification\nKnow Terraform and industry best-practices\nStand out from the crowd with your new certification\nKnow so much more about Terraform than when you started",

Your Explanations where informative and detailed. Thank you!\"\nDeepthi says: \"Topics are explained clearly and they are easy to understand. For SC-900 this is one of the best course in Udemy.\"\nKunjar says: \"The short quiz between chapters is helpful. Practice test at the end of the course is a confidence booster.\"\n\n\nThis course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate SC-900 \"Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals\" across cloud-based and related Microsoft services.\nWe'll start off with looking at the concepts of Security, Compliance and Identity (SCI). We'll look at security methodologies, security concepts and Microsoft Security and compliance principles.\nWe'll then look at Microsoft Identity and Access Management Solutions. We'll look at identity principles and concepts, basic identity and identity types, and authentication, access management and identity protection and governance capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID.\nNext up is Microsoft Security Solutions. This includes basic security capabilities and security management capabilities of Azure, and also Azure Sentinel, Microsoft 365 Defender, InTune and Microsoft 365.\nThe final item is Microsoft Compliance Solutions. In this section, we'll largely concentrate on Microsoft Purview compliance (previously known as Microsoft 365 compliance). We'll look at information protection and data lifecycle management capabilities, and inside risk. We'll end with looking at the resource governance capabilities in Azure.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get a free Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 and Purview compliance trial!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good introductory knowledge of security, compliance, and identity (SCI) across cloud-based and related Microsoft services. And with some practice, you could even go for the official Microsoft certification SC-900 - wouldn't that look good on your CV or resume? And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.\nSo, without any further ado, let's have a look at how you can use the Udemy interface, and then we'll have a look at the objectives for the exam and therefore the syllabus for this course. And if you are an American college student, you might even get college credit for passing that exam.",

      "description": "\"Very good overview for the AWS Networking Specialty exam. I feel like I will be well prepared after deep dive study.\"  - Mike\n\"I am catching on pretty good now. I will use this as a great guide and continue to go over it until I feel good about the information to go test. I like the practice test you included.\"  - Dennis\n\n\nAre you looking for AWS Networking Training? Do you want to learn from an experienced trainer who makes complex concepts simple and easy to understand? Do you need to prepare for the AWS Advanced Networking Specialty exam? Do you need to learn about VPCs, Direct Connect, VPNs, Routing, VPC Peering, Transit Networks, network security, load balancing, Route 53, CloudFront, Disaster Recovery, or other AWS Networking subjects?\nI am an AWS official Instructor and have a number of top-rated courses on Udemy. Most lectures in this course are 5 - 15 minutes long. A few deeper topics are slightly longer.\nCloud Computing is everywhere. Traditional standalone datacenters are slowly becoming a thing of the past. More organizations are either migrating to the AWS cloud or are configuring hybrid computing models that use on-premises resources and cloud resources. In order to stay relevant, you must understand AWS. Many of the networking concepts that you may have already mastered are applicable to AWS networking.\nThis course builds off my \"AWS Solutions Architect Associate with Practice Test\" course and gives you a deeper understanding of AWS networking. Also, you may notice some overlap with my AWS Security Specialty course as it relates to network security.\nSo, join me on this journey and enjoy my top-rated AWS Networking course!",

It has been updated based on the changes in late 2024 for the Tableau Certified Data Analyst exam.\nPlease note: This course is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft.\n\n\nWhat do students like you say?\n\"With this course i got certified as a Tableau Desktop Specialist. THANKS Phillip!\" - Juan Sebastian Rodriguez Casas\n\"Adequate knowledge and good understanding I did not have before about Tableau. With this new knowledge and clear understanding of Tableau I truly believe I can now work as a Tableau Developer. \" - Clever Atanode\n\"Very informative. I feel that I could teach someone Tableau based upon what I have learned here. \" - Phil Jones\n\"Just got my qualified associate certificate yesterday with 91%(75% required to pass). I am a graduate student and have 0 experience with Tableau. But this course gave me an in-depth understanding of Tableau which allows me to be very flexible in ways to solve the questions in the exam. This course is excellent! Thank you, Phillip! \" - Yifu Yan\n\"This course has exceed my expectations in all fronts. Very complete, very comprehensive and at the right pace. I like the fact of going into some important details without getting bored or distracted. The pace of talk of demonstrations was perfect for me. It is clearly an outstanding value for money and I truly recommend it to everyone who wants to master Tableau. Well done and thank you. \" - Jorge Soares Albergaria\nDo you already use reporting software such as Access, SSRS or WebI? Or is this your first reporting software tool? Either way, welcome.\nIn this course, learn the skills that Tableau want you to know, and add another tool to your CV, and even go for either of the first two official Tableau certifications.\nTableau is one of the most requested reporting tools that are requested in the job market, and the ability to being able to use it now could be very useful for your current work, and your next job hunt.\nWe'll download and install for free Tableau Public, which gives you most of the capabilities of the full-cost Tableau Desktop. We'll start by creating our first visualizations (vizzes) and investigate the Tableau interface.\nWe'll create dashboards and storyboards, so that you can tell a story. We'll create maps, hierarchies, groups and sets, and all sorts of chart types. We'll enhance our charts with reference lines and bands, and extend our data analysis with trends and forecasting. We'll add formula calculations, quick table calculations, and LOD calculations. Finally, we investigate advanced data connections and mapping.\nThe course will take around a little more than 15 hours to complete, but completing this will enable you to create vizzes, dashboards and stories of your own, and know how to overcome common problems.\nThe course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll create for instance a basic bar chart, then turn it into a stacked bar chart, and adding coloring and information through tooltips and labels, step by step.\nPlease note: Tableau certifications are currently being tested on versions 2020.3 and 2021.1. There have been very few visual additions to later versions, but where there are, they have been reflected in this course with course updates.\nThe course is fairly relaxed - there will be a few \"wrong turns\", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual analysis will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on.\nAt the end of the course, you can download a certificate of completion, so you can show everyone your new-found skills, prepare for the official Tableau certifications, and be able to start creating analyses for yourselves.",

In this initial series we will not overwhelm you with information, but rather strive get you accustomed to ACI, how it operates, and how to actually do the work within the APIC GUI! This is about 9 hours worth of ACI goodness! If you are preparing for the DC v2 exam, this will be the perfect series to obtain the information that you will need to know in order to be successful in the lab examination (within the scope of ACI).\nYou will learn more about:\n• SDN (Software-defined Networking)\n• VXLAN\n• ACI Components\no Spine and Leaf Switches\no APIC Controllers\nUnlike most traditional courses, I will take you through the implementation of an ACI infrastructure from a real-world perspective. You will learn most of the terminology associated with Cisco’s ACI, as well as the basic networking constructs such as bridge domains and contexts.\nMost implementation are not going to be ‘strictly ACI’ either, so I take you though how to extend layer-2 and layer-3 out of, and through the ACI domain. This includes using some of our favorite protocols such as BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, and vPC!\nNote: My course is developed using ACI 1.2(x) release.",

A great value since this course is updated as Microsoft changes the exam requirements over time. This course will be ready for you when you are ready to take the exam.\nWhat students are saying:\n5 stars, “Great in-depth coverage, easy to understand, good examples to practice.” - Andy K.\n5 stars, “Good explanation, easy to catch up.” - Paul C.\n5 stars, “Seems up to date and thorough, and is a really good bargain” - Stephen I.\nWelcome to this course.\nFully captioned in English.\nThis course has been continually improved and covers the AZ-204 Azure developer topics.\nMicrosoft Azure is a skill in high demand in today's large business marketplace.\nIf you're a developer, you know as well as I do that change is always happening. It's not possible for all of us to be up-to-date on every piece of new technology out there, but this is not one of those times. Cloud-hosting has changed the way all applications are developed—from websites, to web applications, to mobile apps, and traditional backend applications as well. The rapid adoption of the cloud has touched everything.\nThe next time your resume is on someone's desk—be it a promotion at work or a new job opportunity—you cannot afford to have such an obvious gap in knowledge. Can you imagine being a front-end web developer today and not being able to talk about mobile-first or responsive design? Industry trends show that developing applications using cloud-hosted components is becoming the in-demand skill of tomorrow. Having Azure skills on your resume will only help you get in front of more hiring managers and land more jobs.\nThis course goes through all of the requirements of the Microsoft exam AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure exam. While other online resources cover bits and pieces of the topic, I can confidently say this course goes deep on everything you need to know for this exam. Multiple videos are devoted to each sub-objective, and this course also includes a full sample test so you can see how ready you are to take the real test.\nIf you don't have much previous exposure to Azure, this course will cover each core section in detail. If you ARE already an expert at many Azure topics, you can easily skip the sections that you already know and focus on the sections that are new to you.\nThis Azure exam is tough. But these videos will guide you through the Azure interface, and through your own practice and experience with the platform.\nYou get lifetime access to the course, and so there are no silly \"30-day\" countdowns that require you to pay more to extend access. This course will be here when you need it.\nEnroll today!\nVersion history\nVersion 1 - Launched the 70-532 course in January 2017, 8 updates to the course along the way.\nVersion 2 - Launched the AZ-203 course in January 2019. Free upgrade for students of the old course.\nVersion 3 - Launched the AZ-204 course in August 2020. Free upgrade for students of the old course.\nVersion 3.1 - More walkthrough of code that connects to Azure. Cosmos DB and SQL Database.\nVersion 4.0 - Completely re-recorded in May 2022.\nVersion 5.0 - Course re-recorded in September and October 2023.\nVersion 5.1 - Updated with new videos where required.\n\n\nMicrosoft, Windows, and Microsoft Azure are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.

This is THE practice exams course to give you the winning edge.\nThese practice exams have been co-authored by Stephane Maarek and Abhishek Singh who bring their collective experience of passing 20 AWS Certifications to the table.\nThe tone and tenor of the questions mimic the real exam. Along with the detailed description and “exam alert” provided within the explanations, we have also extensively referenced AWS documentation to get you up to speed on all domain areas being tested for the SAA-C03 exam.\n\n\nWe want you to think of this course as the final pit-stop so that you can cross the winning line with absolute confidence and get AWS Certified! Trust our process, you are in good hands.\nAll questions have been written from scratch! And more questions are being added over time! You can see for yourself some of the amazing testimonials from our students who have aced the real exam:\n=======\nFEATURED REVIEWS:\n5 stars: I just passed my SAA-C03 today and I would like to thank Stephan for creating such great content. I went through his course and did these practice papers as well. And the questions were really similar to the ones which came in the actual exams. I am still stunned with my score since I got 1000/1000. If this does not clear your doubt then nothing will.

If you just do Stephane's Solution Architect course and this test course, you will pass the certification for sure. Ankur W.\n\n\n=======\nQuality speaks for itself...\nSAMPLE QUESTION:\nA social gaming startup has its flagship application hosted on a fleet of EC2 servers running behind an Elastic Load Balancer. These servers are part of an Auto Scaling Group. 90% of the users start logging into the system at 6 pm every day and continue till midnight. The engineering team at the startup has observed that there is a significant performance lag during the initial hour from 6 pm to 7 pm. The application is able to function normally thereafter.\nAs a solutions architect, which of the following steps would you recommend addressing the performance bottleneck during that initial hour of traffic spike?\nConfigure your Auto Scaling group by creating a scheduled action that kicks-off before 6 pm. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm\nConfigure your Auto Scaling group by creating a lifecycle hook that kicks-off before 6 pm. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm.\nConfigure your Auto Scaling group by creating a target tracking policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm.\nConfigure your Auto Scaling group by creating a step scaling policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm.\n\n\nWhat's your guess? Scroll below for the answer...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect: 1.\nThe scheduled action tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to perform a scaling action at specified times. To create a scheduled scaling action, you specify the start time when the scaling action should take effect, and the new minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling action. The engineering team can create a daily scheduled action to kick-off before 6pm and hence this is the correct option.\nAuto Scaling group lifecycle hooks enable you to perform custom actions as the Auto Scaling group launches or terminates instances. For example, you could install or configure software on newly launched instances, or download log files from an instance before it terminates. Lifecycle hooks are not the correct choice for this use-case.\nWith target tracking scaling policies, you choose a scaling metric and set a target value. Application Auto Scaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling policy and calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value.\nWith step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process as well as define how your scalable target should be scaled when a threshold is in breach for a specified number of evaluation periods.\nBoth the target tracking as well as step scaling policies entail a lag wherein the instances will be provisioned only when the underlying CloudWatch alarms go off. Therefore we would still see performance lag during some part of the initial hour.\n=======\nInstructor\nMy name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course. I teach about AWS certifications, focusing on helping my students improve their professional proficiencies in AWS.\nI have already taught 1,500,000+ students and gotten 500,000+ reviews throughout my career in designing and delivering these certifications and courses!\nI'm delighted to welcome Abhishek Singh as my co-instructor for these practice exams!\n=======\nWelcome to the best practice exams to help you prepare for your AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam.\nYou can retake the exams as many times as you want\nThis is a huge original question bank\nYou get support from instructors if you have questions\nEach question has a detailed explanation\nMobile-compatible with the Udemy app\n30-days money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied\nWe hope that by now you're convinced!...

But even dead simple tools still require a little instruction on how they approach the backup and recovery process. Knowing how exactly to use these tools to ensure the greatest success is part of using them correctly. Actually using Backup and Replication for Backup and Replication -- and restores -- is the theme for our conversation here.\nIn this second course out of three, Backup, Recover and Replicate Workloads with Backup and Replication, you'll begin by being introduced to the architecture of backups, getting to know the three unique methods that can use to store data. Armed with this information, you'll configure and execute a series of backup jobs, exploring the variety of ways that backup jobs can be configured. Next, you'll extend your reach by configuring replication jobs to a secondary disaster recovery site. Then, you'll restore that data, whether it be entire VMs all the way down to individual files. Finally, having done all these activities atop the VMware vSphere hypervisor, you'll see their similarities and differences atop Microsoft's Hyper-V. By the end of this course, you'll be armed with the experience you need to backup, replicate, and recover any virtual or physical workload using your Backup and Replication infrastructure.",

Jason is easy to follow, listen to, and understand during your study period (I sit for hours listening and taking notes and replaying the section) (Mark Guillen, 5 stars)\n\n\nJust passed my security+ today! Dion's course was excellent. It was all I needed, and I took his practice tests I also purchased. The only thing I think would help other testers is more sophisticated and harder performance-based questions as I experienced ones today that were pretty tough and required more hands-on experience. Overall, though completely worth the money. (Duran navarro, 5 stars)\n\n\nThe course is very informative and good for people that has no knowledge about cybersecurity so far. It teaches us about the harm caused by attacks and how to prevent them. I would suggest everyone to take this course, even if they don't wan the certificate from Comptia.  (Mahmoud Choumar, 5 stars)\n\n\nJason is a great pedagogue. He is thorough and amiable. The course has very minimal errors and you can tell he is very strict with the format of his lessons. I had very few questions during the lectures and only experience one issue throughout the whole experience. I will definitely buy more courses from him. I also bought the voucher from his website to get the retake for only 100 bucks! Good job Dion Training! Keep up the great job! (Victor Cabrales, 5 stars)\n\n\nPassed the exam in December of 2022 using this course - FIRST TRY!! This course gave the back bone of everything I needed to pass the Sec. + exam. When the time came to study up a day or two before the actual exam, I used all the practice quizzes/tests from the CompTIA Sec. + study book. Seems thoughtless or stupid to not use the book for actual studying, but I found I learn slightly better in a class environment and this course/videos allowed me that. Thank you for this course and I look forward to many more in the future! Honestly, I haven't taken an ACTUAL exam in years - many years. If I can do it, you all can too! Good luck and God speed! (Nathaniel Shumaker, 5 stars)\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will earn 31 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",

I create no more than three questions/day to maintain high-quality.\nb. There are no simple one-liner questions. Each question is based on your understanding of a scenario. The questions challenge you to understand, apply, and analyze your knowledge.\nc. I simulate the actual PL300 Microsoft exam experience for you in the form of drag-and-drop questions, dropdown questions, multiple yes/no questions with a radio button, repeated scenario questions, etc.\nd. Clear and lucid explanations for both correct & incorrect answers.\ne. Where required, each question comes with an attached PBIX file that you can download to verify your answers.\nf. Supporting visuals created by me to drive better understanding (Not taken from Microsoft documentation)\ng. Explanations run parallel to the product. Every detailed explanation has corroborating evidence with the Microsoft product (like Power BI Desktop or PBI service) shown in screenshots and clear callouts.\nh. Explanations are NOT directly copied from Microsoft documentation. I have rephrased all the reasoning in a simple and easy-to-understand language.\ni. No step-motherly treatment of incorrect answer choices. I took enough effort to explain the rationale for each answer choice (whether correct/wrong), including the reference links.\nj. Don't worry about inaccurate sentence framing/wrong grammar/incorrect punctuations. I use Grammarly to review every question.\nk. Almost non-existent repetition of questions only to increase the question count.\nl. For some questions, you may have to search for answers in the given reference link. A Quick Preview feature shows a screenshot of the relevant paragraph to which the correct answer refers.\nm. I love to help you succeed. If you need to discuss, we have an Active Q&A dashboard and expect fast responses (save for my sleeping hours, which are generally less).\nn. As soon as there is an update from Microsoft, I try to update my course, keeping it always fresh.\no. The question bank is peer-reviewed every three months to ensure exam relevance.\np.

Again, Thanks 6 stars.\"\n\n\nThis course focuses on the various apps which make up the Power Platform, together with how they can be used by other programs, apps and services. It covers many of the requirements of the PL-200 \"Microsoft Power Platform Functional Consultant\" exam.\nWe'll start off by looking at canvas Power Apps. We'll get a free Developer edition and/or free trial of Power Apps, and get some sample data using the Dataverse (previously known as the Common Data Service). We'll then create a canvas Power App through a template and then, starting from scratch, we will replicate it and expand the functionality. This also includes creating a new table in the Dataverse. We will also look at Global and Context variables, components and collections.\nWe'll then look at model-driven Power Apps using the Dataverse. We'll look at the constituent parts of a model-driven Power Apps: site maps, forms, views, charts and dashboards. We'll also restrict the type of data which can be inserted into our Dataverse by using business rules.\nNext up is Power Automate. Using our free Developer edition or the paid-for version, we'll create several automated flows, and the different triggers and actions you can use. We'll look at various triggers and actions, together with looking how we can enter data in sections using the business process flows.\nWe'll then go back to the Power Platform more generally, looking at solutions, security, and importing and exporting data.\nWe'll start off with looking at Power BI. If you have a PC, we'll look at the Power BI Service (available through any modern web browser), creating reports and dashboards, and sharing dashboards. We'll also look at adding existing Power BI tiles or dashboards into our model-driven and canvas Power Apps.\nFinally, we'll then look at practical examples of using models inside Power Apps and Power Automate, and finish with some other topics.\nNo prior knowledge is required - we'll even see how to get a free Power Platform trial!\nThere are regular quizzes to help you remember the information, so you can be sure that you are learning.\nOnce you have completed this course, you will have a good knowledge of how to make Power Apps and Power Automate flows, together with how to use them in Microsoft Teams. It will help with the requirements for Microsoft's PL-200 certification.\nSo, without any further ado, let's have a look at how you can use Udemy interface, and then we'll have a look at the objectives for the exam and therefore the syllabus for this course.",
