      "description": "Learn a dying art that is Film Photography. Learn the complicated in a simple way within the surroundings of your own home. Bring photography back to life and create timeless photos and steal back what digital has taken from you. Simply...learn how to take photos and make them from the vision of your eye to the print of your wall, and enjoy the process....Be part of the film revival!!!\nLearn the very core and basics of Photography covering areas such as:\nAperture, Speed and ISO.\nComposition - Rule of Thirds, Sweet Spots and Lines.\nSettings for Portraits and Landscape shots.\nLearn in an unrestricted way where practice and correcting mistakes takes priority over tedious dictations and perfection. This course will teach you the 'rules' and push you towards your personal and unique style of photography.\nHave you never used a film camera? Not to worry, this course will guide you through everything from choosing a film to loading it within a film camera. You will also learn how to safely remove your film, store and create that film into negatives. Learn the magic of printing your very own print. It's a satisfying feeling when you see that image magically appear on that bit of paper after all the effort you've put in. It's even more satisfying when you see the quality of your work in broad daylight. We will cover:\nDarkroom Equipment and Materials\nTips and techniques for ease of use and better results\nChemicals processes and preparations.\nThis course is instructed in a way that will allow the absolute beginner to start from scratch and operate a home lab not too different from a pro lab. Create results that have been used for over 100 years, become part of a dying breed and learn a skill. It's a skill you can easily learn, develop and pass on! Videos are accompanied with supplementary material in the form of a pdf guide. This will allow you to follow the actions of each lecture but also to follow a written guide for some finer details. Sometimes a 5 second video extract can say more than a paragraph in a guide, but a guide can create a definitive detail that would be boring and uninspiring to listen to in a video. With this course you have the best of both worlds and a choice as to which way you want to learn.\nThis course is based upon a 10 week practical learning basis. You can complete this course in an hour, but the aim is that you complete a lecture practice for a week, testing technique, then moving onto the next lecture. That way, you are giving yourself time to learn and experiment and not being bogged down with feeling pressured to move through the course at a pace that doesn't suit you. Please do your own research and change any areas that you do not agree with in this course. This course isn't a definitive guide, it's a guide to introduce you and hopefully expand your knowledge and thinking.\nTake this course and you will open yourself up to a skill and expertise that is fast disappearing. You'd be surprised at the acknowledgement and comments you'll get when you have a film camera. Don't let a microchip control your photos and memories, put yourself in control and be your own artist.",

What was intended to be a two-month trip ended up becoming a three-year journey around the world.\nDuring those three years, I fell in love with the world and the many beauties and adventures it held.\nWhat was at first no more than a simple tool for me to express myself and show others what I was experiencing â the beauty and thrill of living in this world â slowly turned into a passion and love that I have turned into my profession.\nAs a travel and adventure photographer, I have visited more than 40 countries, worked with companies on various projects, and become a best-selling teacher. To date, I have taught a total of more than 10,000 students, and I am incredibly humbled to have shared my knowledge with them all.\nIn this course, I want to take you on a wild adventure and show you the art of travel and adventure photography.\nThe wonders and thrills of working in the field, various tricks and tips, how to take EPIC photographs that truly capture a feeling, handy accesories, the best camera equipment to travel with, photography backpacks, how to keep yourself, your photos, and your equipment safe, how to earn money through travel and adventure photography, and much, much more.\nI cannot wait to embark on this most exciting photography journey with you.\nI hope you are ready!\nJellis\nAn honest review and rating is always appreciated and will help me to make any necessary improvements for the course, as well helping to get more people involved so they too can benefit from the beauty of photography. Many thanks!\n_______\nNote: This is a specialization course, not a beginnerâs course on photography.\nIf you have no prior knowledge about the basics of photography, I suggest you check out âThe Ultimate Photography Course for Beginnersâ and âThe Ultimate Post Processing and Editing Course.â\nâThe Ultimate Photography Course for Beginnersâ teaches the fundamentals about photography, such as the exposure triangle, exposure modes, lighting, focus, composition, etc.\nâThe Ultimate Post Processing and Editing Courseâ is an in-depth course about the other half of photography: the post-processing and editing side.\nYou will learn how to work with Lightroom and Photoshop and how to turn your okay-looking photos into stunning photographs.\nThis is only a suggestion to help you become a better photographer. The reviews and ratings for these two courses speak for themselves and illustrate how much value they have provided to other students.",

My name is Rose! I am a Photographer, Videographer and Online Course Creator from the Philippines. My work is focused on events, food and product photography and creating courses to share practical tips from my experiences. I made so many mistakes and bought gear and props I haven't used up to this day. In my courses I share everything. From mistakes to avoid and techniques to help cultivate your photography and videography skills. :) I have taught over 50,000 people locally and globally on how to create scroll stopping food and product photos and here are a few words from some of them:\n\n\nâIf you are thinking of buying the course, do it. You will learn something helpful. Rose is a good instructor and she maintains a good pace. I am not a beginner and have been taking and editing my own product photos for a couple of years. But they looked kind of ...meh... The sections on Color, Composition, Branding, and Planning were real eye-openers for me - I am going to go back and redo all my photo sets (about 30) using the concepts taught by Rose. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Good instructor. The material is presented clearly and the target audience is complete beginner - someone who may not have a camera other than the one on their phone. It is a quick flyover of the basics of product photography aimed at someone is a first-timer and wondering how to improve their images. Completely un-intimidating and very down-to-earth and helpful. UPDATE: I am now in the section on Composition and Color. This is game-changing for me. I will be revising all of my product photos based on this information. THIS SECTION ALONE IS WORTH SEVERAL TIMES THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY I AM INVESTING IN THIS COURSE. BRAVO!â - Mark C.\n\n\nâPerfect for a beginners' course. Short, to the point, and easy to do in one sitting! I'll be diving deeper into the videos when I put these tips in action. I liked how Rose expressed the importance of using what you currently have before splurging for fancy equipmentâ - Nika T.\n\n\nâBest photography course I ever took. Very practical, easy to understand and Rose is wonderful! I learned so much!â - Shiran A.\n\n\n\"This course is simply amazing. It's very detailed and easy to follow. I didn't know much about shooting my own products, but she did a great job of simplifying the process and now I have the confidence and knowledge to shoot my own products.\" -Valerie\n\n\nâI just love the course ! It exceeded my expectations. It is just so practical and so genuine and professional.â - Bassem M.\n\n\nâI have been watching different videos to improve myself, this one is definitely one of them that is practical and helpful. Thank you again!â -Ming Yin H.\n\n\nâThis course is perfect for a beginner. It taught me so many great techniques about composition, photo editing, lighting, etc etc.â - Tanya N.\n\n\nBy the end of this course you will be more confident in using your most powerful tool which is your camera, you will be more familiar with lighting and different ways you can set up for different effects, you will no longer be intimidated with composition and you will be more confident in styling your scene. I really hope youâll join me! See you inside the course :)",

Too often IÂ see people taking pictures on their smartphone that are just boring, uncreative, and at best, meh.\nThis is why IÂ have created this smartphone photography class in which IÂ want to share with you the skills that allowed me to build an audience of 30,000+ followers and get to license my photographs to brands like Apple, AirBnB, or UPS, or publish photography books and host photo exhibitions. IÂ want you to truly step up your smartphone photography game, to the point that people won't believe that you took those pictures on a smartphone.\nOver the course of this course, which has been recorded in real world settings, I will teach you all you need to know to become an skilled smartphone photographer and take and edit pictures that are not only beautiful to look at, but also tell a story that reaches and touches your audience.\nThe course consists of the following 6 chapters:\nIntroduction: I will share some of my philosophies and thoughts on how to think about smartphone photography and how to develop your own style. IÂ want to help you be more thoughtful about what makes your pictures uniquely yours.\nYour camera: You won't be able to master your smartphone camera if you don't fully understand it. Let me walk you through some of its most important features. Yes, some of those features are basic, but mastering those is what can help set you apart.\nComposition: This is where I will teach you specific techniques on how to make your pictures more visually appealing. Basically how your pictures can stand out creatively. This is what will allow your pictures to move from \"oh, nice\"Â to \"oh, wow\"!\nStreet Photography: Do you always need permission to take pictures of people? I will teach you the ins and outs of street photography and how to capture the hustle and bustle of life on the streets. It takes time to get a handle for this, but I'll share my secrets with you.\nEditing: Taking a picture is half the rent. Editing it is the other half. Watch me edit pictures and share my thought process with you as I do. IÂ will walk you through my edits step-by-step. You will see how some digital touches can really elevate a picture.\nAudience Engagement: IÂ will share my thoughts and experience on how to engage with your audience and how to be a great visual storyteller. After all, each picture has a story to be told, and you want to be thoughtful of how you share those stories.\nAgain, IÂ am very excited to welcome you to this class!",

      "description": "In Masterclass In Photography Part 1 youâll learn which camera is best for you, I mean do you âneedâ an expensive pro level camera and lenses for the kind of photography you love doing?\nYouâll learn why manual mode is vital to understand for creative reasons (covered in PT2 of this series) and how easy it is to use on a mirrorless, DSLR or bridge camera.\nMost photography courses concentrate on gear and tech, but cameras donât take pictures! You take pictures and you are often overlooked in favour of the latest gadget or upgrade.\nIf you've been photographing for years but still have lingering doubts about any of these things, Masterclass Pt1 will bring them together and replace confusion with clarity and confidence\nIf you've just got your first camera, you'll have clarity from the start and confidence will quickly follow - you'll shortcut years of trial and error\nWhat Will You Learn?\nHow a camera works so you can creatively exploit it to the max\nPhotography jargon explained\nMenus and feature setups you need\nCamera and kit you need - and what you donât!\nExposure modes explained\nDifferent types of lenses and what they do\nIntroduction to types of image files\nThree useful filters\nHow to tell the camera how you want your photos to look\nWhy manual settings are vital - and how simple they are to use\nThe exposure triangle - trust me it's easy\nExposure settings\nHow to easily shoot in manual mode\nThe camera settings I use any why I used them\nPractical exercises to grow your skills and confidence\nPhotography is not as complex as some make out. Itâs a bit of knowledge and a lot of practise - which is great news because you already love taking pictures right?\nFirst youâll master the 3 exposure controls so youâll know what they do, why they do it and be able to choose which settings to use. Exposure is not rocket science. It's just 3 controls and if you can get online and enrol on a course you can easily master 3 camera settings.\nManual mode is pretty simple TBH, and it's vital because cameras canât think for themselves and sometimes get it wrong. Ever taken a photo of bright snow or a white sand beach in sunshine? Did it come out dark and dull looking? - Thatâs what I mean.\nWhich Camera Do I Need For This Course?\nThis photography course is designed for cameras that have settings. DSLR, Mirrorless and Bridge cameras. Though there are benefits for compact camera and phone photographers, it is not designed for these.\nCameras don't take pictures - you use a camera to make pictures, in the same way a musician plays an instrument or an artists uses a brush.\nThe camera is your instrument. First you learn how to play it, then how to make beautiful music with it - and there are only five controls you need to do that.\nGreat photographers of the past took stunning photos on the most basic of cameras with only three controls. They understood the creative relationship between settings, composition and light - the bedrock upon which great photos are built. If they could do it with their clunky old cameras, there's no reason why you can't too.\nIf you don't agree I'll give you your money back no quibbles. Far enough?\nMike\n\n\nPS: Exposure settings have creative superpowers too and the next step is learning what they are and how to choose settings for creative reasons. Every photo you take is your photo and Masterclass PART 2 will put you in control of how you want it to look.",

      "description": "<<Â One of six digital photography courses by Villiers Steyn >>\n\n\nNow that youâve mastered the basics of your DSLR camera itâs time to take your photography skills to the next levelÂ without wasting any time!\nThis course was designed as a follow-up intermediate digital photography course to another Udemy course of mine called Digital Photography for Beginners with DSLR cameras, but anyone with a sound basic photographic knowledge and a DSLR camera will find value in this course.\nLearn how to turn good photographs into great photographs!\nLearn what to consider when you upgrade your camera gear.\nUnderstand how different camera settings work together to ensure perfect exposures.\nSee the value of a hot shoe flash, whichÂ can be used both on the camera or remotely.\nPush your creative limits byÂ photographing everything from sun stars to the Milky Way.\nGet introduced to Lightroom â the best photographyÂ software on the market!\n\nPhotographers never stop learningâ¦\nSwitching over from Automatic Mode or Program Mode to Aperture or Shutter Priority is just the first step in becoming an excellent photographer. As a beginner, you would have been introduced to a lot of new settings, like ISO, exposure compensation, f-values amongst many others, but the key is to understand how these settings work together to give you perfect exposures. And that is one of the main goals of this course â to help you understand the relationship between the cameraâs most important settings.\nAs your photography knowledge increases, so will the likelihood of you wanting to upgrade your entry-level camera gear, so this course discusses different photographic equipment, including camera bodies, lenses, teleconverters, filters, bags and accessories, as well as hot shoe flashes.\nArmed with the right gear and settings, the skyâs the limit when it comes to creativity, and this course covers everything from moon and star photography to painting with light and HDR imaging.\nLast, but not least, youâll be introduced to every photographerâs best friend: Adobe Lightroom Classic. Itâs the most powerful and user-friendly photography software out there and not only allows you to import, view and sort your photos, but also to edit them and export them for specific uses.\n\n\nContent and Overview\nThis course is divided into five broad components: first we look at photographic equipment and what you can consider adding to your current setup; secondly we look at more advanced camera settings and especially the relationship between different settings and how they work together; thirdly we look at flash photography, focussing on hot shoe flashes, remote flash work and studio photography; next we look at a number of more advanced creative tips and techniques that will help you to take images that youâve only ever dreamed of taking before; and lastly, we look at post-processing of your photos in Adobe Lightroom Classic.\nLectures are short and concise (usually between 3 and 10 minutes long) and consist of either video clips (where I talk to you directly), screen casts (where I show you examples, diagrams or recorded workflow in Lightroom), or a combination of the two.\n\n\nTHIS IS WHAT YOU WILL LEARN FROM THIS COURSE:\nWhat camera equipment to buy next:\nUpgrading from entry-level to mid-range level gear.\nWhen to use teleconverters / extenders.\nWhich filtersÂ  Â  Â  to use for which conditions.\nWhat other small photographic accessories to keep in your camera bag.\nHow to choose a new camera bag once youâve upgraded your gear.\nThe relationship between the cameraâs most important settings:\nJpegÂ  Â  Â  vs RAW files (advantages andÂ  Â  Â  disadvantages of both).\nChoosing the right shooting mode for the right situation.\nMaster apertureÂ  Â  Â  once and for all by looking at an Aperture Scale.\nThe Exposure Triangle (how Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO work together).\nMetering mode vs Exposure compensation (which one is best?).\nCalculating depth of field (so you know exactly how much or how little is in focus).\nStay in focus by mastering auto focus modes and focus points.\nAuto ISO (choose a lower maximum ISO).\n\n\nHow to use a hot shoe flash:\nHow a hot shoe flash works and enables you to light your subjects upÂ  Â  Â  creatively and much better than your cameraâs pop-up flash.\nHow to use a hot shoe flash remotely with the help of transmitters and transceivers.\nThe basic difference between hot shoeÂ  Â  Â  flash photography and a studio setup.\nHow to become an even more Creative photographer:\nHow to isolate your subject.\nHow to capture movement and light with long exposures.\nHow to photograph the full moon and the Milky Way.\nHow to create sun stars.\nHow to paint with light.\nHow to overcome high contrast with the help of HDR imaging.\nHow valuable Lightroom Classic CC is:\nHow to safely store and import your photos.\nHow to view, filter and sort your photos.\nHow to edit your RAW files.\nHow to export your edited RAW photos for different uses.\nTake a moment to view the course Promo Video, as well as those lectures that have been made available as free previews.\nKeep in mind, if you're not happy with the material, there's a 30-day no-questions-asked full money back guarantee!

      "description": "Welcome to Beginning DSLR Photography. Do you have a DSLR camera but have no idea how to use it? Maybe you've heard terms like shutter speed, aperture, and ISO, but don't have a good idea about what they do or how to control them?\nMaybe you've started taking photos but they always turn out blurry and you can't figure out why so you put the camera down in frustration?\nDon't worry! In this course we're going to cover all the essential basics. This course is a great foundation that will teach you the basic principles of how a camera works so you can start practicing and begin taking better photos right away.\nIn the first section we will cover each point of the exposure triangle and how they work together to create an image. Each video lecture demonstrates the topic and shows example photos to help drive home the information.\nIn the next section, we'll go over focus, various focus modes, focus points, and back button focus. You'll learn how to nail the focus every time!\nSection 3 will cover composition, rule of thirds, leading lines, leading the eye, and balance. Once we understand the technical aspects of exposing a photo correctly, it's time to start getting creative with composition and crafting a shot that will stand out and be something more than just a snapshot.\nSection 4 is all about light. We'll discuss and demonstrate the different qualities of light and how to harness light to craft an image.\nSection 5 is about applying your knowledge and getting out to practice! I provide several exercises that utilize what we've learned in the previous lessons and will help you get well on your way to becoming an amazing photographer.\nEvery concept is explained and demonstrated in a way that is simple and easy to understand. Still have questions? I'm available through the wonderful Udemy platform to help you out.\nEven if you've been taking photos for a while now, this course will cover foundational items that you may have not picked up on your own.\nI teach this curriculum at my local technical college and I'm excited now to bring this course online!",

      "description": "Do you want to learn how to food photography?\nDo you want to become a professional food photographer and start charging potential clients/cafes/restaurants/hotels?\nThen you've come to the right place!\nI have created this food photography course in such a way that even if you are complete beginner, you will be able to easily understand and apply everything!\nAt the same time, it's also perfect for intermediate level food photographers who really want to take their food photography skills to the next level!\nThe best and most unique part about this course is that we take a LEVELÂ BASEDÂ APPROACH!\nThat means we start from the basic LEVELÂ 1 shot and keep increasing the difficulty and professionalism of shots with each level.\nThis makes your learning very linear, easy and practical!\nIn this course we focus on the following six elements of food photography:\n\n\nPhotography gear to be used\nSettings to be used in the camera\nSurface/Background/Backdrop to be used\nProps/Styling to be used\nType of Lighting to be used\nEditing and Post-Processing of the food shot\nWith each level, we will increase the difficulty of these six elements and that will mean we see our food shot getting more and more professional as we add more things.\nLet's briefly go through these six elements:\n\n\nPhotography gear\nIn this course we will be mainly focusing on using DSLR or Mirrorless cameras but this course CANÂ also be followed using phone cameras. We will also be using other shooting gear like prime lenses, tripods, etc.\n\n\nSettings\nOnce we start moving up the levels, our main focus will be on using the manual mode of the camera. We will be focusing a lot of the three settings of the exposure triangle - Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO and seeing how to get the best combination of these three settings to get the best food shot.\n\n\nSurface/Background/Backdrop\nWe will be using different types of surfaces/backgrounds/backdrops as we move up the levels. You will be pleasantly surprised to see how cheap it is to get your hands on \"professional\" looking surfaces and backgrounds.\nProps/Styling\nAsÂ  we move up the levels we will start to incorporate more advanced props and styling to our food shot which will make it look more professional.\n\n\nType of lighting\nThis is a very important part of this course because lighting is perhaps the most important of the six elements of food photography. We will be learning how to manipulate the lighting using various techniques which will ultimately enable us to get those DARK/MOODY looking food shots that we see on the internet.\n\n\nEditing and Post-Processing\nNo food shot is complete without editing. And as we move up the levels we will start going from basic to advanced editing. The best part is that wherever possible, only free editing software will be used. We will learn all the techniques professional food photographers apply to their shots like selective adjustments, faded look, exposure correction and so much more.\n\n\nYou will also be getting your hands on a document which will contain all the food photography equipment and accessories shown in this course so you don't have to research anything on your own.\nThe best part about this course is that everything that is shown is either very cheap or in most cases can even be made at home with some hacks (DIYÂ stuff).\nFood photography is truly a skill that once mastered can easily be used to make an earning since it's a skill that is always in demand because food industry is one industry which will always keep growing.\nA side advantage of learning food photography is that you can apply most of the things to product photography too.\nSo you learn two genres of photography in one go.\n\n\nWho am I?\nI'm Kush Sharma, a professional photography and videography instructor and I have taught over 45000 students form over 160 countries. I have been teaching photography since 2013.\n\n\nSo if you like the sound of all this, then don't wait any longer. Sign up right now and we'll get started straight away! :)",

      "description": "Photography for Beginners - DSLR Photography Camera Settings is the key to finally getting to grips with your DSLR!\n\"I love, love, love Rosie's courses! She is a fantastic instructor and engaging (I am a teacher by profession and can say she is a really great teacher). I have taken a bunch of other beginning DSLR classes and was overwhelmed. I was totally frustrated by my camera. THIS course was the first one I have taken and able to apply all that I learned right away.\n\nThis course is short, sweet, to the point. The difference in my photos has been amazing! She uncomplicates camera settings for you! I can go out and now know exactly where to start in manual mode and how and what to adjust. Her modules give just enough information without too much. It is enough to get you started taking beautiful photographs right away.\n\nHer case studies at the end are particularly helpful as well. Start with this class and then add on her Creative Fundamentals class after. I love Rosie as a teacher and would definitely enroll for any of her other classes she creates in the future. RosieÂ - I'd love a beginning Lightroom class from you :-) .\n\nHighly recommendÂ this class for the beginning photographer and useful whether you have a Nikon or Canon camera\".\n- Nichole Churchill (five stars)\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\nDo you enjoy photography andÂ have a gorgeous fancy camera but always find yourself using it only on auto mode?\n\n\n\nOr perhaps you briefly tried out the different settings but ended up feeing completely confused and overwhelmed by photography?!\nIt's really exciting when you buy a new camera - you have all these hopes and visions for beautiful photography, but the reality of loads of confusing knobs and dials when you get it out of the box can be frustrating!\nIf you've felt disappointed with the photographyÂ you've been shooting onÂ your DSLR (a camera where you can change the lenses) or bridge camera then this is the perfect photography course for you!\n\n\n*****\n\n\"I have just completed this photography settings course and I\ncould have never imagined when I started out that I would be able to\ndemystify all of the confusing settings and buttons on my camera! Now\nthat I am done I feel perfectly confident that I can take great pictures\nin any environment.\" (five stars)\n\n*****\n\nI'mÂ Rosie Parsons, owner of Rosie Parsons PhotographyÂ - an award winning professional photographer with 12 years photography experience. My photography has been featured on theÂ cover ofÂ Professional PhotographerÂ and inÂ OK! Magazine among others.\nI would love to come alongside you, to be your guide and help you discover the easy, step by step path to understanding your camera and improving your photography.\n\n\n*****\n\n\"Rosie's photography course is amazing! I have learnt so much in\nthe past few weeks. So much detailed information which allows me to\nunderstand what photography is. Understanding how the aperture, shutter\nspeed & ISO works, I can now take photos using the Manual Mode with\nconfidence. I am so glad to get a chance to enrol in Rosie's photography\ncourse andÂ looking forward to increasing my knowledge andÂ make\nphotography as a career. Thanks Rosie\" (five stars)\n\n\n*****\n\nIn myÂ Photography Beginners: DSLR Photography Camera SettingsÂ CourseÂ we take things at a really easy pace, thoroughly explaining all the key photographyÂ settings you need to know, how to adjust them and how to choose the correct photographyÂ settings in any given situation from dark rooms to bright sunny days. You'll get to watch me in action as I photograph events like a christening and how I adjust my photographyÂ settings inside the dark church, and what settings I choose outside in the bright sunshine to capture great family photos and candid photography.\n*****\n\n\n\"I found Rosie's photographyÂ course insightful, fun and inspiring. Her informal manner made the lessons feel like I had invited aÂ friend round to teach me the basics of photography, and as a result, I Â think I digested the bite size tips more quickly. I feel like I've learnt a lot about photography in a very short space of time thanks to her clear communication and obvious talent. The fact that I can dip in and out of the videos at my leisure made the whole experience easy and\nenjoyable.\"\n- Nicola Moyne, Marie Claire Magazine\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\"I love this course ! Rosie is great at breaking it down for you . Her lessons are well thought out and organized. I love the quizzes at the end of the chapter. Im getting the answers right so I know I'm learning! I took my camera out for the first time yesterday. I was able to easily apply what I learned. Each chapter builds on the next. I dont have a Cannon or a Nikkon camera. Familiarizing myself with my camera setting prior to taking a lesson was extremely helpful. Although I have a Sony A7RII I was able to follow along after I learned to navigate my camera's settings. Her lessons apply to any camera. I love her smile and and assuring attitude. I will take another course from Rosie.\"\n\n- Jessica Cortez\n\n\n*****\nTakeÂ this photographyÂ course with itsÂ easy to follow, bite sized lessons and photographyÂ challenges (plus our exclusive Facebook community only for students of this course) and enjoyÂ a huge improvement inÂ your photography skills!\n\nYou've made your biggest investment by buying your fantastic camera, now let's make the most of what it can do!\nEnrol now in my Photography Beginners: DSLR Photography Camera Settings course and let's get you started on your fast track to amazing photography!",

        "Lighting is easily the most important aspect of photography. I would even go as far as saying that lighting is photography: It is even in the word itself; \"Photography\" is greek for \"Light Drawing\", or \"drawing with light\". Without light, you cannot take photos. It is perfectly possible to take amazing photographs with a very simple camera - as long as the lighting is good. The opposite is true as well: If you are taking photos in a situation where the lighting is truly appalling, having the fanciest, most expensive camera in the world isn't going to help you capture the photographs you want. Become a seeker of light! The most important thing we have to do is to learn how to \"see the light\". A lot of things will affect what the effects of a light source are, and how your photos are affected by said source. The brightness (or 'intensity') of the light source plays an important role, but, as we will explore in depth in the next chapter, is a lot less important than you might think. The color of light is essential - and some of the biggest challenges you'll meet in photography are the issues that arise when you start mixing different light sources. Sunlight, for example, has a drastically different color from the light that comes from your flash, the light that comes from car headlights, or the light in your house. While it can be incredibly difficult to get your photos to look \"right\", light sources of different colors offer an opportunity too. With the right mixture of types and colors of light, you can achieve some beautiful creative effects that will make your photos really 'pop'. During the class we are going to through the evolution of light using small Speedlites, direct flash, bounce flash, multiple wireless remote flash, and creating studio quality light anywhere, anytime."

You will learn how to beautifully use your flash INDOOR & OUTDOOR.

To watch him wave his hand beneath focused beams of light as a reverse image of Full Moon over Half Dome burned into the paper's silver surface. No two prints would ever be precisely the same. He was as much an artist here, in the darkroom, as he was in the field.\nAs much as I love to keep my teaching focused on in-the-field technique and creative inspiration, at some point you have to address the other HALF of the art form. This is a course for wilderness photography enthusiasts dedicated to that other half of the craft. I hope this course is as much like that experience next to Ansel might have been. Except that in the place of a darkroom, we have a lightroom. Instead of Ansel, you have me.\nI have been shooting as a professional wilderness photographer for the past 15 years. I've been published in Time/Life, National Parks, Nature's Best, and National Wildlife.\nI'm a purist. I started my first decade in photography shooting with slide film. Photo clubs made sure you followed rules!\nSo, if you want the guy who will give 200,000 Lightroom presets to make your images look just like his (over saturated and artificial as they may be) then I advise you look elsewhere.\nThis is for aspiring outdoor photographers who wish to train their eye (and hand) at editing their RAW images with ease and joy. For those who wish to truly be artists in the room of light. And to do so with as much simplicity and organization as possible, so that you can get back outside taking pictures, since that's what caused you to fall in love with this in the first place.\nI believe you will see that it isn't about having profuse knowledge of every possible trick in the book, it is about acquiring a skilled hand with just a few essential tools.\n100-level 1st hour - The essential stuff you MUST know so that your digital life doesn't become a monster and try to eat you in your sleep.\n200-level 2nd hour - This is the fun part. I walk you through recent images of mine made in the American Southwest demonstrating tasteful use of the essential tools you MUST know in Lightroom. I intentionally leave out plenty of tools for two reasons. One, I only USE the ones that we cover here. Two, it does you no service to waste your time teaching you things you don't need to know.\nThis is everything you need to know and none of the other shenanigans.\nSee you inside the Museum of Art!\nPaul",

And a few photographers speak about, in fact, especially when it comes to analyzing their own photos.\n\nThe course is recorded by Vyara Georgieva, that's why you'll hear a female voice once you start it.\n\nYou are on the way to stat an amazing journey in the world of photography!

The eleven lessons in Rules of Composition work separately and combined with each other to help you develop your own signature style. Maybe you want to create a sense of frenzy within the image, pushing the viewerâs eye to dart back and forth and up and down within the frame. Perhaps the story you want to tell is framed in such a way to convey a subject who is completely alone and unobserved, or perhaps the opposite, challenging the camera with humor, hostility or irony. Learn how different colors can create different moods. Develop easy to learn techniques to make your subject appear tiny and powerless or bold and dominate. And then of course, there is lots of fun in breaking the rules once you know them.",

      "description": "Why Learn Fashion Photography?\nAre you excited when you see images in top Fashion and Editorial brands like VOGUE, ELLE, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar, and InStyle? But, at the same time, you're unsure where to begin, or you don't have the bizarre budget for most of these productions? Great, it sounds like you're in the right place, my friend.\nFashion photography is the pinnacle of portraiture, and it's often both the most creative and lucrative medium to boot. Most fashion editorials take a small army of creatives and genuine innovative thinking to produce. But, the results stand the test of time and captive millions worldwide. Fashion has always pushed the bounds. And it's a medium that many photographers admire. But, it's not one without its challenges. In comes this course.\nIn this course, you will:\nRecognize the importance of the shooting environment and how to maximize it.\nIdentify the required gear and best camera settings for fashion photography.\nRe-construct a one-light setup and demonstrate the post-processing workflow to enhance your fashion images.\nWho Am I?\nI'm Devaun Lennox, a fashion photographer by trade and the co-founder of PhotographyPX, a rising authority brand in the photography community. I originally started my photography journey in the spring of 2017. But, in May of that year, I organized my first makeshift fashion editorial shoot with friends at an abandoned ghost town. Think bikers, spikes, lots of leather, and a serious attitude. After that shoot, it was hooked. And I was sold a dream. Since then, I've averaged about ten fashion shoots monthly. But like many, I was self-taught. And I had to go through the grueling pains of learning this medium without much guidance. Plus, I didn't have the budget or space. I still don't, quite honestly. Yet, that was never an excuse. And I've found creative ways to maximize your home studio, so you can still replicate those eye-catching editorials we see monthly in print. And those skills, tricks, and best practices are what this course is all about.\nThis course will guide you through a one-light fashion shoot from start to finish. And not only will we capture an image that largely replicates most VOGUE editorials, but we'll also do so in the comfort of our living room and at a price less than a used DSLR. Yup. If that doesn't surprise you, I don't know what else to say. But, yes, totally possible. And so possible, any photographer can do this. It's simply a matter of learning how to is all.\nSo what are you waiting for, friend? Get started.\nSee you inside Home Studio Fashion Photography.",

      "description": "This photography course changed this photographer's life...\n\n\n\"After more than 20 years of taking photos as a hobby, I decided that I wanted to know more about photography and finally leave \"Auto-mode\" behind me.\nShould have done this much sooner: Chris explains everything in a simple manner but very thoroughly, and now; finally, all the puzzle pieces fall into place.\nGreat course, highly recommended.\"\nMartijn Tilgenkamp\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nHighlights...\nMaster Photography | 28Hr Complete Guide Includes 209 Page Companion PDF\n*** 28 hours of photography video tutorials\n*** 200+ Photography E-book w/150+ images to use with this Photography Masterclass\n______________________________\n\n\nHave you ever found yourself thinking or even telling someone close to you...\n\"The struggle is real. I look at other photos and think, mine will never be that good?\"\nIt doesnât have to stay that way. Your photos can drastically improve once you understand the 4 core ingredients for creating amazing images.\nSo, what are these 4 ingredients? Theyâre equipment, light, composition, and editing.\nHow can this photography masterclass help you master these ingredients and, most importantly, transform your photos into something incredible?\nFirst, let me introduce myself. Iâm Chris Parker, and I have 35 years of experience as a professional photographer, along with 15 years of teaching others how to elevate their photography skills.\nIn this masterclass, Iâll guide you through each ingredient step by step, breaking down every concept so youâll fully understand how to apply it. Letâs take a closer look at what youâll learn for each of these game-changing elements.\n\n\nJeff D. Jones\n\"Chris Parker is amazing. He explains everything, so it's crystal clear the first time, so you don't have to keep replaying the lessons to figure out what he was talking about. I've been a photographer myself for over twenty years, and I feel that to stay fresh, it's a good idea to take these \"refresher\" courses like Chris.\nI highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone who is interested in photography.\"\n\n\n\n\nINGREDIENT 1: EQUIPMENT\nItâs not the gear that you have that allows you to create great imagesâ¦ itâs knowing how to get the most out of what you have!\nIf you master Lighting and Composition, youâll be able to create spectacular images whether you have a smartphone, a $500 DSLR, or a $10,000 Mirrorless camera.\nBut before you can master Lighting and Composition, you need to understand how your camera AND lenses work, their limitations, and more.\n\n\n\n\nDesislava Toteva Garcia\n\"This course is extremely helpful!! I love the way you explain everything, + I love your vibe!! 100 % recommended!!\"\n\n\n\n\nWith that knowledge, youâll elevate your photographic knowledge beyond 90% of photographers in the world.\nWhen you complete this section, youâll understandâ¦\n\n\nHow to read a Histogram for perfect exposures every time\nYouâll know the difference between Dynamic and Tonal range and how that affects your exposure andâ¦\nHow your camera's Tonal range limitation can affect what you want to createâ¦ and how to overcome it\nThe first lens you should buy and why\nWhy your camera gets exposure wrong and how to fix it\nHow to take full creative control over your camera and shoot in Manual mode (easyâ¦ step-by-step instructions)\nWhy I donât recommend Manual Mode for beginners and Iâll reveal a better alternative!\nHow to get sharp images every time\nWhy lenses arenât always perfect and how to avoid imperfections\nYouâll discover the difference between Focal length and Field of View and their purpose in creating amazing images\nWhy you should consider the Crop Factor before buying a lens\nHow lens Aberrations can negatively affect your photos and how to overcome them\n\n\n\n\nShelly Woesthoff\n\"I really liked the interactive camera demonstration indoors and outdoors. Makes it much easier to wrap your mind around the different settings when you can see it in real-time.\"\n\n\n\n\nStart by mastering the camera gear you have. Then, move on to masteringâ¦\n\n\nINGREDIENT 2: LIGHT\nAlthough this is the second ingredient... it's actually the number one ingredient to master. Why should it be number one?\nWell, without it, you wouldnât be able to create an image. Itâs like trying to create a photo with your lens cap on. How do you think that will work out?\nWith Light, you can tell a story by shaping the light based on your creative vision. Light can be soft or hard, and can even be of different colors.\nHarnessing light is essential for creating amazing images. Once you complete the Light mastery section, youâll understandâ¦\nThe difference between soft and hard light and why you may want to use one over another\nWhere light comes from and why itâs important to your photography\nHow your camera sees light and its limitations\nThe 3 behaviors of light and how they can alter what you capture\nHow contrast can change the mood of your image\nThe 4 characteristics of light and how they can affect the quality of your images\nAnd more\n\n\n\n\nRyan Lehoullier\n\"Phenomenal course. Clearly, a lot of time and effort went into it. The course is informative, with quality content and valuable information. Thank you for this.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis section is in the process of being re-recorded and will also include new content. See (below) the last section for more information.\n\n\nINGREDIENT 3: COMPOSITION\nNow that youâve mastered Light and are a master of your camera gear, itâs time to elevate your photographic prowess by mastering composition.\nThis will includeâ¦\nA true understanding of what composition is and how it can make your images better\n10 composition rules that will improve your images instantly\nThis section is in the process of being re-recorded and will also include new content. See (below) the last section for more information.\n\n\n\n\nKris Chartrand\n\"I purchased my canon rebel nearly 10 years ago, and I had never attempted to play with the manual settings, this course truly helped me understand, and the images he actually uses and does as a walk-through truly helped the understanding quite a bit. I can't wait to start playing around and testing what I have learned. Thank you!\"\n\n\n\n\nINGREDIENT 4: EDITING\nNow that youâre impressing family and friends with your photography skills, one more thing will take you over the topâ¦ editing.\nPhoto Editing, in and of itself, is an art form. Master editing, and youâll leave your mark on the world for generations to come. Yes, editing is that powerful.\nHalf the goal of editing is developing your own editing style. It wonât be easyâ¦ and will take some time.\nIâll guide you on your editing journey with several image manipulation apps that can help you achieve your creative vision. This will include introductoryâs toâ¦\nLightroom\nPhotoshop\nGIMP\nDarktable\nAnd more\nPlus, Iâve included a 4 step process for âdevelopingâ your editing style.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Turner\nUsing plain simple language, Chris manages to make what is seemingly complicated understandable - I've been playing around with cameras for years and mostly been flying by the seat of my pants, I'm now starting to understand how I managed to jag those couple of really great shots, and now hopefully will be able to create even more 'great shots'.",

When I left the workshop I was EXCITED to use my camera! I tried all of my newly learned techniques at home. I learned so much that day, and I was hungry for more!!!!!\"\n\"Steve explained things at a level I understood, using terminology I understood. And even more important, I was able to practice what was taught and see the results. If the results were not what I expected, Steve was available to explain what changes should be made to get the better shot.\"\n\"Steve is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and easily imparts that knowledge to students. He spends time explaining even the most basic concepts (like how do I pop the flash!). I had just gotten my camera and had no idea how to use it. I took some pretty great pictures after the workshop!\"",

      "description": "From a passionate professional photographer with 15 years experience\nThis course is going to teach you in short period of time:\nHow to use artificial constant light to illuminate your photographs;\nHow to use the daylight as a key light;\nHow to set fast and cheap a home studio;\nHow to work with cheap backdrops and how to create backdrops yourself;\nHow to use reflectors and diffusers;\nYouâre going to fully understand the camera of your phone;\nHow to take the best out of the settings of your phone;\nHow to shoot on a tripod and off tripod;\nHow to take flat lays, straight ons and 45 degree shots;\nHow to use the portrait mode of your camera (live focus) and get that beautiful blurred background that makes your images look like professional;\nHow to use the focus of your camera properly;\nHow to take food photos with the Lightroom mobile application;\nHow to edit your food photos, usign Lightroom mobile application and Snapseed;\nHow to create food compositions that make your images recognizable;\nHow to level your camera, how to hold it properly and how to use the zoom of your camera;\nWhat if I told you that you can take stunning food photographs with your mobile phone?!\nWould you still want to spend thousands of dollars on professional equipment? I donât think so!\nHi, Iâm Ted Todorov!\nIâm a professional photographer and I have been doing professional photography for 15 years. Iâve been shooting many hotels, restaurants, restaurant menus, a lot of food.\nAnd over my practice I realized that the potential of the mobile phone is huge. And this was one of the reasons that I created this course for.\nWhoâs this course for?\nIf youâre an instagrammer this is the right course for you.\nIf youâre a food lover, food bloggers or a chef this course is also for you.\nThis course is based on pure knowledge, less talking, more action.\nIt is going to teach you everything that you need to know in order to take stunning, beautiful food photographs with your mobile phone at home on a budget.\nPay a close attention to the details\nI break down the whole photo shooting process into tiny details.\nIâm going to show you and teach you how one composition could be shot with 5 different light angles and how the same composition could be illuminated with 3 different cheap lighting setups, Iâm going to show you how to use the cheapest possible reflectors and defusers. And Iâm doing all this, because I want you to know that one scene could be illuminated in different ways, with different light sources and even with the cheapest light, youâre still going to be able to take a fantastic shot.\nIn this course Iâm going to show you all the mistakes that should be avoided. Againâ¦ this course is based on pure knowledge and practice.\n\n\nThe Smartphone Revolution\nIf you compare $400 investment on mobile food photography equipment against $5000 or $10000 or maybe even $15000 on a professional equipment for food photography the final result would be almost the same when it comes to websites, Instagram, Facebook or any other online presentation.\nContinue reading to see why and when you should choose a Smartphone instead of a professional DSLR camera and heavy equipmentâ¦\n\n\nWhy mobile food photography?\nBecause with the mobile food photography you learn much faster and you are much more effective and everything happens much easier with a little investment.\nIf you compare $400 investment on mobile food photography equipment against $5000 or $10000 or maybe even $15000 on a professional equipment for food photography the final result would be almost the same when it comes to websites, Instagram, Facebook or any other online presentation.\nYou can not tell the difference. Of course if you need the image for print, letâs say for billboard or a magazine, you can tell the difference then, because the professional cameras, thatâs the way they have been designed â the potential of the cameras, the quality of the cameras is completely different than the mobile phones.\nBut again, if you need the image for your food blog or your Instagram account, for Facebook, for your personal usage, then the mobile food photography is on the right spot. This is the thing that you need.\nThatâs why, if you want to save money, time, nerves, youâd better start with mobile food photography. Youâd better learn what ISO is, what shutter speed is, what shallow depth of field is, how to use the daylight as a light source, how to use artificial constant light, how to compose your scenes, how to illuminate your scenes, how to choose the right backdrop for your scenes, how to turn an idea into a concept and to achive final results like the ones that you see, because the mobile food photography is the entry level, this is the doorway to the world of the professional cameras.\nWith mobile food photography you learn faster, you take the images much faster and easier, you make the composition much faster and easier, you donât need any tethering cables, you donât need a computer to see the scene and to make your life easier.\nThe mobile phone gives you lot of flexibility and opportunities. Take advantage of them. And Iâm going to show you how to do it. And beside that, you edit the image much faster and much easier and the final step to upload the image is also faster and easier.\nI think that all these benefits a quite enough to think twice when it comes to food photography courses.\n\n\nEdit like a pro\nThe good preparation saves you time when it comes to editing.\nThe choice of the proper light source and itâs position, the proper camera settings, along with a good composition and the proper ratio will guarantee you a nice image that you wonât need much time to spend on editing. You will find all that in the course.\nBut in the course youâre also going to see and learn how all the images in this section have been taken and edited and youâre going to witness the entire process.\nEverything is perfectly explained in details. You will be surprised how easy it is to turn yourself into a professional photographer and editor.\n\n\nMobile food photography is the entry level... or does it?\nYou know what happens? These days many people buy professional cameras, thinking that once they buy a professional camera they will start taking amazing food photos with the camera. Unfortunately in the real life it dosenât happen this way, the reality is different.\nDo you know that most of these people give up at the end of the first month after they have bought the camera. You know why? Because they need to deal with aperture, ISO, shutter speed, focus, different modes of the cameraâ¦ they just get lost. And then you see that someone who have spent thousands of dollars on a professional camera, lenses and equipment. heâs not able to take as good images as these taken with a mobile phone, that costs between $350 and $400 second hand.\nSo, before you buy a professional camera, before you spent thousands of dollars on professional equipment, think twice. Iâm not trying to stop you from buying professional equipment, the only thing that I want to do is just to save your time, your money and your nerves. As I mentioned the mobile food photography is the entry level.\nFor those who donât want to become professional photographers, who donât plan to develop a career as a professional photographer, this course is for you.\nlso for those who plan to develop a career as a professional photographer, they can still use this course, because itâs going to teach you at least 80% of the knowledge that you need to know as a professional photographer.\nIâm going to walk you through the entire working process, Iâm not going to hide anything. So you will be able to see in real time what exactly happens through the screen of the phone. This is very important, nothing is hidden, everything is visible and will be revealed in this course.\nIâm going to start with building up the home studio, Iâm going to show you how to choose the right light source, how to use the daylight coming through your window as a light source and so on.\nThe whole idea of this course is to show you and to teach you how to take stunning food photographs at home on a budget. Itâs all about creativity, knowledge and imagination.\nIâm also going to edit all the images in the Lightroom mobile application and in Snapseed. And the final step that you have to do is just to upload your image to your Instagram account, Facebook or anywhere else that you want to upload your image.\nYouâre also going to be able to download the raw files of my images and to try to edit them yourself on your mobile phone, using Lightroom mobile application or Snapseed.\nAnd I want you to do that, because Iâm 100% sure that if I can do it, you can do it. Just follow me step by step, do as I do and you will be amazed with the final results.\nYou wonât believe that that was you taken all those images. One thing is guaranteed â at the end of the course you wonât regret a single minute of it.\nIt took me 6 months of hard work to put all the information together, to structure it, so I ca present it to you. Itâs about knowledge that I want to pass through. Because I know that anyone can do it.\n\n\nThis content is precious. Pure knowledge, based on practice. Thatâs all I guarantee.",

This is a short course to give you my Ten Top Tips and explain why they will make you a better photographer. With over 35 years experience as a professional photographer I have designed these Top Tips to give you an encouraging start. LearningÂ  to use your DSLR, mirrorless or compact camera in Manual Mode and freeing yourself from letting your camera making choices for you will allow you to be more creative with your camera. I've kept my language simple and avoided using jargon as much as possible so that if English is not your first language it will be easy enough to understand (and I have had some good feedback from people telling me I am easy to understand.) All the photos and video used to demonstrate my teaching are taken by myself or my wife (I'm not someone who teaches photography by using other peoples photos, except for some special illustrations.)\n\nYou will gain a fundamental understanding of your DSLR, mirrorless or compact camera and how you can be more creative with your photography. I frequently run photography workshops with people who own modern, high tech, expensive camera equipment and shoot all their photos on auto. In this course I will teach you how to break free from just using your camera's auto modes and how you can be more creative shooting in Manual Mode. Any camera that has a Manual Mode (and that's most cameras) is suitable to sue with this course.\nYou will learn about the exposure triangle - ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed, and how to use the camera's exposure meter to create well exposed photographs in any situation. I will teach you how to start appreciating different lighting conditions and how to take better photos no matter what the light is like. You will also learn how our eyes see differently than our camera and why this is an important concept for photographers to grasp.\nPeople who enjoy photography are usually visual learners so I have designed this course to be as visually stimulating as possible. Ten Top Tips is mostly presented with video, including lots of photographic examples, diagrams and animations to help illustrate the teaching.\nThere is no time limit to the course and I would encourage you to take time to complete each lecture and exercise as you feel comfortable to. Even repeat a lecture and exercise if you are not sure that you are understanding the teaching.\nIt does take time to learn to operate a camera manually, but I encourage you to persevere as it is rewarding. As you study, do the exercises and practice the teaching in this course you will be more creative with your camera.",

We're in an inflation of images today, so how can you make a difference?\n\nWhat won't be part of the course is yet another discussion about the camera and technical specs. It won't be about rules and techniques, how to use the camera and all that blah-blah, because you already know that.\n\n\nWe're going to talk about your position in Photography. How to not only to evaluate yourself, but to use instinct and your cultural background in order to take photographers that MATTER. IÂ believe THEORYÂ is more important than PRACTICE at this point.\n\n\nOn the completion of this course you will be able to:\nCreate a relationship with your subject (from a person to a landscape, it can be anything)\nKnow when is the right time to press the shutter and why\nHow to stop the overthinking and start seeing the world around you\nHow getting closer to the subject make your photographs alive\nThe harmful effect of laws and composition rules and how to create your own rules\nUnderstand how to analyzeÂ photographs\nGet into the right mindset\n\n\n\n\nWe'll start knowing more about photography without the camera. That's right!\n\n\nWhatÂ makes a good photograph and why?Â This seems to be the most important question mostÂ photographers don't know how to answer. I'll show you how simple it isÂ to understand the process and it use for any future photograph you see or take.\n\n\nYou will get to know what photography actually is. We will study the studium and the punctum and how they influence our perception, how to train the mind to work without the camera, how to know when is the right moment to take the photograph, and how rules block you from finding your own personal style.\n\n\nThis theoretical course isÂ cooperative.Â Meaning thatÂ IÂ propose you a different way of thinking as an exercise, and then you apply it by using your intuition and see what results you get. And then we move on until you start to see the difference.\n\n\n\n\nSupport materials:\nTwo of the best books on photography (on which the course is based)\nPhotographs (of course)\n\n\n\n\nSince we're here...\nA bit about myself\n\nI believe a place can reveal more than itself. It can revealÂ something aboutÂ you.Â It can be about aÂ moodÂ or anÂ action. It can beÂ stillÂ or aÂ reaction. I'm talking about the images which stop time. Images that absorb you.Â Every place in this world has a story, but how will we decide to tell it?\n\nI'm NorbertÂ Fodor, a romanian cinematographer currently based in Asia. I've graduated my BA and MA in Cinema and worked on national and international projects, TVC, Fiction, Music Videos, Ads.\nI've always been interested in images and got my first camera when IÂ was seven.Â Since then I couldn't forget about it, so it became more than justÂ aÂ profession.Â It becameÂ a way of thinking and living. My love for cinema and photography is eternal, and IÂ am constantly trying to deconstruct it and see what makes it alive and ticking.\n\n\nAÂ personal note on this course\nThe internet is an inflation of information. That's how IÂ got lost and that's how you probably did too.\nOn thisÂ journey IÂ found that the most rewarding experience is showing the secrets and mechanismsÂ toÂ people who are searching to ride through it. IÂ hope you will find this information useful and use it toÂ teachÂ others too.\nNorbert.\n\n\nPhotography, Composition, Camera, Canon, Nikon, dslr, beginner, editing, photoshop, lightroom, portrait, headshot, wedding, nature, budoir, course, digital, family, art, painting, free, bootcamp, guide, nikon, canon, fujifilm, fuji, sony, a7r, a7s, stock, outdoor, real estate, street photography.",

You must own a compact (point-and-shoot) camera, or a Micro 4/3rds, or a Bridge camera, so you can put this theory into practice.\nVideo lectures make up the bulk of this course, with 3 exercises and a quiz. The final exercise requires downloading some freeware, and installing this on a Windows-based computer.\nTopics include: image resolution & size, JPEG vs RAW files, memory cards, focus, metering, program modes, aperture / shutter speed, plus how to get your photos off the camera and fix them on a computer.\n\nFinally, the tutor does not own your particular camera - hang, there's hundreds of models out there, and the course would be many hours long if it was to cover every possibility.\nSo, you will be required to download and read your camera's manual, to fully understand exactly what dials to turn and buttons to press.",

So I wanted to consolidate all of that information and knowledge and put it in one place, in a structured, informative, exciting way for you to watch and enjoy. Itâs everything you need to know, distilled down into the key takeaways and delivered in a way that is designed to inspire you and take you to that place where youâre making your best work.\nSo, if you want to fast-track your learning journey, dial up your confidence in the craft, and start making the work you know you can make - then letâs do it.\nBy the end of this course you will be able to show yourself and the world HOW YOU SEE the world.

      "description": "This course takes you on a journey from being a street photographer to becoming a documentary photographer. IÂ explain how those genres differ, what you need to know about both, what principles to follow to be a good documentary photographer and then show you how I started getting assignments. IÂ talk about my first assignment at a legendary Gleason's Gym where legends of boxing trained for their fights - what was the plan and how I executed it.Â I mention the importance of a long-term project and having a long-distance attitude when working on a documentary project. Another important aspect that is being discussed is publishing your work and different avenues to explore. At the end students will be suggested a project that will get them involved, dip their toes in a new uncharted territory in a smooth way.\n\n\nThis course is for you if you are trying to venture into documentary photography while already feeling comfortable with street photography, but also if you are just curious to see a case study of such transition. I hope you enjoy it and - as always - feedback is very much welcome.\n\n\nPROJECTÂ DESCRITPION\nDocument your neighborhood or surroundings, make me feel what it's like to live there. Be specific! A broad approach isn't usually the best, it's the details that matter and through a specific person, place or time we can achieve showing a bigger pictures much easier. Instead of working on \"documenting your neighborhood\" work on documenting a specific place in that neighborhood, like playgrounds or your local grocery store. Document specific people, the guy who sells fruits and vegetables on the corner or your neighbor who has lived there ever since you remember.",

      "description": "In this course \"The Art of Figure to Ground\" we will explore how to add layers to your photograph. Artists have used layers to tell stories in their images, but to make them work effectively we must fully understand the concept of Figure to Ground relationships. From street photography to portraiture, every layer is an opportunity to add something to your picture.\nHave you ever wondered why professional photographers always get good images? Are they just lucky or do they see the world differently?\nA Room for Improvement is the first photography program that starts training your most important tool, Your Eyes. While most of the photography world is obsessed with gear and post production, the real secret to taking amazing images is learning how to see like an artist. Join artist & photographer Adam Marelli as he shares the tools, lessons, and training that classical artist use to bring images to life. As a trained photographer, painter, and sculptor Marelli combines twenty years of art eduction into simple to follow lessons that you can do in your own backyard.\nCOURSE STRUCTURE\nThis course is divided into 7 Lectures that are a Master Class in Figure to Ground.\nLecture 1: Why your discoveries matter?\nLecture 2: Spot the Background first?\nLecture 3: Use black and white to see color.\nLecture 4: Work like an artist.\nLecture 5: Solutions from my portfolio.\nLecture 6: See the photograph before it happens.\nThe lectures are designed to be watched in order, but you are free to skip around.\nThis course is approxiamtely 45 minutes, with downloadable images from the lecture, and an assignment designed to highlight the tools from each lecture.\nMarelli uses his own work and the famous artists who influenced his work to reveal \"how artists work\" and \"how they learned to see in a completely unique way.\" For centuries these concepts were reserved for artist guilds and apprenticeships, but for the first time they are being put in a language available to photographers.\nEXPECT RESULTS\nBy the end of this course, you will understand why photographers always say that \"the equipment doesn't matter.\" Learning to see like an artist is one of the single most fulfilling steps on the way to becoming a better photographer. In addition to improving your own work, you will be able to walk into any gallery or museum in the world and know, with full certainty, whether you are looking at a great piece of art or not.\n</p>",

My name is Denis Buchel, I am an experienced photographer and my goal is to help you improve your photography skills.\n\nThe course you are about to start will help you improve your photography skills on so many levels!\n\nYou will start reading and capturing peopleâs emotions in a better way.\n\nYou will start noticing all those small details that will enable you to level up your photos.\n\nYou will start analyzing, thinking, choosing and showing your photo work a little bit more precisely.\n\nYou will keep enjoying the whole process - because street photography is all around us, it is the world we live in.\n\nDuring the course I will be explaining everything in a simple and understandable way.\n\nThere will be hundreds of examples here. All of the photos you will see are mine. The stories Iâll be sharing, the experience,Â  the difficulties Iâve faced, the roundabout Iâve foundâ¦ these are things you canât learn by the book.\n\nYou need some inside info letâs say. Well, with 15 years into the photography world - into street photography mainly - I am here now to share what Iâve learnt, what Iâve discovered, what I've proved to be working.\n\nIf still wondering why you need to dig deeper into street photography mainly - in a word: because itâs magic.

How to pre-visualise how you want your photo to look, then figure out what You need to do to make it happen.\nIs the light perfect now, or do you need to wait for a break in the clouds, or move to the shade, or shoot by a window? Where do you need to stand for the best angle? Which lens to choose for the look you want. These are things You have to think about and take action with to capture vibrant, exciting, interesting images.\nKnowing what you want to achieve makes choosing settings easy. For example, when you know you want to blur movement to add life to the flow of a river it indicates what kind of shutter speed to use. If you want to capture an up close and personal feeling, youâll know what kind of lens to use.\nWhether you shoot on an expensive camera or a phone, You and how you think is the no1 most important thing in all photography. Itâs You who turns lead into gold\nYou'll learn my top five camera controls and how they can be combined creatively and technically for any image, 3 essential tools which will make your photography not only easier but make it look awesome too.\nAnd you can come behind the scenes on what was one of my most challenging yet personally rewarding professional photoshoots so you can see how it was planned, what went wrong and how I figured out what to do about it. It was a lot of work - but just 3 minutes of that was shooting.",
