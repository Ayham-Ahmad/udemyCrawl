      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nIf you want to advance in your career and get promoted, you have to learn how to efficiently delegate work to other people. It is not an easy skill to master, but you also do not have to be born with a special talent. With a proper approach, you can delegate any work efficiently. Luckily, there are a lot of interesting management productivity hacks that will help you delegate work efficiently to other people. In this course, I will teach how to delegate work efficiently to other people and still not jeopardizing the quality of the work.\nIn the course, you will learn the following things:\nHow to delegate efficiently\nWhen to use different types of delegation\nHow NOT to do things you are not supposed to do\nHow to make sure that the team works efficiently\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from the Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 100 different consulting projects in different industries that generated, in total, 2 billion of additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who are now Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that, my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 315 000 students, including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excel files as well as additional presentations and materials shown in the lectures, so as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nIn most cases, when you become a project manager or a manager, you will have little experience with delegating tasks to other people. The person who has promoted you will quite often not provide you with a practical approach to delegation, so you will be on your own to figure out how to do it in practice. This may lead to huge frustration during your first year as a manager.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help you learn how to delegate in practice. The course will give you tips and hints on how to approach delegation that will make your life during your first year as a manager much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what you should delegate, how, and to whom. On top of that, I will show you how to make sure that the team you are managing remains extremely efficient.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a good manager, you have to know how to delegate work efficiently. That is why I highly recommend this course to first-time Project Managers and Managers. The course will help you become an expert in delegating at the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will help you delegate work and select the right person for the task. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience, as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that, thanks to the course, you will learn:\nHow to delegate efficiently\nWhen to use different types of delegation\nHow NOT to do things you are not supposed to do\nHow to make sure that the team works efficiently\nYou can also ask me any questions either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is currently divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little introduction to the course, as well as some general information on how the course is organized\nEssential Concepts in Delegation. In the second section, we will discuss essential concepts. We will see who should delegate work, what kind of work you can delegate, and what types of delegation you can use.\nHow to delegate in practice. In this section, we will look at case studies that will help you delegate work. We will discuss fast and gradual delegation, as well as how you can select the right person to perform the task.\n· How to build team efficiency. In the last section, we will discuss what you should do to keep the team efficient after you have delegated most of your work to your team.\nYou will also be able to download many additional resources\nUseful frameworks and techniques\nAnalyses shown in the course\nAdditional resources\nLinks to additional presentations, articles, and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nPick the optimal delegation method\nDelegate work to others\nSelect the right person or a firm to do the work\nIncrease the efficiency of your team\nKeep some control despite delegating the work\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nManagers, especially first-time managers\nProject Managers\nStartup Founders\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics",

Learners will learn techniques for providing constructive feedback, building capacity, and fostering a culture of learning and accountability within project teams.\nImportance of Monitoring and Evaluation Skills\nMonitoring and evaluation (M&E) skills are indispensable for ensuring the success, sustainability, and impact of development projects across various sectors and contexts. By systematically tracking progress, identifying challenges, and measuring outcomes, M&E enables project stakeholders to make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and maximize project effectiveness. Here's why mastering M&E skills is crucial:\nEnhanced Accountability and Transparency: M&E fosters accountability among project stakeholders by providing transparent and objective evidence of project performance. By tracking progress against predetermined targets and indicators, M&E helps identify areas of success and areas needing improvement, holding project implementers accountable for results.\nContinuous Learning and Improvement: M&E facilitates a culture of lesson learning and improvement within project teams and organizations. By systematically collecting and analyzing data on project activities and outcomes, M&E enables stakeholders to identify what works, what doesn't, and why, thus informing adaptive management and strategic decision-making.\nEvidence-Based Decision-Making: M&E provides decision-makers with reliable data, evidence and insights to inform strategic planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation. By generating data-driven recommendations and insights, M&E helps ensure that decisions are based on objective evidence rather than assumptions or anecdotal evidence.\nResource Optimization: By identifying inefficiencies, redundancies, and areas of underperformance, M&E helps optimize the allocation of resources, maximizing the impact of limited resources. By identifying areas of success, M&E enables stakeholders to scale up successful interventions and reallocate resources to areas with the greatest potential for impact.\nStakeholder Engagement and Ownership: M&E promotes stakeholder engagement and ownership by involving key stakeholders in the monitoring and evaluation process. By soliciting feedback, input, and participation from beneficiaries, partners, and other stakeholders, M&E fosters a sense of ownership, accountability, and commitment to project goals and outcomes.\nDemonstration of Impact and Value: M&E enables project implementers to demonstrate the impact and value of their interventions to donors, funders, and other stakeholders. By providing credible evidence of results and outcomes, M&E helps build trust, credibility, and support for ongoing and future projects.\nIn conclusion, mastering monitoring and evaluation skills is essential for ensuring the success, sustainability, and impact of development projects. By systematically tracking progress, measuring outcomes, and generating evidence-based insights, M&E enables stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and maximize project effectiveness and impact. This course equips learners with the knowledge and skills necessary to design, implement, and assess robust M&E frameworks that drive positive change and development outcomes.",

As the software industry grows into unimaginable size, one of the most critical roles in the software industry is that of a software Project Manager.\nA software project has many moving parts which need to to be managed as an entire stream of activities which must be completed in a nicely choreographed manner. Each of these activities has its own goals, schedules, resources, and costs associated with each of them.

Almost half (45%) of PMO staffers have earned their PMP (Project Management Professional) certification.\nBarely over half (56%) of project managers are certified.\n\n\nHowever, Project Management is just not about these numbers. Do you know what it takes to\n\n\nInitiate a software or IT project?\nPlan the project based on estimations, schedules, and other constraints?\nEnsure the project is being executed as per the stakeholder's expectations?\nManage the risks which may arise during the execution of the project?\nEnsure the product or service being produced is of high quality?\nMonitor the progress of your project and report it to the stakeholders?\n\n\nThese are some of the fundamental Challenges that companies ranging from early-stage startups to Global Fortune 500 companies face on a daily basis.

      "description": "If one of your goals is to earn the most respected and gold-standard certificate in the project management - the PMI PMP certificate, in Year 2025, then this course is for you!\nLet's start with a few quick questions on project management, shall we?\nDo you know the Net promoter score or NPS of your stakeholders?\nWhat is a “fishbowl window” and how can an Agile team use it?\nHmm, let's try a few more.\nWill you form T-shaped or I-shaped skilled teams for your next Agile project?\nHow as project manager will you apply  'ADKAR' model to bring the change into an organization?\nHow do you use the Function point analysis technique to measure the size and complexity of a project?\nYou may find questions in the PMI-PMP exam on some of the above terms which are lesser known, and using these practice tests, you will get an exposure to these and many other such less known but important project management concepts and how to use those in a project scenario.\nThese PMI PMP practice tests are based on latest PMI PMP exam content outline, curated carefully to validate your understanding of the multiple and diverse topics which for the PMI PMP exam.\nEach of the 4 practice tests has 180 questions and is timed for 230 minutes.\nAnd these are developed using the same percentage(%) as in the real PMI PMP exam and it is based on PMI PMP Exam content outline as below,\n•Domain l: People - (42%)\n•Domain ll: Process - (50%)\n•Domain lll: Business environment  - (8%)\nThis practice test consists  of 720 situational questions designed as per the new format of the PMP exam (2024) by PMI which had become effective from 2nd Jan 2021 (50% Agile and 50% Predictive/Hybrid).\nA sample question in these practice tests may looks like this,\nThe project to develop the screws for 2-wheeler is in the last weeks of its completion.\nDuring the project closure phase, the project manager wants to assess the overall satisfaction of the project stakeholders.\nWhich of the following should project manager use?\nNet Promotor score or NPS\nMonte Carlo simulation\nStakeholder Cube\nStakeholder engagement assessment matrix\nExplanation\nThis is one of the new topics introduced in the 7th edition of the PMBoK guide and the PMP exam may test your understanding on the application of net promoter score and how it can be useful in the project management.\nNet Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric that is often used in project management to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nNPS is typically measured through a survey, where customers are asked to rate how likely they are to recommend the project or the product to a friend or colleague, on a scale of 0 to 10.\nBased on the responses, customers are categorized into three groups:\nPromoters (score 9-10),\nPassives (score 7-8), and\nDetractors (score 0-6).\nOther options such as stakeholder engagement assessment metrics and stakeholder cube are used during the project management and specifically during the stakeholder engagement but it is not used to measure the customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nMonte Carlo Simulation technique can be used for project planning, monitoring, and control. It is not directly relate to measuring customer satisfaction and loyalty like the Net Promoter Score.\nReference: PMBoK Guide 7th Edition, Section 4.4.4 Page 180\n\n\nAnd this pattern/format you will see for all 720 questions, across the 4 practice tests.\nI have used official PMI reference material such as PMBoK Guide 7th Edition, PMI Agile practice guide & PMI PMP Exam content outline as a source for creating these questions and I have included the references to the exact page number or section to each of these official references in every 720 questions so that you can use it as a reference to study it further.\nThe questions in the practice tests are based on most typical agile and traditional project scenarios which you will encounter in real world  projects and ask to answer or respond to the situation as an agile or project management professional. You may find that multiple answers may be correct but you have to select the best option - for the given scenario.\nWhile there is a lot of excellent training & video content available on Udemy and other sources online to learn the exam topics for PMI PMP Exam, you still need to make sure that you go through the practice tests to reinforce and ascertain you are fully prepared for the exam.\nThese practice exams will test your understanding of the PMI PMP content/syllabus and help you decide if you are \"ready for the exam\".\nIf you start passing these practice exams with a consistent score of 75% or above - it is a good indication that you will be able to pass the PMI PMP Exam too - as these practice tests cover all the aspects of the PMI PMP Exam with similar difficulty level.\nThe real PMI PMP exam has 180 questions & exam duration is 230 minutes.\nFor these practice exams too, I kept 180 questions in each practice test and timed for 230-minutes to give you a real-life, simulated environment to prepare for the real PMI PMP exam.\nCome, join in & get ready to earn the coveted PMI PMP certificate - All the best!\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nSource of questions in these practice test: Questions in this simulator are created entirely by myself taking into account my personal experience of preparing & writing the PMP exam and assessing the difficulty level of the same. Also, the scenarios are developed by me from my project management experience.\nI have used ONLY publicly available information regarding the new format of the PMP Exam (ECOs, Crossover Maps, PMI Articles etc.) to develop the questions as per the revised syllabus. Neither the questions nor the scenarios are abridged/recreated from any textbook or online forum. These questions are NOT created from memory and hence DO NOT represent the actual PMP exam questions in any way. Use these questions only as a guide to help you in your preparation and not as a collection of previous PMP exam questions.

      "description": "Welcome,\nWhy CAPM Maths is important\nIn CAPM Exam out of 150 there are almost 25-30 Questions that involves Mathematical Formulas, Equations and numerical. So even if you are not good at Maths you just cannot ignore them.\nPMBok Guide has loads of different formulas related to Earned Value Management, Critical Path Method, Activities duration and cost estimates, Risk Management, Project Selection Methods,Communications Channels, Decision Tree Diagram, Expected Monetary Value etc\nSimilarly it has loads of acronyms associated with Mathematical Formulas i.e. EV, AC, EAC, SPI, ETC, TCPI, EVM, PERT, BCR, IRR, NPV etc\nThis is something that is not easy to master just by reading PMBok Guide or some other text book.\nAt the same time its very important Understanding the concept and Logic behind Formula. Just take example of Point of Total assumption formula even if you memorize the Formula and you don’t understand what it means by Ceiling Price, Target Price then you will not be able to extract these values from question in the exam.\nWhy to Take my Course\nSince CAPM Exam and PMBok Guide is already very dry and boring so ideally you don’t want a course that is just a Power point Slideshow readout where Instructor is reading the Screens. This is nearly the same experience you reading book yourself.\nThis is where my course is different, I will explain all concepts in detail in an interactive video based style lectures on this white board where.\nI will make sure this “Hard Math” is simplified in concepts and gives you detail regarding the background logic of the formulas using simple real world examples. That makes it easy to remember.\nHow the Course is Structured\nI have structured this course in a way that first I will explain all formulas in details in lectures then I will show you how to solve sample Exam questions and lastly there will be quiz so that you can assess your knowledge.\nWhat is covered in this Course\nCover all \"Earned Value Management\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in CAPM Exam\nCover all \"Critical Path Method \" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in CAPM Exam\nCover all \"Activities Cost and Duration Estimates\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in CAPM Exam\nCover all \"Communication Channels\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in CAPM Exam\nCover all \"Decision Tree Analysis\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in CAPM Exam\nCover all \"Expected Monetary Value \" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in CAPM Exam\nCover all \"Project Selection Methods\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in CAPM Exam\nCover all \"Point of Total Assumption\" Mathematical Formulas and Related Questions in CAPM Exam\nWhats done for this course\nI have spent of plenty of time on brain storming and research to make this course as simple as possible.\nI have gone through whole PMBOK Guide and covered each and every Mathematical formula in this course even if it simple formula like standard deviation that is P – O /6 so this course will be enough to cover Mathematical part of CAPM Exam.\nTrust me this Course is a Treasure and no one did this topic like this before Udemy.\nAfter taking this course, I can guarantee you, you would not need to forcefully dump your brain with so many formulas rather you would be to able conceptualize the Formulas to remember them forever.\nStill in case you change your mind, you have Money Back Guarantee So you have nothing to loose.",

Positive risks are opportunities, while negative risks are threats. The practice of risk management includes planning the approach, identifying and analyzing risks, response planning and implementation, and ongoing monitoring of risks. Risk management is an essential aspect of all organizational activities. This standard describes the application of risk management within an enterprise risk management (ERM) context that includes the portfolio, program, and project domains. Risk management shapes the decision-making processes across the organization and within each of the domains.\nSuccessful organizations are able to effectively and efficiently identify the risks that directly influence goals and objectives. The challenge for most organizations is making the best use of resources by focusing on the right risks. This depends on the characteristics of the organization, its environment, internal maturity, culture, and strategy. Determining the most impactful risks can be difficult. Organizations develop and improve by refining the processes for risk prioritization..",

However, the actual PMP Exam will be a combination of multiple-choice, multiple responses, matching, hotspot and limited fill-in-the-blank.\nIn all cases, you will benefit from these Mock Exams as they simulate a similar mix, difficulty and style of questions that you can expect to see on the actual PMP exam.\nTo increase the chance of passing the actual PMP exam on first attempt, you should aim to score 80% on each mock exam here.\nIf you don't score well on the mock exams, review the answers and, if required, re-study the areas that you are weak on in order to enhance your knowledge.\nFor your quick reference, please see below details of the actual PMP Exam from PMI:\nThe actual PMP examination is comprised of 180 questions. Of the 180 questions, 5 are considered pretest questions. Pretest questions do not affect the score and are used in examinations as an effective and legitimate way to test the validity of future examination questions. All questions are randomly placed throughout the examination.\nTotal Examination Questions = 180\nNo. of Pretest (Unscored) Questions = 5\nNo. of Scored Questions = 175\nThe allotted time to complete the examination is 230 minutes.\nFor the actual PMP exam, there are now two 10-minute breaks in the exam. The first will appear after you complete questions 1- 60 and review all of your answers. The second break will appear after you have completed question 120 and confirmed that you have reviewed all of your answers. Please note, once you review your responses and start your break you will not be able to return to the questions from the previous section of the exam.\nWhen you are signed back in after each break, you will have the remaining allotted time to complete the remaining section(s).

Are you looking to find some more meaning to the way you engage in work goals and engage with people to achieve them? Then you're in the right place.\n\n\nIn this course:\nIn this mini-course you will work on finding a goal and stakeholders - YOUR goal and YOUR stakeholders! We'll help you discover the sophisticated connection between your personal aspirations and work goals, that will serve as the basis for the rest of your stakeholder management journey. You'll walk through this important step alongside a fellow Project Manager, who will be present throughout this course, and will share his story about identifying the right stakeholders.\n\n\nIn this introductory course you will:\nDiscover how a work goal can become meaningful to you\nIdentify stakeholders that can help (or hinder) you achieve your goal\nGet organized with helpful tools to help you practice building relations with stakeholders\nReceive a Certificate of completion\nIn each of our courses we strive to deliver information-packed lectures that quickly give you the information you need to make your stakeholder management process easy and your final results amazing. We include lots of examples, as well as practice activities to make sure you're practicing your new skills.\nBy the end of the course, you'll have identified an important goal to you and who the relevant stakeholders are. We know from data and experience, that people who start out with a solid meaningful goal, are more likely to deliver successful projects, reach their goals and have stakeholders supporting them, making sure their projects stay ahead, through small and large bumps on the road.\nOnce you've completed all lectures you can receive a Certificate of completion.  When you receive your certificate of completion Diego and I have even added a small bonus for you as well.\n\n\nLet's get started!\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nDevelopers and software professionals looking to boost their career\nProject managers\nLeaders\nChange management teams\nCommunication professionals\n\n\n\n\nThere's a paradigm shift hidden in this course that can take some time to absorb:\nThe shift is that work goals and stakeholders are not dictated by anything or anyone other than you - if you can't find a way to approach it that makes sense in the overall picture of how you want to live and feel in your life, then it's not your goal and they are not your stakeholders.\nEveryone has goals because they expect the achievement of those goals to return some sort of positive feeling in their lives; feeling successful, being part of a group, more money, more time on their hands, acknowledgement.. whatever it might be. If you don't know what feelings you want to fill your life with it is difficult to be strategic about stakeholders because you risk doing what most people do and spend all your energy on stakeholders that are frustrating instead of those that you happy and help you move towards your goals.\nJust taste that paradigm shift for a little bit. Think about it. And if it resonates with you, that's great - try it out and see how much better you'll deliver, how much more success you'll have with your ideas and suggestions, how much better and at ease you'll feel at work.\nWhat do you have to lose from giving it a try? The biggest reason we humans don't see results from what we learn is because we don't have trust enough in what we learn to apply it long enough to evaluate whether it did make a change for us or not, keep that in mind.",

You might be made redundant if you do not bring any value add in your PM role,  In today’s world, with more emphasis on automation, cost-cutting, agility – it is very important to show the benefits you bring to your organization or your team in the PM role\nI have worked as a PM in big organizationss as well as startups. I had always felt that most of the organization do not understand the value and importance of a Project Manager.  While the senior managerss see the PMs as a person to provide the status reports, the team members think that a PM is a word or an excel expert. They fail to see the value add that a PM brings in a project.\nWith this course, I will try to create awareness among the PMs to add value in their projects. They should become the most valueable employees in their organizations\nIn this course, I will talk about\n- Roles which should NOT be considered as a PM role as they dilute the PM’s responsibility and authority.\n- Best practices which can help you shine in the PM role and eventually make you a valuable resource in your organization.\n\n\nI created this course from the webinar delivered earlier in the PMI forum.\nFew Review comments on the webinar:\n\"Awesome insights. I loved the approach and the example showcased.\"\n\"A good and informative presentation. your term \"paper pm\" fits a few that I have had to deal with in my early years.\"\n\"What an excellent presentation, one of the best I've seen on coaching project management and their success.

The course is aligned with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK6) developed by the Project Management Institute (PMI).\nThis course focuses on a single process, the Create Work Breakdown Structure Process, or create WBS, as it's called in the PMBOK® Guide. We're going to talk about the role the WBS plays in planning, and how it's used in control and reporting.\nYou'll learn about the important activities involved in decomposition to break down project requirements and deliverables in order to create a WBS. You'll also learn about an important output of the Create WBS process, the scope baseline.\n1. The Role of the WBS\n2. The WBS Structure\n3. Inputs to Create WBS\n4. Decomposition Activities\n5. Principles for Effective Decomposition\n6. Verifying the WBS\n7. Finalizing the WBS\n8. Outputs of Create WBS\n9. The WBS Dictionary\n10. Exercise: Creating the WBS and Scope Baseline\nThe importance of schedule control can't be overstated. Every project, no matter how well-planned, encounters unexpected roadblocks and delays. The skills you learn in this course will directly translate into your ability to identify potential problems early, analyze their impact, and develop effective solutions. By learning to anticipate challenges, you'll be empowered to make informed decisions that mitigate risks and keep your project on track. Proactively addressing issues is the difference between projects that spiral out of control and those that successfully meet their goals, on time and within budget.\nThat’s it! Now go ahead and push that “Take this course” button, and see you on the inside!",

We will conclude the Project Portfolio Management overview with several reasons why bad things usually happen if portfolio management is ignored.\nConsequently, we will also discuss Agile Project Management and its key components like Agile core values, Agile project processes and comparisons between Agile and Waterfall approaches.\nIn the second part of the course, we will examine the proposed Agile Project Portfolio Management processes starting from the High-Level Design Document (HLD) to Low-Level Design Document (LLD) to Development and Release. We will also discuss Agile resource allocation and Agile release management.\nFinally, I will demonstrate to you – using real-life project documents the complete journey of one project I have worked on through the entire Agile PPM pipeline, from inception to the final delivery.",

Java offers a robust and secure environment for developing a wide range of applications, from desktop and web-based software to complex enterprise-level systems and mobile applications. Its object-oriented nature emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Moreover, Java boasts a rich standard library (Java API) that provides pre-built functionalities, simplifying tasks like data handling, networking, and graphical user interface (GUI) creation.\nOne of Java's distinguishing features is its platform independence, achieved through bytecode. When Java code is compiled, it generates an intermediate form known as bytecode, which is executed by the JVM. This architecture decouples the program from the underlying hardware, enabling it to run on any platform that supports JVM, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nJava also excels in multithreading, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which is essential for modern, responsive applications. Its security features, such as sandboxing and cryptographic libraries, make it a preferred choice for developing secure systems.\nJava’s versatility, reliability, and cross-platform capabilities have cemented its place as one of the most popular and enduring programming languages. From powering large-scale enterprise systems to mobile apps and web services, Java remains a cornerstone of the software development world, evolving continually to meet the demands of modern computing.",

But not just any old Project Charter, a fantastic Project Charter!\nBuilding a Project Charter is not an easy task. There are a range of complexities that need to be taken into consideration when it comes to building one, a process to follow and a number of steps you need to complete. Many projects I have worked in over the years have a \"Project Charter\", but the project still fails because the charter is missing key parts, is too complicated or just is not focused enough. Many people build a charter to say they have one, and leave it to fester and not deliver its true potential.\nIn my experience, those projects that are launched with a solid Project Charter, covering all the necessary steps are the ones that truly deliver.\nIn this course, we will look at:\n- What is a Project Charter?\n- The purpose and importance of a Project Charter.\n- How to build a Project Charter.\n- A step by step breakdown of all of the key aspects of a charter and how to complete them.\nWe will use a scenario to walk through this process, enabling you to see exactly how you could deploy your own project idea into a Project Charter as soon as you have completed the course!",

Scrum and Kanban are two of the most widely used Agile methodologies.\n\nIn Agile processes, there is constant feedback, allowing for team members to adjust to challenges as they arise, and stakeholders an opportunity to communicate consistently. Though originally created for software development, the Agile approach is now widely used in executing many different types of projects and in running organizations.\n\nAgile grew from the minds of a group of software development project managers. Since then, it has continued to be popular in software development, but has expanded to many other industries as well. These include finance, IT, business, fashion, biotechnology, and even construction—among many others.\n\n\nWhat does this course offer you?\nThis course consists of 4 practice tests.\nPractice test consists of 25 questions each, timed at 30 minutes with 50% as passing percentage.\nThe questions are multiple-choice.\nThe answers are randomized every time you take a test.\nQuestions are of varying difficulty - from easy to moderate to tough.\nOnce the test is complete, you will get an instant result report with categories of strength to weakness.\nYou can re-take the tests over and over again as and when it suits you.\nNew set of questions will be added frequently and you can practice along without having to buy the course again.\nLearning Resources will be shared over email frequently to all enrolled students, along with any latest updates/news/events/knowledge.\n\nWith this course you will get lifetime-long access to 100+ Interview and Practice Questions on Agile, Scrum & Kanban that are updated frequently.

      "description": "A major task in managing a software project is to select the right software methodology for your specific project needs.\n\nIt is not one size fits all, there’re many factors that you need to put into consideration before you decide the perfect approach to run your project.\nYou should not always go agile or always go traditional. Traditional approaches is all about control. Agile approaches is all about flexibility and accepting changes.\nIf you are an agile advocate then there are situations where extra control is needed. And if you are a traditional advocate then there are situations where extra agility is needed. So to decide on the best approach, I believe that you need to learn both: agile methodologies and traditional project methodologies. And this why this course is different.\nit is not one way or the other, it is not black or white … it is not traditional versus agile … the reality is that most of the software projects are in between … there’s a wide spectrum between the 2 approaches and we need to learn how to decide which is the right methodology for your specific project circumstances.\nIn this course, we will learn the benefits, drawbacks and when to use most familiar approaches, we will also learn how different factors can affect your methodology selection, I will provide you with my personal recipe that I have successfully used for years to help you select the perfect methodology according to your specific project needs.\nI will be happy to work with you to decide on the best software methodology for your specific projects and answer all your questions",

The course is aligned with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK6) developed by the Project Management Institute (PMI).\nProjects are complex undertakings that require a high degree of coordination from start to finish. A lot goes into planning, getting the work done, monitoring progress, and finally, closing the project. In this course, you'll learn what project integration management involves and why it's important. Once you have an understanding of what's needed to manage project integration, you'll learn about the first two processes. These are what you use to create a project charter and develop a project management plan.\nProject Integration Management\nIntegration Management Process Groups\nThe Project Charter and Project Management Plan 4. Business Needs and Project Creation\nInputs to Developing the Project Charter\nTechniques for Developing the Project Charter\nElements of a Project Charter\nInputs to the Project Management Plan\nCompiling the Project Management Plan\nExercise: Planning the Project\nThe Project Charter, in particular, serves as a crucial foundation. It provides a high-level overview of the project goals, stakeholders, constraints, and even initial risk assessments. This document becomes a point of reference for decision-making throughout the project's life cycle. The Project Management Plan takes it further, with a detailed plan for execution, communication, resource management, and more.\nThat’s it!

      "description": "One topic, Two courses - A two speed risk management course.\nThe fast-track is under 30 minutes of step-by-step WHAT to do\nThe videos and Workbook-manual guide you through what's needed at work to Manage, Lead or Oversee and Facilitate risk in your projects, programs and portfolios.\nThe Master-class is 13hours of detailed HOW-to using the same Workbook and slides as the Fast-Track\nDip into the Masterclass videos only where you feel you need or want more guidance than the fast-track gives.\n*IF* you also want to take PMI or AXELOS/PeopleCert exams then use the two 'exam conversion' modules to understand what exam specific vocabularies and process models are overlaid on real-world risk management.\n~~\"~~\nThese two courses are for Project (and Program or Portfolio) managers and PMO Analysts, Scrum Masters, Team Subject Matter experts and Project Sponsors and Product Owners who need competency in how to handle risk.\nLearn a step by step framework of WHAT to do grounded in \"Projects are delivered by people (so most of the arithmetic theory isn't too useful)\". Plus here are the techniques, tips, tools and hints per step to give solid How-to that includes the adjustments required to work across the typical mixture of teams using Agile and Predictive product development ways of working.\nThe master class covers it all.\nThe Fast-Track is just the structured what to do - suitable if you've already got some idea of how to lead workshops and define risk scales (etc).\nYour ideal situation would be that your starting a project and feel some guidance on \"how to really do risk\" from day one with the sponsor through every day with the team to last day and risk handover. Ideal because the WorkBook's guidance is written as exercises to be applied to your current project to create real governance documents. If you've not got a current project then I've provided a scenario based on a fictionalised combination of some of my past projects.\nI've practiced projects as PM and PMO lead for 30 years and taught other people's risk courses on and off over the last 20. Those course from the big global training companies have always needed a big dose of reality which is what I've built into this course.\nThe result is a course unlike any other I know of because it doesn't treat the world as 'text-book'. In fact I've recorded it because I think big training company courses and project risk textbooks and chapters (in the PRINCE2 guide and the PMBoK-Guide) are fit more for exams than reality. Since the course is IMHO reality I've included two 'exam conversion modules' for those who DO want to take the exams.\nI'm expert enough to be unsure what a risk is (!) but I know its not 'A Single and instantaneous event-based-cause that leads to A Single quantifiable consequence for A Single stakeholder'. That is too naive. Too simple for the world I work in and for the one you're in too. I know that identification is key to all that follows. I'll share with you how to define responses (they are what actually matter!) so defining \"A\" risk isn't so important when we know our set of valid responses (plural).\nI'll start you off with what does running each workshop of each step look and feel like. In the Master-Class I'll give your a slew of tools to use and I'll suggest how to apply to your own project, how to build responses into the baseline - because we only have one set of people to deliver the project and handle the risk. I'll cover how reporting of project status integrates risk management.\n[ Of course after investing your effort you'll probably appreciate a way to demonstrate the results so I've also been mindful to giving you real world skills that substantially support efforts to gain CAPM®/ PMP®/ IMPA-abcd/ PRINCE2agile® and PRINCE2® exam/ RMP/ MoR etc. The course includes the supplements for translating to exam needs.",

      "description": "IMPORTANT before enrolling:\nThis course is not intended to replace studying any official vendor material for certification exams, is not endorsed by the certification vendor, and you will not be getting the official certification study material or a voucher as a part of this course.\nThis comprehensive course is designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of Prince2, a leading project management methodology.\nThrough a structured approach, you will gain extensive knowledge of Prince2's principles, themes, processes, and roles, ensuring you are well-prepared to manage projects effectively and efficiently.\nPRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments) is a structured project management methodology widely used and recognized internationally. Developed by the UK government in the late 1980s, it has become a standard for managing projects effectively across various industries. PRINCE2 provides a systematic approach to planning, managing, and controlling projects through its comprehensive set of processes, principles, and themes.\nWe begin with an introduction to Prince2, exploring its origins and evolution. You'll understand why Prince2 has become a preferred methodology for many organizations and the advantages it offers in various project environments.\nNext, we delve into the seven Prince2 principles that form the foundation of this methodology. You will learn about the importance of continuous business justification, learning from past experiences, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, progressive management, managing by exception, product focus, and the need to tailor these principles to specific project needs.\nOur exploration continues with the Prince2 themes, which are crucial aspects of project management that must be continuously addressed. You will gain insights into the business case, organization, quality, plans, risk, change, and progress themes, learning how to tailor them to suit different project contexts.\nThe course then covers the Prince2 processes, providing a step-by-step guide to managing projects from initiation to closure.

Positive risks are opportunities, while negative risks are threats. The practice of risk management includes planning the approach, identifying and analyzing risks, response planning and implementation, and ongoing monitoring of risks. Risk management is an essential aspect of all organizational activities. This standard describes the application of risk management within an enterprise risk management (ERM) context that includes the portfolio, program, and project domains. Risk management shapes the decision-making processes across the organization and within each of the domains .\nSuccessful organizations are able to effectively and efficiently identify the risks that directly influence goals and objectives. The challenge for most organizations is making the best use of resources by focusing on the right risks. This depends on the characteristics of the organization, its environment, internal maturity, culture, and strategy. Determining the most impactful risks can be difficult.

      "description": "Risk management should not only help companies to achieve minimum legal compliance requirements but also contribute to the demonstrable achievement of objectives, linking risks with performance. According to ISO31000 standard, integrating risk management into an organization is a dynamic and iterative process, and should be customized to the organization’s needs and culture. Risk management should be a part of, and not separate from, the organizational governance, leadership, strategy, operations and performance management.\nAlex Sidorenko has created a 25-step program to integrate risk management into decision making, core business processes and the overall culture of the organization. This course covers practical steps to design, implement and measure effectiveness of risk management.\nThis course will help you answer the following questions:\nDo key stakeholders believe risk management is aligned with strategy, objectives and culture and helps the organization achieve its objectives?\nIs there a risk management statement or policy?\nDoes management show commitment to the integration of risk management into all processes or decision types, giving risk team sufficient resources and responsibility?\nIs responsibility for risk management as part of business activities and decision making regularly communicated by top management to management and staff?\nAre oversight bodies confident that risks have been adequately considered when setting the organization’s objectives?\nIs information about risks and their management presented in the reports that oversight bodies receive and included in any significant decisions they have to make?\nAre results of independent risk management effectiveness assessments presented to the oversight bodies on a regular basis?\nIs risk management effort consistent with internal and external environment (meeting both regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations)?\nHave risk management principles been integrated into existing policies and procedures instead of just having a single aggregated risk management framework document?\nHas the responsibility for risk identification and analysis been documented in the committee charters, policies, procedures and job descriptions?\nDoes risk management team have the necessary resources to effectively integrate risk management into business activities and decision making?\nIs information about risks and their management integrated in existing financial and management reporting?\nDoes an organization have a plan to implement risk management into all activities throughout the organization, including decision-making?\nAre significant decisions and approvals made by the management only after analysing the risks associated with these decisions?\nIs risk management integrated into planning, budgeting, motivation and performance management processes instead of having a standalone risk management process?\nAre strategic goals, objectives and key performance indicators set based on the results of the risk analysis?\nIs risk management integrated in core operational processes, risks are analysed on an ongoing basis within operating activities?\nAre key supporting (back-office) processes organized in such a way, that risks and their treatments are considered?\nIs risk-based decision making consistently applied across subsidiaries, key suppliers and supply chains?\nAre risk management competences developed in all key departments?\nAre risk management competences integrated in the training and development program for employees, is there regular risk management training for different levels of management?\nAre risk management competences an important attribute when applying for jobs in the organization?\nDo you consider organization has a strong culture dedicated to risk-based decision making and risk management?\n\n\nThe content of the course is 100% aligned with the structure and principles of the ISO31000:2018. This course will be immensely valuable for risk managers, risk consultants, auditors and everyone who want to learn more about risk management 2.",

This course will cover the two analysis processes in risk management qualitative and quantitative analysis.\nIn qualitative we will learn about how to determine your risk score or risk index by using probability and the impact of each risk so that we could grade them on the risk matrix scale to see which risks require a response. We will also cover the quantitative risk analysis process to further analyze the risks that have moved forward. We will look at sensitivity analysis to know about the tornado diagram. Schedule and cost uncertainty will be covered and we’ll talk about triangular distribution and beta distribution.\nWe will learn how Monte Carlo simulation uses all this information to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event. You’ll learn about the distribution graph and the distribution analyzer and how to read your project outcomes from these graphs. We will then cover planning risk responses to all your risks and how to monitor and control them and what should your outcomes after doing risk management be.",

      "description": "Post mortems are an incredibly important tool in project management, incident response and other areas of business. They not only help groups avoid negative problems, but also enhance positive outcomes by digging in and learning what works.\nAdditionally, post mortems are not a way to blame a team or an individual - they're a way for the group to improve and do better. Cultivating a blame-free environment when conducting post mortems is critical to their success.\nThis course is designed around two main sections:\nSection 1 - How to conduct a post mortem\nThis section covers how to run a post mortem successfully, and includes things like:\nDefining what will be included in your post mortem process\nHow to collect information - including identifying who should be involved and what information you need\nAnalyzing what you find - Drawing conclusions from all that data\nConducting a post mortem meeting - getting everyone together to brainstorm how to do better next time\nImplementing improvements - How you'll take what you've learned and make it real\nSection 2 - Cultivating a culture of improvement\nThis section focuses on how to help your team focus on improving, and moving away from blaming. Lectures include:\nBuilding buy in - Convincing others that post-mortems are important can be hard, start small and build out.\nMaking a habit of post mortems - They shouldn't be only only on special occasions, do them for every project to help build a habit\nBlameless - post mortems aren't meant to blame, instead they're meant to help us all do better\n\n\nWho Should Enroll\nThis course is meant for anyone who might be involved in a post mortem, or expected to run one. Examples of roles that tend to do this include:\nSoftware Engineers: Analyze system failures and identify improvements\nSystems Managers: Determine the cause of system faults and avoid them\nAnalysts: Figure out why a project is successful and help others do the same\nCustomer Support : Pull apart an escalation and avoid them\nProject Managers: Ensure project closure with effective post-mortems, especially following unexpected challenges.\nScrum Masters: Augment your toolkit with practices that foster team growth and efficiency.\nWhy Choose This Course:\nEvery project ,incident, escalation, failure, success (and more!) should be analyzed to see why it happened. You should choose this course because you want to learn from success (and failure), and because you want your team to focus on improving - not blame.",

      "description": "One of the most significant problems confronting any business or project is the uncertainty of the future – not knowing what the future will bring.\nA good business or project manager needs to look to the future and be prepared to respond to it. They need to identify opportunities and potential problems and, where necessary, address these to manage their impact on their business or project.\nWhat can you do to better understand and respond to the future?\nThe answer is risk management.\nRisk management is a process that is critical to the success of most human endeavours. Effective risk management is used to predict potential problems and opportunities and address them proactively, if required, to improve success.\nI’ve been managing operations, business and projects for well over 35 years, and during that time I’ve come to rely on risk management to effectively and successfully manage the operations, businesses and projects I have led.\nDuring this time, I’ve also encountered considerable push back from employees, team members and key stakeholders regarding their involvement in risk management. Many of these people are either unable or not interested in effectively participating in risk management.\nI believe this is because many do not know how to effectively manage risks and therefore shy away from getting involved.\nThis course is intended to help people that do not have a thorough understanding of risk management to increase their risk management knowledge and experience to enable them to become better risk managers.\nThis is a practical, hands-on course. It covers more than just the knowledge of risk management. In addition to risk management theory, you will be challenged, through 13 distinct scenario based practical exercises, to perform the critical risk management processes of identifying,  scoring and prioritizing risks, and determining and defining risk response options to address the risks you identify as well as documenting and reporting these risks.\nBy the end of this course you will be able to effectively identify, prioritize and respond to risks and maintain a comprehensive risk register. You will be a better risk manager!\nRisk management is not a one-person job. If you are a manager, whether it be a operations, business, project manager, you will need to involve your employees, team members and important stakeholders in the management of risks if you expect to do it effectively and successfully.\nBeing able to lead others in risk management is the second benefit of this course that I believe you will appreciate. This course will provide you with the tools and techniques you can and should use to lead and assist others to manage risks. You will come out of this course not only being a better risk manager, but you will also be able to help others to manage risks.\nWhat will you learn?\nYou will learn the principal techniques and tools needed to effectively manage risks and support others to manage risk. The risk management tools and techniques used in this course are derived from the Project Management Institute’s (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), ISO 31,000 Risk Management guidelines and other sources.\nThe techniques and tools you will learn include the standard risk management processes of:\ncreating a risk management plan and establishing a risk management environment,\nidentifying risks,\ndeclaring risks,\nscoring and prioritizing risks,\nidentifying and defining risk response options, and\ntracking and reporting risks.\nYou will learn how to clearly and succinctly declare risks statements using a three-part format.\nYou will learn 14 unique risk identification tools and techniques and you will practice 8 of these through hands-on exercises.\nYou will learn the standard risk response options and you will practice defining these in 3 hands-on exercises.\nYou will learn how to identify and determine contingency to effectively respond to risks.\nYou also learn key risk management terms and roles.\nAs an added bonus you will be provided with a detailed Risk Register and a scoring and reporting Heat Map, in Excel, to document and report your risks.\nWho is this course intended for?\nThis course is intended for anyone who wishes to become experienced in risk management. It is designed for both new and experienced managers, employees, team members and other business and project stakeholders. The course will also help you understand PMI’s PMBOK risk management knowledge area.",

Agile is a collaborative and cross functional approach of discovering requirements & developing solutions with the help of cross functional team.\nScrum: Scrum is the subset of agile management approaches where we perform small iterations (called sprint) and continually add value in the product along with the customer collaboration.\nKanban: First developed by Taiichi Ohno (Industrial Engineer at Toyota), Kanban is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and projects requiring just-in-time manufacturing (JIT). The basic structure of a Kanban Board uses Boards, Lists and Cards\n· Boards contain or encapsulate a project or a workflow.\n· Lists contain and often prioritize cards that share a similar status or attribute.\n· Cards describe the task, including related or supporting information\nLean: Lean is a continuous improvement and a value oriented strategy of creating more value to the customers (users) using minimum resources with minimization of wastes in every steps of process.\nNote:\n• Value- Ability to provide the customers what they want in right time, quality and cost.\n• Waste-Any activity that utilizes time, space and resources without adding value to the product.\nLean is not just only a cost related practice. It’s way of thinking and organization of entire organization. It helps organization to be innovative and competitive.\nSix Sigma: Six Sigma is a continuous, controlled and data driven method of eliminating defects in such a way as to go for six standard deviations between the mean and nearest specification limit in any process throughout the life cycle of the product, business or service. To achieve six sigma, the process shouldn’t produce more than 3.4 defects in a million opportunities.\nXP: It's basically a Project Management approach used in the software development.\nCrystal: Crystal is a Lightweight and adaptable management approach basically used for software development. It is a combination of different agile methodologies like Crystal Clear, Crystal Yellow, Crystal Orange, Crystal Red, Crystal Maroon, Crystal Blue,etc\nDon't get confused over the noises of project management complications with different certifications in the market.

You are free to work at your own pace so completion time depends on you.\nCorporations operating globally need BM's to manage the localization of marketing materials, technical manuals, etc. for domestic markets worldwide.\nCandidates for these positions need to be able to learn quickly, think on their feet, and mobilize teams to fulfill commitments with clients relative to deadlines, quality, and cost. A university degree is advantageous but not necessarily essential. Foreign language skills can be useful but in your role as business manager you would not normally be required to translate or interpret as these tasks would be carried out by qualified translators and interpreters who would form part of your team.\nPersons with a background in languages, translation studies or linguistics would be able to fill some positions calling for such skill sets as a precondition. (Some smaller companies combine management and language skills in a single job offering.)\nThis course takes you through the processes and procedures involved in managing and localizing marketing materials and other documents in a step-by-step presentation of study materials. Special attention is paid to web content and the tools used to produce websites with subsites holding information for target markets\nYou will be able to measure your progress through quizzes and other tests, with feedback on your outcomes.\nThere is no doubt that the job market for localization and translation services is facing a dramatic increase as the figures demonstrate: In 2012 the projections from the “Language Services Market 2012″ report states the industry will reach US $33.5 billion shared by over 26,104 suppliers of related services across the globe; Microsoft alone executes over 1,000 localization projects a year.",

      "description": "Welcome to CIPS L5M8 practice exams. This module is Project & Change Management.\n\n\nThis course has recently been updated and is suitable for students taking the CIPS exams from 2025 - 2028.\n\n\nWhat is this course?\nThis course contains practice questions to help you prepare for your CIPS exam. The questions and format have been carefully designed to mimic the real CIPS exam as closely as possible.\nAfter you have completed a practice test, your test is instantly graded and you are given a score, which will provide you with an indication of whether you will pass the real exam. For each question asked, I provide a complete commentary detailing why the correct answer is correct. I also reference which Learning Outcome the question comes from and the page number in the Study Guide for you to refer back to. The commentary also includes details on whether the topic is a common theme in the exam (i.e. there's likely to be lots of questions on this subject) as well as some links to additional reading on difficult topics. No other practice papers provide you with this level of detail. My aim is to not only to help you get the question right, but to help you understand why it is right.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of using this course\n· All Learning Outcomes and question types are covered. These are the only practice questions on Udemy where you’ll find the TWO types of question that come up at Level 5; multiple choice and ‘drag and drop’. It’s important to practice both types.\n· The course has been meticulously designed by an experienced teacher to build your confidence, practice your technique and highlight areas where you are strong and weak before the exam, so that you can work on this and pass first time.\n· I'm also a native English speaker so my questions are all grammatically correct and my explanations are easy to understand\n· Each practice paper consists of 48 questions and is 1h 30mins long. This is the exact number of questions and exact time you have in the real exam. One of the main challenges students face is maintaining concentration for 48 questions straight- so these practice tests will help develop your technique as well as your knowledge (i.e. not spending too long on one question, not losing focus). No other practice papers are set up this way.\n· Some CIPS exam questions are not covered in the Study Guide. Where possible, I have included known exam topics that aren't in the Study Guide - so you shouldn't get caught out in the exam.\n\n\n\n\nReviews and Results\nStudents who take this course report excellent exam results, higher levels of confidence and being able to pass their exams with less hours of study. My courses have been selected as part of 'Udemy for Business'. This means they're within the top 3% of courses on Udemy, based on quality. Please check out the review section for more:\n“I have found all of Elizabeth's courses incredibly helpful so far during my level 5 self-study. They have been excellent for identifying gaps of knowledge during my revision” – Ben\n“The questions were similar to the actual exam! very helpful and comprehensive learning.. excellent, thank you Elizabeth!” - Saloni",

Sigma emphasizes cycle-time improvement while at the same time reducing manufacturing defects to a level of no more than 3.4 occurrences per million units or events.\n\n\nThe premise of Six Sigma is that variation in a process leads to opportunities for error; opportunities for error then lead to risks for product defects. Product defects—lead to poor customer satisfaction. By working to reduce variation and opportunities for error, the Six Sigma method ultimately reduces process costs and increases customer satisfaction.\n\n\nCourse Layout:\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\n2.

Later we discuss different groups of Property Management System (PMS)requirements that have been identified by the stakeholders, including revenue, call center, marketing, IT, reporting and financial features to name a few.\nLater we will learn how we assigned priorities to the requirements and added extra sections including additional questions, user journeys, pricing and references. We will also discuss a proposed response format for the bidders.\nNext, we will present our Criteria for Evaluation of Responses including points assigned for each criterion for a total of 5,735 points total possible. We will then delve into the Detailed Vendor Comparison section of the course where all 11 remaining vendors are scored across all categories side by side.\nAt the next (most important!) stage of the project, we will talk about vendor demos based on 38 must-have features of the project where the bidders were required to demonstrate the ability of the system to perform the necessary operations and what came out of this exercise.\nAnd finally, we will discuss how the final winner was selected and what factors affected that decision.",

      "description": "Any engineering or non-engineering project, business, or investment usually starts by mixed virtual ideas and thoughts. To be translated into reality, such ideas will require several resources, in which the “capital cost” is the most essential. However, before investing our capital cost, several questions need to be answered from an “economic” perspective, such as:\n- Is the expected return from the project or investment worth the capital cost?\n- Are there other alternatives?\n- What are the other alternatives?\n- Which alternative is the best?\n- What is the confidence level of my selected alternative?\n- Etc.\n\n\nEngineering Economic Analysis can answer these questions and more. In other words, this course is all about decision making from an economic perspective. The term “Engineering” exists as this course will be focusing more on engineering projects. However, the same concept can be applied for non-engineering projects (e.g. importing and selling goods, adopting a new accounting system in your firm, etc.).\n\n\nEven on a personal level, we deal with “money” on a daily basis. Thus, this course can also help us to understand the management of money and to take economic decisions such as:\n- Buy or lease a car,\n- Open a saving account in Bank (A) or (B),\n- How much saving shall I make each month to have $500K in my account 20 years from now?\n- Etc.\n\n\nThis course is divided into two parts with a total of 101 carefully selected examples solved in details to ensure you understand the concept. The main topics that will be covered in part (1) are as follows (see the course contents for more details):\n- Time Value of Money\n- Economic Equivalence\n- Nominal and Effective Interest Rates\n- Commercial Loans\n- Inflation\n- Measuring Worth of Investments\n- Comparison of Investments\n\n\nWhile, the main topics to be covered in part (2) are as follows:\n- Supplementary Analysis\n- Capital Budgeting\n- Depreciation\n- Taxation\n- Replacement Analysis\n- Economic Analysis in Public Sector\n- MARR Selection",

      "description": "Despite many accepted IT security standards, many IT projects fail at IT security. This also includes for instance (‘smart’) products that just include information technology in small proportion. What needs to be considered, what mistakes and pitfalls to avoid?\nMost IT projects have a tight budget. Only in rare cases, a project manager has access to unlimited financial resources. This applies to projects of both large and small businesses alike but usually the smaller the company the bigger the problem. If security cannot be used as a (unique) selling point for a product or for the development of a system, the project manager often has a hard job to acquire proper and adequate resources for security.\nNo matter if you are a manager in a small company or even on your own or if you are part of a large enterprise with information security management in place. This pragmatic guide helps you to understand information security on a high level and how to integrate security in your project or product. What needs to be done for long-term success and why? The author, Computer Scientist Frank Hissen, explains it in a few practical steps from over 15 years of experience as IT security consultant:\nMotivation: IT Security Holes in Projects and Products\nEnforce IT Security in Projects\nIT Security in Projects: From the very beginning!\nSecurity is a Process\nIT Security Standards\nDo the same for Data Privacy / Protection Laws!\nChecklist for Project Managers\nConclusion\n\n\nFurthermore, all students can download the course material as ebook (included in section 1).",

      "description": "Projects are a lot of work, and ensuring they successfully deploy can be challenging. It can be tempting to let the development team do some testing and then launch... but this can be a very risky gamble as critical test scenarios may be missed, the business may not be bought in and bugs may escape. At one extreme this can result in project failure.\nThis is where a User Acceptance Test, or UAT, comes in. Running a UAT will help ensure a successful deployment by throughly testing your product before it launches. This testing includes involvement by the teams who will use the new tool (the business), a robust examination of which scenarios need to be tested, and extensive testing to ensure the system meets their needs.\nUAT's give the project team a chance to correct any issues, and also exposes the customer or business team to how the project works, increasing engagement and buy-in.\nWhy do UATs matter?\nUAT's are a critical phase in every project's lifecycle, but they can be challenging to organize and run. This course covers every aspect of running a successful UAT, including:\n1. Strategic Planning: Generating buy-in and excitement for a UAT is critical to it's success, as is putting together a solid team to help run it.\n2. Flawless Execution: UATs go beyond running tests. They also include effective communication, identifying champions, and tracking critical metrics and issues.\n3. Seamless Closure: Completing a UAT isn't just about finishing test scripts. Discover how to address every issue, obtain team consensus, and achieve the official sign-off for testing completion.\n\n\nUAT's are more than test scripts! They're about people. This course also covers the human element of UAT's, including:\n\n\nSecuring Stakeholder Buy-In: Master the art of convincing stakeholders about the value of UAT and how to effectively communicate its importance.\nManaging Diverse Perspectives: Explore strategies for handling the diverse group of individuals involved in UAT. Learn to navigate varying opinions, availability challenges, and foster collaboration for the betterment of your project.\nEmpowering Your UAT Team: Discover how to provide the essential support your UAT team needs for success. From documentation to addressing challenges, you'll become the catalyst for a high-performing UAT team.\nBuilding Effective Working Relationships: UAT is about teamwork and collaboration. Learn how to cultivate strong working relationships with your team members, testers, and stakeholders for smoother UAT processes.\nCultivating Champions: UATs help identify system champions - users who will be your system's cheer leaders and help others learn about, and buy into, the new system.\n\n\nWhy should you take this course?\n\n\nReduce the risk of a deployment failing - Failed deployments are incredibly costly, both in terms of dollars, but also in terms of tarnished reputation.  Running a UAT helps reduce this risk by having the business thoroughly test the system, and sign off on that testing, before deployment.\nBuild stronger teams - A UAT is comprised of the project team (developers, analysts, etc) and the business team (individuals from the unit accepting the system). Bringing them together helps improve everyone's skills and helps uncover new test scenarios and features that could be missed.\nImprove your skills - Understanding how to run a UAT will improve your skillset, making you a more valuable member of your organization, and will improve your confidence when deploying systems.\n\n\nWho Should Enroll:\nProject Managers: Boost your project management skills, and project success, by learning how to plan, run and close successful UATs.\nProject Team Members: Understand the importance of UATs and how you fit into this critical part of a project.\nTesters: Maximize your testing impact by gaining a clear understanding of UAT expectations and responsibilities.\nManagers of UAT Participants: Enhance your support by comprehending your team's UAT roles and challenges.",

We will then cover the most typical layout of the RFP/RFI document including introduction, instructions to bidders, proposal response formats, bid evaluation methods, terms and conditions and requirements.\nWe will then discuss several recommended strategies for the companies issuing the RFP/RFI as well as the potential games the vendors could play in order to maximize their revenues from the project.\nOnce we cover the basics of the RFP/RFI process, we will turn our attention to an actual business case where a large North American hotel chain decided to replace their existing Property Management System (PMS) and had to choose a platform from fifteen potential vendors. We will examine the current state of the hospitality industry, the severe impact of the technology and the key capabilities desired by the hotel chains.\nLater we will examine the structure of our own RFP, the anticipated timeline and the key questions included in the RFP.",

      "description": "Note: The course contents can be applicable to non-construction projects\n\n\nProjects in general, and construction projects particularly, goes through different stages from their inception to their closeout. In the simplest terms, a typical project starts as a “concept” which develops with time going through different phases such as designing, bidding, procuring, executing, and closing. In the absence of applying a proper monitoring and control at each of these phases, one should not expect a successful project. WHY? Simply because construction projects are dynamic in nature. In construction, no project, almost, is executed as planned. For instance, changes are very likely to happen. Moreover, problems related to procurements, resource availability, productivity, financial acquisition, communications, quality, stakeholder engagements, etc. are common in construction project. Such factors can lead to delays in project completion and/or cost overruns.\n\n\nThus, to avoid or minimize such pitfalls, it is of extreme importance to apply adequate periodical monitoring and control to your project. “Monitoring” is comparing the project’s actual performance against its planned performance (i.e. baseline), while “Control” is taking preventive and corrective actions to bring the possibly deviated project back on track.\n\n\nAccordingly, in this course, we will discuss and implement the common practices that are applied to project monitoring and control. The course is divided into five sections that are briefly described as follows:\n\n\nSection (1): The different project monitoring and control processes (e.g. validate scope, control scope, control schedule, control cost, monitor communications, etc.) will be discussed along with their integration. In addition, a review of project scheduling (critical path method and precedence diagram) will be discussed with example as the project schedule is a crucial prerequisite for applying monitoring and control.\n\n\nSection (2): The different methods that are commonly used to measure the percentage completion of each “activity” in your project will be discussed with examples. This is followed by understanding and implementing how the percentage completion of the entire “project” can be measured.\n\n\nSection (3): Measuring the work progress (whether for each activity or the entire project as discussed in section 2) is an important input to apply what is known as “Earned Value Analysis” (EVA). EVA is an integrated time-cost approach that is used to monitor and analyze the project performance with respect to time and cost. Thus, in this section the main concept and objectives of EVA will be discussed. This is followed by understanding three important measures that are to be determined periodically and used to define the project performance. To define the project’s current performance and expected future performance, different analysis tools will then be discussed with examples (i.e. variance analysis, performance analysis, trend analysis, forecasting analysis, and reserve analysis). Finally, important practical concerns and consideration with respect to the validity of EVA will be discussed.\n\n\nSection (4): Nothing can better represent your project's actual current and expected future time performance like updating your project schedule. Thus, in this section we will discuss the main types of information required and collected when preparing a report to apply schedule updating. This is followed by understanding how schedule updating is carried with applying different examples.\n\n\nSection (5): The concept, uses, and methods of project crashing (or project acceleration) as a control tool will be discussed. We will understand that project crashing is not necessarily used only for project control, but it can be carried also for other purposes. One of the common analysis methods of project crashing is the “Time-Cost Tradeoff”, which will be also discussed with important practical considerations in this final section.\n\n\nBest wishes and good luck.",

The 5 process groups ranging from project initiation to project closure are all very important pieces of the overall puzzle and you will need to master them all to distinguish yourself as one of the best project managers.\nDepending on who you talk to, they may have different ideas on which of the process groups should be considered more or less important than the others. One thing that all those who are well versed in the field project management agrees on though, is the fact that exceptional project management is about delegating the actual project work and focusing your energy, as the project manager, on monitoring and controlling the health and status of your project. This is where you make the BIG difference, and where you catch the eyes of the client and upper management.\nThis course was designed to arm you with the essential knowledge you require to understand project health monitoring and the pivotal role it plays in project success.\nThe course covers all the project health monitoring essentials. We will also be looking at the importance of proper monitoring and control and how you can effectively and efficiently incorporate good Earned Value Management (EVM) practices into your monitoring strategy. We will also be working through some guided practical examples and you will have a chance to apply what you have learned on a few practical exercises. The course also places some emphasis on good control measures and we will work through guidelines that will help you effectively implement change control procedures. The course ends of with an assessment that will not only help you gauge what you have learned but also test you in a practical setting.\nFurthermore we will also be sharing some project health reporting templates and pre-programmed Excel sheets that you can use and adopt for your own projects.\nThe course design caters for those who already have the foundational knowledge of project management and are familiar with the PMI project management methodology. Beginners are however welcome to take it up as well, as the course is structured to add value to all project management professionals.\nIf you are new to project management we suggest you take a look at our Project Management Fundamentals course before you take this one.",

We will conclude the Project Portfolio Management overview with several reasons why bad things usually happen if portfolio management is ignored.\nConsequently, we will also discuss Agile Project Management and its key components like Agile core values, Agile project processes and comparisons between Agile and Waterfall approaches.\nIn the second part of the course, we will examine the proposed Agile Project Portfolio Management processes starting from the High-Level Design Document (HLD) to Low-Level Design Document (LLD) to Development and Release. We will also discuss Agile resource allocation and Agile release management.\nFinally, I will demonstrate to you – using real-life project documents the complete journey of one project I have worked on through the entire Agile PPM pipeline, from inception to the final delivery.",

Drawing from his 25 years of experience in managing major ERP implementations, Jamal provides invaluable insights and practical knowledge to help you navigate the complexities of ERP project management.\nBuilding upon the foundation established in Part 1, we begin by revisiting the definition of ERP systems and examining the industry outlook on ERP growth, as well as success and failure statistics associated with ERP implementations. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the ERP landscape and the factors that contribute to project outcomes.\nNext, we delve into a specific real-life ERP project recently managed by Jamal. Explore the company type, project scope, constraints, and the project environment, gaining valuable context for successful project execution. We then shift our focus to analyzing the \"Lessons Learned\" from the project, covering critical aspects such as providing degrees of freedom, establishing an internal team of subject matter experts (SMEs), securing commitments from executives, conducting weekly project rollout meetings, managing vendor relationships, addressing potential risks, and implementing effective requirements, communications, and testing approaches.\nWith a solid foundation established, we dive into project initiation and planning, examining real-life Project Charter and Project Plan documentation derived from actual projects. Additionally, we engage in an in-depth discussion on the Requirements Engineering approach, equipping you with the tools and techniques necessary for gathering and documenting project requirements effectively.\nIn this final part of the course, we focus on comparing planned schedules with actual schedules, identifying differences, and seeking reasonable explanations for any gaps observed. This exercise helps you develop a deeper understanding of schedule management within ERP projects.\nFurthermore, we dedicate substantial time to discussing various testing strategies, including test case creation, implementing SWAT calls, leveraging vendor Super SMEs, employing effective ticket management techniques, conducting ERP rollout meetings, generating comprehensive status reports, and engaging in an in-depth discussion on access levels and training requirements.\nEnroll in this comprehensive course led by Jamal, and gain the knowledge, insights, and practical techniques necessary to successfully run ERP projects. Develop the skills to navigate the intricacies of ERP implementations, and drive successful outcomes for your organization.",

The 10 knowledge areas include:\n1- Project Integration Management: Where we make sure that everything is well integrated and coordinated from project beginning to end and manage changes in an integrated manner.\n2- Project Scope Management: Where we plan for scope and requirements management, collect requirements, define the scope, create the work breakdown structure, validate the work that we accomplished and make that we do 100% of the work required (and only 100% of the work).\n3- Project Schedule Management: Where we plan for schedule management, list activities, sequence activities, estimate activity durations, develop a project schedule (with tools and techniques like the critical path method and schedule compression) and make sure that the project schedule is maintained.\n4- Project Cost Management: Where we plan for cost management, estimate costs, develop a cost baseline and overall budget (while accounting for reserves) and track cost performance (through earned value analysis) while maintaining the cost baseline and budget.\n5- Project Quality Management: Where we incorporate the organization’s quality policy regarding planning, managing, and controlling the project and product quality requirements, in order to meet stakeholders’ expectations. Where quality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements.\n6- Project Resource Management: Where we identify, acquire, develop the project team and manage the resources (be it personnel or physical) needed for the successful completion of the project.\n7- Project Communication Management: Where we ensure timely and appropriate planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, control, monitoring, and ultimate disposition of project information. (This knowledge area is especially important as studies indicate that project managers spend 75 to 90 percent of their time communicating with stakeholders).\n8- Project Risk Management: Where we conduct risk management planning, identification, analysis, response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project. Where risk is any uncertain event or condition that has an impact on the project.\n9- Project Procurement Management: Where we take necessary actions to purchase or acquire products, services, or results needed from outside the project team. (This knowledge area is especially sensitive from a legal perspective).\n10- Project Stakeholder Management: Where we take necessary actions to identify stakeholders, to analyze their expectations and their impact on the project, and develop appropriate management strategies for effectively engaging stakeholders in project decisions and execution.\n\n\nBusiness Environment: Ensuring compliance and adjusting to changes in the business environment in order to optimize value.\n\n\nAlong with extra information that is relevant to your project management development and archived notes of the previous course's structure.",

Why it feels like each department works in a silo instead of resembling actual teammates? Why the ball gets dropped so often? Why there's so much miscommunication?\nThe answer may be that your organization isn't following some fundamental project management (PM) best practices.\nThis course is designed for the healthcare project management (PM) novice. As a physical therapist, I was tasked with managing all kinds of projects without the slightest idea of project management best practices (and without the slightest idea that project management was even a thing!). My goal is to provide some foundational PM skills to those clinicians out there that have been tasked with implementing new programs or creating new processes in their organizations. My aim is to provide you with lessons learned, 'what I wish I had knowns', and basic skills to set you up for success in bringing your projects to completion!\nLet the journey begin!\nCONTINUING EDUCATION NOTES:\nPMP(R) Certificate Holders: This course content is appropriate to be self-logged for 1 PDU in Ways of Working under the Education category. Nothing will be automatically added to your Dashboard after taking this course. You will have to manually log into your PMI(R) account and self-enter the PDUs in your Dashboard. Please message me with any questions on how to log your PDUs.\nPhysical Therapists/PTAs: For the year 2025 - This course is approved for 1 continuing education credit by the West Virginia Board of Physical Therapy (WVBOPT) for physical therapists and physical therapy assistants in the United States. Please message me for details on obtaining the appropriate course certificate if this applies to you.

      "description": "Healthcare project leaders - Have you ever wondered why the programs at your organization aren't fully adopted? Why it feels like each department works in a silo instead of resembling actual teammates? Why the ball gets dropped so often? Why there's so much miscommunication? Why? Why? Why?\nThe answer may be that your organization isn't following some fundamental project management (PM) best practices. As a physical therapist, I was tasked with managing all kinds of projects without the slightest idea of project management best practices (and without the slightest idea that project management was even a thing!). My goal is to provide education on project management skills to those clinicians out there that have been tasked with implementing new programs or creating new processes in their organizations. My aim is to provide you with lessons learned, 'what I wish I had knowns', and basic skills to set you up for success in bringing your projects to completion!\nThis course is the more advanced version of my Healthcare Project Management course. That course focused on definitions and understanding of project management terminology, whereas this course is really building off of that knowledge. In this course I still make sure to define some of the project management language and review project life cycle basics, but it's more advanced in that each section includes more opportunities for real-time use and practical application of the tools and knowledge you’re gaining through critical thinking assignments.\nFrom charter to lessons learned, the handouts provided will give you a great start to building out your very own project implementation toolkit! Let the journey begin!\nCONTINUING EDUCATION NOTES:\nPMP(R) Certificate Holders: This course content is appropriate to be self-logged for 0.5 PDUs in Ways of Working under the Education category.

      "description": "GET INSIGHTS INTO THE BIGGEST REVENUE-CHANGING EVENTS\nBy tracking patent expirations, patent litigation, generic and biosimilar development, you can anticipate these market-shaping forces and stay one step ahead.\nBranded drug companies can experience precipitous revenue erosion as generic drugs rapidly gain market share. All the while patients, physicians, payers, pharmacists, and other healthcare stakeholders must race to keep up.\nThis course answers the following questions to help you adapt:\nWhen will key drug patents expire?\nHow can I write stronger patents?\nHow can I defeat drug patents?\nHow can I find, evaluate, and plan for generic market entry opportunities?\nHow can I find proprietary out-of-court settlements and deal terms?\nComprehensive and actionable coverage of commercial, legal, and regulatory factors builds a solid foundation for strategic thinking. Diverse case studies build on this groundwork by analyzing and explaining real-work examples to form the underpinning for your tactical plans.\n*INCLUDES FREE COMPANION TEXTBOOK\nThis course is the product of more than twenty years of providing guidance to drug development companies and other healthcare stakeholders.\nThrough developing the first website on the business of biotechnology in the 1990s (now owned by the New York Times), editing and publishing the Journal of Commercial Biotechnology, and leading data analytics for a subsidiary of Scientific American, I have had the fortune of spending considerable time at the bleeding edge of the commercial side of drug development.\nThe motivation to develop this course comes from my experiences running DrugPatentWatch, a comprehensive platform to help identify and evaluate opportunities around drug patent expiration and generic entry. In the early 2000s the first version of DrugPatentWatch was developed in response to repeated requests to answer the simple question: “When do drug patents expire?” As the platform matured, it became apparent that there was a strong need for a single source integrating broad strategic guidance to help stakeholders throughout the drug development and delivery value chain. This course was designed to meet that need.\nAs with my other publications, the focus of this course is on actionable intelligence. Because the legal and regulatory underpinnings of drug development and delivery are complex and change frequently, the approach taken by this course is to explain the current state of affairs and to provide representative examples to help you develop a deep understanding so you can quickly adapt to and capitalize on future events.\nA primary objective of this course is to fill gaps in knowledge, helping you leverage your expertise, without being overly exhaustive. For readers seeking greater technical depth I provide links to some of the books and web-based resources that I found helpful.\nBecause strategic planning for branded drugs has many similarities to finding and prioritizing generic entry opportunities, this course has relevance for generic and branded companies alike. Likewise, distributors, payers, investors, and myriad other stakeholders will also benefit by understanding the commercial dynamics of pharmaceutical and biotechnology drugs.\nI hope you enjoy this course as much as I did putting it together.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nYali Friedman, Ph.D. has more than 20 years experience providing business intelligence to life science companies. He was recently named one of the 100 most influential people in biotechnology by Scientific American. He is also author of the MBA-level textbook Building Biotechnology and publisher of the Journal of Commercial Biotechnology.",

      "description": "Are you looking for a differentiator in your career?\n“What everyone wants is a professional capable of clearly identifying problems and finding the best solutions to those problems. In other words, a good business analyst”.\nNormally, BA learning is empirical, making mistakes several times until something works. It doesn't have to be that way. There is a Guide for the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK® Guide) that can be used by professionals who practice Business Analysis. Practice in a conscious and organized manner can leverage your career and differentiate you in the work environment.\nBut the BABOK® Guide is hard reading. It's too abstract and there are no applied examples. That is why the Brazilian BA is here to solve your problems. He is an expert in presenting difficult ideas in an approachable and charming way.\nThis course is full of fun graphic illustrations and practical exercises with the instructor's answers so you can learn by doing. In the end, you will be prepared to conduct a structured business analysis using globally recognized techniques to understand needs and design solutions that maximize value for all your customers.\nIt will be the basis of your studies to obtain one of the Core professional certifications in Business Analysis from IIBA® (ECBA, CCBA, or CBAP).\nIf you are still a professional at the beginning of your career and would like to become a Business Analyst, this course will guide you to avoid a lot of suffering to learn “the easy path”.\nIf you are already a senior and quite experienced professional, this course will help you organize your knowledge and experiences by placing a certain formalism in your way of acting, helping you to work more consciously and effectively leaving you even more qualified to attend to your customers.\nFinally, you will feel more secure and prepared to formally act as a business analyst or take a certification exam in Business Analysis.\n* IIBA ®, BABOK ® Guide, and Business Analysis Body of Knowledge ® are registered trademarks owned by the International Institute of Business\n** Music: Funny Song - Bensound .com",

In these projects, after a lot of effort, days worked, money spent, stress and battle to deliver the result, it seems that \"this was not exactly what the client wanted\".",

Theory of Constraint's CCPM (Critical Chain Project Management) is all about clearing this mystery and finding an effective yet simpler way to manage projects successfully.\nThe single project and multi project CCPM solutions of TOC are being used worldwide by many fortune 500 companies manage projects. This course intends to introduce the Project management students and professionals to CCPM, the breakthrough way of TOC to manage projects.\nIn this course we will discuss the basic TOC concepts followed by project management fundamentals. We will take real life examples to understand how to plan a project and create a project network. We will also discuss the CPM and PERT for project scheduling before discussing the CCPM (Critical Chain Project Management) solution of TOC.\nThe course evolves from the discussion on problems and dissatisfaction in our current way of managing projects. The root causes of the problems are discussed and the CCPM solution is proposed as a way to overcome the problems of traditional project management practices. Once we discuss all the solution elements of CCPM, the implementation of the same is discussed in detail for a single project environment and multi project environment.\nThis course is intended to help all project management students and professionals explore a new way of managing projects, the TOC way.\nPS: Captions/subtitles in English are available for this course",

Part of the problem is that the examples used in books often do not seem realistic.\nUnfortunately, examples must be made simple to facilitate the learning process. Larger, more complex examples reflecting actual applications would be too complex to help the student learn the modeling technique. The modeling techniques in this course are, in fact, used extensively in the business world, and their use is increasing rapidly because of information technology.\nThe real objective of management science is to solve the decision-making problems that confront managers by developing mathematical models of those problems\nFor this course, the main goal is to demonstrate solutions to various problems that managers face every single day. From maximizing profitability, minimizing transportation costs, to optimizing employee scheduling, this course will provide you with a hands-on approach to dealing with management science models and techniques.\nThere is no mathematical programming in this course or learning complex formulas, as we will use Microsoft Excel as an aid to solving various common business scenarios that you encounter at the workplace.\nThe whole idea is to make these mathematical topics seem less complex and present them in a practical way to your benefit. Each modeling technique is explained with straight forward examples followed by hands-on tutorials.\nThank you.\nSyed and Team ClayDesk",

This comprehensive course provides a deep dive into the essential skills of project scope definition and resource management, equipping you to deliver projects that meet stakeholder expectations, stay within budget, and are completed on time.\nWe'll begin by exploring the importance of a well-defined project scope. You'll learn proven techniques to gather requirements, translate them into a clear scope statement, and use tools like Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) to break down complex projects into manageable components. Understanding how to define the \"what\" of a project is the first step towards success.\nHowever, projects rarely unfold exactly as planned. This course will empower you with a systematic change management process. You'll learn how to evaluate change requests, assess their impact on timelines and budgets, and negotiate with stakeholders to maintain project alignment.\nNext, we'll tackle the art and science of resource planning. You'll learn to identify the types of resources your project needs (people, equipment, materials, budget), develop accurate estimation methods, and create detailed resource plans. This knowledge will help you proactively avoid resource shortages or overcommitments.\nFinally, the course will focus on monitoring and controlling your resources. You'll master strategies for tracking resource usage, identifying potential bottlenecks, and optimizing utilization. We'll emphasize the critical role of communication and collaboration throughout, ensuring you have the skills to keep stakeholders informed and your project team working effectively together.\nWhether you're a seasoned project manager, a team member, an aspiring project leader, or an entrepreneur, this course will transform the way you approach projects, setting you up for consistent, successful outcomes.",

      "description": "Identifying the need for, instilling and controlling quality within an organization is a skill highly in demand today. To enable you to do this, the 7 tools of quality are a set of tools tried and tested in a range of industries, sectors and organizations of all sizes. They can be used for many different purposes including identifying the distribution and frequency of data points, assessing the stability and performance of a process, understanding the root cause of a problem and graphically showing you the current state of your key operations. In this course, we will:\n- Learn about the fundamentals of quality, looking at examples, how to monitor it and why it is important.\n- Review each of the tools, breaking them down into what they are, when they should be used and why.\n- Run through a series of practical demonstrations, based on real life scenarios, to show you how to deploy the tools in full.\n- Learn about what you should expect as outputs from the tools, what good looks like and how to determine the best tool for the job, depending on the situation at hand.\nThese tools can help you to identify that quality is indeed required, that established quality is in danger and show you the path to improvement. They can be used reactively and proactively, to understand current performance and future risks and, crucially, can be trained out to others to deploy as part of their daily activities - improving quality and performance one colleague at a time.",

Whether we use software for that or just a whiteboard and sticky notes.\n\n\nKanban for Individuals and Small Teams\nWhat Kanban is and where it comes from\nHow to create a board\nHow to create tasks (a.k.a. cards) and how to prioritise them\nHow to work with a WIP Limit and increase focus\nHow to enhance our board and make it more flexible\nHow to design a Kanban workflow that specifically meets the needs of a specific project\nFinding the best task size\nKanban for Software Teams\nDesigning a board for the Software Development workflow\nWorking with \"Done Rules\" for increased quality\nUsing WIP limits to indicate workflow imbalances\nEstimation for Kanban teams: working with tasks of same size\nI am a certified Scrum Product Owner and Scrum Master. Working with agile teams has taught me a lot about project management in creative environments. No project is like the other. Teams change, customers change, requirements change. For that reason it is important to have a system that can change with you. And that is easily understood by coworkers and customers alike.\nWhat's great about Kanban is that it is flexible enough to grow from one-person daily task management to a tool that is used by entire teams and complex workflows.",

      "description": "Introduction:\nProject managers today are asked to take on increasingly challenging responsibilities. In an era of limited budgets and risk averse organizations, project managers (PMs) must be able to cut costs while managing many complex projects and multiple staff members while adapting on the fly to challenging business conditions. If you can relate, Xcel Project Manager (XPM) is for you.\nThere are software systems that attempt to do what XPM can do. Unfortunately they are often expensive and have too many varied tools to be practical for the average PM. XPM is is perfect because it is simple in its construction and is highly adaptable to new staff, changes in salary and cost, and changing resource assignments. Through this course you will make a complex yet simple tool that you can refine to your needs over time.\nIf you don't have time to take the course right now, you may download the finished product in the last section and use the videos as a tutorial for how to use it!\nWhat XPM can do:\nXPM tracks projects on a weekly basis\nMeasures task and project costs weekly based upon staff resources assigned to them\nTabulates costs for multiple projects into resource summary rows in each project sheet. This allows for the PM to make changes while keeping track of overall allocation.\nCan be used to project far into the future\nAllows for justification for new hiring (or force reduction) based upon projected resource needs\nPresents an easy mechanism to add new projects and write new proposals with immediate recognition of impacts to staff resources\nAllows for immediate response to changes in allocation on a weekly basis or for changes in salary or cost\nIt is completely adaptable to your needs once you learn the simple mechanisms of connecting separate spreadsheets through formulas\nThe following is a course outline:\nSection 1: Welcome!\nSection 2: Create a weekly project tracking spreadsheet\nSection 3: Create a staff resources accounting spreadsheet\nSection 4: Tie weekly project tracking spreadsheet to accounting (staff cost sheet)\n\nSection 5: Establish summary project and staff resources spreadsheets\n\nSection 6: Add new projects\n\nSection 7: Improve readability (and attractiveness of sheets). Also manage staff resources and project budgets. Learn to manage a project proposal.\nTo take this course you only need a willingness to learn and access to Microsoft Excel (I use 2016 but 2013 is very similar).\nThank you for taking the course! I will be responding to questions and keeping track of any issues that students may have. This course should establish skills that will be immediately usable for all project managers in any field.\nIan Dowdy, MBA",

      "description": "\"Project Thinking for Non-Project Managers\" - 2 hours on-demand video in English (+ Russian cc), 38 downloadable resources - templates in English and in Russian and sketchbooks for every lesson, 2 contact hours of education for PMP exam!\nNow it is difficult to find person who first encounters projects in his workplace or personal life. But for many, the first attempt leaves only a negative experience.\nIncessant mess in everything, constant switching between tasks, daily changes, reconsideration and, as a result, insufficient recognition of efforts. This is how up to 90% of participants in projects in which I took part describe their first experience.\n\"Project Thinking for Non-Project Managers\" online training is designed for those students who participate or lead project activities, but are not a professional project managers.\nMy goal is to help you figure out why everything is not the same in projects as in Business As Usual,  how to find your place in the project team and how to help the project manager bring the project to a successful conclusion.\nThe best option for completing this training is an online marathon. One day, one lesson, one practical work and reflection on the experience gained.\nWe will talk to you in simple language about complex concepts and tools. You will try to apply both classic, waterfall models of project management and modern Agile approaches such as Kanban and Scrum.\nI will draw sketches for you and visualize information for better learning and remembering. You can download a sketchbook of each lesson to your computer.\nI want to form the right expectations for our marathon:\nDo not hope that after this one course you will become a professional project manager - you are at the very beginning of your journey in this field;\nWe will not use any project management standard or methodology as the basis for all training and will not prepare you for a professional certification such as PMI PMP (c) or PRINCE2 Practitioner (c);\nYou will not receive the magic wand or silver bullet that will lead your project to \"successful success\".\nBut,\nYou will get a proper introduction to the new, wonderful world of project management;\nWe will talk about complex things in simple language, based on my practical experience and your common sense;\nYou will be able to understand what and why the project manager will want from you, what should and should not be done in the project and how to help the team complete the project on time, within the budget and so that the customer also needs your project's deliverables;\nAnd if needed, you can earn 4 contact hours of education for this training that is required to be admitted to the professional certification exam.\n\n\nWelcome on board and good luck to you!",

      "description": "Welcome to the course on The Scrum Development Process. This is the third course of a series of eight that will form the Agile Project Management - The PMI-ACP (Agile Certified Practitioner) Certification Program.Who is your instructor?\nAn overview of the Scrum development process.\nScrum is one of the most popular agile methodologies to date, with tools and techniques applicable to more than just software development projects.\nThis course will assist prospective Scrum masters, product owners, and team members with the understanding of core Scrum practices. This includes an outline of the roles and responsibilities of members of the Scrum team, the importance of good communication, and the role of project stakeholders.\nThe course divides the Scrum development process into three major phases: pre-game, game, and post-game. It describes the activities performed in each phase, but particularly examines the activities and tools of the game phase.\nScrum basics covered include the use of product and sprint backlogs, the use of iterative development in the form of sprints, performing daily stand-up meetings, the use of sprint reviews and retrospectives, and using Scrum task boards and burn-down charts for monitoring and reporting project progress.\nWho is your instructor?\n\nMy name is Sorin, and I will be your instructor. I am a trainer and project manager with more than 10 years of experience. Before Udemy, I trained hundreds of people in a classroom environment – civil servants, managers, project workers, aid workers and many more. And I managed projects in the fields of justice, corrections, regional development and human resources development.\nHow will you benefit?\nThis course is intended for project managers, program managers, or anyone who wants to efficiently participate in agile projects. It is aligned with the Agile Certified Practitioner exam objectives developed by the Project Management Institute® and Certified ScrumMaster learning objectives.\nTraining videos, examples, exercices and quizzes will help you learn all about the Scrum development process.

Having incredible leadership skills can be what takes your career to the next level and drives your teams/projects to success.\nThe importance of being a leader is the new norm if you want to advance. PMI Pulse data shows most organizations place nearly an equal emphasis on developing leadership skills as they do on technical skills.\nThis course is a journey of self-mastery developed through the teachings of emotional intelligence, leadership styles and their appropriate applications, building peak performing teams, and setting up projects for success. You will learn the value and application of earned value management, organizational awareness, and proper project management methodologies taught in a fun and interactive manner.\nThis course covers the top 5 things that I have experienced that plague us all as PMs and cause the chaos effect and overall project failure:\n1. Inability to recognize and accept that change is inevitable and how to be proactive\n2. Lack of leadership development among project managers\n3. Lack of proper project management processes, tools, and proper training programs\n4. Lack of understanding as to how the organization's systems function with one another\n5. Lack of clear communication at all levels internal and external (vision, mission, value, understanding, goals, wants, needs, responsibility and accountability).\nThis course is based around enhancing all these areas. Transforming from something that plagues us to strategies that benefit us, and how to lead your teams to success by avoiding the major pitfalls that plague 75% of all projects.\nLeadership and management are equally important within this ever-changing culture. This course is based around real world experiences and lessons learned from a seasoned project manager. It is formulated so that others don't have to learn the hard way by avoiding major pitfalls, navigating, and thriving in change, and building peak preforming teams.\nBy the end of course you will be able to thrive in any project. You will be the most trusted PM in your organization because of your ability to organize, influence and execute with precision.\nYou’re not going to just learn methodologies that make you a better employee.\nYou’re going to raise your personal value and your life/career currency!",

Why should I select your practice exams?\nOur Questions Are Specifically Developed For The 2021 PMP Exam!\nMost existing course providers have just added some new questions and call their practice exams aligned with the new examination content outline. Don’t be fooled by that! The 2021-2022 PMP Exam is completely different than the previous exam. Therefore, the majority of the practice exams that were offered before are not representative anymore. All our questions have been developed specifically for the 2021 examination content outline, so:\n50% Agile / Hybrid\nHighly situational\nNew question types (matching, multi-select, and hotspot)!\nFull Length Practice Exams With Correct Proportions Of Domains And Tasks\nWe pride to offer full length practice exams (3 x 180 questions) for which the questions are proportioned across the three domains (people, process, and business environment) and even more important across the tasks in the domains. From our experience most course providers proportion their questions across the domains, not the tasks in the domains! This means that you might miss out on your weak areas.\nOur Practice Exams Are Affordable!\nGetting your PMP is already expensive enough, therefore, we strive to keep our practice exams affordable and accessible for all aspirant PMP candidates. We offer 3 full length practice exams (540 questions in total) for the base price of $19.99.\nOur Questions Are Challenging!\nAs the proverb says: “hope for the best, prepare for the worst”. Our questions are challenging, some of them even more difficult than you would expect to see on the real PMP exam. So, when you pass our practice exams, rest assured you will pass the real PMP exam as well!\nDetailed Explanation Of The Answers With Reference To Literature\nThis one speaks for itself.\nThat Sounds Great. But What About The PMBOK 7th Edition?\nYes, it is confusing that while the examination content outline fully changed the PMBOK 6th Edition is still applicable for the 2021 PMP Exam. When the PMBOK 7th Edition is released we will update our practice exams. However, because our questions were developed specifically for the 2021 examination content outline, we don’t expect too many changes!\nWhat are you waiting for?

      "description": "The Monitor Project Communications (PMI - PMP) is course 20 of 28 of the Project Management Professional Certification Program (PMI-PMP).\nSometimes on projects, things don't go according to the communications management plan. Stakeholders' information needs might change or your team members find a better way to use technology to communicate with each other.\nOr maybe someone drops the ball and keeps forgetting to send you important status updates. It's your job to monitor the flow of information and determine whether the plan needs to change or whether people's actions need to change, so they comply with the planned approach for project communications.\n1. Monitor Communications Overview\n2. Data and Documents for Monitoring Communications\n3. Other Inputs to Monitor Communications\n4. Using a PMIS to Monitor Project Communications\n5. Using Techniques to Monitor Communications\n6. Outputs of Monitor Communications\n7. Exercise: Monitoring Project Communications\nMonitoring project communications is a crucial aspect of project management. By regularly reviewing the flow of information, project managers can ensure that stakeholders are receiving the necessary updates and that team members are effectively communicating with each other. This process allows project managers to identify any deviations from the communications management plan and take appropriate actions to address them.\nIn order to effectively monitor project communications, project managers need to have access to relevant data and documents. This includes communication logs, meeting minutes, progress reports, and any other documentation related to project communications. By reviewing these materials, project managers can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of the current communication methods and identify areas for improvement.\nMonitoring project communications requires more than just reviewing data and documents. Project managers also need to consider other inputs such as stakeholder feedback and team member observations. By actively seeking feedback from stakeholders and team members, project managers can gain a better understanding of their information needs and any communication issues they may be experiencing. This information can then be used to make necessary adjustments to the communications management plan.\nThat’s it! Now go ahead and push that “Take this course” button, and see you on the inside!",

      "description": "Are you concerned about your project and whether it will achieve success? Do you have worries about project failure? Project managers often experience a fear of risk, stemming from the potential consequences of project failure, including delays, cost overruns, and reputational damage, which can be a significant source of stress.\nLearn and Master Risk Management Approaches and Techniques\nRisk is something that cannot be removed. Risk always exists across the duration of the project’s lifecycle. You can ease the burden of worries and stress through effective risk management. Effective risk management offers numerous advantages, including enhanced decision-making, improved operational efficiency, better resource allocation, and increased stakeholder confidence, ultimately leading to a more resilient and successful organisation.\n‘Risk Management: Strategic Mitigation for Project Success’ will give you practical techniques and a structural framework to manage risks to your projects. You will be able to tackle risks and issues that arise with confidence. The course will give you the skills to take a proactive approach. You will be prepared for risks rather than be reactive. A reactive approach does not work, it leads to panic and frustration. Your organisation will not be ready for a risk scenario and it could jeopardise the whole project.\nYou will go through different phases of a risk management process and you will:\n\n\nDevelop a risk management plan\nRecognise and identify risks\nLearn how to apply risk analysis\nBuild a risk response plan\nImplement risk monitoring and control\nYou will understand the principles of risk management. You will also know how to create a risk management plan that takes everything that you learn throughout the course.\nYou will learn how to identify and analyse risks using SWOT analysis and risk categorisation followed by the risk matrix, the risk register, and the Monte Carlo Simulation. From your identification and analysis of risks, you can develop response strategies.\nYou will be able to develop effective response strategies. You will learn about who to appoint as risk owners and who is accountable for each risk. And you will be able to develop contingency plans for scenarios when risk responses fail.\nFinally, you will learn how to monitor and control risks including reporting systems and documentation.\nThis course provides essential learning about an element of project management that should not be overlooked. Risk is something that has to be continuously monitored and reviewed. Changes in the risk landscape can change throughout the duration of the project. Risk is something that should be communicated to all stakeholders involved in the project. You must be proficient in risk management in today's world which proves to be uncertain at the best of times.\nRisk is an aspect of a project that is uncertain but its impact can be managed and there are different approaches to countermeasure risks. Will you treat a risk? Or will you simply tolerate it? These are decisions project managers must make. By the end of your training, you will be in a better position to confidently make these decisions.\nYou will have the confidence to accurately report risks to stakeholders and senior leadership in your organisation. You will know the correct procedures and processes to report risks and obtain approval to make changes when risks arise.\nThroughout this course, the learning leans towards practical experience over theoretical knowledge. We encourage you to take action and put techniques into practice as soon as you have completed a lesson. The lessons include resources such as spreadsheets and report templates for you to review and use. This course is all about getting you to implement a risk management approach immediately into your projects.\nYou should be proficient with spreadsheet software. We recommend that you use Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. You will also require Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Write to open and use the report templates. You could also apply what you have learnt to project management software. For example, you could develop a risk register or risk management information system using project management software.\nThe course is directed at project managers but risk managers, project team members, resource managers, department managers, and business students will also find this course extremely useful. Wherever you are in your career, every business professional should have a good understanding of risk management. The course content and material have been designed and developed to suit all career levels, whether you have experience in risk management or are a novice.\nSo if you are looking to improve the success rate of your projects and enhance your CV, then enrol now! We look forward to you joining the course.",

Just check out the curriculum to get an idea of the topics covered.\nI've been teaching IT project management for over 20 years at Nanyang Technology University (NTU) in Singapore, and I've been engaged in the IT industry since the start of my career in the 90's.\nThe reality is that project management is hard, and project failure is just as common as project success.\nHowever, outstanding project managers understand that, in the real world, successful projects isn't just about crafting a project plan - it's about assessing the ROI of projects, defining a clear scope, estimating in a rational manner, building a high-performance team, managing stakeholder expectations, and more.\nThe course is lengthy, but is broken down into distinct, easy to digest modules:\n\n\nWorld of project management\nAchieving project success\nProject conception and proposal\nProject scope and requirements\nProject planning\nAgile projects\nProject estimating\nManaging stakeholders\nProject outsourcing\nProject risk\nLeading the project team\nProject governance\nThere are no short cuts to becoming a better project manager.  However, this course will provide you with ideas and insights that will help accelerate that journey.\nGood luck!",

It has a practical case study i.e., Residential Building Construction comprising of several activities under Civil works, Finishes, MEP, etc. We start with the fundamentals of setting up the project - Creating the EPS, OBS, Site Customized Calendar, WBS, Activities, Relationships, Resources, etc. Furthermore, we move on to understanding all the available delay analysis techniques in construction theoretically & practically. Then we learn how to generate & print various reports of our analysis to present the same to our senior management for easing their decision-making. Lastly, we have one very interesting assignment question (ofcourse, with solution) for Hotel construction project to encapsulate all the learnings. Additional video on concurrent delay analysis is also appended towards the end in case the subject entices you all !\nThe most unique part of this course is that it also explains the cost analysis of resources due to delays using P6 which is rarely taken up elsewhere.\nEverything is explained in the simplest way possible through real examples to help the learners get an industry like exposure. It is ensured that every video is linked to the real project scenarios unlike other teachers who randomly take topics and examples having absolutely zero correlation with each other. This will also help you get the real feel of executing a project at site.\nThe flow of the course is as follows -\nSection 1 (Introduction) - Shows the outline of the complete course and helps you understand various types of delays that one could come across in construction.\nSection 2 (Residential Building Construction Project Set Up in Primavera P6) - Here you will learn how to set up & plan the project by creating & assigning EPS, OBS, Customized Calendar, WBS, Activities, Relationships, Resources, and much more. Gantt Chart will also be explained in detail.\nSection 3 (Delay & Cost Analysis Theory & Practical) - We shall take one very small sample project to understand all delay analysis techniques. Then each of the techniques is applied practically in Primavera P6. This section forms the most significant part of the project. Following techniques are explained - As Planned vs As Built, Impacted As Planned, Collapsed As Built, Time Impact Analysis (TIA). Furthermore, we generate & print these analysis reports.\nSection 4 (Hotel Construction Assignment for Delay & Cost Analysis) - Here comes the most interesting assignment of Hotel construction project to help you all summarize all the learnings & apply them here. An additional lecture of concurrent delay analysis is also provided as an optional lecture based on the interest of learners.\nAnd you are ready to take over scheduling & delay/cost analysis using Primavera P6.",

Learn basic techniques for creating building information models, including building elements, building envelopes, curtain systems, interiors and circulation, and creating families.\nAutodesk® Revit® building design software is specifically built for Building Information Modeling (BIM), including features for architectural design, MEP and structural engineering, and construction. This course presents many of the fundamental concepts of creating BIM models by applying the tools in Revit. The features presented are a small subset of the full range available in the Autodesk® Revit® platform, specifically focusing on creating new models and displaying them in ways suitable for various applications.\nCAD is no longer just about drafting. Autodesk® BIM solutions allow you to explore and evaluate a project’s constructability before it’s built, improve cost reliability, visualize construction processes through 4D simulation and clash detection, increase coordination between stakeholders throughout the design and construction process, and better predict, manage, and communicate project outcomes. In this course, we also begin with creating building models that more accurately reflect construction execution. From there, we will look at 4D simulations leveraging those BIM components. Then, we will look at creating model-based cost estimates and takeoffs. Finally, we explore the management of facilities through BIM.\nThis online course includes over 9 hours of content in more than 30 instructional videos along with 26 step-by-step modeling exercises.\nTable of Contents:\nIntroduction to Building Information Modeling\nModeling Building Elements\nBuilding Envelope\nCurtain Systems\nInteriors and Circulation\nViews and Visualization\nMaterials, Lighting, and Rendering\nConstruction Modeling\n4D Simulation and Construction Planning\nCost Estimating and Quantity Takeoff\nFacilities Management\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nIdentify and describe effective modeling and visualization techniques for presenting your designs.\nCreate 3D models of Architectural structures using Building Information Modeling elements that are virtual representations of the real world.\nCreate building models that more accurately reflect the construction techniques that will be used for the materials and systems specified.\nCreate 4D simulations to support construction planning and assess the impact of proposed design features on the construction schedule and workflow.\nCreate building models to support conceptual cost estimating and quantity takeoffs.\nUse BIM to track, update, and maintain facilities management information to support better planning, operations, and maintenance decision-making throughout a building’s life cycle.\nSupplemental Texts:\nBIM Handbook: A Guide to Building Information Modeling for Owners, Designers, Engineers, Contractors, and Facility Managers (3rd Edition, 2018); Authors: Rafael Sacks, Chuck Eastman, Ghang Lee, Paul Teicholz; Publisher:  John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Agile and Scrum: From Fundamentals to Advanced Practices course by Uplatz.\n\n\nWhat is Agile?\nAgile is a broader project management philosophy that encompasses a set of values and principles for guiding software development and other projects. It emphasizes customer collaboration, frequent delivery of working software, responding to change over following a rigid plan, and valuing individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Agile methodologies like Scrum are designed to promote transparency, continuous improvement, and rapid adaptation to changing requirements.\n\n\nWhat is Scrum?\nScrum is a lightweight, agile framework designed to help teams develop complex products in an iterative and incremental manner. It provides a structured approach to project management, emphasizing flexibility, adaptability, and close collaboration among team members. At its core, Scrum breaks down large projects into smaller, manageable units called sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. During each sprint, the team focuses on completing a specific set of prioritized tasks, with regular checkpoints and opportunities for adjustment to ensure the project stays on track and aligned with the evolving needs of stakeholders.\n\n\nScrum and Agile offer a framework for managing complex projects that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. They empower teams to deliver value more frequently, adapt to change, and continuously improve their performance.\n\n\nHow Scrum and Agile Work Together\nScrum and Agile are intrinsically linked, with Scrum being one of the most widely adopted Agile frameworks. Scrum provides a practical implementation of Agile principles through its defined roles, events, and artifacts.\nRoles: Scrum involves three key roles: the Product Owner (responsible for defining product vision and prioritizing features), the Scrum Master (facilitates the Scrum process and removes obstacles), and the Development Team (self-organizing and cross-functional group responsible for delivering product increments).\nEvents: Scrum events include Sprint Planning (where the team plans the work for the upcoming sprint), Daily Scrum (a short daily meeting to discuss progress and challenges), Sprint Review (where the team demonstrates the completed work and gathers feedback), and Sprint Retrospective (a reflection meeting for the team to identify areas for improvement).\nArtifacts: Scrum relies on three artifacts: the Product Backlog (a prioritized list of desired features), the Sprint Backlog (items selected for the current sprint), and the Increment (potentially shippable product functionality created during the sprint).\n\n\nMain Features of Agile\nCustomer Collaboration: Agile teams prioritize understanding and fulfilling customer needs throughout the development process.\nAdaptability to Change: Agile teams welcome change and can adjust their plans based on new information or evolving market conditions.\nFocus on Working Software: The primary measure of progress is working software, rather than extensive documentation or planning.\nCollaboration: Agile teams foster collaboration and open communication among all members.\nSustainable Pace: Agile teams aim to maintain a sustainable work pace that allows for continuous delivery without burnout.\n\n\nMain Features of Scrum\nIterative and Incremental Development: The project is divided into short iterations (sprints), where the team focuses on delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint.\nSelf-Organizing Teams: Scrum teams are cross-functional and empowered to manage their own work, making decisions about how to achieve their sprint goals.\nTime-Boxing: Each sprint has a fixed time duration, creating a sense of urgency and focus.\nTransparency: Scrum emphasizes open communication and visibility into the team's work, progress, and challenges.\nContinuous Improvement: Retrospectives at the end of each sprint provide an opportunity for the team to reflect and identify ways to improve their processes and performance.\n\n\nAgile and Scrum: From Fundamentals to Advanced Practices - Course Curriculum\n\n\nIntroduction to Scrum and Agile\nScrum Agile Mindset and Principles\nBenefits of Agile and Project Management Approach\nScrum Agile Methodologies and Mindsets\nScrum Definition and Three Pillars\nScrum Values\nScrum Roles and Features\nKey Terms of Scrum\nExtreme Programming\nFeature-driven Development\nValue-driven Delivery\nValue-driven Delivery - IRR\nValue-driven Delivery - Prioritization Techniques\nValue-driven Delivery - MVP\nAgile Compliance\nEarned Value Management\nEarned Value Metrics\nAgile Contract and Types\nAgile Stakeholder Management\nAgile Stakeholder Needs and Understanding\nAgile Personas\nAgile Community Management\nAgile Impediments Log\nAgile Team Performance and Formation\nAgile Team Performance - Management and Leaderships\nAgile Collaboration and Brainstorming Technique\nAgile Time-Boxing and Estimation Technique\nAgile Problem Detection and Resolution Technique\nAgile Risk Management Life Cycle\nAgile Continuous Improvement and Continuous Development\n\n\nCareer Scope in Agile and Scrum\nCompleting a Scrum and Agile course can open doors to a variety of career opportunities. Agile can provide a solid foundation for a fulfilling career in project management, software development, or other fields where Agile methodologies are used. Some of the key potential career paths and job titles to pursue are:\nDirect Scrum Roles:\nScrum Master: This is a core role in Scrum, responsible for facilitating the Scrum process, removing impediments, and ensuring the team adheres to Scrum values and practices.\nProduct Owner: This role is responsible for maximizing the value of the product by defining and prioritizing the product backlog. They work closely with the development team and stakeholders to ensure that the right product is being built.\nAgile-Related Roles:\nAgile Coach: Helps teams and organizations adopt and implement Agile practices effectively. They provide guidance, training, and mentorship to help teams improve their Agile maturity.\nAgile Project Manager: Manages projects using Agile methodologies, ensuring that projects are delivered on time and within budget while maintaining high quality.\nRelease Train Engineer (RTE): Facilitates the coordination and alignment of multiple Agile teams in a Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) environment.\nRoles Leveraging Agile Skills:\nBusiness Analyst: Agile business analysts work closely with stakeholders to elicit and prioritize requirements, ensuring that the team builds the right product.\nDeveloper/Tester: While not specifically Agile roles, developers and testers working on Agile teams need to understand Agile principles and practices to effectively contribute to the team's success.\nProduct Manager: Agile product managers focus on understanding customer needs and defining a product vision that delivers value.\nTeam Lead/Manager: Agile leadership roles focus on empowering and supporting teams to self-organize and achieve their goals.\n\n\nCareer Progression\nWith experience, individuals in these roles can move into more senior positions, such as:\nSenior Scrum Master\nAgile Program Manager\nEnterprise Agile Coach\nDirector of Agile Delivery",
