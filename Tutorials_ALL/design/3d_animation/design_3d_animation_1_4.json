Something you drew up yourself, a piece of art you found online, or perhaps one given to you at work.\nIn this project-based course, we'll be starting with a simple shaded drawing of a retro sci-fi themed robot.\nWith the concept art at hand, you'll begin interpreting and translating it to 3D as faithfully as you can. Then add additional details to fill in the gaps left by the concept art. Choose your own materials and colors, decals and weathering effects to bring the 3D art closer to life. Hook it up to a simple rig and give a dramatic pose, then top it off with equality dramatic lighting. Finally, render out the final image.\nBy the end of this project, you'll have brought a flat 2D concept art to life as a fully realized 3D art.\n\n\nIn order to help you accomplish all of that, this course will guide you through the following major steps:\nModeling hard surface character from concept art\nConverting low poly mesh to high poly mesh\nBaking high poly mesh to low poly mesh\nPhotoreal texturing of hard surface character\nRigging and setting up a dynamic character pose\nCinematic photo studio lighting and rendering\nThe tools we'll be using are:\nBlender 2.9\nSubstance Painter\nA summary of the skills you'll end up with after the course:\nAbility to translate concept art to 3D\nKnowledge of photoreal texturing techniques\nHow to pose and light characters for beautiful renders",

There are animations about Map, text, nature, canvas, signature, lighting, banner, plasma ball. I have shown shortcut keystrokes and rendering process. I have set rendering process for GIF banner animation as well. The animations are important for commercial level works and updating people about 2D animation. For making graphics I have used Adobe Illustrator to make the vector files. I used some famous plugins like Saber, Glow, Particle World, Gradient.  You will learn many things of animation from here. There are some quiz. 22 tutorials would give you many things to discover new animation techniques and motion graphics. There are effects of color, strokes, fill, opacity, gradient, keyframes, trimpaths, rotation, position, glow, lighting, noise, distortion, shadows, blur effects. There are compositions with timeframes between 4 to 20 seconds. City and canvas animations are complicated performances here. I have shown some unique ways to get job in international freelancing and remote job sites like Upwork and Linkedin. USA, Germany jobs sites have been shows here. So many can get some ideas about their demand and responsibilities. The Market is growing up rapidly with AI.",

      "description": "This masterclass is your comprehensive guide to integrating Blender into your architectural workflows with efficiency and effectiveness. From generating detailed architectural massings to producing compelling visualizations, Blender facilitates a design process that is both expansive and refined. This course empowers you to unlock your creative potential with the assistance of Blender.\nWhat's Covered in the Course\nThis masterclass spans the entirety of Blender's application in the architectural design process, ensuring you're equipped to handle any project:\nInitial Setup and Essential Settings: Start your Blender journey on the right foot with an understanding of essential settings that streamline your design workflow.\nModeling Techniques: Learn to create detailed architectural elements and structures with precision and flair.\nProcedural and Parametric Modeling: Harness the power of procedural modeling and parametric setups for dynamic and adaptable designs.\nExploring Geometry Nodes: Learn how to use Geometry Nodes for instancing and for parametric wall creations\nMaterials and Textures: Add depth to your designs through understanding materials and textures\nOptimizing Rendering Settings: Learn rendering settings and camera angles that highlight the best of your designs.\nPost-Processing: Enhance the visual appeal of your projects with post-processing techniques that add the finishing touches\nBy the end of this course, you'll have a robust foundation in using Blender to transform your ideas into beautifully presentable design projects. Whether you're enhancing your professional skills or embarking on a new design journey, this course has everything you need to succeed.\nLearn from an experienced Architect!\nOver the years working as an architect, and later as a project designer in distinguished firms in London, I have perfected utilising Blender for Architecture, ranging in scale from small pavilions, to buildings, and to whole masterplans. Why did I create this course? When I had a team to manage, I had to teach them Blender one on one, on the job, and I had to work overtime to then do my job! I thought, why not start creating courses with everything I've learned and share them with my co-workers, and with other interested students. Then I found out that I love teaching and now I am on a mission to show as many architects and designers the wonders that Blender can do for realising their designs.",

In this adventure, we will tell you how to model all the motorcycles in the world, at which stages you can create a motorcycle for yourself. We will prepare all the textures and materials. Next, we'll take the best light settings and the best camera angles and settings. We will make a very special scene for our model. And we will adjust the render settings for great rendering. From textures and materials to lighting, from lighting to camera settings and finishing, you'll learn everything in this tutorial. At the end of the training, you will model and render all the motorcycles in the world. When you complete the training from start to finish, you will have gained a great skill for yourself. You should follow every detail by seeing the lesson. This training is silent throughout. Just follow me and keep going. Don't forget to ask where you hang out. Before starting the training, please note that the training is quiet and if you get stuck, you will ask me a question.\n\n\nThroughout this learning...\nWe will do the modeling and rendering of the motorcycle named \"Harley Davidson Street Bob 2021\", one of the world's long-established motorcycle brands, together with you. Do not forget to ask me questions even at the smallest point in this process. I'm going to take the motorcycle creation apart. We will go according to the curriculum. But I want to talk about something here; This training is a very detailed training. It is a training that can take hundreds of time. Therefore, this training will be an up-to-date training. It will take a long time to finish. I will include the completed stages in this process. The tutorial will start from modeling and end under rendering. In this process, please do not think that the training is over when there is no video left in the training. Note that I did this part then. I'm going to break down motorcycle training into sections. Here is our curriculum;\n\n\n- Motorcycle Modeling\n- Texture and Material Making\n- Light Settings\n- Camera settings\n- Scene Setup for Motorcycle Rendering from Scratch\n- Render Settings\n\n\nFirst of all, we will do very detailed model and rendering processes in this course. The course is very detailed. And all the lessons in this course content are completely silent. You are asked to learn by following.Please note that all training is silent while taking the course.",

Then you will learn some of the basic concepts and modelling tools inside of Maya. It is important to learn how to navigate the camera and how to select objects.\nNext, you will begin the modelling process. This is a human character so you will learn how to model the head, eyes, mouth, teeth, tongue, and the rest of the body, like the arms, hands, and legs. You will learn the importance of topology and how to get the topological workflow right to achieve a great looking result.\nThen we will move to the UV mapping process. This is an important step in the 3D model creaton, as creating UV maps will allow you to paint textures and plug these texture maps into the model. The texturing process will be done in Photoshop.\nThen we will go back into Maya, and you will learn how to plug the texture maps into the 3D models using shaders from Maya's Hypershade menu.\nFinally, we will create a background, and set up a camera, which will enable us to render the character. You will also learn and understand the concept of how lights work in Maya, and how to use these lights to create a great looking scene. And finally, you will learn how to render out the final render to give yourself a gorgeous looking render.",

A few years ago he jumped in the adventure that is freelance and the academic world. At Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, he jumps on tables, topples over cabinets and uses props, reference, Maya, UE4 and straight keyframe techniques to help future animators learn how to utilize both art and tech to bring their creations to life in the engine. He also works as an animator/director etc. under his own company, Hummingbird and the Lotus. We're currently working on a Metroidvania PC titled Run Lulu Run to be released in 2016.",

The verts number obliges us to create content with low aesthetic value. Thanks to my method, your projects will look realistic, but will not burden the game engine.\nTogether, we will create your first 3d hairstyle in just an hour. The model will have a clean topology (quads only).\nThe entire creation process has been recorded on the camera, so you do not have to worry that you will miss something. You will learn how to create a basic mesh model and add an alpha textured layer to it. You will also learn how to create uv maps and texturing an object. I will show you my tricks that will make 3D hair styling quick, pleasant and giving you satisfying results.\nEpisodes :\n1. Creating a sphere\n2. Creating a hairstyle shape\n3. Adding a length\n4.

After finishing the course, you would easily be able to create the renders shown in the trailer and create high quality props of your own.\nThis course has 4 hours of content! (All the videos have audio commentary)\nWe will go over every step in this course together and nothing will be skipped. The course does not have any kind of time-lapse so that you can follow every step easily.\nWe will start by modelling the prop in Blender, and learn various modelling techniques and also learn a lot about different modifiers. After finishing the modelling, we will apply all the modifiers and UV unwrap our model for export.\n\n\nWe will import our model into Substance Painter to start with the texturing process; we will start by baking the mesh maps for our model. We will learn to create high quality and realistic materials and the key features of Substance Painter like Smart Masks, generators, smart materials etc.\nAt last, we will take our models back to Blender and render them. We will set up the material, lighting, and the camera and learn how to use HDRIs to light our scenes. We will finish the course by taking a portfolio ready render and a little bit of Photoshop editing.\nThis course is for everyone who has a basic understanding of Blender and Substance Painter and wants to upgrade their skills.",

      "description": "Hello potential students.! This course is going to go over many concepts and techniques of working with Houdini Vellum to create a small FX shot. We will cover many tricks that are used all the time in production to get fine control over your Vellum setup, including ways to pin vellum objects together to create an interactive system of multiple vellum objects.\nWe will go over various constraint types and methods to use geometry grouping to simplify the constraint creation process, and creative ways to not only break constraints, but how to use those broken constraints to procedurally drive other attributes that can be used during the shader setup and rendering of your vellum setup to create a much more interesting render.\nWe will see how you can use vellum constraints to create a dynamic wire type of object with objects that stick to it, until you want them to break free and detach. These connected objects will be controlled by other constraints to make them behave as rigid bodies on a deforming wire. Once we have this Vellum system the way we like it, we will go over other tricks to create procedurally generated electrical energy bolts, Something that is much more common to do in post production than you might think.! Every FX artist should know how to create an effect like this, it comes up all the time in a professional production environment.\nOnce we have this all done, we will check out some rendering options, and even how to quickly add an extra layer of FX elements to the setup, another thing that is very common to have to do when addressing client notes or requests on a tight production deadline and a very useful skill to have as a working FX artist.\nThis course is intended for individuals that have some level of familiarity with Houdini. You should know at least the very basics, such as creating nodes and how to create a basic node network, how to set keyframes and diving in and out of networks.  I will not be explaining the most basic concepts in this course, since you should know these things if signing up for this course. If you took my first Houdini course, Master Houdini FX, you will have everything and more than you need to know to be able to take this course. If you have been using Houdini for a few months, you will more than likely have enough of a foundation with the software to be able to take this course. If at anytime while watching this course you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. You can post questions through the Q&A or use the messaging system to ask me directly.\nThis course will have a number of examples using VEX and wrangle nodes. Many artist try to avoid VEX, but you should NOT be afraid of VEX, it is extremely powerful and it will be made clear how and why it is so powerful in this course. Every professional working FX artist ( that uses Houdini ) should know how to use VEX, even if just at the basic level. If you do not wish to create setups that use VEX, you will still be required to know some VEX when working at a post production company since other artists, including FX leads will use VEX in their setups, and there will be many times that you will have to use a Rig setup by an FX lead or take over someone else's scene file to finish the shot or address client notes if another artist is out for the day or has been released from the project.\nLike most of my Houdini lectures, I will show you multiple ways of achieving the same end result for certain things in this course, so I will show alternatives to using VEX in some instances to not only show you that there are multiple ways of doing the \"same thing\" in Houdini, but to also show how many things are easier and faster to create with VEX compared to the Non VEX approach.\nEvery lecture will have a downloadable Houdini HIP file ( except the final closing lecture ) that is a working version of the rig up to that point in the lecture. You should make sure you download these to have on your local computer. They are invaluable when trying to troubleshoot if you are not getting the same results that you see on screen when you are recreating the setup on your own. You can use these to cross reference what you have done and double check your work to make sure you are accurately re creating the file.\nThere will also be downloadable PDF files that are a summary of the videos. They are not intended to be a substitute for watching the lectures, but can be used more of a quick reference after you have watched the lecture, to go back and see the most important parts of a lecture if you need a refresher.",

We will cover the hills and mountains with low-poly trees using the low-poly trees geometry nodes scatter that I created for scenes like this. After that we will focus on the trees closer to the camera, using the Smart Trees asset pack.\n\n\nBoth asset packs (Smart trees and Low-poly-trees scatter are available if you buy the larger pack.\nSmart trees individually cost $20 and Low-poly-trees scatter $10, so this is an ideal opportunity to get both packages + tutorial for less than the cost of both packages.\n\n\nSNOW\nAfter the trees, we will create the snow.\nThe whole part with the snow is divided into 3 chapters and lasts 1 hour and 10 minutes, in which I explain in detail where to find good shaders, how to mix shaders, how to create the real mesh with a displacement map, how to use the photoscan element to get more details.\nAlso, we will mention a few free add-ons that may be useful.\nLater, we+e'll talk about lighting, volumetric effects, and more.\nCOMPOSITING\nIn the Blender compositor, we will significantly transform the final result and try out many options.",

      "description": "Master 3D Rendering To Save Time was designed specifically to teach architecture students and graduates how to truly understand their rendering software in order to produce realistic renders in less time. The course covers pain points that almost all architecture students share in common; developing a work-flow, creating realistic lighting, creating accurate materials, applying textures and producing photo realistic final renders. Ingosy Inc. has designed and structured the course to be completed in as little as one weekend. That way students can get right back into creating studio projects, designing their portfolio or applying to graduate schools with their new skill set.\nThe course is taught using 3ds Max and Fstorm Render. We have rendered using all types of programs and rendering engines and decided on this combination for the course because it best suits what students and recent graduates need. 3ds Max is hands down the best modeling software to use for rendering. However, this course doesn't ask anyone to remodel anything. We show you how to import your models from your favourite programs; Rhino, Revit and SketchUp.\nIn school, the program most of us \"learn\" first is Vray. We think it is time to move on to something better, faster and less expensive. This course is taught using Fstorm Render which produces higher quality renders while remaining in the budget range of all university students at €20. Let's leave the $1,180 Vray for the big agencies and studios.",

Unlike typical tutorials, this course offers a unique and professional solution, fully mentored by me. You’ll learn how to build smooth, accurate VFX meshes that won’t overshoot or break, even in slow motion or high-resolution screenshots. Perfect for stylized and realistic games alike.\nAcross 5 hours of high-quality video lessons, I’ll guide you step by step through building an industry-ready mesh generation tool in Houdini, and then show you how to use those meshes inside Niagara in Unreal Engine 5 for advanced swoosh effects. The lessons are clear, efficient, and straight to the point,no fluff, just practical knowledge and powerful techniques that you can reuse again and again.\nThe tool is fully compatible with both Houdini 19 and 20 and is flexible enough to adapt across different workflows and projects. Once imported into Unreal, you’ll be able to push your Niagara VFX even further.\nYou’ll also get full access to my private Discord, where you can ask questions, share progress, and get feedback directly from me.\nIf you're serious about real-time VFX and want to take your work to the next level, this course will expand both your skillset and your toolset.\nDon't forget to rate the course and share it with fellow artists.

      "description": "Nomad Sculpt: Solid Foundations — the friendliest way to go from “totally bewildered” to “I can actually sculpt this.”\nIf 3D sculpting has ever made you feel lost, intimidated, or one crash away from giving up, you’re in the right place. This beginner-first course is designed to remove the panic, clear the jargon, and give you a calm, repeatable workflow you can trust. No gatekeeping. No “you should already know this.” Just you, and a clear path from blob to believable forms.\nI’m an experienced video instructor with 35+ years as an illustrator/designer. I already have top-rated Procreate courses on the iPad, and I’ve taught thousands of creatives who swore they “weren’t 3D people.” Spoiler: they were. If you’ve ever enjoyed painting or sketching in Procreate, you already have the instincts for Nomad Sculpt- and that’s what this course is: a gentle, structured start that builds genuine confidence.\nWhat makes this course different?\nWorkflow based, not just explaining tools. You won’t be dumped into a sea of buttons. We’ll establish simple, dependable workflows  that you can use for everything you make.\nLearn by building, not just watching. Instead of tool lectures, you’ll create beginner friendly models step-by-step that turn concepts into muscle memory.\nBeginner-safe pacing. We start with the four tools you’ll use most (Clay, Move, Flatten, Crease), plus Smooth, symmetry basics, and navigation. As your confidence grows, we layer in more Nomad tools—always in service of the workflow, never as random features.\nA Mindset that actually helps. You’ll have permission to make a mess, restart without fear, and learn in small, satisfying chunks.\nBy the end, you’ll be able to:\nNavigate Nomad comfortably and set up a distraction-free interface\nBlock out strong shapes, refine clean planes, and add crisp stylized accents\nUnderstand what’s under the hood—vertices, edges, and quads—so tools finally “click”\nUse symmetry wisely (and break it when your model needs life)\nExport cleanly and know your next steps toward printing, painting, or game-ready workflows\nThis is for absolute beginners - artists who love creating in apps like Procreate but feel intimidated by 3D. If that’s you, you’ll feel seen, supported, and—most importantly—successful. We’ll keep projects fun and finishable so you stack wins quickly and build real momentum.\nYou’re not just buying videos; you’re getting a starter system you can reuse for heads, props, creatures—anything you imagine. Once the workflow is second nature, adding Nomad’s more advanced tools is simple (and surprisingly fun).\nAnd because I want this to feel completely safe to try, your purchase is covered by a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you don’t feel more capable and confident with Nomad after working through the lessons, you shouldn’t pay. Simple as that.\nReady to turn “that looks impossible!” into “that looks great! I did that...”?\n\nEnroll in Nomad Sculpt: Solid Foundations now and start sculpting, with a workflow you’ll use for years. I'll see you on the course!\nSimon",

We will be using primarily Substance Painter 2019 for most of the texturing however we will also use Mari for some very basic projection work.\n\nI'll go over the texturing of the armour/mouth from start to finish with me giving guidance every step of the way. I cover the skin texturing however it will not be real-time and as in depth as the armour. I use Mari for the skin as it is much better at projecting images. We will explore all the layers and channels I exported out for this character and give a complete breakdown of how I ended up with the final result.\n\nTexturing in VFX is slightly different to texturing in games. We tend to require much higher resolutions. This means that on a typical hero VFX model, it can often require hundreds of UDIMS. This can make texturing quite difficult, however In this tutorial I will show you how to manage heavy assets like this.\n\nAlthough this tutorial is aimed at VFX, everything I show is transferable to game asset texturing. What's important is the fundamental ideas behind texturing.\n\nEnjoy!",

      "description": "Note: The Speaker's voice is generated in AI Text to speech, Automatic subtitles are available.\nTopics: in this course we will study the new Tyflow Terrain dedicated to parametric terrain simulation, as well as other plugins and tools integrated into 3ds max for the realistic simulation of these models.\nThe course is structured in 4 Sections.\nSection 1: creation of terrains through the Terrain plugin dedicated to the analysis of DEM data a digital elevation model (also known as DEM, from the English Digital Elevation Model) is the representation of the distribution of the elevations of a territory, or another surface, in digital format. The digital elevation model is generally produced in raster format by associating each pixel with the attribute relating to the absolute elevation.\nSection 2: creation of terrains through the use of Heightmaps acquired from real terrestrial data and used with the use of displacement mapping, a technique used in 3D computer graphics for modeling objects. It does not use standard editing tools, but is based on the processing of grayscale images, the displacement intervenes directly on the geometry of the model, modifying it. Acting in the \"normal\" direction of the surface, the displacement map causes a positive shift of the points of the model corresponding to the light areas of the image, and a negative shift of those corresponding to the dark areas; the methods of generating materials through the use of Terrestrials will also be analyzed.\nSection 3: creation of terrains through the Compound Object Terrain of 3ds max dedicated to the analysis of topographic data extrapolated from Spline and imported into 3ds max for the generation of reliefs suitable for topographic representation.\nSection 4: creation of terrains through the new parametric operators of Terrain included in Tyflow, through this technique you will be able to modify any shape of terrain quickly; the parametric operators allow us to modify the shape as well as the related meteorological data of snow and rain; furthermore the section dedicated to very full-bodied materials can generate any representation data, whether fantasy or real through the use of bitmap shaders, gradients etc.\nOperators that we will use in the course: Birth Terrain, Object Terrain, Terrain Clear, Terrain Color, Terrain Display, Terrain Erosion, Terrain Filter, Terrain FX, Terrain Liquid, Terrain Mesh, Terrain Resample, Terrain Scatter, Terrain Slope, Terrain Tile, Terrain Warp, Terrain Copy Out, Terrain Transform, Export Terrain.\nThe compatible exercise files for 3ds max 2017_3dsmax 2020 and higher are available attached to the lessons.\n002_Terrain Installation\n044_New Terrain Presets",

      "description": "So, what are you going to learn in this course?\nWell, some Panda3D and Blender hacks. And in particular:\n1) How to create simple models in Blender and add materials to them.\nWe’ll be creating a UFO model in Blender with two materials that we can later export to Panda3D.\n\n\n2) How to bake textures from materials in Blender so that we can later use them in other software, and in particular in Panda3D.\nOur UFO model needs to be textured in order to be exported to Panda3D and look as expected there, so we’re going to learn how to use the materials that we have to bake textures.\n\n\n3) How to export a model from Blender in GLTF format and then load it in Panda3D.\nGLTF is a widely used file format and you can use it in Panda3D instead of its native EGG. We’ll be talking about the available export options and we’ll export the UFO model to GLTF.\n\n\n4) How to use position, rotation and scale intervals in Panda3D to create an animation.\nWe’ll animate our UFO model using intervals. This is a tool in Panda3D that comes in handy when you don’t need control over an object for some time but want it to move, rotate and scale in a predefined way.\n\n\n5) How to capture the screen in Panda3D and create a video in MP4 format.\nWe used intervals to animate our UFO model, but now we can render a video with that animation.\n\n\n6) How to integrate the Kivy framework in your Panda3D application using the panda3d-kivy add-on.\nAlthough Panda3D ships with its own GUI system, you’re not limited to it. If you know the Kivy framework, you can use it inside your Panda3D app window to create even more fancy GUIs.\n\n\n7) How to make a scientific simulation of gravitational acceleration in Panda3D using the Bullet physics engine.\nPanda3D is not only about games. You can use it for many other purposes like, for example, scientific simulations. We’re going to create a simple simulation of gravitational acceleration here.",

We are going to slay the program Maya from Autodesk and learn how to rig a character with a pipeline that’s tailored for VFX, animated films and games. I'm going to teach you my learnings from working in the industry for over a decade, on animated films, AAA games, and indie games, working on projects such as Vampires: The Masquerade, Men in Black, Disney's Frozen, and many more. We are starting from the very beginning with the basics of rigging. I love creating content like this, and I'm very engaged in sharing my knowledge with newer generations of computer graphic artists.\nWe will do this in the absolute simplest and easiest way, so that everybody has a chance to learn it. I make my courses easy to digest with a passion for teaching at a very affordable price. You don't need prior experience with Maya or scripting. It's good to have a basic understanding of Maya, but not needed.\nWe will start by evaluating the mesh and making sure everything is proper for rigging. Then, we are going to create a skeleton for our character. Next, we will set up controllers to animate the spine, arms, legs, and head. In the end, we are going to look into binding our mesh to the skeleton, so the mesh moves with our animation. Finally, we will wrap it up by cleaning the scene. Along the way, we will dabble a bit with scripting, but it will be super easy, so don't worry.\nThere is also bonus content in the course for more advanced people who wish to delve a bit deeper. We will look into how to set up an FK & IK switch, we are going to do a reverse foot setup as well, add twist bones for limbs, and I might add more on a request basis.",

This pipeline allows to speed up production process as well as to create any ideas for your characters. It also allows to check your ideas at an early production stage, so you won’t waste your time, fix the character quickly where/if needed and achieve great result at the end. Also one of the most important bits, this pipeline allows to create 3D characters even with the base knowledge of 3D software, because it is based on assets creation and their combination in one character, which works greatly for character concept artists.\nKnowledge you gained in this course can be used in scenes, environment creation, etc. Because the course contains lots of information on modelling, lighting, materials creation and rendering.",

      "description": "In this course, you will learn specific strategies for generating numerous architectural massings with ease.\n\n\nYou will achieve this new knowledge by creating massings and concepts for a staggered building, mimicking the typical design ideation process that most professionals and students utilise for early stages of projects.\n\n\nThe goal of this course is to equip you with a series of workflow strategies that enable you to ideate and bring more of your ideas out more quickly and effectively.\n\n\nLearn from a seasoned Architect!\nOver the years working as an architect, and later as a project designer in distinguished firms in London, I have perfected utilising Blender for Architecture, ranging in scale from small pavilions, to buildings, and to whole masterplans. Why did I create this course? When I had a team to manage, I had to teach them Blender one on one, on the job, and I had to work overtime to then do my job! I thought, why not start creating courses with everything I've learned and share them with my co-workers, and perhaps also with other interested students. Then I found out that I love teaching and now I am on a mission to show as many architects and designers the wonders that Blender can do for realising their designs.\n\n\nThis course came as an idea for applying procedural design strategies while I've worked in the office. Often, in the early conceptual phases of a project, architects and designers need to produce numerous iterations, FAST, and still be at a decent level of detail that shows the necessary scale. I am experienced with Grasshopper, but found out that it was taking way too long to produce parametric design, only for the whole design strategy to change and start from the beginning! Yikes! Or the other alternative, explicit modeling in either Rhino, Sketchup, or others was also time consuming, as any little change could result in hours upon hours of remodeling.\n\n\nSo, with its easy-to-use parametric capabilities and extensive modeling toolset, Blender is perfect for this, as once you get your way around, it has many workflows that are straightforward and can be combined together non-destructively.\n\n\nPart 1 - Massings\n\n\nYou will learn how to create quick massings both non-destructively and destructively in edit-mode. You will learn multiple procedural workflows that allow instant adjustments of massings without having to manually redo work. These workflows will empower you to quickly and easily adopt and modify massings, replicating the typical contextual, programmatic, team, or client-based adjustments that drive the design evolution.\n\nThe procedural workflows encompass techniques utilising multiple modifiers, including Geometry Nodes. The edit-mode workflows teach you how to modify your geometry based on topological adjustments like understanding where it insert loop cuts, splits, connecting vertices, and others.\n\nThroughout the course, most of the emphasis is placed towards procedural workflows. Yet, it is equally as important to have prime knowledge of modifying topology of any given massing that is sometimes essential for further development.\n\nPart 2 - Architectural concepts\n\n\nAfter you learn the techniques for creating quick architectural massings, we will investigate turning some of the massings into a more developed architectural concepts, portraying a sense of scale and proportion. Will still part in early ideation phase, these architectural concepts will provide snapshots to understand and communicate whether the project is evolving in the desired direction, without needing to resolving all the project parameters.\n\n\nIn this phase, we first will look at modifying a massing to create topological continuity. This is both easier in some respects and more difficult. It is easier because sometimes to process of modifying geometry directly is more straightforward. Yet, in the initial highly iterative design process, where numerous massings need to be generated quickly, manually adjusting the topology for multiple options becomes a time consuming and repetitive process.\n\nThus, second, we will investigate procedural techniques of generating architectural concepts from the earlier sets of massings. The intent is to provide you with highly creative workflows by reducing the manual process of editing the massings to a minimum. In this step-by-step process, the techniques become more advanced where, eventually you will learn how to further streamline the process with Geometry Nodes into an almost completely automated massing and architectural concept generation process.\n\n\nThroughout the course, we will be utilising the Tissue addon to tessellate panel components onto the massings. This step is a further optimisation process that helps reduce the time you need to spend on creating options so you can get to the right one quickly and efficiently.\n\n\nPart 3 - Presentation\n\nPresenting work is as important as generating the work. Hence, why we believe it is as essential to provide knowledge for you that teaches you how to present concepts effectively. This includes creating hidden-line type renderings, isometric cameras, and laying your models in a manners that showcases your design process thinking to the stakeholders (clients, managers, professors).\n\nWhat you get\n\nTo help you learn more optimally and progressively, the course includes assignments that allow you to practice with your own ideas beyond the material presented. The best work that is submitted will be showcased throughout this course and on social media with credits.\n\nFurthermore, you will gain access to an exclusive community of other students like you where you can ask questions and showcase your work. Additionally, you can comment directly on each lesson and you will have access to email support\n\nThe course includes automatically generated subtitles which can be searched in the video player. This his highly useful when you like to go back and find a reference for something you remember watching initially.\n\nThis course also includes live sessions where you can ask your questions directly to the instructor. The live sessions will be recorded and uploaded to the course curriculum so even if you missed a live session, you would be able to recap and learn from other students' questions.\nBy the end of this course you will :\n\nReduce the time you spend on creating massings in the earliest ideation phases of design List item two\nEnable more creative output of your ideas by learning how to work more effectively with Blender's inherent procedural workflows List item four\nProduce your designs more efficiently with Geometry Nodes and the Tissue addon.\nCompellingly record and present your design processes.",

Built from the ground up for Blender 4, this course teaches you the core skills and concepts often skipped or rushed in other training — giving you a clear, solid base to build on.\nYou won’t be diving deep into every tiny feature or buried in menus. Instead, we’ll focus on big-picture workflows, good habits, and practical understanding. You'll learn box modelling, a fast and intuitive method for shaping models, with only light use of edit mode where it’s absolutely needed.\nThis is not just a \"press-this-button\" tutorial. It’s a course about why things work the way they do, and how to use Blender with purpose from day one.\nWhat You’ll Learn\nSection 1: Setting Up Blender\nIs your computer ready for Blender 4?\nStep-by-step installation for Windows, Mac, and Linux\nBlender preferences explained clearly\nHow to revert Blender if things go wrong\nSection 2: Getting Help\nLearn to navigate the Blender Manual properly\nUse our “Save Points” system to backtrack easily if things go wrong\nGet help the right way — and ask better questions\nShift from passive watching to active learning\nSection 3: A Look Around Blender\nUnderstand Blender’s interface and workspaces\nUse multi-monitor setups, screencast keys, and shortcuts efficiently\nSet up a clean, reliable default startup file\nSection 4: Box Modelling in Blender\nFocus on object-level modelling: transforms, snapping, duplication, collections, and more\nUse modifiers (Array, Bevel, Mirror, Boolean) instead of jumping deep into edit mode\nCreate fun beginner-friendly projects: barrels, rockets, staircases, mechs, and more\nBuild scenes fast and clean with a big-picture mindset\nSection 5: Basic Materials\nLearn about PBR materials and how to apply colour without overcomplicating it\nUse the Shading workspace effectively\nA sneak peek at textures without diving into complexity\nSection 6: Lighting and Camera\nUnderstand basic and environmental lighting setups\nLearn how cameras work — focal length, perspective, and safe zones\nSet the stage for polished, clean renders\nSection 7: Rendering\nWhat is rendering, and why does it matter?\nLearn to render with Eevee, Cycles, and Workbench\nSet up output settings for sharing your work\nTackle real-world challenges to solidify your skills\nWhy This Course Stands Out\nTrue beginner focus – no experience needed\nBlender 4-first – everything tailored to the latest version\nProject-driven – learn by doing, not just watching\nMinimal edit mode – you’ll learn to model with confidence using object-level tools\nStrong fundamentals – we cover what others gloss over: naming, organisation, viewport control, and proper workflow habits\nChallenges included – fun, clear projects that help you practice what you’ve learned\nMeet Your Instructor\nMike Bridges has been teaching Blender professionally since 2014 and has trained tens of thousands of students through Canopy Games and YouTube. Known for his clear explanations and structured teaching, Mike specialises in helping beginners build a strong foundation and understand the why, not just the how.\nStart Creating Today\nIf you’re ready to break into 3D with clarity, confidence, and guidance that puts you first — this is your course!\nNo pressure. No confusion. Just the right tools at the right time.\nJoin Blender 4 Foundations today and take your first real step into 3D.",

Please note that this course was putted together by merging different classes which were recorded in different times.\nWhile this is a introduction course we made sure you will also learn character sculpting from a Sphere blocking out the  skeleton, go through the main superficial muscles that after the skin than we add our skin surface on top.\nLearn anatomy sculpting in ZBrushCore 2021 with this course and improve your character sculpting skills, Anatomy being the most crucial for a character or creature artist but it is the most ignored topic in the industry. We teach and always press this that anatomy is surely the foundation for every character/creature artist or animator etc.\nMany students get discouraged when it comes to studying anatomy because we are all drawn to all the fine details and realistic renders, I must confess i was also like that when i begun. I was so ignorant of the anatomy for such a long time until i got stuck in this hole where i finally didn't know what was wrong with my art and i couldn't solve it, only to find my primary and secondary forms where not in place(which is anatomy).\nWe will cover the entire ZBrushCore UI/Menus\nAll major Shortcuts\nAnd functions\nStart Our Sculpt from a Sphere\nBlock out Basic bony land marks that are important\nGo through our superficial muscles that are important and affect the skin\nAfter muscles we will add our skin layer on top\nThan lastly we will cover proportions\nProject ZBrush files will be provided for each lecture sections so everyone can follow along(Personal use only)\nAnd for any questions or further assistance i will be surely available to assist where i possibly can. So i hope you ready because I am, open up ZBrush or ZBrushCore and lets start sculpting.",

      "description": "Welcome to Realistic 3D Creature Creation! This course is designed to give intermediate artists the knowledge & guidance to create a stunning portfolio piece. I have spent months packing as much value as possible into this course so you can waste no time learning the in-depth process.\n\nI believe that a community is a HUGE part of growth as an artist. I’ve personally seen the most growth as an artist once I began joining and interacting in artist communities, so I want to provide that to anyone taking this course through a Discord Server.\n\n\nWHAT YOU GET:\n- 70+ HD Video Lessons that walk you through the entire process of creating our character\n- 15 hours of Video Lessons\n- Lifetime access to the Artist Growth Discord server (link in resources PDF upon purchase)\n- Resources (Reference files, Textures, Images, & The Resources PDF which also includes extra recommended video & resource links)\n\n\nYOU'LL LEARN:\n- How to Create a realistic character from scratch\n- A good understanding of the muscle and bone structure of the body\n- Sculpt realistic skin forms, wrinkles, & folds\n- Texture & render realistic skin\n- Create a full hair groom with Blender's hair system\n- Render out a full character for a stunning portfolio piece\n\n\nFAQs:\nDo I need to purchase any external products?\nThe FlippedNormals Face Kit, Skin Kit, and Eye Kit are highly recommended. Although any other pore alphas can be used for the skin detailing. However, I do not cover how to create the eyes from scratch. The eyes are completely from the FlippedNormals Eye kit.\n\nWe also use some free external resources such as HDRI Haven & CC0 Textures (these resources are provided in the course).\nDo I need Zbrush?\nWhile it is possible to do all the sculpting with another software like Blender or Mudbox, however, Zbrush is recommended for artists who want to fully maximize their results. Also if you’re a student interested in Zbrush, I recommend getting a Zbrush student license.\nIs this a beginner course?\nThis course is NOT meant for complete beginners. I created this course for artists who are closer to an intermediate or advanced level. I do not teach the basics of the software, rather I focus on teaching technique fundamentals. So I recommend having at least a year of experience under your belt.\nHow long will I have access to the course?\nFOREVER! You will have lifetime access to Realistic 3D Creature Creation and all it's resources upon purchasing.\n\n\nCredit: HDRI Haven, CC0 Textures, Pexels\nSpecial Thanks to Noggi & Aryan for their YT resources\nArtist Credit (Music): Keys of the Moon, MaxKo Music, Alex-Productions, Scott Buckley",

The power of Character Animator is the synchronization of movements in real time. Thanks to the webcam, the software records your face movements in real time to adapt them to the puppet. It is therefore possible to make recordings of face movements on the puppet in real time. Character Animator doesn't stop there, it is possible to animate a whole puppet with all parts of the body, to make movements of arms, legs and more. It is also possible to add behaviors that improve the animations.\nPuppet\nThe basis for successful animation in Character Animator is in the distribution of layers during the creation of the puppet. Indeed, the layers must follow a logic to then optimize the animation in Character Animator. It is possible to create your puppet with Photoshop and Illustrator. In the course, we will use Illustrator to create a robot puppet and a character puppet.\nTraining video\nIn this training you will learn how to animate puppets step by step. It is best to have Illustrator to take the course, as a robot puppet and a character puppet will be made to fully understand layer management. Then, we will use these puppets in Character Animator to arrive at a structured animation step by step. To do this, we will start by positioning the different tags, by adding behaviors and more. We will see how to record with the camera, but also by using the triggers. At the end of the training, you will be able to create a puppet, to use it in Character Animator until making recordings for your projects.",

      "description": "Mastering CLO 3D through this course is one of the smartest moves you can make as a fashion or digital design professional, because it equips you with the ability to draft, simulate, and render garments entirely in 3D and to do so with industry-grade precision and speed. You’ll save weeks of time and hundreds of resources by visualizing fit, fabric behavior, trims, and silhouette instantly, instead of going through multiple physical samples. CLO 3D lets you iterate designs, test drape, and preview textures in real time, eliminating costly communication errors and ensuring your vision translates faithfully to production-ready patterns and visuals. The software powers collaboration across teams every team member works from the same digital prototypes, so making changes or sharing feedback is seamless and efficient. This course walks you through everything: from navigating the dual 2D/3D workspace; to importing or drafting patterns; sewing garments and adjusting fit; assigning realistic materials; and exporting photorealistic renders, animations, and tech‑ready files for a polished portfolio. As sustainability becomes urgent, learning CLO 3D lets you design with minimal fabric waste and carbon footprint virtual sampling replaces physical prototyping without sacrificing creativity or precision. For independent designers and freelancers, CLO skills are already in demand: many professionals report winning new clients and charging higher rates thanks to proficiency in CLO, and some say that freelance opportunities expanded significantly after learning it. As one experienced user put it, “I’ve been able to get a steady stream of clients after learning Clo3D,” and another praised its time and cost saving potential, noting it “cuts on cost of sample, lead time, and allows designers to experiment without losing too much valuable time, money and manpower.” With this course’s structured, project-driven approach, you won’t just learn software—you’ll develop tangible, industry-aligned skills, build a standout portfolio, and join the next wave of digital fashion innovators. Ready to make the leap into virtual garment design? This CLO 3D course is your launchpad.",

I have a preference for finishing my character up to 70% before starting to retopologize it.\nWe use Maya to Retopologize the character and I will teach you how to come up with a clean topology ready for rigging and animation.\n\nThen we jump back to Zbrush to bake our details back onto our model. For this particular character we must add a visible thickness and also keep the model at lower subdivsion. I will show you how to do that as well.\n\nTexturing is really fun! To keep this project as simple as possible we use Zbrush Polypainting to add amazing colors to our character and help breath life into it.\n\nWe finish this chapter by exporting the needed maps from Zbrush.

We begin by covering the fundamentals of sketching, where you'll learn the differences between fully defined and undefined sketches. Understanding how to properly define sketches is crucial to ensuring the stability and accuracy of your designs, which will be emphasized throughout the course.\nYou'll then dive into 3D modeling commands, with in-depth explanations on when, how, and where to use specific tools like Extrude, Revolve, and Sweep to create complex geometries. We’ll also explore assembly modeling, where you’ll learn how to assemble multiple parts, ensuring they interact correctly.\nThis course not only explains how to use SolidWorks commands but also covers why issues may arise during modeling, such as sketch errors or constraint conflicts, and how to fix them. You'll understand the best practices for avoiding these problems altogether.\nAdditionally, the course is packed with plenty of hands-on exercises, giving you the opportunity to apply what you’ve learned through real-world examples. By the end, you'll be fully equipped to confidently sketch, model, and assemble 3D designs in SolidWorks.\n\nThis course is not fully complete as it will get a lot of updates base on your feedbacks.",

The famous Smart Extrude gadget brought in 3ds Max 2021.2 receives new [Shift]-drag operations to mechanically sew extruded geometry to any a part of a mesh it touches, and to reduce via the mesh entirely. Several of the important thing modifiers have additionally been updated, with the Slice modifier getting a Radial slice option. Holes created with the aid of using slice operations also can now be capped mechanically.\nThe Symmetry modifier adds support for numerous symmetry planes in a single operation, as well as the ability to replicate and repeat geometry around the gizmo's centre point.\n\n\nThe Relax modifier now has a new Maintain Volume option to help preserve the original shape when removing tiny surface detail — for example, to clean up raw 3D scan data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Extrude Modifier's interactive performance has been enhanced by \"up to 100x,\" while AutoSmooth's performance has been \"substantially\" improved.\n\n\nV-Ray® for 3ds Max is a rendering programme that has been used in the real world. It is the go-to option for artists and designers across the 3D industries because of its adaptability and ability to handle any style of project — from enormous, dynamic scenes with thousands of lights to an exquisite still life.",

The techniques used in this course are suitable for small to medium studios. The software used are :Zbrush to create the model , Maya for Rigging and Animation while I used 3DS Max for VFX and rendering.\nEach chapter can be watched separately. so you can jump between chapters at your ease.\n\nChapter 02: Environment Kitbaching - Implementing the animated characters in 3DS Max\n\nKnowing that every project has a deadline, It is impossible to model every object yourself especially for such a huge project. To surpass this problem we rely on kitbashing using free models from the internet.\nWe use kitbaching to create a suitable environment for our main character and you are free to come up with your own environment that suits your scene. For our scene is kinda \"bittersweet\" so we go for a nighty forest with some grass, rocks & some insects...\n\nTyFlow was used to simulate the background swarm of insects and also to simulate the cloud of bats. Several techniques were tested to achieve a satisfying (stylish-realistic) behavior for the animated insects / bats.\nConcerning the butterfly & the crawling insects we had to manually integrate them into the scene. Various techniques were used to achieve that.\n\nYou will learn very valuable techniques that can be used widely and you will be comfortable animating any swarm of “sth” and integrate different type of insects for your future scenes.",
