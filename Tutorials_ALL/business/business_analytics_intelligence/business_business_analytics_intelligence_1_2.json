      "description": "Automating business processes using techniques such as RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is a skill highly in demand in today's workforce. Businesses are seeking new and innovative ways to improve their operational performance, save money, reduce time wasted and produce better quality products and services, all quicker and more efficiently. They want to reduce the occurrence of errors and issues, defects and problems. Automating their processes can help with all of that.\nIn this course, we are going to explore the following:\n- How to identify and define a process as \"ripe\" and ready for automation, looking through the techniques to determine this.\n- How to plan for an automation project of this kind (process automation).\n- How to build out the most important document in process automation, the PDD (Process Definition Document).\n- What automation is, the different types you may see and how process automation fits in here.\n- A practical example of a real life automation, defined, explored and deployed within an organization.\nThe course focuses on a good mix of the practical and the theoretical. The aim is for you to leave the course confident to be able to identify a process in need of automation, and the steps you need to take post this to deploy the change. We will cover off what work you need to do internally (process mapping, project management activities) and the work the developers will be taking on (production, test scenarios etc.)\nIt is worth noting this course is NOT about giving you technical skills to actually build the automation itself. This course is going to upskill you in how to run a process automation project, how to identify and prioritize those processes ripe for automation and how to conduct the many activities internally (such as planning, mapping, workshops etc.) to get the automation over the line. These skills (outside of the technical) are really important - having someone coordinate, plan and delivering all of the work required.",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nExcel is the most often used first-choice tool of every business analyst and consultant. Maybe it is not the fanciest or most sophisticated one,  yet it is universally understood by everybody especially your boss and your customers.\nExcel is still a pretty advanced tool with countless features and functions. I have mastered quite a lot of them during my studies and while working. After some time in consulting, I discovered that most of them are not that useful; some of them bring more problems than solutions. On top of that, there are features that we are taught at university that are not flexible and pretty time-consuming.  While working as a business analyst I developed my own set of tricks to deal with Excel  I learned how to make my analyses idiot-proven and extremely universal.\nI will NOT teach you the entire Excel as it is simply not efficient (and frankly you don’t need it). This course is organized around the 80/20 rule and I want to teach you the most useful (from a business analyst/consultant perspective) formulas as fast as possible. I want you also to acquire thanks to the course good habits in Excel that will save you loads of time.\nIf done properly, this course will transform you in 1 day into a pretty good business analyst that knows how to use Excel in a smart way.\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated in a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 300 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach step by step on the basis of Excel files that will be attached to the course. To make the best out of the course you should follow my steps and repeat what I do with the data after every lecture. Don’t move to the next lecture if you have not done what I show in the lecture that you have gone through.\nI assume that you know basic Excel so the basic features (i.e. how to write formulas in Excel) are not explained in this course. I concentrate on intermediate and advanced solutions and purposefully get rid of some things that are advanced yet later become very inflexible and useless (i.e. naming the variables). In the end, I will show 4 full-blown analyses in Excel that use the tricks that I show in the lectures.\nTo every lecture, you will find attached  (in additional resources) the Excel shown in the Lecture so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nI have done a number of courses showing you how to analyze data in Excel. Yet, I have noticed that some students lack fluency in operations in Excel. This course is designed to fill in the gap and help you fully appreciate my other courses for business analysts and consultants. It can be used also as a standalone course that will help you to be smart in Excel\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you do the analyses as well as the quality of the conclusions coming out of available in your company data. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience, and other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to use Excel in a smart way to be able to analyze data fast and efficiently\nHow to draw conclusions from analyses – chosen examples of analyses\nHow to be efficient in your work as an analyst?\nHow to build Excel files that are understandable for you and your team, even after some time\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro to the course\nHow to merge data from different sources. Quite often as an analyst, you will have to combine data from different sources. In this section, I will show you how to do it using the VLOOKUP function and others to make sure that you can easily combine data from different tables into the desired analysis. You will also see how to use HLOOKUP, MATCH, SUMIFS, and INDEX functions.\nCleaning and unifying data.  50% of your time will be lost on setting the data right so it can be used for analyses. In this section, you will      learn how to clean and unify data fast\nHow to use the IF function and what you can do instead? Most of the analyses require you to make them dependable on something. For this, you can use the IF function which gets messy with more complicated formulas. I will show you how to avoid the mess and in most cases not use the IF function\nPivot Tables. As a business analyst, you will have to look at data on different levels. I will show you how to do it with Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts, and what to do instead.\nOther useful functions. In this section, I will show you other useful functions that you should master\nExample of analysis. Here we show a full analysis from start to end including drawing conclusions. This will show you want should be the end result\nTools for analyzing data. On top of the Excel functions, you have available other tools in Excel that we will discuss in the section. Most of them save you a lot of trouble in analyzing data\nBeing faster with Excel. If you spend 6-8 hours a day with Excel you have to be fast and not to waste your valuable time. Here I will show you  how to do it\nVisual Basic – the main things you should know. Sometimes it is much easier to do something in Visual Basic than go via typical Excel formulas. In some cases, Visual Basics create new opportunities. Here I will show you the most useful elements of Visual Basic.\nEssential  Excel shortcuts. In this section, we will discuss the essential shortcuts that will help you do the analyses much faster.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nYou will master the most crucial functions and features of Excel\nUnderstand the main challenges in analyzing data in Excel\nPerform the analyses in a very effective manner\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nBusiness analysts\nResearchers\nControllers\nConsultants\nSmall and medium business owners\nStartups founders\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

For example, you will learn how to develop a predictive model.\n\n\nIf you are using SAS Enterprise Guide and want to learn how to code/program instead of using the point-and-click interface, this course is ideal! The course also introduces SAS model building.\n\n\nThe first part of the course utilizes the Data step, the 2nd part looks at SAS SQL, and the third part looks at Macro Programming/Programs.\n\n\nAdditionally, I have added a section on SAS Predictive Modeling using Logistic Regression. Here, we will build a predictive model (also known as Predictive Analytics)\n\n\nThe course is for beginners and builds to an intermediate level. It is comprehensive and covers some advanced topics. This also allows students with prior experience to benefit from the course. Furthermore, since you get the LIFE course, you can use it as a resource anytime.\n\n\nSAS programming continues to be the language of choice for most enterprises/corporations. In 2018, 92% of Fortune 100 companies utilized SAS. It is the go-to for many industries, including banking/finance, insurance, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and automotive.\n\n\nMy SAS training course was also developed to help you become a certified SAS Specialist: Base Programming Certified. I have received numerous private messages from students who have passed the SAS Base exam, work-related exams, or interviews because of this course. I love hearing this!\n\n\nThe lessons in this course are meant to be taken in order, as each lesson builds upon knowledge, and may mention some crucial ideas/concepts. If you skip videos, it may appear that some aspects are not being explained. For example, if you skip the import.txt lecture because you only care about importing .csv files, you may miss explanations about specific lines of code.\n\n\nNevertheless, you will learn a lot!\n\n\nSo, whether you want to start a career/gain employment, or move up at your current company, this course can help you with school projects and prepare you for a career after you complete your education.\n\n\nLearning SAS programming means you can accomplish the same goal with any software supporting the SAS language.\n\n\nFinally, you have nothing to lose. No risk! You get a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\n\nEnroll now! Your future looks brighter with SAS training.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\n\nWe are not in any way affiliated or associated with the SAS Institute.

      "description": "As a data analyst, you are on a journey. Think about all the data that is being generated each day and that is available in an organization, from transactional data in a traditional database, telemetry data from services that you use, to signals that you get from different areas like social media.\nFor example, today's retail businesses collect and store massive amounts of data that track the items you browsed and purchased, the pages you've visited on their site, the aisles you purchase products from, your spending habits, and much more.\nWith data and information as the most strategic asset of a business, the underlying challenge that organizations have today is understanding and using their data to positively effect change within the business. Businesses continue to struggle to use their data in a meaningful and productive way, which impacts their ability to act.\nThe key to unlocking this data is being able to tell a story with it. In today's highly competitive and fast-paced business world, crafting reports that tell that story is what helps business leaders take action on the data. Business decision makers depend on an accurate story to drive better business decisions. The faster a business can make precise decisions, the more competitive they will be and the better advantage they will have. Without the story, it is difficult to understand what the data is trying to tell you.\nHowever, having data alone is not enough. You need to be able to act on the data to effect change within the business. That action could involve reallocating resources within the business to accommodate a need, or it could be identifying a failing campaign and knowing when to change course. These situations are where telling a story with your data is important.\n\n\nPython is a popular programming language.\nIt is used for:\nweb development (server-side),\nsoftware development,\nmathematics,\nData Analysis\nData Visualization\nSystem scripting.\nPython can be used for data analysis and visualization.\nData analysis is the process of  analysing, interpreting, data to discover valuable insights that drive smarter and more effective business decisions.\nData analysis tools are used to extract useful information from business and other types of  data, and help make the data analysis process easier.\nData visualisation is the graphical representation of information and data.\nBy using visual elements like charts, graphs and maps, data visualisation tools\nprovide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers and patterns in data.\nThe Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modelling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\nPower BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\nPower BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:\nA Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.\nAn online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.\nPower BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.\nThese three elements—Power BI Desktop, the service, and the mobile apps—are designed to let you create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves you and your role most effectively.\nBeyond those three, Power BI also features two other elements:\nPower BI Report Builder, for creating paginated reports to share in the Power BI service. Read more about paginated reports later in this article.\nPower BI Report Server, an on-premises report server where you can publish your Power BI reports, after creating them in Power BI Desktop.\n\n\nTableau is a widely used business intelligence (BI) and analytics software trusted by companies like Amazon, Experian, and Unilever to explore, visualize, and securely share data in the form of Workbooks and Dashboards. With its user-friendly drag-and-drop functionality it can be used by everyone to quickly clean, analyze, and visualize your team’s data. You’ll learn how to navigate Tableau’s interface and connect and present data using easy-to-understand visualizations. By the end of this training, you’ll have the skills you need to confidently explore Tableau and build impactful data dashboards.",

      "description": "The unprecedented evolution and progress of technology in the recent past decades has led to the ease of capture and surge of storage capacity for data for everyone. With the saying that ‘data is the new oil’, we have witnessed organizations undergo transformation in their business models, new companies built on data platforms and the rise of various data products that has become part and parcel of our everyday life.\nIn light of all these head spinning developments there is one truth that needs to be remembered: data captured and stored but not processed is wasteful and useless. All the developments mentioned above became possible because data was made sense of- that is it was turned to information upon which insights were generated which were in turn used to drive better business-decision making, improve business operations or to craft new business strategies.\nThis course focuses on fundamental concepts and best practices for effective communication with data- something that sits between the crosshairs of science and art. It seeks to enable you to tell the story of your data and not just merely to show data. It is primarily designed for beginners in the field of business analytics or data science who quickly wants to learn how to effectively and efficiently communicate the insights they have discovered from a data exploratory analysis and be able to significantly contribute to the improvement or transformation of their respective organization.\nThe course is deliberately designed to be succinct and straight forward as it seeks to develop your data storytelling skill in the quickest way possible and get you up to speed. Thus, it is unencumbered and agnostic of any visualization platform or software. Though know how of a certain platform or software will be a big help in doing some of the exercises and case study, it is unnecessary for this course. If you are not familiar with a platform or software, you can revert to the traditional way of pen and paper. This is not to say visualization platform or software are unimportant. In fact, know how on it will greatly help with completing your data story presentation and becomes more critical as you deal with increasing volumes and size of data and in finishing your story presentation in a shorter time. What is vital to begin with however is that you learn the key principles of data storytelling. Learning a certain visualization software or platform can subsequently follow because being an expert of one does not automatically make you a good data communicator or storyteller. Technology does not know the story of your data, it is your job as the communicator and analyst to bring it out contextually and show it visually. This course intends to familiarize you the process to do so.\nTo achieve the goals mentioned, this course is composed of several lectures, in non-technical language, laced with actual examples so that the concepts can be easily understood and grasped. It is also interspersed with case study practices and exercises. The design is as such because we believe in the learning by doing educational approach and philosophy.",

This course is the first of several series and we are going to cover the key aspects of data governance and data stewardship, starting with definitions and moving on to a Data Governance Program Office framework/setup.\nWhen working with data, there are numerous challenges that need to be overcome, including the fact that Data does not explain itself and someone is needed to ensure that data is not just explained, but maintained. Someone must interpret the data, including what it means, how to use it correctly, and how to determine whether the data is of good quality or not.\nData is shared and used by many people for a variety of purposes. So, finding ownership and accountability for the data can be a challenge, in particular when the data is inaccurate.\nThis course will give you the needed knowledge regarding data, its importance, and how to manage it.\nTo ensure the best learning experience, each lesson is accompanied by a quiz to help ensure that the most important topics are really understood and learned.\nThis course series is open to students within all levels of knowledge of Data Governance, from total beginner to advanced. This particular course series is more of an introduction to the topic, but we believe that even for an advanced data practitioner, the course brings value. The subsequent series will touch more advanced topics which may be of more interest for advanced level data practitioners, but taking all the series will ensure no gaps in knowledge.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Power BI course by Uplatz.\n\n\nPower BI is a business intelligence platform provided by Microsoft that provides nontechnical business users with tools for aggregating, analysing, visualizing and sharing data. Power BI's user interface is fairly intuitive for users familiar with Excel and its deep integration with other Microsoft products makes it a very versatile self-service tool that requires little upfront training.\nIn essence, Power BI is the collective name for an assortment of cloud-based apps and services that help organizations collate, manage, and analyse data from a variety of sources, through a user-friendly interface.\nBusiness intelligence tools like Power BI can be used for a multitude of purposes. Primarily, Power BI pulls data together and processes it, turning it into intelligible insights, often using visually compelling and easy-to-process charts and graphs. This allows users to generate and share clear and useful snapshots of what’s happening in their business. Power BI connects to a range of data sources, from basic Excel spreadsheets to databases, and both cloud-based and on-premise apps.\nPower BI is something of an umbrella term and can refer to either a Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called Power BI Service, or mobile Power BI apps available on Windows phones and tablets, as well as for iOS and Android devices.\nPower BI is built on the foundation of Microsoft Excel, and as such, the learning curve from Excel to Power BI is not that steep; anyone who can use Excel can use Power BI, but the latter is far more powerful than its spreadsheet counterpart.\nUplatz provides this comprehensive Microsoft Power BI training with focus on teaching the fundamentals of Power BI starting from introduction and installation of Power BI to understanding Power BI Desktop in great detail to Data Modelling and Visualization.\nThis training is for anyone who wants to learn about self-service business intelligence with Power BI – regardless of technical or analytical background. You will be able to use all key features in order to effectively analyse your data, create interactive reports and share your findings throughout your organization.\nThis course will enable you to create visually rich, interactive reports and publish them to Power BI Online, where they can be shared anytime, anywhere. You will also explore Power BI Desktop's powerful data modelling tools.\n\n\nPower BI versions\nA free version of Power BI is intended for small to midsize business owners; a professional version called Power BI Plus is available for a monthly subscription fee. Users can download an application for Windows 10, called Power BI Desktop, and native mobile apps for Windows, Android and iOS devices. There is also Power BI Report Server for companies that must maintain their data and reports on premises. That version of Power BI requires a special version of the desktop app -- aptly called Power BI Desktop for Power BI Report Server.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nRapidly analyse, transform and present data\nUnderstand the Power BI platform\nSet up queries to extract and transform data\nCreate efficient data models\nDesign and publish interactive reports\nConfidently use DAX calculations\n\n\nMicrosoft Power BI - course curriculum\n\n\nIntroduction to Power BI\nWhat is Power BI?\nThe Power BI service\nPower BI Report Server\nPower BI Desktop\nReports and Dashboards\nDatasets\nRow-Level Security\nContent Packs\nNatural Language Queries\nPower BI Desktop\nWhat is Power BI Desktop\nInstallation Process of Desktop Power BI\nUsing Power BI Desktop\nPractical Scenarios\nData Sources\nConnecting to Files\nImporting Excel Files\nPublishing to Power BI from Excel\nUpdating Files in Power BI\nData Refresh\nThe Power BI Data Model\nManaging Data Relationships\nOptimising the Model for Reporting\nHierarchies\nSQL Servers\nOther Data Sources\nR Script Data Connector\nConfiguring Data for Q&A\nCreating Content Packs\nCreating a Group\nShaping and Combining Data\nThe Query Editor\nApplied Steps\nAdvanced Editor\nShaping Data\nFormatting Data\nTransforming Data\nCombining Data\nMerging Data\nModelling and Loading Data\nWhat are the Relationships?\nViewing Relationships\nCreating Relationships\nStar Schema\nMerge Queries and Join Kind\nData Model Structure\nRelationship View\nCardinality\nCross Filter Direction\nActive Properties\nWhat is DAX?\nSyntax\nFunctions\nContext\nCalculated Columns\nCalculated Tables\nMeasures\nInteractive Data Visualization\nPower BI Reports: Page Layout and Formatting\nM Language and DAX Language\nMultiple Visualisations\nCreating Charts\nUsing Geographic Data\nHistograms\nPower BI Admin Portal\nService Settings\nDesktop Settings\nDashboard and Report Settings\n\n\nWhat does Power BI do?\nMicrosoft Power BI is used to run reports and surface insights based on a company’s data. Power BI can connect to a wide range of data sets, and cleans & organizes the info it’s fed so that it can be better digested and understood. The reports and visuals generated from this data can then be shared with other users.\nPower BI helps users see not only what’s happened in the past and what’s happening in the present, but also what might happen in the future. Power BI is infused with machine learning capabilities, meaning it can spot patterns in data and use those patterns to make informed predictions and run “what if” scenarios. These estimates allow users to generate forecasts, and prepare themselves to meet future demand and other key metrics.\n\n\nCommon uses of Power BI\nMicrosoft Power BI is used to find insights within an organization's data. Power BI can help connect disparate data sets, transform and clean the data into a data model and create charts or graphs to provide visuals of the data. All of this can be shared with other Power BI users within the organization.\nThe data models created from Power BI can be used in several ways for organizations, including telling stories through charts and data visualizations and examining \"what if\" scenarios within the data. Power BI reports can also answer questions in real time and help with forecasting to make sure departments meet business metrics.\nPower BI can also provide executive dashboards for administrators or managers, giving management more insight into how departments are doing.\n\n\nKey features of Power BI\nMicrosoft has added a number of data analytics features to Power BI since its inception, and continues to do so. Some of the most important features include:\nArtificial Intelligence -- Users can access image recognition and text analytics in Power BI, create machine learning models using automated machine learning capabilities and integrate with Azure Machine Learning.\nHybrid deployment support -- This feature provides built-in connectors that allow Power BI tools to connect with a number of different data sources from Microsoft, Salesforce and other vendors.\nQuick Insights -- This feature allows users to create subsets of data and automatically apply analytics to that information.\nCommon data model support -- Power BI's support for the common data model allows the use of a standardized and extensible collection of data schemas (entities, attributes and relationships).\nCortana integration -- This feature, which is especially popular on mobile devices, allows users to verbally query data using natural language and access results, using Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant.\nCustomization -- This feature allows developers to change the appearance of default visualization and reporting tools and import new tools into the platform.\nAPIs for integration -- This feature provides developers with sample code and application performance interfaces (APIs) for embedding the Power BI dashboard in other software products.\nSelf-service data prep -- Using Power Query, business analysts can ingest, transform, integrate and enrich big data into the Power BI web service. Ingested data can be shared across multiple Power BI models, reports and dashboards.\nModeling view -- This allows users to divide complex data models by subject area into separate diagrams, multiselect objects and set common properties, view and modify properties in the properties pane, and set display folders for simpler consumption of complex data models.\n\n\nPower BI Components\nPower BI consists of a collection of apps and can be used either on desktop, as a SaaS product or on a mobile device. Power BI Desktop is the on-premises version, Power BI Service is the cloud-based offering and mobile Power BI runs on mobile devices.\nThe different components of Power BI are meant to let users create and share business insights in a way that fits with their role.\nIncluded within Power BI are several components that help users create and share data reports.\nPower Query: a data mashup and transformation tool\nPower Pivot: a memory tabular data modeling tool\nPower View: a data visualization tool\nPower Map: a 3D geospatial data visualization tool\nPower Q&A: A natural language question and answering engine\nAdditionally, there are dozens of data sources that connect into Power BI, ranging from files (Excel, PDF, SharePoint Folder, XML), databases (SQL Server Database, Oracle Database, IBM databases, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery), other Power BI data sets, Azure data connections and many online services (Dynamics 365, Salesforce Reports, Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Facebook and others).\n\n\nWhy do Businesses use Power BI\nFor businesses who want more reporting power and analytical muscle than that offered by Excel, Power BI is the next level in business intelligence. With Power BI, businesses can assemble, scrutinize, and visualize data from across the company, giving them greater insight into their operations and performance, and allowing them to make more informed decisions based on real data. Benefits of using Power BI include:\nBusinesses can input huge quantities of data into Power BI that many other platforms would struggle to process\nBuilt-in machine learning features can analyze data and help users spot valuable trends and make educated predictions\nInformation can be visualized using powerful templates to allow businesses to better make sense of their data\nPower BI is cloud-based, so users get cutting edge intelligence capabilities and powerful algorithms that are updated regularly\nPowerful personalization capabilities allow users to create dashboards so they can access the data they need quickly\nAlerts can be set up on KPIs to keep users up to date important metrics and measurements.\nPower BI has an intuitive interface that makes it far more user-friendly and easy to navigate then complex spreadsheets\nThe platform integrates with other popular business management tools like SharePoint, Office 365, and Dynamics 365, as well as other non-Microsoft products like Spark, Hadoop, Google Analytics, SAP, Salesforce, and MailChimp\nWith data security a massive talking point for modern businesses, Power BI ensures data is safe, offering granular controls on accessibility both internally and externally",

The emphasis is to teach only those SAS procedures what you need in your daily work. This allows you to use SAS Procedures immedialtely and apply them in your programs.\nIn addition, i created a lot of assignments for each  procedure. This will allow you to practice and to gain experience.\nAll the code programmed during the course can be downloaded. However, i reccomend and suggest you to write the code independently, so you can understand it in depth. Some of the SAS Procedures are statistical, and therefore, i will remind and explain you statistical tests and measures, their meaning and how conclusions can be drawn from the output.\nI divided the course into four sections. First section is Introduction. It includes lectures such as Installation and Familiarity with SAS University Edition, Introduction to SAS Procedures. In the second section i present you a variety of statistical procedures. Third section includes data manipulation sas procedures. And in the last section, we are going to talk about creation reports.\nAs you will noticed, some of SAS Procedures that associated with regressions or charts are not included in the course. I will create a separate course for each these topics.\nIf you have any questions about the material, suggestions or ideas how to improve the course, i would be very happy to hear them.

      "description": "Course Overview: This course is designed to provide beginners with a solid foundation in MySQL, a widely used open-source relational database management system. It's a course for absolute beginners only.\nWhat is MySQL?\nMySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle that is based on structured query language (SQL).\nA database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or a place to hold the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. In particular, a relational database is a digital store collecting data and organizing it according to the relational model. In this model, tables consist of rows and columns, and relationships between data elements all follow a strict logical structure. An RDBMS is simply the set of software tools used to actually implement, manage, and query such a database.\n\n\nMySQL is open-source\nAny individual or enterprise may freely use, modify, publish, and expand on Oracle’s open-source MySQL code base. The software is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).\nFor MySQL code needing to be integrated or included in a commercial application (or if open-source software is not a priority), enterprises can purchase a commercially licensed version from Oracle.\nAgain, these options provide organizations with additional flexibility if deciding to work with MySQL. The public and community-based nature of open-source releases enriches MySQL’s documentation and online support culture, while also ensuring that sustained or newly-developed capabilities never stray too far from current user needs.\nMySQL is easy to use\nThough MySQL’s relational nature and the ensuing rigid storage structures might seem restrictive, the tabular paradigm is perhaps the most intuitive, and ultimately allows for greater usability.\nIn fact, MySQL makes many concessions to supporting the widest possible variety of data structures, from the standard but rich logical, numeric, alphanumeric, date, and time types, to more advanced JSON or geospatial data. Beyond mere data types and an expansive built-in feature set, the MySQL ecosystem also includes a variety of tools, easing everything from server management to reporting and data analysis.\nRegardless of the RDBMS’s overarching architecture, users can invariably find a MySQL feature allowing them to model and codify data how they wish. MySQL remains one of the most straightforward database technologies to learn and use.\n\n\nPrerequisites: No prior knowledge of databases or SQL is required for this course. Basic computer literacy and familiarity with working in a command-line interface or graphical user interface (GUI) is recommended.",

And one of the most important things that you need to do is to perform market research and to find out whether or not there is a market for the product you’re trying to sell.\nFurthermore, if you have a product that has a market, where is that market located? Is it in another country or your very own?\nDo you know where your potential buyers like to hang out? Do you know what sites they’re on? Do you know how to reach them?\nAnd the questions don’t stop here! You need to have answers to even more questions if you want to make sure that you’ll know who to market to:\n-What’s the competition in your market?\n-Who is your competition?\n-What is your completion doing?\n-What are you doing that your competition isn’t?\n-And more…\nThere are tons of questions that you need to have answers to before you determine whether or not the market you want to get into is really profitable and for you.\nSo, what’s the conclusion? Market research is of the utmost importance!\nAt the same time, trying to get to the bottom of things, knowing what your buyers respond to, knowing what they like and don’t like is equally important.\nNo matter if you have a product idea that you think is a money maker or you already have a finished product, knowing the answers to the above questions is going to help you tremendously in achieving your goals which translates into making money!\nThis is why this video course was created: so that you have a clear understanding of how you should look at your market and how to know what your buyers want from you (the most important thing in any sales process). It’s a whole lot easier creating a product based on a belief than it is to create a product customized for your buyers’ needs.\nIf you want to find the answers to all of the above questions and to make sure that you did everything in your power to make your product sell then THIS is for YOU!\nIntroducing...\nMarket Research Classroom\nHere’s the list of videos that you’ll get in this course:\nVideo# 1 – Overview\nVideo# 2 – Niche Research Tools\nVideo# 3 - Using Free Tools Part 1\nVideo# 4 – Using Free Tools 2\nVideo# 5 - Find Customers Trend in a Niche\nVideo# 6 - Researching Affiliate Products\nVideo# 7 – Finnding Trending Topics\nVideo# 8 - Research from Questions and Answers Sites\nVideo# 9 - Advanced Research\nVideo# 10 – Hijacking Your Competitor's Niche\nVideo #11 - Finding Trends on Social Media\nvideo #12 - Conclusion\nGet this 12 part video course and know that you’ll not only find the right niche, but also that you’ll know exactly what your customers want!",

No questions asked!\n\n\nWHO'S THIS FOR? - This course is designed specifically for those wanting to learn how to approach and visualize any type of data no matter how big or small. This course is not for beginners!!\n\n\nWhy do we Deep Dive?\nIn this day and age, businesses live and breathe data! We've become so good at collecting it that eventually it becomes too big to even manage. The ability to take that data, find patterns and trends is essential for the survival of both big and small business around the world.\nFrom an individuals point of view, those with the ability to perform such analysis will become (if they're not already) the most valuable people in every industry!\n\n\nWhat will learn?\nThis course is made up of 3 tutorials and 3 assignment each with different complexities.\nIn the tutorials I'll show you in extreme detail the steps I take when analyzing data. These are the same steps I use in my professional life. I'll go through why I choose certain visualizations, how I come to build them as well as shortcut secrets I use to create visualizations far quicker than most of my colleagues.\nThe assignments themselves don't have any one truth. In fact, deep diving is really about interpretation. You're interpretation may be different from mine and that doesn't necessarily make yours or mine correct or incorrect. However, whichever path you choose, be ready to logically defend why you do it that way.\nThis forms the second part of deep diving which is communicating your findings. I'll show you how I do it so that even non-data people can understand.\n\n\nSign up today! It’s no risk to you with Udemy’s 30-day Money Back Guarantee, No Questions Asked!",

Therefore you will be able to distribute your own apps to as many people and iOS devices as you like.\nMore advanced users can even host an online version which will work with most browsers including Android.  The advanced version can  integrate with everything from SQL to SAP and Claris has just released Claris Connect, which can connect your  app to API's via a simple workflow.  These advanced (multi-user) techniques are beyond the scope of this training course however advanced users, BI specialists, data analysts, data scientists, programmers and app developers may still want to take this course to refine core skills in multidimensional modelling and analysis.\nHowever, this training course is squarely aimed at the typical Excel user who wants a simple method for building their own Dashboards and Business Apps.\nSign up today to start creating your own Dashboards and iPhone apps without learning a single line of code.",

      "description": "Neural networks are powerful predictive tools that can be used for almost any machine learning problem with very good results. If you want to break into deep learning and artificial intelligence, learning neural networks is the first crucial step.\n\n\nThis is why I’m inviting you to an exciting journey through the world of complex, state-of-the-art neural networks. In this course you will develop a strong understanding of the most utilized neural networks, suitable for both classification and regression problems.\n\n\nThe mathematics behind neural networks is particularly complex, but you don’t need to be a mathematician to take this course and fully benefit from it. We will not dive into complicated maths - our emphasis here is on practice. You will learn how to operate neural networks using the R program, how to build and train models and how to make predictions on new data.\n\n\nAll the procedures are explained live, on real life data sets. So you will advance fast and be able to apply your knowledge immediately.\n\n\nThis course contains four comprehensive sections.\n\n\n1. Multilayer Perceptrons – Beyond the Basics\n\n\nLearn to use multilayer perceptrons to make predictions for both categorical and continuous variables. Moreover, learn how to test your models accuracy using the k-fold cross-validation technique and how improve predictions by manipulating various parameters of the network.\n\n\n3. Generalized Regression Neural Networks\n\n\nIf you have to solve a regression problem (where your response variable is numeric), these networks can be very effective. We’ll show how to predict a car value based on its technical characteristics and how to improve the prediction by controlling the smoothing parameter of our model. The k-fold cross-validation techniques will also be employed to identify better models.\n\n\n4. Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n\nThese networks are useful for many prediction problems, but they are particularly valuable for time series modelling and forecasting. In this course we focus on two types of recurrent neural networks: Elman and Jordan. We are going to use them to predict future air temperatures based on historical data. Making truthful predictions on time series is generally very tough, but we will do our best to build good quality models and get satisfactory values for the prediction accuracy metrics.\n\n\nFor each type of network, the presentation is structured as follows:\n\n\na short, easy to understand theoretical introduction (without complex mathematics)\nhow to train the network in R\nhow to test the network to make sure that it does a good prediction job on independent data sets.\n\n\nFor every neural network, a number of practical exercises are proposed. By doing these exercises you’ll actually apply in practice what you have learned.\n\n\nThis course is your opportunity to become a neural network expert in a few days only (literally). With my video lectures, you will find it very easy to master these major neural network and build them in R. Everything is shown live, step by step, so you can replicate any procedure at any time you need it.\n\n\nSo click the “Enrol” button to get instant access to your course. It will surely get you some new, valuable skills. And, who knows, it could greatly enhance your future career.\n\n\nSee you inside!",

      "description": "Welcome to \"Introduction to Supermetrics for Data Automation\"! In this quick crash course, you are going to learn how to automate data reporting by using Supermetrics and its wide range of connectors. Often, when faced with multiple data sources, from platforms like Facebook Ads, Twitter and Campaign Manager (CM360), it becomes difficult to ensure they are always up-to-date, error-free and follow consistent formatting. Therefore, to automate your reporting, you need a tool like Supermetrics to connect the pipes and allow your data sources to get to their destinations in the most efficient way possible.\n\n\nThe course is aimed at beginners and those who are starting their journey in reporting automation. If you are a marketing data automation expert already or an advanced Supermetrics user, this course is probably not suitable for you.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to:\nPull data directly into your Data Studio report from multiple sources, including Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Company pages and etc.\nEliminate hours of manual work by scheduling data transfers and automating your marketing reporting.\nPlug into all your BigQuery tables with one data source instance and pulls all that data neatly into Data Studio.\n\n\nPlus, three quick hands-on projects:\nProject 1: Use the Twitter Public Data connector to fetch metrics and dimensions for any public twitter account and analyze it in Data Studio.\nProject 2: Use the Pinterest Public Connector to fetch data for any account and use a Data Studio parameter to search and add new accounts dynamically.\nProject 3: Using the Google Analytics 4 Connector to analyze your website data\n\n\nBONUS: Once you complete the course, you get a 20% discount from a Supermetrics subscription via a special promo code (this applies to first-time purchases made from the website ONLY)!\n\n\nWhat is Supermetrics?\nSupermetrics tools automatically fetch data from multiple platforms (e.g. Twitter Ads, Facebook Ads, Google Analytics...) and pull it into any destination (Data Studio, Google Sheets, Excel). It also allows you to set up automatic data refreshes and scheduled emails. This eliminates the need to copy-paste marketing data into a reporting or data visualization platform.\n\n\nWho is the instructor?\nLachezar Arabadzhiev is a digital markitech with 4+ years of experience in performance analytics and data visualization. Lachezar began his career as a digital marketer at Microsoft, but soon transitioned to the measurement and analytics world, where he has had the opportunity to work with major brands such as Air Canada, RBC, Kimberly-Clark, Mazda and HSBC.\nLachezar has been working with Data Studio and BigQuery since early 2017 and has built a wide variety of visualizations and automation flows. From performance-based dashboards with joined GMP sources (Google Analytics 360, Campaign Manager and Display & Video 360) to audience-driven segmentation views with user-level eCommerce data.\nLachezar is a certified GMP expert and an official speaker at the Canadian Google Data & Analytics Summit, 2018.\n\n\nWhat are the students who took the course saying?\n\n\n\"Great course! This is my second course with the same instructor and I just enrolled with another one of his courses, the third one. Not only do I love his courses, his teaching style is also excellent. I'm getting from his courses just the skills that I need as a Digital Marketing freelancer. Thank you!\" - Dame\n\n\n\"Great course to learn about how to automate data reporting and make efficient use of so much data. It has easy to follow practical examples which makes it intriguing and resourceful. Highly recommended for people in digital marketing/social media campaign management\" - Emmie\n\n\n\"Great course and content! As a digital marketing practitioner working with Data Studio, I highly recommend this course if you are looking to quickly get up to speed with Supermetrics and understand what it is and what its main functionalities are. I especially liked Lachezar's hands-on approach, presenting the material in a concise and comprehensive way, which is really ideal for practitioners. Looking forward to more high quality content!\" - Andrea",

      "description": "Greetings!\nI am super-excited to invite you to “Excel Pivot Tables Data Analysis Master Class”.\nAs an Excel user, you simply must learn how to create Pivot Tables. Seriously, there is no better way to instantly sky-rocket your employability than to master Pivot Tables.\nNothing comes close. Especially if you have to crunch large data sets and perform data analysis.\nIn fact, lacking this crucial skill is like leaving a wide-gaping hole in your professional defenses.\nIt keeps you exposed to an equivalent of a nasty sucker punch. A disaster waiting to happen: a bleeding nose, a bruised ego, and a brutally murdered professional reputation.\nThat’s why savvy Excel users quickly discover that they need to learn how to use pivot tables ASAP.\nThis Pivot Tables on-line training will teach you exactly how to tightly fill that gap, bullet-proof your Excel skill set, and boost your career to new heights.\nIt teaches you how to create and use pivot tables for maximum benefit.\nSo you are ready to tackle any sneaky data-analysis situation as a world-class, mega-skilled Excel ninja.\nI am introducing to you this super-easy-to-follow Excel Pivot Tables tutorial, where you’ll learn this powerful, but somewhat hidden functionality.\nNow, what shall you expect from this course?\nWhen you enroll, you’ll discover that this is not a regular on-line tutorial course where some starched up instructor keeps selling you their “expertise”.\nNo way!\nSince my early days as an Excel trainer, I learned what works and what doesn’t in teaching software.\nThat’s why, in this course, I teach you as a friend. You should expect a casual conversational style, clear explanations, and a pleasant learning experience.\nMy focus is to help you learn Excel in an easy and comfortable way.\nFrom the very instant you enroll, I’ll gently lead you step by step through the most essential Pivot Tables techniques.Your learning curve will be astonishingly nice and smooth.\nAs you go through the course, I’ll provide answers to your most burning questions. Such as:\nHow do I prepare my dataset for pivot tables analysis?\nHow do I create a pivot table?\nWhat is a pivot table and what is it used for?\nHow do I create a pivot chart?\nHow can I create a calculated field\nHow do I create a calculated item?\nHow do I extract data from a pivot table?\nHow do I format a pivot table?\nHow can I create a Pareto Chart using pivot tables?\nAnd more…\nI will be the needle, you will be the thread. As you follow me along, you’ll be more and more comfortable with Pivot Tables.\nTogether we are just about to:\n1) Learn how to quickly and easily create actionable pivot table reports.\n2) Discover how to use pivot tables for data manipulation and data extraction.\n3) Quickly fix data in Excel, so you are ready for analysis.\n4) Become adept at the art and science of Pivot Table data crunching.\n5) Quickly transform your raw data into useful, actionable information reports.\n6) Impress your boss and your colleagues with your newly acquired and highly polished skills.\n7) Acquire proven strategies, Excel tips and tricks, so you are mega-proficient at any task.\n8) Excel at Excel in general, with or without pivot tables.\nAnd (again) much more…\nThere are several reasons why it’s prudent for you to develop these skills:\n1) Availability, 2) Power and flexibility, 4) Speed.\nLet me quickly explain…\n1) You want to learn Pivot Tables simply because they are available to you right now.\nThink about it. Let’s say, you are already using Excel to create stunning spreadsheets. You may be comfortable with formulas and functions. You know how to do formatting - to make your workbooks look top-notch professional, but you don’t know how to use Pivot Tables.\nWhy not? After all they are already there for you benefit. There is nothing extra to install. They are part of Excel.\nWhat would you say to a carpenter, who is using only manual tools and ignores the electrical ones? Would you hire someone who uses a hammer instead of a nail gun - because he never took the step to learn how to use it?\nPivot Tables are available for your benefit to learn immediately - they are already in your tool box. Learn them! Otherwise, you’ll never discover what you are missing.\n2) You need to learn Pivot Tables because of their unmatched power and flexibility.\nPivot Tables is a kick-ass, flexible reporting tool.\nIf you’ve ever had to run a report from a database, chances are, it struck you as being a bit fixed. It reflects the mindset of whoever created it. It may not be exactly what you want form the start. Of course, if you want, you can create your own report, but it will take time. With Pivot Tables, you can change things on the fly. You can experiment. It takes minutes, or even seconds. You can modify things at (almost) the speed of light. If you know how.\nYou can quickly format your reports exactly the way you (or your bosses) want. It will dramatically improve your productivity and creativity when working with data.\nIn this course, I’ll reveal to you what massive difference it makes. Believe me, it feels like freedom.\n3) It’s crucial for you to learn Pivot Tables to become instantly and infinitely more productive.\nWhen you go though this course, you’ll realize that without Pivot Tables, certain tasks would have taken weeks or even months to accomplish.\nIt’s amazing. I’ve actually met Excel users who were - oblivious to the existence of Pivot Tables - scrambling for weeks to consolidate data into a report. With Pivot Tables you can crank the same task in a matter of minutes.\nDon’t be them - learn the right way (the Pivot-Tables way). You life will never be the same.\nPivot Tables is your secret weapon. As you learn it, you’ll be astonished and pleased every step of the way. When you have learned it - it’ll help you succeed.\nIt’s gonna be great! When you are ready, enroll in this course and let’s begin!\nIgor Ovchinnikov\nP.S. Important warning!\nAfter you have perused this course, your skills will be on a much higher level than those of many of your colleagues. Fundamentally, you’ll “leave them all in the dust” - skill-wise.\nYou’ll be much faster and more efficient at many Excel tasks then most of them.\nPeople don’t like that. They will get nervous and threatened. Be careful!\nThere are two things you can do to soothe their sorrows.\n1) Share this course with them, so they can also get to your level. It will be a very classy gesture on your part. They will appreciate you even more.\n2) Be very gentle with them when demonstrating the superior knowledge and power that you accumulated in this course. Try not to destroy their ego. You wouldn’t want them to feel inferior to you, would you? Be nice.\nP.P.S. There are no prerequisites for this course, but it will be easier for you if you already know the most important Excel concepts. If you are a beginner, I highly recommend to take my “Basic Excel Tutorial - Jumpstart Training Course” before you enroll in this course right here.",

Become a proficient quantitative and qualitative researcher through this engaging and informative course section.\n\n\nKey Concepts\nKey concepts. As I had explained to you. What are the key concepts? Three main key concepts are there. First is the sampling in quantitative research. So sampling refers to the process of selecting a subset of the population to participate in a research study.\nHow do you select the subset of the population? That is a very professional work that requires a lot of skills. A well-designed sample should be representative of the larger population. So, how do you decide what kind of decision you take to estimate the sample you are taking?\nYou cannot take the whole population. So, the sample that you are taking, how you are selecting that sample, how the sampling is being done to make sure that it is nearly representative of the population, and you can avoid Bias.\nFor example, suppose you are surveying school students. Now, schools are of different categories. They are government schools. For example, if we talk about the Indian context, there are government schools, there are private schools, and there are schools that are meant for the rural population of students. Some schools are meant for the urban population of students.\nHow do you decide the student's sample from which school, and what are the questions of your survey? What is the survey design that will be just talking about? Depending on the context, depending on the research outcomes that you are expecting, or you are trying to test what hypothesis you are trying to test, depending on all, and depending on the focus groups.\nSuppose your survey is focusing on the urban population. Then that's a different context you are looking at. The urban population means urban students in schools in urban areas. But there are different categories of these schools in the urban areas also. So, how do you do the sampling? How do you select the subset of the population that will participate in a research study? So it requires a lot of skills and a lot of brainstorming.\nThen the second concept of the quantitative research refers to the survey design. Now, survey design involves developing a set of questions that will be used to gather data from the sample population.\nHow do you design those questions, and what kind of method are you going to use that will also decide the survey design? Suppose, for example, you are collecting data through the internet through online methods. Then, probably the survey design may be of a different type. Then, another scenario wherein you are collecting data on the street in the field.\nMaybe the survey design will be different.\nDepending on the type of sample depending on the methods of data collection, we will be just talking about the data collection part. The survey design will differ, but the survey design has to focus on the outcome. What hypothesis are you testing, and what is the context?\nSurvey design will involve developing the most suitable set of questions that is suitable for the context of the research.\nAnd then the third key concept of the quantitative research is the data collection. So data collection involves the administration or administering the survey. The survey that you have designed for the sample population, the sample population that you have selected, the subset of the population that you have selected as a sample, and being able to effectively and accurately collect the responses.\nWhat is the best method? Again, it will depend on the context. Again, it will depend on the research questions. Again, it will depend on the nature of the research, the ecosystem where this research is being carried out, and who the stakeholders of the research are.\nThere are so many variables that will help you decide the method of data collection, what kind of data collection it will be, and how you administer the survey.\nWhat is the involvement of the survey in this data collection? And the method of data collection will be according to that.\nYou will find a lot more such ideas in this course.\n\n\nAbout the instructor\nDr. Vijesh Jain, the instructor of this course, is an international marketing professional with over 35 years of international marketing practice, research, academic, and training experience.

      "description": "Do you struggle with making data-driven decisions for your business due to scattered, inconsistent, and inaccessible data? This course is the solution! Learn to build a streamlined and efficient ETL pipeline that will allow you to turn data into actionable insights.\nThis course teaches you how to build a system that collects data from multiple sources, normalizes it, and stores it in a consistent and accessible format. You will learn how to extract data, explore and preprocess it, and ultimately visualize it to support better decision-making and optimize business processes.\nForget about big data and cluster management headaches, this course is designed to get you up and running quickly with a real-time ETL pipeline. With infrastructure costs under $50 a month, you can start seeing immediate results and return on investment for your clients or company.\nIn the first part of the course, I will walk you through the architecture and introduce you to the tools we will be using:\nDeepnote, as a setup-free development environment\nDagster, as the pipeline orchestrator\nMetabase, as a low-code data visualization platform\nWhile the course will introduce you to the relevant features of Deepnote and Metabase, it is mostly focused on Dagster.\nIn the next part, we will get started by generating dummy sales data of a hypothetical company using Deepnote. The code will be provided for this. Once we have the data, the course will dive into data exploration and preprocessing techniques using Python and SQL in Deepnote, including cleaning and normalizing data from various sources such as relational and JSON data, Excel sheets, and more. We will implement the processing logic in Deepnote, then commit it to a Git repository that will be shared with Dagster.\nIn the following section, we will wrap the business logic with Dagster operations and jobs, then deploy them to Dagster Cloud (self-hosted option also available), which will allow you to manage everything from a single, unified view. In this section, you will also learn a few tricks to speed up and optimize processing, such as parallelization or streamed processing.\nIn the final section of this course, you'll bring your preprocessed data to life with Metabase. With a few simple clicks, even non-technical individuals will be able to create stunning, powerful visualizations that unlock the full potential of your data.\nBy the end of this course, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of the tools used and how they work together, empowering you to provide tangible benefits to your clients or company from day one, measured in thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.\nThe choice is yours - will you seize this opportunity to deliver massive benefits to your company or clients, and claim your fair share of the rewards?",

The goal of this course is to present practical techniques while avoiding  obstacles of abstract mathematical theories. To achieve this goal, the DSP techniques are explained in plain language and computer code, not simply proven to be true through mathematical derivations.\nStill keeping it simple, this course comes in different programming languages and hardware architectures so that students can put the techniques to practice using a programming language or hardware architecture  of their choice. This version of the course uses the Java programming language.\nWith each dsp topic we shall develop two versions of the same algorithm. One version shall be focused on code readable and the other version shall focus on robustness and execution speed- we shall employ programming techniques such loop unrolling and Multiply- Accumulate (MAC) to accomplish this.\n\n\nBy the end of this course you should be able build a complete DSP library in java, develop the Convolution Kernel algorithm in Java, develop the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithm in Java, develop the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) algorithm in Java, design and develop Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters in Java, design and develop Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters in Java, develop Windowed-Sinc filters in Java, build Modified Sallen-Key filters,  build Bessel, Chebyshev and Butterworth filters, develop the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in  Java, even give a lecture on DSP and so much more.

Quickly adapting to changes in customer and market behaviour. Or even build out entirely new data-dependent value chains for the organisation, often called Infornomics.\nIn this course, we will learn to align the data strategy with the business strategy. To balance the pillars of a data strategy:\nData Analytics: Data Assets, Analytical Insights, and Data Science Insights\nData Services: Data Platforms, Engineering and Operations\nData Governance: Data Ownership, Data Controls, and Data Curation\nPeople: Data Citizens, Data Professionals, Data Skills\nYou will learn to avoid the common pitfalls of a data strategy and acquire the skills to face the challenges of delivering a data strategy and getting it accepted by the organisation.\nThe course breaks down the data strategy into components parts and provides techniques for analysing the current data landscape. This analysis allows the identification of concerns which can be addressed through a strategic plan of change within the data strategy.\nThe course includes some quizzes to embed the terminology we will learn and some assignments to practice the techniques. Each assignment has a worksheet and example answer.\nThe final data strategy needs to be optimised for the organisation's situation and culture. The course can help you prepare to deliver a narrative for your organisation's data strategy.",

The course does not assume the use of any specific statistical software. Therefore, this course should be of use to anyone intending interested in factor analysis. The theory is explained in an intuitive way while keeping the math at a minimum. The course starts with a simple one-dimensional example where the concepts of reliability, loadings, and eigenvalues are explained. The course then moves to two-dimensions where the concept of rotation is explained. Different rotation techniques are discussed in addition to the differences between them.\nIn the second part of the course, students walk through a case study in a step-by-step approach in order to see how the techniques are applied and what sort of logic is used in each step. In this part, students will walk through a large project in order to understand the type of questions that are raised throughout the process.",

For example, you have a data set of truck distances driven and stops made. Using this information, we can construct an equation which allows prediction of duration given distance number of stops. This would be of great use to anyone having to give out quotations.\n\nI show you how to check whether your regression actually works and how accurate it is.\n\nIndicator or 'dummy' variables are an important source of information, and I show you how to convert textual data into dummy variables for inclusion in the regression analysis. We know how long repair jobs take and months since last service. Does including information about whether the job was electrical or mechanical make predicted repair time any more accurate?\n\nSales go up at certain seasons: being able to measure those increases and predict them is highly useful.\n\nWe also cover elasticity, a topic often missed out in regression courses. Using elasticity, we can predict the effect on sales volume in precent of a percent change in selling price.\n\nI provide detailed explanations and provide the datasets so that you can follow along.\n\nThe pace of the course is measured and step by step, each section building on the last. The datasets I use in the examples are included so that you can run your own regressions and compare results.",

      "description": "This course has been designed to take novice, Powerpivot users, to a level where they are comfortable working with Power Pivot Models, using Pivot tables and charts along with carrying out DAX calculations and using DAX time intelligence functions.\nPower Pivot is an Excel add-in, available in Excel 2010 and certain versions of Excel 2013 and later. You can use Power Pivot, with its own DAX functions to perform powerful data analysis and create sophisticated data models. With Power Pivot, you can mash up large volumes of data from various sources, perform information analysis rapidly, and share insights easily.  Power Pivot is the gateway to business intelligence and data all within Excel.\nThis course consists of 5 modules, each with learning activities, and workbooks to download.  To make sure you get the most out of this course, the learning material is made up of both videos and articles to reinforce what is covered.\n\n\nModule 1\nGet your head around the basics of Powerpivot, learn how to link a table, and work with that table and find out how you can get data into PowerPivot to work with it. If you are new to Power Pivot this module will show you around, so you become more familiar with the user interface and become more confident adding data to a power pivot model.\n· What is Power Pivot?\n· How do I create a linked table from Excel to Power Pivot?\n· What other ways can I get data into Power Pivot?\n· How do I find my way around Power Pivot?\n· How do I work with tables in Power Pivot?\n·\nModule 2\nPowerpivot allows you to perform calculations across different tables of data. In order to do this, you must link the tables together by means of relationships. Relationships can be difficult to understand at first and they are a big change to working in Excel. In this module, you will learn\n· What are relationships?\n· How do I create a relationship in PowerPivot?\n· How do I overcome many to many relationships?\n- How to set up a bridging table\nModule 3\nThe pivot table is by far one of the most useful ways to analyze and visualize your data in Excel. Powerpivot allows you quickly insert a pivot table or chart from multiple tables to analyze or slice and dice like never before. In this module, you will learn\n· How do I insert a pivot table from Power Pivot?\n· How do I work with a pivot table?\n· How do I insert a pivot chart from Power Pivot?\n· How do I work with and format a pivot chart?\n· How do I insert and work with slicers and timelines?\n\n\nModule 4\nPowerpivot allows basic to complex data modeling and calculations to be carried out across multiple tables of data. It does this via its powerful calculation engine using Data Analysis eXpressions. Understanding the basics of DAX is a necessity for the use of Powerpivot.

Grouping layers are added manually for perfect control of all aspects of data groups.\nInteractivity is added to reports through interactive sorting, filtering, collapsible and expandable hierarchies, bookmarking, and document mapping.\nMaps are a staple on modern reports. To finish the course, geographic maps are added to reports to help analyze business data.  These maps include heat maps and color maps. International maps are also created using spatial data available from the Internet.\n\n\nInstructor: Eric Brockway",

      "description": "You have created some great Alteryx workflows, now how do you share it so your colleagues can also use it with their own inputs? Have you built Alteryx workflows which others need to run who don't have Alteryx License? Is your boss always coming to you for data requests and reports? Do you find yourself dealing with processes that have to repeat again and again?\n\n\nIn this course, learn how to turn your workflow into Analytic Applications or Apps by using Interface Tools in Alteryx so your end-users can easily adjust the workflow based on their own needs.\nLearn how to publish your workflows to the Alteryx gallery so others can be self-sufficient with their requests and users can run Alteryx apps from a simple web interface.\n\n\nThis course covers how to build analytic Applications or simply Apps in Alteryx. Alteryx Apps are workflows with an interface that have interactive elements built into them. This user interface allows users to interact with and adjust the underlying workflow without editing individual tools. Alteryx Apps also facilitates the automation of repetitive processes through Apps like quarterly closeouts, weekly revenue report generation, creating PDF reports.\n\n\nAlteryx Apps enables you to toggle variables within a workflow by connecting tools from Interface Tools category to your workflow tools. Interface tools are used to build the user interface and update the workflow tools with the values the user picks in the user interface like a drop-down choice between sorting by the customer or by product or a numeric up-down control to select 10 records or choosing output format to generate a report.\n\n\nAlteryx Analytical Apps are a standard out-of-the-box feature of Alteryx and are not installed separately. Apps have the file extension yxwz. Any workflow no matter how simple or complex can be turned into an Alteryx App by adding tools from the Interface tool category. One of the key benefits of analytic apps is that they are not just restricted for use by those with Alteryx designer licences.\n\n\nIf you are planning to appear for Alteryx Advanced Certification exam Exam, Analytical Apps is one of the core topic tested in the exam. This course covers all the tools required to create an App in Alteryx which is tested during the exam.\n\n\nIn this course we will cover:\nInterface Tools - Interface Tools can be used to update standard WorkFlows tool (WorkFlows tools are standard tools which are housed in other tools palette)\nInterface Designer - How you want your user to be able to interact with the WF that you have built\n\n\nSpecifically, you will learn how to:\nConvert an existing WF into an existing app using Interface tools\nConfigure the interactive experience with the Interface designer\nChoose from the range of interface tools to construct a user-friendly Interface\nPublish your app to the Alteryx Gallery for consumption by others\nUse interface tools to update tools in a Standard Workflow\nUse the Interface Designer to arrange interface elements and customize app behaviours.\n\n\nInterface Tools you will learn from the course:\nAction Tool\nDrop Down\nList Box\nDate Tool\nNumeric Up Down\nFile Browse\nFolder Browse\nText Box Tool\nError Message\nCheckBox\nControl Parameter\nMap\nTree Tool\nYou should be familiar with the fundamentals of Alteryx before you take this course. You just need to have basic knowledge of Alteryx like how to navigate Alteryx and be able to create a simple workflow.\nThe purpose of the course is to master Alteryx Apps. We will start with the very basics of creating an App. We will then cover the different interface tools and take a deep dive into its various configuration options. We will then learn how to make your app robust by using error tool. After that, we will move on to advanced topics like checkbox tool, radio tool to route your app based on conditions and how to use the control parameter. We will also learn how to chain multiple apps together by using Chained App functionality.\nLet's dive into Alteryx Apps with lessons that incorporate videos, resources and quizzes to assess your knowledge and reinforce your understanding of the key topics.\nWe offer friendly support through the Q&A section. In case of any doubt or if any concept is not clear, please drop us a question in the Q&A section.",

      "description": "LATEST: The course is updated to Jan 2017.\n\n=== This is the FIRST COURSE ever on Udemy of SPSS SYNTAX programming ===\nHi I am Doctor AnalytiX and I have spent many years on testing what really works in SPSS to get results in very short time, and now I want to share with you how to prepare data and how to automate tasks in a few simple steps.\nI have trained hundreds of people in these years and explained how to use SPSS syntax programming in several live training sessions and now you have the chance to follow me lifetime.\nThis course will teach you how to use this 'behind the scene' language and other features for data management and manipulation, and for overall control of SPSS execution.\nThere will be an \"in-depth\" details about the Syntax language: useful and relevant examples and exercises that shows how Syntax can make your analysis more efficient, more transparent and more easy.\nThis awesome program includes:\ngreat exercises with solutions end codes.\nuseful handouts.\nhandy checklists.\ninteresting projects.\nexiting quizzes.\nDon't you think it possible to add percentage signs to your data? With SPSS syntax it will be very easy! Only a very limited number of people know this information. In only 3 hours you can learn how to automate repetitive tasks and how to perform additional options that are not available in the dialog(ue) boxes in SPSS. You can easily transform your analysis process in simple steps, record and reuse them whenever you need.\nIs my course better than another? I don't think so, but what I have learned after 15 years of training and statistic projects is how to save 4 hours a day making analysis and repetitive data management tasks thanks to SPSS, by using simple syntax commands.\nCreating a syntax script for SPSS automation is very easy, you don't need to know any special programming language or any complex tools, you just have to know SPSS.\nGiven the obvious advantages of using a graphic user interface, you can wonder why anyone could want to program by using the syntax. Actually, there may be many situations in which the use of the syntax is preferable or even essential. Here are some examples in which the syntax is preferable to the \"point-and-click\" method:\nIf you have to create weekly or monthly reports: instead of recreating the commands, by using the menus each time, you can save them in a syntax file for later reuse.\nIf you have to use commands that are not available by using the dialog(ue)s: some subroutines for reading complex data structures, transformations like structures \"do if\" and \"loop\" and macros, you can get only by using the syntax.\nIf you have to create multiple tables or graphics: the syntax allows you to create them in a single step, whereas, by using the menu, you can only generate them one by one.\nIf every month you run the same SPSS commands, but the name of the database changes every time you run the analysis: you can change the file name using \"Syntax Editor\", and re-use the rest of the commands, rather than redefining from the beginning the file by using the menu every time.\nThis course provides students with a greater understanding of a variety of programming techniques along with the procedure to use the most popular statistical software package, SPSS. The course will serve the students as a self-learning material of using SPSS for applying analysis and data management tasks, programmatically.\nThe course has been written to provide solutions to the students in different disciplines. The course is intended for everybody works on data analysis, statistics, strategic decision-making process or quantitative methods taught in management and other disciplines like psychology,economics, education, nursing, medical, or other behavioral and social sciences. This course is also useful for IBM SPSS certification exams..\nCustomer satisfaction is my main concern. Feel free to contact me for any questions, concerns or problems. We can work it out to make you feel satisfied with what you are getting. If things doesn't work out for you, we have a 30-day money back guarantee. I assure you that you won't regret this.\nAlready excited?

      "description": "Learn how to get insights from your customer data, understand your customers deeply and target the right customers with the right products!\nThe SPSS program offers a comprehensive customer analytics tool – the Direct Marketing module. With this tool you can conduct powerful analyses without being an expert in statistics and data analysis.\nThe everyday interactions with your customer generates a high amount of valuable data. The customer marketing analysis is the best solution to transform these data into real knowledge. The goal of this analysis is to get you a precise view of your customers, identify the most profitable groups of customers and send them the most appropriate marketing messages.\nThe Direct Marketing toolkit in SPSS includes six practical analysis procedures. Each of these procedures has its own section in this course.\nThe RFM analysis allows you to classify your customers according to the recency, frequency, and monetary value of their purchases. You can pinpoint your most valuable customers (those who buy often and spend much money), as well as adapt your strategy for each RFM customers (e.g. encourage new customers to buy more, reward good customers with discounts and prizes, re-gain old customers that stopped buying from you etc.)\nThe cluster analysis procedure helps you segment your customers or prospects using their most relevant demographic, economic or behavioral characteristics. In each cluster you will find customers that are similar with eah other and different to the others. You can combine this procedure with other analyses, to identify the segments with the highest RFM values, for example, or to estimate the buying probability in each segment.\nThe customer profiling technique helps you detect the customer groups with the highest response rate, based on the results of previous campaign. This way you can know in advance which customers are more likely to respond to your future offers. In consequence, you can significantly improve the targeting of your future campaigns, reduce campaign costs and increase sales and ROI.\nAnother procedure allows you to identify the responses to your campaign  by postal codes. This is extremely useful for direct mailing campaigns, because you can find out the geographical areas where most of your customers live. You can compare the response rate of each geographical zone to your target rate and decide where to send your future mailing packages so you can maximize your profits.\nThe Direct Marketing module in SPSS also helps you estimate the probability of purchase for each contact in your list, using an advanced prediction analysis method (binomial regression). You can send your future messages only to the prospects who are most likely to buy from you and remove the inactive prospects from your list. Moreover, you can predict the probability of purchasing for new customers, those freshly added to your list.\nThe Control Package Test method allows you to compare the effectiveness of two or more marketing campaigns. This is useful especially when you intend to test existing campaigns against new campaigns. The differences between the campaigns response rates are evaluated using the binomial test.\nMost of the procedures above use sophisticated statistical analysis techniques to process your data. However, you don’t have to be a statistician in order to use them. You can get the results you need with a few clicks only, in a few seconds. This is what you will learn in this course.\nEvery procedure is explained live in SPSS, and the output is interpreted in detail. At the end of each section you can find a couple of practical exercises to strengthen your knowledge.\nJoin this course today and you will be able to analyze your customer data using state-of-the-art predictive techniques and make informed decisions!",

This course lets you explore a toolbox of data cleaning, shaping, and loading techniques, which you can apply to your data.\nThe process of creating a complicated data model in Power BI is straightforward. If your data is coming in from more than one transactional system, before you know it, you can have dozens of tables that you have to work with. Building a great data model is about simplifying the disarray.\nCreating a great data model is one of the most important tasks that a data analyst can perform in Microsoft Power BI. By doing this job well, you help make it easier for people to understand your data, which will make building valuable Power BI reports easier for them and for you.\nProviding set rules for what makes a good data model is difficult because all data is different, and the usage of that data varies. Generally, a smaller data model is better because it will perform faster and will be simpler to use. However, defining what a smaller data model entails is equally as problematic because it's a heuristic and subjective concept.\nTypically, a smaller data model is comprised of fewer tables and fewer columns in each table that the user can see. If you import all necessary tables from a sales database, but the total table count is 30 tables, the user will not find that intuitive. Collapsing those tables into five tables will make the data model more intuitive to the user, whereas if the user opens a table and finds 100 columns, they might find it overwhelming. Removing unneeded columns to provide a more manageable number will increase the likelihood that the user will read all column names. To summarize, you should aim for simplicity when designing your data models.",

It is often referred to as logistic regression. However, in Minitab, it is called binary logistic regression.\nI will use Minitab 19 to perform the analysis. The focus of my teaching will be on explaining the theoretical concepts and on analyzing and interpreting the results of the analysis.\nPerforming Binary Logistic Regression in Minitab is easy. It is just a few selections and clicks and you are done with it. However, the difficult part is understanding and interpreting the results.\nThe following concepts are covered in this course:\nThe purpose of Binary Logistic Regression\nThe concept of Odds and ln(Odds)\nLogistic Regression Equation\nOdds Ratio\nConfusion Matrix\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve\nR-Squared in context of Logistic Regression\nHosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test\nProject work to practice all the above concepts\nIn the project work, marketers at a cereal company investigate the effectiveness of an ad campaign for a new cereal. Three factors considered in this project are the income, whether the person has seen the advertisement and whether the person has kids in the house.\nHere we performed binary logistic regression to determine whether people who saw the ad are more likely to buy the cereal.\nAfter completing this course, you will be easily able to perform the logistic regression, select the model.",

Instructor stayed on topic and didn't get sidetracked by going down 'rabbit trails' of additional content, which can sometimes happen. I would definitely take another class with the same instructor.\"  Phil Carpenter\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server Profiler is a graphical user interface to SQL Trace for monitoring T-SQL Statements of Database Engine\nSQL Server Profiler is a powerful tool that allows you to capture and analyze events.\nThis information can be used to identify and troubleshoot many SQL Server-related problems.\nOne of the things that separate less knowledgeable DBAs from exceptional ones is that exceptional DBAs know how to take full advantage of the tools available to them.\nEven though Profiler can be used to monitor analysis services and integration services its core use is for tracking down real world issue that happen within SQL Server’s database engine.\nIn this course, we are going to cover the architecture of SQL Server Profiler and then use it to track down performance related issues.\nIn the course, we are also going to cover the nomenclature in detail. What’s an event and for that matter what’s an event class? How do I use them?\nThe interface isn’t that intuitive and in this course we will walk through all the tabs and their meaning as well as learn how to use them to capture only what we want to see, not the thousands of lines we don’t need.\nWith profiler, we can: create traces, watch the trace capture the spids in real time, store it, replay and even save the output to a server to others can view the results in table format.\nThere are several reasons profiler isn’t used more often in the real world. Firstly, the interface isn’t well designed, secondly it creates a ton of data when it’s not filtered and lastly it can consume a lot of resources on the server.\nIf the profiler is configured appropriately to trace only relevant data for analysis, it will diminish the additional load that is introduced while it is running.\nIf profiler is run for a longer duration, then to capture the event of longer duration it is very important to collect selective data, otherwise the collected data can outgrow the space on the server.\nIn this course, we are going to learn how to ameliorate all the “issues” with the tool and learn how to use it effectively in the real world.\nThanks for your interest in Real World SQL Server Profiler.",

      "description": "Business intelligence (BI) helps organizations analyse historical and current data, so they can quickly uncover actionable insights for making strategic decisions.\nBusiness intelligence tools make this possible by processing large data sets across multiple sources and presenting findings in visual formats that are easy to understand and share.\nBusiness intelligence systems combine data gathering, data storage, and knowledge management with data analysis to evaluate and transform complex data into meaningful, actionable information, which can be used to support more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making.\nBusiness intelligence environments consist of a variety of technologies, applications, processes, strategies, products, and technical architectures used to enable the collection, analysis, presentation, and dissemination of internal and external business information.\n\n\nHow business intelligence works\nThere are four keys steps that business intelligence follows to transform raw data into easy-to-digest insights for everyone in the organization to use.  The first three—data collection, analysis, and visualization—set the stage for the final decision-making step. Before using BI, businesses had to do much of their analysis manually, but BI tools automate many of the processes and save companies time and effort.\n\n\nStep 1: Collect and transform data from multiple sources\nBusiness intelligence tools typically use the extract, transform, and load (ETL) method to aggregate structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. This data is then transformed and remodelled before being stored in a central location, so applications can easily analyse and query it as one comprehensive data set.\nStep 2: Uncover trends and inconsistencies\nData mining, or data discovery, typically uses automation to quickly analyse data to find patterns and outliers which provide insight into the current state of business. BI tools often feature several types of data modelling and analytics—including exploratory, descriptive, statistical, and predictive—that further explore data, predict trends, and make recommendations.\nStep 3: Use data visualization to present findings\nBusiness intelligence reporting uses data visualizations to make findings easier to understand and share. Reporting methods include interactive data dashboards, charts, graphs, and maps that help users see what’s going on in the business right now.\nStep 4: Take action on insights in real time\nViewing current and historical data in context with business activities gives companies the ability to quickly move from insights to action. Business intelligence enables real time adjustments and long-term strategic changes that eliminate inefficiencies, adapt to market shifts, correct supply problems, and solve customer issues.\n\n\nPower BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your\nunrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet,\nor a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources,\nvisualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\n\n\nPower BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:\n\n\nA Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.\nAn online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.\nPower BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.\n\n\nTableau is a data visualization and business intelligence tool used for reporting and analysing vast volumes of data.\nIt helps users create different charts, graphs, maps, dashboards, and stories for visualizing and analysing data, to help in making business decisions.\nIt can connect to several data sources . Tableau enables users to create reports by joining and blending different datasets",

Sometimes it gets very frustrated after several attempts. I was there when I started my first job too and have been through this painful learning process. After years of experience, I can resolve most errors nice and quick, and what’s more important, I am able to write code with less and less errors. To bring my know-how to more people, and make you spend less time to build up your experience, I decide to open this course to share my experience.\nThe entire course is split into two sections, the first one is about the log issues, their root cause and how to resolve them, and the second is about good programming practice.\nIn this course, you will be first exposed to many common log issues that most beginners make, and you will learn to understand and troubleshoot them. This helps you create a mindset of keeping a clean log, which is crucial to deliver high quality of products.\nGood programming practice as another important section, will then be introduced to help you prevent the issues beforehand. For beginners and intermediate SAS users, it’s very important to build up a good programming habit, which will be beneficial in long term. For SAS working professionals, the course materials can be served as the SAS programming bible or cheat sheet if you may call, to refer to in your daily job, which will be a very convenient source for log check and good programming practice.\nWHAT DO I EXPECT?\nSpot, understand and solve the log issues like a big shot;\nCreate a mindset to keep a clean log and focus on product quality;\nPrevent the problems upfront by implementing Good Programming Practices;\nBecome an excellent SAS programmer.\nPREREQUISITE COURSES AND KNOWLEDGE:\nBeginner to intermediate SAS level preferred;\nSome SAS Base / Advance knowledge;\nSAS professionals who want to write better code;\nSAS users looking for improvement;\nEntry level SAS users are also welcome.",

      "description": "Power Query is a data transformation and data preparation engine. Power Query comes with a graphical interface for getting data from sources and a Power Query Editor for applying transformations. Because the engine is available in many products and services, the destination where the data will be stored depends on where Power Query was used. Using Power Query, you can perform the extract, transform, and load (ETL) processing of data.\nBusiness users spend up to 80 percent of their time on data preparation, which delays the work of analysis and decision-making. Several challenges contribute to this situation, and Power Query helps address many of them.\nPower Query enables connectivity to a wide range of data sources, including data of all sizes and shapes.\nWhen using Power Query to access and transform data, you define a repeatable process (query) that can be easily refreshed in the future to get up-to-date data.\nIn the event that you need to modify the process or query to account for underlying data or schema changes, you can use the same interactive and intuitive experience you used when you initially defined the query.\nPower Query offers the ability to work against a subset of the entire dataset to define the required data transformations, allowing you to easily filter down and transform your data to a manageable size.\nPower Query queries can be refreshed manually or by taking advantage of scheduled refresh capabilities in specific products (such as Power BI) or even programmatically (by using the Excel object model).\nBecause Power Query provides connectivity to hundreds of data sources and over 350 different types of data transformations for each of these sources, you can work with data from any source and in any shape.\n\n\nThe Power Query user experience is provided through the Power Query Editor user interface. The goal of this interface is to help you apply the transformations you need simply by interacting with a user-friendly set of ribbons, menus, buttons, and other interactive components.\nThe Power Query Editor is the primary data preparation experience, where you can connect to a wide range of data sources and apply hundreds of different data transformations by previewing data and selecting transformations from the UI. These data transformation capabilities are common across all data sources, whatever the underlying data source limitations.",

      "description": "Do you want to learn Tableau and SQL?\nAre you looking for an engaging course that will teach you how to perform A/B testing in real-life situations?\nHow about adding a hands-on data analysis project to your portfolio?\nIf so, then you have come to the right place.\nElevate your website's performance with our Udemy course on Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), with a special focus on Sign-Up Flow Analysis. You'll work on a real-world case study, identifying and fixing sign-up flow issues to increase conversions and maximize your business growth.\nThis comprehensive journey begins with an introduction to the significance of sign-up flow optimization and how even small improvements can significantly impact conversion rates. You'll work with actual data from the 365 data science website to explore the entire sign-up process, spotting potential bottlenecks that may be causing drop-offs.\nUsing SQL in MySQL Workbench, you'll retrieve and analyze key data points, while Tableau visualizations will help you pinpoint inefficiencies in the sign-up and login processes. You'll then craft a Tableau dashboard story to communicate findings effectively and develop an actionable analysis report to guide improvements.\nTo ensure data-driven decision-making, you'll apply A/B Testing, a crucial statistical method for validating hypotheses and measuring the impact of potential optimizations.\nInstead of exploring CRO in a broad and theoretical way, this course focuses on a specific real-life case study—a data-driven analysis that directly impacts business decision-making.\nWe believe the best way to learn CRO is by observing how actual data analysis leads to meaningful changes, in this case, optimizing a sign-up flow to improve conversions. While there are many strategies to enhance a website’s conversion rate, this course stands out for its practical, results-oriented approach.\nYou’ll see first-hand how data shapes decisions, culminating in a real modification of the sign-up screen—a tangible change that drives measurable improvements.

The flexibility of unstructured, schema-less, storage, combined with robust querying and post-processing functionality, make MongoDB a compelling solution for enterprise big data needs.\nWe need to discuss database schemas. Yes, MongoDB is touted as schema-less but here's where we show that proper design is what allows our collections to scale. Indexing is something everyone talks about, but few understand. We'll explain MongoDB indexing, and index properties because a successful indexing strategy is a key to performance and scaling. Finally, we'll talk about CRUD commands from the MongoDB client and how to write effective queries.\nTaking this course will help you understand supported standards and data types in MongoDB, and best practices to design collections to scale and index them. Also, you will learn some basic CRUD commands.\nAbout the Author\nMicheal Shallop started programming in 1981 on a Tandy TRS-80 Model 1 and hasn't stopped since. He graduated in 1991 from Oklahoma State University with an Honors degree in Computer Science. In his career, he's coded in many programming languages and has used a variety of databases, relational and otherwise. He was the technical author of a patent awarded in 2011 for his work on real-time data collection, aggregation and forecasting in a conventional (automotive) business.\nHe is currently working for designing and writing a back-end, event-driven, object-oriented, data-agnostic framework utilizing AMQP as the data transport vector and PHP 7.1 as the primary language. He has been programming in PHP for MongoDB since 2010 and has been the architect of several systems, mostly back-end frameworks.\nMicheal is interested in anything with a programming language behind it. Most recently, he has been experimenting with Arduino, programming on the Raspberry Pi, and writing a social media site in Python. He is also technically skilled in RabbitMQ, general database tech, Python, C/C++, Linux",

If you take this course, you can do away with taking other courses or buying books on R based data science as you will have the keys to a very powerful R supported data science framework.\nIn this age of big data, companies across the globe use R to sift through the avalanche of information at their disposal. By becoming proficient in machine learning, neural networks and deep learning via a powerful framework, H2O in R, you can give your company a competitive edge and boost your career to the next level!\nLEARN FROM AN EXPERT DATA SCIENTIST:\nMy name is Minerva Singh and I am an Oxford University MPhil (Geography and Environment), graduate. I finished a PhD at Cambridge University, UK, where I specialized in data science models.\nI have +5 years of experience in analyzing real-life data from different sources using data science-related techniques and producing publications for international peer-reviewed journals.\nOver the course of my research, I realized almost all the R data science courses and books out there do not account for the multidimensional nature of the topic.\nThis course will give you a robust grounding in the main aspects of practical neural networks and deep learning.\nUnlike other R instructors, I dig deep into the data science features of R and give you a one-of-a-kind grounding in data science...\nYou will go all the way from carrying out data reading & cleaning to finally implementing powerful neural networks and deep learning algorithms and evaluating their performance using R.\nAmong other things:\nYou will be introduced to powerful R-based deep learning packages such as H2O.\nYou will be introduced to important concepts of machine learning without the jargon.\nYou will learn how to implement both supervised and unsupervised algorithms using the H2O framework\nIdentify the most important variables.\nImplement both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with the H2O framework\nWork with real data within the framework\n\n\nNO PRIOR R OR STATISTICS/MACHINE LEARNING KNOWLEDGE IS REQUIRED:\nYou’ll start by absorbing the most valuable R Data Science basics and techniques. I use easy-to-understand, hands-on methods to simplify and address even the most difficult concepts in R.\nMy course will help you implement the methods using real data obtained from different sources. Many courses use made-up data that does not empower students to implement R based data science in real-life.\nAfter taking this course, you’ll easily use the data science package H2O to implement novel deep learning techniques in R. You will get your hands dirty with real-life data, including real-life imagery data which you will learn to pre-process and model\nYou’ll even understand the underlying concepts to understand what algorithms and methods are best suited for your data.\nWe will also work with real data and you will have access to all the code and data used in the course.\nJOIN MY COURSE NOW!",

      "description": "Linear programs are widely used to model real life problems using linear equations and inequalities. There are some decision variables, an objective function and some constraints. Solving linear program means finding such values of decision variables that optimizes the objective function (either maximizes or minimizes depending on the requirement) within identified constraints. None of the constraints should be violated with the solution because such solution cannot be implemented (infeasible solution). The optimum solution is the best one under given constraints.\n\nIt is possible that there is no such solution that satisfies all the constraints. It means that the identified problem has no feasible solution. So, either relax some of the constraints or increase resources. It is possible that there are many feasible solutions and one of them gives the best value for the objective function. In some special cases, there may be multiple optimal solutions. These concepts you cannot learn by learning Linear Programming through features of some software/tool.\n\nSolving a linear program requires lots of computation. Hence, there are tools/ software that can do all these computations for you. They can provide the results in various report forms that can be easy to interpret. So, it may be useful to learn such tool/ software once you are comfortable with the concepts of Linear Programming in Optimization.\n\nCan you learn Linear Programming for Optimization by learning the features of such software/ tool? Do you become better expert of this technique by learning more of such tools/ software? Learning Industry is flooded with such courses that focus on such tool/software. That only creates market for such tools. Success/ progress of you as an expert of Linear Programming is heavily restricted if you learn the topic by learning through such courses focusing on tools.\n\nSuppose, the organization using Liner Programming for Optimization gets additional fund. Where they should allocate this to have best impact on the objective function? Suppose, availability of some resource is adversely impacted due to political adversity in that area. How to handle that to avoid adverse impact on objective function? These are not solving a linear program, but are related to deep understanding and usage of concepts involving linear programming and optimization. There could be plenty of such situations where one has to go beyond computation. This understanding doesn't come through courses focusing on tools/ software.\n\nThis course doesn't talk about any software or tool. It should not. But, it takes you deep into the concepts in intuitive way. This is a must if you want to get the thrill of using Linear Programming and Optimization.\n\nThis course aims at making you comfortable with the most important optimization technique - Linear Programming. It starts with the concept of linear, takes you through linear program formulation, brings you at ease with graphical method for optimization and sensitivity, dives into simplex method to get to the nuances of optimization, prepares you to take advantage of duality and also discusses various special situations that can help you in becoming smart user of this technique.",

This special kind of deep networks is used to make accurate predictions in various fields of research, either academic or practical.\n\n\nIf you want to use R for advanced tasks like image recognition, face detection or handwriting recognition, this course is the best place to start. It’s a hands-on approach on deep learning in R using convolutional neural networks. All the procedures are explained live, step by step, in every detail.\n\n\nMost important, you will be able to apply immediately what you will learn, by simply replicating and adapting the code we will be using in the course.\n\n\nTo build and train convolutional neural networks, the R program uses the capabilities of the Python software. But don’t worry if you don’t know Python, you won’t have to use it! All the analyses will be performed in the R environment. I will tell you exactly what to do so you can call the Python functions from R and create convolutional neural networks.\n\n\nNow let’s take a look at what we’ll cover in this course.\n\n\nThe opening section is meant to provide you with a basic knowledge of convolutional neural networks. We’ll talk about the architecture and functioning of these networks in an accessible way, without getting into cumbersome mathematical aspects. Next, I will give you exact instructions concerning the technical requirements for running the Python commands in R.\n\n\nThe main sections of the course are dedicated to building, training and evaluating convolutional neural networks.\n\n\nWe’ll start with two simple prediction problems where the input variable is numeric. These problems will help us get familiar with the process of creating convolutional neural networks.\n\n\nAfterwards we’ll go to some real advanced prediction situations, where the input variables are images. Specifically, we will learn to:\n\n\nrecognize a human face (distinguish it from a tree – or any other object for that matter)\nrecognize wild animal images (we’ll use images with bears, foxes and mice)\nrecognize special characters (distinguish an asterisk from a hashtag)\nrecognize and classify handwritten numbers.\n\n\nAt the end of the course you’ll be able to apply your knowledge in many image classification problems that you could meet in real life. The practical exercises included in the last section will hopefully help you strengthen you abilities.\n\n\nThis course is your opportunity to make the first steps in a fascinating field – image recognition and classification. It is a complex and demanding field, but don’t let that scare you. I have tried to make everything as easy as possible.\n\n\nSo click the “Enroll” button to get instant access. You will surely acquire some invaluable skills.\n\n\nSee you on the other side!",

Almost every job in the world now relies on Data Analytics. Not only that, but companies will pay huge amounts of money for people with these skills, since it is still such a new market. While this course focuses on MySQL, I will be going over topics that extend into other realms of data analytics, going in depth into what it takes to properly manage a database, and how to analyze a database into meaningful results for a company.\nThe course follows the following format:\nThe first section is an introduction into what MySQL, with an installation of the software as well as the two free data models we will be working with extensively in this course.\nThe next section is a high level overview of data, and database management. I make sure to touch on how data applies to all forms of software and uses, not just within MySQL. At the end will be a review covering the topics we learned, in a way that also tests your ability to apply the new concepts to conceptive questions.\nThe following section will be going over all the basics of SQL, introducing all the topics right away so we can reuse and reapply the functionality over and over in the following sections in more complex queries. The questions at the end will give you a chance to reapply the section's materials in a meaningful way.\nThe next section will be an introduction of relational databases, specifically the 1:m relationship. With this introduction, we will start going over more difficult concepts, slowly building on materials learned in previous sections. Again, this will feature a review quiz at the end, further solidifying all the material you have learned so far.\nIn the many to many section, we will be covering a more advanced relational database, and introduce more MySQL topics scattered throughout the section. As always, we will have a review lecture, and I will make sure to explain the process of data modeling and querying as we go along.\nIn this section we will discuss the final relational modeling concepts, 1:1 relationships and recursive relationships. This will push your understanding of data analytics from beginner to intermediate stages. Recursive relationships are the most difficult to master, so I will be spend a considerable amount of time going over the intricacies in the formulation of each data model. At the end, there will be another review section, which will provide you with another opportunity to go over the material.\nThis section will be a wrap up of data modeling, and we will be going over some more complicated examples of model creation, as well as the rules and standards associated with this field. This review section is set up to test all the data modeling practices we have learned so far in a meaningful and challenging way.\nIn this section, we will talk about Temporal and Spatial Databases, one of the newest and challenging concepts related to Data Analytics. We will go over how these topics are being used to reshape the database world, and go over some of the querying and data modeling techniques associated with them. We will have a review section, touching on the topics learned, as well as showing some conceptual questions related to these young database techniques.\nThe final exam will be featured in this section, which will wrap up everything we have learned into final queries and data modeling examples that will test your knowledge, and give you a chance to see what areas you still need improvement in.\nThis is the first of two bonus sections, introducing two real world database models you would design for clients in MySQL. The data model in this section is an NBA statistics App, called NBA Today,  that we will use to model questions and queries faced by a similar mobile application that is available in the App Store. This will give us a chance to see how data analytics and data modeling is used to solve real world problems.\nThe second bonus section is a business database model, in this instance, a prison system that we have been tasked with answering queries about that will introduce new querying topics and show what a business model will look like when we apply the lessons we have learned. We will build everything from scratch, and I will even show you how I created the dummy data using excel.\nI hope you guys are excited as I am to get into the world of Data Analytics and Database Management. Whether you are a student, trying to learn a new skill, or an entrepreneur, MySQL , and more importantly, data analytics is an extremely important skill to have in today's world. Please, don't be afraid to ask any questions, I will be more than happy to answer them as best as I can.",

      "description": "Dashboards in Power BI are one-page collections of visualizations that are created from within the Power BI service (online). You can create dashboards by pinning visuals from reports.\nWe all live in a data culture where business decisions are based on facts, not opinions. We need data to help us make these decisions. Power BI Desktop is a free application for PCs that lets you gather, transform, and visualize your data. Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service work together. You can create your reports in Power BI Desktop and then publish them to the Power BI Service for others to consume.\nPower BI Desktop connects to many types of data sources, including local databases, worksheets, and data on cloud services. Sometimes when you gather data, it's not quite as structured, or clean, as you want it to be. To structure data, you can transform it, meaning that you can split and rename columns, change data types, and create relationships between columns.\nYou can connect Power BI Desktop to many types of data sources, including on-premises databases, Microsoft Excel workbooks, and cloud services. Currently, there are over 110 Power BI-specific connectors to cloud services such as GitHub  You can also connect to generic sources through XML, CSV, text, and ODBC. Power BI will even extract tabular data directly from a website URL.\nData doesn't always come into your report clean, or ready to use. You may need additional columns or to rename or hide existing columns. You may have multiple data sources and need to define a relationship between them. All of these tasks are known as data transformation.\nVisuals allow you to present data in a compelling and insightful way and help you to highlight the important components. Power BI has many compelling visuals and many more are released frequently.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Business Intelligence: From Foundation to Advanced Analytics course by Uplatz.\n\n\nUplatz provides this comprehensive Business Intelligence training to help you get started on your journey in Business Intelligence and Analytics.\nThe course covers the BI concepts from scratch and take you through the complete lifecycle of Business Intelligence beginning with understanding data, data warehousing, and building data visualization and useful BI reports & analyzes over top of the data.\n\n\nWhat is Business Intelligence\nBusiness intelligence is a concept that integrates reporting, business analytics, data mining, data visualization, data tools & infrastructure, data governance, and best practices to help organizations make informed data-driven decisions. A company can drive growth and make an impact in the modern world only by having a comprehensive view of its enterprise data and using that data to drive change, eliminate inefficiencies, as well as quickly adapting to market or supply changes. BI helps you analyze data to gain actionable insights and improve decision making for your business.\nBI empowers the organizations to analyze historical and current data, so that actionable insights for making strategic decisions can be uncovered in real-time. Various Business intelligence tools make this possible by processing large data sets across multiple sources and presenting findings in visual formats that are easy to understand and share.\nBusiness intelligence (BI) essentially refers to an overarching term for the tools & technologies that enables data preparation, data management, data mining, data governance, finally data visualization and building dashboards. BI tools and processes allow end users to identify actionable information from raw data, facilitating data-driven decision-making within organizations cutting through domains & industries.\n\n\nBusiness Intelligence: From Foundation to Advanced Analytics - Course Curriculum\n\n\nIntroduction to Business Intelligence\nIntroduction to Data Warehousing\nReal-time BI\nApache Server\nNoSQL and Cluster Computing\nData Analytics\nData Mining\nClustering Analysis Algorithms\nDBSCAN\nRegression Models\nMachine Learning Techniques in Business Intelligence\nMachine Learning vs. BI\nPredictive Analysis Tools\nCrowdsourcing Data\nIntroduction to Business Analysis\nIntroduction to Data Models\nDeep-dive into Data Warehousing\nImportant Concepts of Business Intelligence\nBusiness Operational Intelligence\n\n\nBI Tools\nThere are some really good BI tools available in the market that aid business users in analyzing performance metrics and extracting insights in real time. These tools focus on self-service capabilities, reducing IT dependencies and enabling decision-makers to recognize performance gaps, market trends, or new revenue opportunities more quickly. Some of the key BI tools currently in the marketplace are:\n\n\nTableau\nPower BI\nQlik\nMicroStrategy\nSAS Visual Analytics\nTIBCO Spotfire\nOracle Analytics Cloud\nand more.\n\n\nKey processes involved in the BI journey include:\n\n\nData preparation: Integrating multiple data sources, identifying the dimensions and facts (measurements), preparing the same for data analysis.\nQuerying: Asking the data specific questions, BI pulling the answers from the datasets.\nReporting: Sharing data analysis with stakeholders so they can draw conclusions and make decisions.\nData visualization: Turning data analysis into visual representations such as charts, graphs and histograms to more easily consume data.\nUser stories: Exploring data through visual storytelling to communicate insights on the fly and stay in the flow of analysis.\nData Analytics: Using historical data analysis to detect useful trends and patterns.\nData mining: Using databases, statistics and machine learning to uncover trends in large datasets.\nPerformance metrics and benchmarking: Comparing current performance data to historical data to track performance against goals, typically using customized dashboards.\nStatistical analysis: Taking the results from descriptive analytics and further exploring the data using statistics, such as how this trend happened and why.\n\n\nBenefits of Business Intelligence\nBusiness intelligence can help companies make better decisions by showing present and historical data within their business context. Analysts can use BI to provide performance and competitor benchmarks to make the organization run smoother and more efficiently. Analysts can also more easily spot market trends to increase sales or revenue. Used effectively, the right data can help with anything from compliance to hiring efforts. BI applications are commonly used to make informed business decisions, advancing a company’s position and providing an edge. Moreover, user adoption of BI continues to increase at a rapid pace, especially as customers migrate workloads to the cloud and self-service BI becoming a norm. Vendors are increasingly supportive of different cloud platform providers, leading to more SaaS-based BI solutions and subscription-based pricing models.\n\nAdvantages of Business Intelligence in making data-driven decisions and driving organizational growth\n\n\nKey decision-making at the right time\nExplore ways to increase profit\nAnalyze customer behavior and patterns\nAccurate tracking of sales, marketing, and financial performance\nOptimize operations\nPredict success\nSpot market trends\nDiscover issues or problems\nIncreased efficiency of operational processes\nClear benchmarks based on historical and current data\nGenerate alerts about data anomalies and operational issues\nAnalyses that can be shared in real-time across departments\nInsights into trending products & services that can be launched\nReduced go-to-market time by empowering strategic product/service decisions\n\n\nBecause business intelligence tools speed up information analysis and performance evaluation, they’re valuable in helping companies reduce inefficiencies, flag potential problems, find new revenue streams, and identify areas of future growth. In the past business intelligence tools were primarily used by data analysts and IT users but now self-service BI platforms make business intelligence available to everyone from executives to operations teams.\n\n\nThere are some keys steps that business intelligence follows to transform raw data into easy-to-digest insights for everyone in the organization to use.\na) Data integration from multiple sources\nBusiness intelligence tools typically use the ETL (extract, transform, load) method or the more modern ELT (extract, load, transform) to aggregate structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. This data is then transformed and remodeled before being stored in a central location, so applications can easily analyze and query it as one comprehensive data set.\nb) Knowledge discovery\nData mining, or data discovery, typically uses automation to quickly analyze data to find patterns and outliers which provide insight into the current state of business. BI tools often feature several types of data modeling and analytics including exploratory, descriptive, statistical, and predictive techniques, that further explore data, predict trends, and make recommendations.\nc) Dashboards & Data Visualization\nBusiness intelligence reporting uses data visualizations to make findings easier to understand and share. Reporting methods include interactive data dashboards, charts, graphs, and maps that help users see what’s going on in the business right now.\nd) Insights & Analytics in real time\nViewing current and historical data in context with business activities gives companies the ability to quickly move from insights to action. Business intelligence enables real time adjustments and long-term strategic changes that eliminate inefficiencies, adapt to market shifts, correct supply problems, and solve customer issues.",

      "description": "Dashboards are popular way to make data digestible using data visualization. In the business world, dashboards can be a powerful way to communicate important information at a glance, monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and take action. However they often fail and have low adoption because they are not effective, useful or actionable. The most common reason is because people dive straight into building a dashboard in their Business Intelligence (BI) tool or Analytics Platform of choice before taking the time to design a dashboard that is meaningful for the user and provides them actionable insight.\nI created this 5-step data visualization and dashboard design method to address these problems by applying the principles of User-Centered Design. Over the past decade, I have used it successfully and consistently for my Fortune 500 clients, irrespective of the BI tool or Analytics platform they were using, including Tableau, Power BI, or MicroStrategy. This method also works for more static data visualizations and dashboards in common tools like MS Excel and PowerPoint.\nYou will learn how to apply these 5 steps in a quick, concise and no-fluff format:\nIdentify User Roles & Needs\nEvaluate Metrics & Key Performance Indicators\nIdeate Visualization\nCreate Prototype\nValidate & Iterate\nYou will learn how to apply these 5 steps and design data visualizations and dashboards before beginning any development. This design process works for all BI tool or Analytics Platforms, and you do not need to be a developer. This course focuses how people consume information and shows you how you can apply design principles and steps to design dashboards and data visualization that can then be built in any technology.\nIf you are interested in improving your dashboards, data visualization, information visualizations as an analyst, project manager, designer, developer, this course will show you the 5 steps you should take to visualize data and make it effective, insightful and actionable.",

      "description": "Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\nPower BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:\nA Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.\nAn online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.\nPower BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.\nSQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is a reporting software that allows you to produce formatted reports with tables in the form of data, graph, images, and charts. These reports are hosted on a server that can be executed any time using parameters defined by the users. It is part of Microsoft SQL Server Services suite.\n\n\nSQL Server Integration Services is a platform for building enterprise-level data integration and data transformations solutions. Use Integration Services to solve complex business problems by copying or downloading files, loading data warehouses, cleansing and mining data, and managing SQL Server objects and data.\nIntegration Services can extract and transform data from a wide variety of sources such as XML data files, flat files, and relational data sources, and then load the data into one or more destinations.\nIntegration Services includes a rich set of built-in tasks and transformations, graphical tools for building packages, and the Integration Services Catalog database, where you store, run, and manage packages.\nYou can use the graphical Integration Services tools to create solutions without writing a single line of code. You can also program the extensive Integration Services object model to create packages programmatically and code custom tasks and other package objects.\nSQL Server Analysis services (SSAS) is a multi-dimensional OLAP server as well as an analytics engine that allows you to slice and dice large volumes of data. It is part of Microsoft SQL Server and helps perform analysis using various dimensions. It has 2 variants Multidimensional and Tabular. The SSAS full form is SQL Server Analysis Services.\nAnalysis Services is an analytical data engine (VertiPaq) used in decision support and business analytics. It provides enterprise-grade semantic data model capabilities for business intelligence (BI), data analysis, and reporting applications such as Power BI, Excel, Reporting Services, and other data visualization tools. Analysis Services is available in different platforms.\nSQL Server is a software application designed to manage databases, it stores and retrieves data as requested by other applications. When software developers are writing new business applications that store information in a database they will very often use SQL Server’s functionality to look after the databases rather than reinventing the wheel writing their own code to do the same thing. This makes writing database applications easier and quicker (and therefore cheaper) as well as making them more reliable, scalable and secure.\nSQL Server is known as a “Relational Database” Management System. Data is stored in tables in a similar way to rows and columns in a spreadsheet. If you imagine a database containing accounting information you may have a table for each invoice with values, VAT, Totals, invoice number etc. Each invoice relates to a customer but instead of recording the customer’s details (name, address, discounts etc.) with each invoice you just record it once in a separate table called Customers. The Customers table and Invoices table are linked or “related”.\nThe “Management System” part of SQL Server makes sure the databases are stored efficiently and the data can be searched or retrieved as quickly as possible. It also makes sure multiple people connecting to the same data are managed properly so you don’t get problems if two people change the same information at the same time.",

So, we requested Haitham to conduct a 5-day workshop in our office to train 8 staff members, which opened us up as a team to deeper data analysis. Today, we have gone a step further and retained Haitham, as a consultant, to take our data analysis to the next level and to help us implement inventory guidelines for our business. The above progression of our actions is a clear indication of the capabilities of Haitham as a specialist in R and in data analytics, demand planning, and inventory management.\"\n\n\nShailesh Mendonca\nCommercial lead-in Adventure AHQ- Sharaf Group\n\n\n\n\n“ Haytham mentored me in my Role of Head of Supply Chain efficiency.

      "description": "If you already have a running Cloudera Manager installation this course follows on with the logic behind the placement of the Hadoop master/slave daemons across your cluster. We actually go ahead and discuss the placement and perform the installation of Hadoop.\n\nIf you do not have a Cloudera Manager installation and you want to follow along hands on, you can complete the course : \"Real World Vagrant - Automate a Cloudera Manager Build - Toyin Akin\" beforehand.\n\n\n\"Big Data\" technology is a hot and highly valuable skill to have – and this course will teach you how to quickly deploy a Hadoop Cluster using the Cloudera stack.\nCloudera allows you to download a QuickStart Virtual machine which is great for developers, but this is of no use for the Operations team to start the planning and the building out of DEV / UAT and PROD environments within their organizations. What assumptions were made when the QuickStart VM was put together?\n\nIn addition, hosting all of Cloudera's processes as well as Hadoop's processes on one VM is not a model that any large organization can or should follow. The Hadoop services need to be split out across multiple VMs/Servers. In fact that's the whole point out Hadoop!\nDistributed Data and Distributed Compute.\n\nAfter all, if you are developing against or operating a distributed environment, it needs to be tested. Tested in terms of the forcing various failure modes within the cluster and ensuing that the cluster can still respond to user requests. Killing the QuickStart VM destroys the entire cluster!\nYou'll learn the same techniques these large enterprise guys use to move to the next step in building out an enterprise grade Hadoop cluster.\nIf you are a developer, the operations team can build out that centralized cluster in which you are truly testing against a distributed cluster. Testing code against the Quickstart VM may work, but as any experienced distributed developer knows, verifying code against a pseudo cluster on a single machine is different than verifying against code against a truly distributed cluster.\nAs an example bottlenecks in Networks or CPU cycles will come to light. In addition, this will also assist in capacity planing of the UAT / PROD cluster as initial metrics can be acquired.\nIf you are in operations then this gives the operations team an environment for the team to start learning how to jointly operate the cluster. Here the team can start to understand cluster metrics, adding/removing cluster nodes, managing the various Hadoop services (Zookeeper, HDFS, YARN and Spark) and a lot more. We also look at managing Cloudera Hadoop Parcels as well as changing Hadoop versions once a cluster is deployed.\nThe operation team can start to develop procedures and change management documentation ready for Production operation of a Hadoop cluster.\n.\n\nHere I present a curriculum as to the current state of my Cloudera courses.\nMy Hadoop courses are based on Vagrant so that you can practice and destroy your virtual environment before applying the installation onto real servers/VMs.\n.\nFor those with little or no knowledge of the Hadoop eco system Udemy course : Big Data Intro for IT Administrators, Devs and Consultants\n.\nI would first practice with Vagrant so that you can carve out a virtual environment on your local desktop. You don't want to corrupt your physical servers if you do not understand the steps or make a mistake. Udemy course : Real World Vagrant For Distributed Computing\n.\nI would then, on the virtual servers, deploy Cloudera Manager plus agents. Agents are the guys that will sit on all the slave nodes ready to deploy your Hadoop services Udemy course : Real World Vagrant - Automate a Cloudera Manager Build\n.\nThen deploy the Hadoop services across your cluster (via the installed Cloudera Manager in the previous step or your own Cloudera Manager installation). We look at the logic regarding the placement of master and slave services. Udemy course : Real World Hadoop - Deploying Hadoop with Cloudera Manager\n.\nIf you want to play around with HDFS commands (Hands on distributed file manipulation). Udemy course : Real World Hadoop - Hands on Enterprise Distributed Storage.\n.\nYou can also automate the deployment of the Hadoop services via Python (using the Cloudera Manager Python API). But this is an advanced step and thus I would make sure that you understand how to manually deploy the Hadoop services first. Udemy course : Real World Hadoop - Automating Hadoop install with Python!\n.\nThere is also the upgrade step. Once you have a running cluster, how do you upgrade to a newer hadoop cluster (Both for Cloudera Manager and the Hadoop Services).

      "description": "Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), a second-generation multivariate technique, has become a widely used technique for examining complex business and social research models. SEM is expressly considered prominent in behavioral studies where the variables are latent. There are two types of SEM where covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM) is primarily used to confirm (or reject) theories (i.e., a set of systematic relationships between multiple variables that can be tested empirically).\nThe most popular and user-friendly software package for CB-SEM is AMOS (Analysis of Moments Structures), which enables researchers to analyze the inter-relationships among constructs having multiple indicators in a model, where the inter-relationships are estimated simultaneously. AMOS is also owned by IBM, and the software is intertwined with SPSS; hence, it's also officially known as IBM SPSS AMOS. Moreover, SmartPLS 4 also offers the facility for analyzing models based on CB-SEM.\nThis course provides a step-by-step guide to CB-SEM and Path Analysis using IBM AMOS and SmartPLS 4. Whether you're a researcher, data analyst, or student, this course will equip you with the skills to perform complex statistical analyses and interpret results confidently.

      "description": "Data being the backbone of all businesses and organizations in the world today makes interacting with data even more critical to gain insights and make informed decisions. Most business teams rely on the data analytics or insights team to interpret data and generate insights, which can lead to inefficiency within the organization.\n\n\nEarlier businesses used to have limited data, and all this data could have been analyzed by the limited people in the insights team of the company with immense technical knowledge. But now the landscape has changed drastically!!! it has come to a point where even non-technical roles require analysis of some form of data to make their decisions. And that is where the problem comes in. People in roles like - marketing, HR, operations, sales, etc., have less or less technical knowledge. These people rely on the insight team for even the smallest insights. This leads to inefficiencies in the process and a lot of loss to the company.\n\n\nAnd this is precisely where no-code tools come in. No-code tools like Orange Data Mining and Tableau have revolutionized how businesses handle data analytics and visualization. These platforms democratize data science by making it accessible to individuals who may not have programming skills, thereby widening the pool of talent capable of deriving insights from data.

You will learn to connect and execute database queries from Java Code.\nYou will learn how to establish a connection from Java code to the database and perform different operations like Select, Insert, Update, and Delete.\nYou will also get the complete source code.\nDatabases are essential tools for storing and organizing large amounts of data, and they have become increasingly important as the amount of data that organizations collect continues to grow. A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that makes it easy to access, manage, and update. Some common types of databases include relational databases, NoSQL databases, and graph databases.\nOne of the most popular languages for working with databases is SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a programming language that allows users to manipulate and query data stored in a database. It can be used to create tables, insert data into tables, update data in tables, and retrieve data from tables. SQL is a declarative language, which means that users specify what they want to do with the data, and the database management system (DBMS) figures out how to do it.\nJDBC, which stands for Java Database Connectivity, is a Java API for connecting to databases and executing SQL statements. JDBC provides a standard interface for Java programs to interact with databases, making it easier for developers to work with different types of databases. With JDBC, developers can create database connections, execute SQL statements, and retrieve results from queries.\nTogether, SQL and JDBC are powerful tools for working with databases. SQL allows users to manipulate data stored in a database, while JDBC provides a standardized way for Java programs to connect to and interact with databases. This combination of tools has become a cornerstone of modern data-driven applications, enabling organizations to collect, store, and analyze vast amounts of data to gain insights and make better decisions.",

      "description": "Hi Everyone and Thank YOU for visiting this course on learning Tableau. Have you ever wanted to learn Tableau but thought \"Hmm! But I'm no data analyst, and I don't understand data!\" ? If so then this course is for you! When designing \"Tableau For the Non-Technical Backgrounds\" I kept in mind that folks just like you across an organization or fresh out of school that do not understand the technical lingo of a Data Analyst and other technical roles need to work with data too! And they also need to learn a super hot industry skill that they are now seeing more and more everywhere.\n\n\nWelcome to my course on Tableau, where I approach each and every lecture with one thing in mind - That not everyone is a data analyst, but everyone loves cool looking visual dashboards they can present and impress their teams with. I have committed to this style of teaching technical topics to non-technical folks for over 10 years and across the organizations I've worked at, have gotten great feedback on my teaching style. This is what brought me to Udemy where I could share my non-tech savvy teaching style with the world, So if you're someone who's wanted to learn a new technical skill, but have no technical background, or are brand new to the world of data, then this course was specially designed for you!\n\n\nNote from your instructor:\nI care about the success of each and everyone of you and this message is to say Thank you for letting me pursue my dream of becoming an instructor on Udemy. I will be launching courses in the future and I believe that my students come first. Because of this I pledge to keep my courses as affordable as possible allowed by Udemy, Always.\n\n\nThank you from your instructor,\nWaqar Ahmad",

In many jobs programming is essential nowadays! We both studied Engineering and Science, tried many different tools to analyze Data and we both believe python is the best way to do it!\n\n\nEnough with the nice words. What can you expect from the course:\nIntroduction and Setup Software (Anaconda| JupyterNotebooks | Jupyterlab) -> If you just want to see if Jupyter is the right tool you can start running jupyter on a server! I prepared a mybinder server for you! (No installation necessary!)\n\n\nJupyter and Python basics (Syntax, Data types, Operators, control structures, Modules, Import an find Libraries, use documentation)\n\n\nIntroduction to Scientific Packages + Syntax (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, SciPy ...)\n\n\nProject 1: Experimental Data analysis (Example: Resistance of Lithium Ion Batteries) - Full automatic Workflow |  Read Data and Filter Data (Pandas) | Manipulate Data (Numpy) | Fit Data (SciPy interpolate) | Symbolic Math (SymPy) |  Statistics\n\n\nProject 2: Numerical Simulation (Example: Heat Simulation) - Manipulate Arrays (Numpy) | Nested for loops | Heat Maps (Seaborn) | Create Dashboard with Voila\nWe put a lot of effort in this course and we hope you like it! :) If you have any questions don't hesitate an contact us!",

This discount is based on the customer's sales volume over a specified time period.\nYou define the details of the rebate in a rebate agreement . In the agreement you specify, for example\nwho receives the rebate payment\non what criteria the rebate is based (customer, customer and material, and so on).\nSince rebates are not paid until the validity period of the rebate agreement has ended, the system must keep track of all billing documents (invoices, credit and debit memos) that are relevant for rebate processing. The system automatically posts accruals so that accounting has an overview of the cumulated value of the rebate.\nA rebate agreement is finally settled when you issue a credit memo to the customer for the accumulated rebate total.\nYou can set up rebates at any level just like pricing. The following rebate types are available in the standard system:\nRebate based on a material\nRebate based on a customer\nRebate based on a group of materials\nSales independent rebate\nPrerequisites\nYou can process rebate agreements when the following prerequisite conditions are met:\nThe sales organization in which the sales order is processed must be relevant for rebate processing. Your system administrator sets this indicator in Customizing for Sales.\nThe payer must be subject to volume-based rebates. In many cases, the payer is the same as the customer. So that the customer can receive a rebate, the Rebate field must be selected on the billing screen of the customer master record.\nThe billing type used (invoice, credit memo, and so on) must be relevant for rebate processing. Your system administrator sets this indicator when defining billing types in Customizing for Sales.\n\n\nRebate Configuration in SAP SD\nThe rebate configuration process in SAP SD consists of ten steps:\n\n\nDefine agreement type\nCondition type groups\nCondition technique for rebate processing\nAccount determination for rebates\nActivate rebate processing\nCreate a rebate agreement\nCreate a sales order\nCreate delivery\nCreate billing document\nGo to the created rebate agreement.\nA rebate is an agreement between the company and the customer which is valid for a specific time period. The rebate agreement specifies the percentage of rebate offered to the customer during the specified period. The system calculates the rebate accruals for each applicable invoice and posts them to the corresponding G/L accounts and also updates them in the corresponding rebate agreement. At the end of the rebate agreement validity period, the company will reimburse the rebate amount to the customer.\n\n\nThe rebate process in the following 3 steps.\nConfiguring rebates.\nSetting-up rebate agreements.\nManaging rebate agreements and payments.\n\n\nyou can find sap paths in session explanation.\nreal time interview difference between erb and eru key in sap ecc or s4 hana\nLETS LEARN, SALE PROMOTIONS AND SALE DEALS...IN S4 HANA",

        "MapReduce or Hadoop is something that people get barely get exposure to as compared to the programming languages. It could be considered a unique technology. So it is obvious that one must have to possess below skills to being learning the MapReduce certification course. Programming Fundamental: You must know the basics of programming as you will be supposed to write programs in HIVE, PIG and so on. Though it is not the sole of Hadoop, you should have some idea about coding. Good Communication: As the processed outcome has to be presented to the next action takers, you should have good communication skills. Well, not just here but everywhere you must have some unique to present data. Analysis fundamentals: MS Excel provides us an interface where we can work with data. Thought the size of data is not that much but still, it gives you an idea of how the data could be processed."

      "description": "MapReduce can be defined as the sub-module of Hadoop that offer huge scalability of data spread across numerous of commodity clusters. MapReduce comprises of two things that work consecutively to process the analytics. The process in both the different parts is done in a parallel manner helping save a lot of time while working with significant data. In the traditional data analysis approach, the data was analyzed serially and MapReduce overcomes that problem.\nAs it’s named sound, it involves mapping and reducing process which is done by mappers and reducers. The dataset gets divided equally among different mappers and all of the processes or analyses the data in a parallel manner. Once the mapper produces the outcome, reducers come in to generate the outcome. The role of the reducer is to collect the data from all the mappers and then process their outcome to get the final result.\nFor instance, if Flipkart needs to find out the total sell in 2018 in Mumbai. The entire process will flow below.\nThe entire dataset will be divided into months which means the sell data of one year will be divided into 12 months like how much they made each month from which location.\nThe dataset will be then assigned to 12 mappers.\nEach mapper will find out in which city and how of how much the goods were sold.\nAfter the mappers generate the report, now it comes to the turn of reducers.\nThe reducers will grab the sell value from every month for Mumbai location.\nEventually, they will all sell value to generate the outcome.\nIn this MapReduce training course, you will learn something that is going to be the next big thing soon, generating lots of opportunities in the new future. You will learn how to work with mass data, unstructured data. Working with various kinds of data and try to get all of them on the same page anyway is what you will study here. In technical terms, you will be getting a practical insight into the working of data scientists. In addition to data processing, you will also learn to develop a program in HIVE, PIG, MapReduce, and Sqoop.\nEvery organization has its requirement for data analysis so it is very important to develop a customized program that can generate the desired output. You will see and learn how the sub-modules of Hadoop like PIG or HIVE could be used to reduce the complexity of the program. In addition to all those vital things, you will learn which framework should you use and in which case. By the time you come to the end of the MapReduce certification, you will be enough cognizant to play with abundant data.",
      "target_audience": [
        "MapReduce is the kind of technology that needs some prior experience as data analytics to learn it efficiently. It is kind of a vast topic and hence mostly preferred by working professionals. So if we talk about the target audience. Of course, working folks will be the best audience who can opt for this MapReduce certification course to enhance their expertise. Coming to students, most of them prefer to have internships to begin their professional careers. So all the students who want to work as an intern in reputed organizations should learn MapReduce as it can give a good kick start to their career. By using several modules taught here like HIVE or PIG, students can leverage it to make some basic projects as well. People who are working in any other domain of information technology but wants to jump in as data scientists could be the perfect audience for this MapReduce certification course as nothing is best than a person willing to learn. Though it will be a bit hard to begin the things right after changing the domain, it’s also true that it won’t take much time to have you dive deep into this technology."

      "description": "Business intelligence; the term is bandied about so frequently today that it might seem like everyone except you already understands it. The truth is that like its partner “Big Data”, business intelligence is actually not well understood at all. Most people who talk about business intelligence have at best a general notion of what it means and almost no experience with actually using BI in a meaningful way. However, BI is an important new tool for modern business. Advances in computing power can now give businesses ways to analyze data that they never could before. With these advances, firms can make decisions about pricing, marketing, new products, and resource allocation more effectively than they have ever been able to in the past. Major corporations like Kroger are starting to use BI to help determine what products they should advertise to specific customers. General Electric is using BI to more efficiently run its industrial maintenance schedules. Citi is using BI to help proactively figure out the maximum interest rates various customers are willing to pay. BI is useful in all of these settings and a lot more.\nIn this short course, you will learn the basics of what is business intelligence is, why it's useful, and how it can help with your business. This course will also prepare you for future hands on courses that will go through the steps of a business intelligence project in greater depth.",

We need to prepare the data to make it suitable for analysis to retrieve useful insights.\nIn the world of power bi, we have a Power query like an ETL for the data warehouse. Whenever we perform any operation on the data, the power query generates M code, a formula language. M formula language contains a rich set of different functions for data transformation & cleaning.\nWhy learn M formula language\nIn power bi, we have a graphical user interface that we use to perform different operations on the data. Still, unfortunately, this interface is minimal. We cannot perform all the data related operations on it by using a graphical user interface.\nAlmost every month, Microsoft releases new versions of Power BI, which have new graphical tools in the power bi ribbon. However, we still have to depend on the unique features of the power query graphical user interface.\nWe can overcome this dependency by learning the Power Query M language. M language is much more powerful than the Power query because the entire underlying auto-generated code will be in our hands.\nIn this course, You will learn all the building blocks of Power query M language to master it on your own.\nThis course will give you a clear path about the M language on how to implement any available function for data transformation.\nNew upcoming features & functions will be added in this course from time to time.\nAbout me\nMy name is Muhammad Asif, and I will be your instructor in this course. I have more than ten years of experience in data & analytics with one of the world's leading organizations. I am a Microsoft certified solution expert in data analytics & management.\nI have developed several data models, dashboards & reports for a different line of services. You can learn from my experience, and I will share each and everything. I aim to spread the knowledge by simplifying hard concepts.\nI wish you all the best for your journey in Power BI & M formula language.",

R is one of the most widely used open source languages for data and graph analysis. It is platform-independent and allows users to load various packages as well as develop their own packages to interpret data better. R gives aspiring analysts and data scientists the ability to represent complex sets of data in an impressive way. So, if you're a data science professional and want to learn about the powerful data visualization techniques of R, then go for this Learning Path.\nThis comprehensive 3-in-1 course follows a practical approach, where each recipe presents unique functions of plots, charts, and maps as well as visualization of 2D and 3D interactive plots in a step-by-step manner! You’ll begin with generating various plots in R using the basic R plotting techniques. Utilize R packages to add context and meaning to your data. Finally, you'll design interactive visualizations and integrate them on your website or blog!\nBy the end of the course, you’ll master the visualization capabilities of R to build interactive graphs, plots, and Pie charts as well as visualize 2D and 3D interactive plots.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 3 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Learning R for Data Visualization, covers getting to grips with R’s most popular packages and functions to create interactive visualizations for the web. We start by importing data in R from popular formats such as CSV and Excel tables. Then you will learn how to create basic plots such as histograms, scatterplots, and more, with the default options, which guarantees stunning results. In the final part of the course, the Shiny package will be extensively discussed. This allows you to create fully-featured web pages directly from the R console, and Shiny also allows it to be uploaded to a live website where your peers and colleagues can browse it and you can share your work. You will see how to build a complete website to import and plot data, plus we will present a method to upload it for everybody to use. Finally, you will revise all the concepts you've learned while having some fun creating a complete website.\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have an armor full of different visualization techniques, with the capacity to apply these abilities to real-world data sets.\nThe second course, R Data Visualization - Basic Plots, Maps, and Pie Charts, covers mastering the visualization capabilities of R to build interactive graphs, plots, and Pie. We start - off with the basics of R plots and an introduction to heat maps and customizing them. After this, we gradually take you through creating interactive maps using the googleVis package. Finally, we generate choropleth maps and contouring maps, bubble plots, and pie charts.\nThe third course, R Data Visualization - Word Clouds and 3D Plots, covers advanced visualization techniques in R to build word clouds, 3D plots, and more. We start off with the basics of R plots and an introduction to heat maps and customizing them. After this, we gradually take you through creating interactive maps using the googleVis package. Finally, we generate choropleth maps and contouring maps, bubble plots, and pie charts.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll master the visualization capabilities of R to build interactive graphs, plots, and Pie charts as well as visualize 2D and 3D interactive plots.\nAbout the Authors\nFabio Veronesi obtained a Ph.D. in digital soil mapping from Cranfield University and then moved to ETH Zurich, where he has been working for the past three years as a postdoc.

You’ll practice Power Query for data prep, create a tidy data model, and assemble a smooth user experience with a home page, intuitive navigation, and readable visuals. Along the way, you’ll use checklists, naming conventions, and simple validation tips to make your work credible and repeatable.\nBy the end, you’ll have a portfolio-ready Power BI project that proves you can turn raw data into insights, communicate results with charts that make sense, and ship a dashboard people want to use. If your goal is an entry-level data analyst role, moving from Excel to Power BI, or leveling up your business intelligence skills, this course gives you the structure, repetition, and confidence you need.\nYou’ll leave with: a complete Power BI dashboard, reusable DAX patterns, interview talking points, and a clean case study you can share on your resume, LinkedIn, or in a portfolio review.

      "description": "The \"Generative AI for Business Analysts\" course is a comprehensive and hands-on program designed to equip modern Business Analysts (BAs) with the tools, techniques, and strategies to fully leverage the power of generative AI in business analysis. As AI continues to transform business functions, this course bridges the gap between traditional BA practices and intelligent automation, focusing on how tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others can optimize requirement gathering, documentation, stakeholder communication, and decision-making.\nThe course begins by exploring the evolving role of generative AI in core business functions, followed by foundational training in prompt engineering tailored for BAs. Participants will learn to generate AI-driven templates for stakeholder interviews, auto-create user stories, use cases, and acceptance criteria, and design smart interview questions that align with project goals. Using AI, learners will convert stakeholder input into structured documents and simulate stakeholder interviews for requirement generation.\nThrough real-world exercises, learners will generate BPMN diagrams, process flows, and journey maps directly from text, critique existing workflows, and even produce process models from emails or meeting notes. A strong data module will demonstrate how GenAI can support exploratory data analysis (EDA), interpret structured and unstructured trends, create dashboards, and drive compelling data storytelling using tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.\nAdvanced lectures include using AI to generate BRDs, FRDs, SRS, and user manuals, detect contradictions in documents, auto-translate business content, perform competitive analysis, and create SWOT, PESTEL, and Porter's Five Forces frameworks. The course also covers role-playing stakeholder simulations, AI-generated communication plans, and conflict resolution techniques. Integrated with popular BA tools (Jira, Confluence, Miro, Trello), no-code platforms, and a library of 1000 GenAI prompts across 50 topics, this course prepares BAs to lead digital transformation with confidence and clarity.",

And to go along with it, we have DAX intermediate and DAX Advanced.\nIn this Power BI DAX Essentials course, we will focus on giving you a good grounding in the DAX language, and making sure that you are confident with all of the basics.\nWe'll discuss the three objects which DAX is capable of creating: calculated columns, calculated tables, and calculated measures.\nYou'll learn how to write your DAX in such a way that you are far less likely to make errors. You'll learn how to use the formula bar in the most effective manner, how to add comments to your DAX measures, how to use auto-complete effectively to minimize the errors that you make; and the course even contains a section dedicated to discussing the most common errors that people make and how you can avoid making them.\nThis is very much a hands-on course, and you'll get plenty of real-world practice in writing DAX, and learning to structure your DAX in such a way that you start with basic measures, which then become the building blocks to your more advanced measures.\nYou'll learn when to use DAX calculated columns in preference to Power Query computed columns, and also the circumstances when calculated columns should be used in preference to measures. But since measures are the most important DAX calculation, most of the course will be dedicated to discussing the creation of measures: some of the key functions that you'll need to use and the technique of nesting functions, whereby one function becomes the argument of another.\nYou will master iterator functions, which enable you to aggregate a virtual column, saving you the overhead of having to physically add a column to the data model. And you'll also get a good handle on the calculate function, the most important function in the DAX language.\nBy the end of the course, you'll feel confident and comfortable writing DAX formulas.",

      "description": "The Power BI Intermediate course by G Com Solutions is designed for users who are already familiar with Power BI and are looking to broaden their horizons when it comes to creating reports and dashboards.\nThe course will extend your knowledge of the Query Editor by showing your how to use query parameters and templates to add power and flexibility to your report creation. You will learn how to use query parameters to control data sources and to filter data as it’s loaded into the data model.\nThe course also discusses row-level security (RLS), the creation of roles and the implementation of RLS in the Power BI service. And we’ll also see how to leverage the DAX USERNAME function to create roles which are based on the user’s login.\nWe then move on to the integration of Power BI with other Microsoft products. We look at the incorporation of Excel solutions into Power BI workspaces and how to use the Analyze in Excel feature to build Excel reports driven by Power BI datasets. We also discuss the pinning of Excel content to Power BI dashboards and how to leverage Power BI’s dashboard subscription feature to distribute Excel content to a much wider audience than is normally possible.\nWe look at connecting to SharePoint folders and sub-folders, connecting to SharePoint lists and the security implications involved when embedding Power BI reports within SharePoint pages.\nWe also discuss PowerPoint integration: the tenant settings which control the ability to export reports to PowerPoint, the mechanism for exporting reports; and how to get the most out of this feature by optimizing your reports specifically for PowerPoint export.\nThe course then moves on to the configuration and implementation of drill-through pages and this includes a discussion of cross-report drill-through and how to overcome some of the limitations of this feature. And, we end this section with a look at a feature often used in conjunction with drill-through; customized tooltip pages.\nNext, we talk about DAX what-if parameters and, after discussing the use of Power BI’s built-in feature, which can only be used with numeric parameters, the course shows you how to extend this feature by creating your own custom parameter tables.\nAnd we use the parameters feature as a launchpad to the creation of a sophisticated currency conversion dashboard which gives us a chance to practice other useful techniques, such as the inclusion of custom visuals in your reports, the use of DAX variables to make your formulas clearer and easier to maintain, and how to provide useful interactive feedback to your users by creating dynamic titles driven by complex DAX formulas.\nSo, if you’ve already mastered the basics of Power BI and are looking to build on that knowledge, the Power BI Intermediate course by G Com Solutions could be exactly what you need.",

      "description": "How is this course different from other Tableau courses?\nMany courses prioritize exam preparation or maximizing exposure to keywords. However, this approach doesn't necessarily translate to real-world application. Our course was developed with a focus on delving deep into the core concepts essential for working with data in Tableau, emphasizing not only the 'how' but also the 'why.'\nWe understand that everyone has a different learning style, and our preferred methods evolve as we mature. Taking this into consideration, we developed our material to incorporate hands-on videos, exercises, and visual guides. Additionally, we utilize a blend of open-ended questions and prompts derived from our professional experiences to reinforce your understanding of each concept and prepare you for real-world challenges.\nMost of all, we can do all this and have some fun along the way!\n\nWhat does the right way mean?\nWe understand that many people are self-taught — we were too at the start of our careers! While this approach may help you get by, our goal is for you to thrive. Doing things the right way entails fully understanding the reasoning behind every action you take (yes, we're talking about blue vs. green pills). For those who have never opened Tableau before, we aim to provide you with all the knowledge we wish we had when we were starting out.\n\n\nWho are you anyways?\nWe are seasoned professionals with over two decades of combined experience, having worked with Fortune 500 companies, government organizations, and professional sports teams. This course is grounded in our real-world expertise. Michael has trained thousands of students across various organizations and universities, while Lindsey is an award-winning data visualization designer and developer.",

And, naturally, you will get plenty of additional practice in all aspects of DAX: calculated columns, calculated tables, DAX measures and time-intelligence functions.\n\n\nAs an advanced Power BI report developer, it is also important that you build and utilize datasets in the most efficient manner. In this course, you will learn how to implement data centralization by using PBIDS Files, disabling the export of static data from your reports, creating dataflows and shared Datasets and how to promote and certifying your centralized datasets.\n\n\nThe course also provides advanced visualization practice, and you will be given the opportunity to create a sophisticated sales pipeline dashboard, starting from scratch and using such techniques as dynamic chart titles and colors and Dynamically Showing a Chart.\n\n\nThen, back in the Power BI service, we discuss the finer points of dashboard tiles: Creating Hyperlinks in a Text Box, working with Image Tiles, Web content tiles, Video Tiles, and Streaming Real-time data by integrating Power Automate functionality.\n\n\nWe then turn our attention to visualizing our data, we look at using the form of visual as well as displaying a hierarchy of images in slices, which enable the user to track the performance of sales managers, as well as individual salespeople. We also look at a useful technique for creating a chart which only becomes visible when a slicer selection is made by the user.\n\n\nIn short, this course will offer Power BI users who are familiar with all of the fundamentals a challenging hands-on workshop, which will expand their familiarity with Power BI best practices, data modelling, visualization and report creation.",

So, for 7 hours of whole course (all 7 parts), you will earn 7 PD hours for ECBA application.\nFor rest of PD hours, you can attend other online courses in business analysis and also claim hours spent on studying BABOK Guide.\nPlease note that course does not cover 50 most commonly used business analysis techniques (described in chapter 10 of BABOK guide v3.0), as it is difficult to provide explanation (with examples) for these many techniques in an online course. However, participants would be able to study use of techniques from the provided downloadable PDF file.\nPlease also note that the course does not cover 5 perspectives (described in chapter 11 of BABOK guide v3.0), as there shall be no questions on them in the exam (as clarified by IIBA in one of their webinars). However, CBAP/ CCBA aspirants are advised to go through them directly from BABOK guide v3.0.",

      "description": "Comprehensive Graphics with R is a thorough, comprehensive overview of each of three major graphics approaches in R: base, lattice, and ggplot. The course also demonstrates the use of the R Commander interface to create a variety of 2D and 3D graphics. Most of the course is engaged in live, \"hands-on\" demonstrations of creating a wide range of 2D and 3D plots and graphs using extensive scripts and data sets, all provided with the course materials. Adequate documentation including slides, exercises and exercise solutions are also provided. The course demonstrates (and uses) two of the most popular ‘front-ends’ to the R Console: R Commander and RStudio. We begin by exploring the range of graphics output available using both the R Commander and RStudio GUI interfaces to the R Console. The course then follows with a more in-depth examination of the graphics capabilities for each of the three main graphics systems, base, lattice, and ggplot.\nThis course is a ‘must see’ for anyone who will use R and wishes to get the most out of the stunning variety of graphical charts, plots, and even animations that are available. The R software was designed from the outset to be particularly strong in visualization and graphical capabilities. However, if you are unaware of the full range of these capabilities you are missing opportunities to apply this wide variety of rich, powerful graphics to your own work and research projects. Accordingly, this course is specifically designed to comprehensively demonstrate and explain the broad range of graphical outputs that are available with R.",

By the end of this course you will be able to explain why some females earn less than males and be able to identify (and measure) where gender wage discrimination is taking place and where not.\nThe techniques taught in this course are all executable in Microsoft Excel and will help you improve your current analysis skills. The topics cover:\nUsing averages and means\nUsing counts and medians\nData visualizations (graphs and plots)\nCorrelations and scatter-plots\nHistograms to describe the shape of data\nHow to easily understand and use variance and standard deviation\nHow to construct and use \"confidence intervals\"\nHypothesis testing\nUsing t-tests to prove or disprove an assumption\nFor all of the above we replicate the technique in Excel and practice drawing insights about what we are seeing.\nThe course begins by introducing you to some basic theory about data and variables. You will then be introduced to some Excel tips and tricks (if you want) and the data-set that will be used. The data is a sample of over 500 survey responses that includes information about income, employment, education, gender, race, age and industry.\nWe then dive into the different techniques until we can statistically prove, with a high level of confidence, where wage discrimination is taking place (or not).\nI hope you find this course rewarding, interesting and challenging!\n\n\nKind regards,\nJef Jacobs",

You will learn the most effective forecasting techniques that analysts use every day to make accurate predictions about the future. This will make you invaluable for your organisation and help you speed up your career like a flash. A time series analyst makes about $70,000 a year on average, but the top performers can make as much as $130,000 (according to SimplyHired).\n\n\nThis course will be a revolution for you, even if you don’t know anything about time series forecasting at this point. After completing it you will know how to...\n\n\ninvestigate historical data,\ndetect trends and patterns\nchoose the most appropriate forecasting methods\nassess forecasting accuracy\nreduce forecasting error\n\n\nIn a word, time series forecasting is a critical data science skill. If you want to be a full-blown data analyst you have to master time series.\n\n\nWithout further delay, let’s see what you are going to learn in this course.\n\n\nIn the first two sections (not counting the introduction) we build the foundations. The second section presents all the steps we must take to perform time series forecasting in practice, while in the third section you will become familiar with the essential time series notions. You will learn about trend and seasonality, time series decomposition, visualising trends, spotting seasonal patterns etc.\n\n\nThe fourth section is about evaluating forecasting performance. We will review the most used accuracy metrics for time series forecasting and explain them in detail. (We are going to use them extensively throughout the course.)\n\n\nIn the fifth section you will find a brief overview of the forecasting techniques approached in the course. The following sections examine these techniques in great detail and offer practical applications for each, using the R program.\n\n\nThe forecasting methods studied in this course are:\n\n\n1. Moving averages (section 6). We don’t have to discard the simple forecasting methods, because sometimes they are more effective than the complex ones. This is why we start by looking into the moving averages, both simple and weighted.\n\n\n2. Simple exponential smoothing (section 7), an extension of the moving averages method. In this section we introduce a very important R function for time series forecasting: ets. More details in the course.\n\n\n3. Advanced exponential smoothing (section 8). Here we delve into really good stuff: we learn to forecast complicated series that present both trend and seasonal patterns. You will become familiar with two powerful models, Holt and Holt-Winters.\n\n\n4. Extended exponential smoothing methods (section 9). In this chapter we will implement state-of-the-art models for series with double seasonality: TBATS and STLM.\n\n\n5. Regression models (section 10). These models can be used for series with both trend and seasonality. They are easy to understand and apply.\n\n\n6. Autoregressive – or ARIMA – models (sections 11 and 12). These models represent a must have tool for any time series forecaster. They can be extremely effective in many situations, since they can make predictions with a remarkable level of accuracy. In these section you’ll learn all-important concepts like autocorrelation, stationarity, integration, autoregressive processes and moving average processes. Afterwards you’ll learn how to identify an ARIMA model using the autocorrelation charts, how to build these models in R and how to use them for forecasting purposes.\n\n\n7. Neural networks (section 13). Here we will deal with a special function that creates neural network models for time series forecasting.\n\n\nEvery technique is presented in video, both the syntax and the output being thoroughly explained. At the end of the course, a good number of practical exercises are proposed. This exercises will help you practice and improve your time series forecasting skills.\n\n\nJoin this course today and get hold of a mission critical ability – time series forecasting!",

      "description": "Are your spreadsheets important?\nIf yes, then this course is MUST for you. It describes good practices that all spreadsheet users should follow.\nUse this course to learn how to avoid the most common errors and to make future development easier. If you are a software tester or a manager of end user-computing, it gives you techniques in checking spreadsheets for accuracy and soundness. If you are an auditor looking for evidence of fraud, such as deliberately concealed data or functionality, you will also benefit from knowing the many ways in which data can be hidden or calculation methods subverted.\nThis course was created in response to experssions of concerns by managers or auditors about risk to the business from a pervasive dependence on spreadsheets. This course can be considered as a guide to developing high quality spreadsheets, steps to perform for auditing or reviewing spreadsheets created by someone else to ensure accuracy. This course is of interest to anyone who relies on data analysis performed in spreadsheets or models built in it for decision making. The techniques described include areas such as ensuring that the objectives of the models are clear, defining the calculations, good design practice, testing and understanding and presenting the results from spreadsheet.\nFrom this course your will learn how to:\nIncrease efficiency by avoiding rework\nDiscover Powerful formula auditing techniques\nFoil attempts to conceal data and formulas from you\nReduce worry about costly and embarrassing mistakes\nCreate spreadsheets faster by avoiding wasted time from lack of specification\nPresent results with more confidence knowing that you have checked for errors.\nIn this course we will first understand various frequently used keyboard shortcuts. I have provided a cheat of all keyboard shortcut combination available in excel. You can simply take its printout and stick it on your workstation.\nThen we will have a look at various inbuilt feature available in Excel which are underutilized. These features can be extremely useful when we are reviewing or auditing or even building any complex models inside Excel file. Some of the features are like watch window, comparing same file side by side on single monitor, options under go window special, how to select cells based on their formatting and various printing setting like keep row heading on each page or printing cells comments, etc.\nThen next section is fully dedicated to a new add-in called as Inquire Add-in. If you are reviewer or auditor then you MUST learn how to use this add-in. Let me repeat you must learn this. This add-in will help you analyze your entire workbook for formulas, errors, hidden sheets, macros and many more. This will help you get pictorial presentation of relationship between workbooks, worksheets and individual cells. Further, if you want to compare multiple version of files then this add-in will do it for you at cell level even for formatting changes and also changes to macro. Further, if you are struggling with excess formatting in workbook then it can help you clean that. So this section is almost more than one hour long which gives detailed explanation of various feature of this add-in. I can assure you that you would not get so much explanation about this add-in even at Microsoft site also. So this is one of the highlight of this course.\nNow moving on auditing the formulas. Most of the people are aware about blue arrows displayed using formula auditing toolbar but unaware about the approaches to be followed to understand complex formulas. There have been many instances when formula entered had parentheses at wrong places and hence results were incorrect. I will explain you the order of operations followed by excel while calculating the results. We will also look at various referencing available in Excel like relative / absolute / structured and circular referencing. You must have a solid understanding of these referencing if you want to audit any formulas.\nIn the next section we will look at pivot tables and various settings. Pivot Table are one of the USP of Excel because it gives flexibility to users to perform the data analysis very quickly. With recent versions of Excel there have been lot of changes made to this pivot table. Current Excel now contains data models and power pivot. In this section I will provide a brief introduction about these new tools. Further I will show you various unexplored setting related to filtering, sorting and grouping data inside the pivot tables. Also, if you believe that the grand totals displayed in Pivot Table are always correct then I will show you settings through which this can be incorrect. Many fraudsters have used this setting to overstate or understate certain items used in financial statements. I also have provided solutions to FAQ on pivot table.\nNow in next section titled overall governance around spreadsheets I will show various design level controls should be in place and implemented to avoid errors from spreadsheets. I will provide you a copy of sample spreadsheet policy which can be used to implement relevant procedures at your organisation. I will also show how can you create a inventory of files stored in a folder and also create a index sheet within excel file using Power Query. I have two other full fledged courses on Power Query.\nSo currently these are areas I am covering as part of this course. In future I will also update more videos to this course and you do not have to pay anything extra for it. So don’t wait and enroll into this course immediately.",

      "description": "A data warehouse is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analytics. Data warehouses are intended to perform queries and analysis and often contain large amounts of historical data. The data within a data warehouse is usually derived from a wide range of sources such as application log files and transaction applications.\nA data warehouse centralizes and consolidates large amounts of data from multiple sources. Its analytical capabilities allow organizations to derive valuable business insights from their data to improve decision-making. Over time, it builds a historical record that can be invaluable to data scientists and business analysts. Because of these capabilities, a data warehouse can be considered an organization’s “single source of truth.”\nData warehouses offer the overarching and unique benefit of allowing organizations to analyze large amounts of variant data and extract significant value from it, as well as to keep a historical record.\nA typical data warehouse often includes the following elements:\nA relational database to store and manage data\nAn extraction, loading, and transformation (ELT) solution for preparing the data for analysis\nStatistical analysis, reporting, and data mining capabilities\nClient analysis tools for visualizing and presenting data to business users\nOther, more sophisticated analytical applications that generate actionable information by applying data science and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, or graph and spatial features that enable more kinds of analysis of data at scale.\n\n\nPower BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\nPower BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:\nA Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.\nAn online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.\nPower BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.",

      "description": "Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\nPower BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:\nA Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.\nAn online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.\nPower BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.\n\n\nSQL Server Integration Services is a platform for building enterprise-level data integration and data transformations solutions. Use Integration Services to solve complex business problems by copying or downloading files, loading data warehouses, cleansing and mining data, and managing SQL Server objects and data.\nIntegration Services can extract and transform data from a wide variety of sources such as XML data files, flat files, and relational data sources, and then load the data into one or more destinations.\nIntegration Services includes a rich set of built-in tasks and transformations, graphical tools for building packages, and the Integration Services Catalog database, where you store, run, and manage packages.\nYou can use the graphical Integration Services tools to create solutions without writing a single line of code. You can also program the extensive Integration Services object model to create packages programmatically and code custom tasks and other package objects.\nSQL Server Analysis services (SSAS) is a multi-dimensional OLAP server as well as an analytics engine that allows you to slice and dice large volumes of data. It is part of Microsoft SQL Server and helps perform analysis using various dimensions. It has 2 variants Multidimensional and Tabular. The SSAS full form is SQL Server Analysis Services.\nAnalysis Services is an analytical data engine (VertiPaq) used in decision support and business analytics. It provides enterprise-grade semantic data model capabilities for business intelligence (BI), data analysis, and reporting applications such as Power BI, Excel, Reporting Services, and other data visualization tools. Analysis Services is available in different platforms.\nSQL Server is a software application designed to manage databases, it stores and retrieves data as requested by other applications. When software developers are writing new business applications that store information in a database they will very often use SQL Server’s functionality to look after the databases rather than reinventing the wheel writing their own code to do the same thing. This makes writing database applications easier and quicker (and therefore cheaper) as well as making them more reliable, scalable and secure.\nSQL Server is known as a “Relational Database” Management System. Data is stored in tables in a similar way to rows and columns in a spreadsheet. If you imagine a database containing accounting information you may have a table for each invoice with values, VAT, Totals, invoice number etc. Each invoice relates to a customer but instead of recording the customer’s details (name, address, discounts etc.) with each invoice you just record it once in a separate table called Customers. The Customers table and Invoices table are linked or “related”.\nThe “Management System” part of SQL Server makes sure the databases are stored efficiently and the data can be searched or retrieved as quickly as possible. It also makes sure multiple people connecting to the same data are managed properly so you don’t get problems if two people change the same information at the same time.\nAlteryx is a software solution that allows users to quickly access, manipulate, analyze, and output data. This can be done in a one-off manner or, more commonly, the process (called a “workflow”) is something people use on a recurring (daily, weekly, monthly) basis. The way Alteryx builds workflows becomes a form of process documentation allowing users to see, collaborate on, support, and enhance the process. Data can be read and written to files, databases, and APIs. Alteryx is used for access, manipulation, analysis, and output of data. The platform is very robust and can be used in virtually any industry or functional area.",

      "description": "There is an overflow of text data online nowadays. As a Python developer, you need to create a new solution using Natural Language Processing for your next project. Your colleagues depend on you to monetize gigabytes of unstructured text data. What do you do?\nHands-on NLP with NLTK and scikit-learn is the answer. This course puts you right on the spot, starting off with building a spam classifier in our first video. At the end of the course, you are going to walk away with three NLP applications: a spam filter, a topic classifier, and a sentiment analyzer. There is no need for fancy mathematical theory, just plain English explanations of core NLP concepts and how to apply those using Python libraries.\nTaking this course will help you to precisely create new applications with Python and NLP. You will be able to build actual solutions backed by machine learning and NLP processing models with ease.\nThis course uses Python 3.6, TensorFlow 1.4, NLTK 2, and scikit-learn 0.19, while not the latest version available, it provides relevant and informative content for legacy users of NLP with NLTK and Scikit-learn.\nAbout the Author\nColibri Ltd is a technology consultancy company founded in 2015 by James Cross and Ingrid Funie.

      "description": "As a data analyst, you are on a journey. Think about all the data that is being generated each day and that is available in an organization, from transactional data in a traditional database, telemetry data from services that you use, to signals that you get from different areas like social media.\nFor example, today's retail businesses collect and store massive amounts of data that track the items you browsed and purchased, the pages you've visited on their site, the aisles you purchase products from, your spending habits, and much more.\nWith data and information as the most strategic asset of a business, the underlying challenge that organizations have today is understanding and using their data to positively effect change within the business. Businesses continue to struggle to use their data in a meaningful and productive way, which impacts their ability to act.\nThe key to unlocking this data is being able to tell a story with it. In today's highly competitive and fast-paced business world, crafting reports that tell that story is what helps business leaders take action on the data. Business decision makers depend on an accurate story to drive better business decisions. The faster a business can make precise decisions, the more competitive they will be and the better advantage they will have. Without the story, it is difficult to understand what the data is trying to tell you.\nHowever, having data alone is not enough. You need to be able to act on the data to effect change within the business. That action could involve reallocating resources within the business to accommodate a need, or it could be identifying a failing campaign and knowing when to change course. These situations are where telling a story with your data is important.\nThe underlying challenge that businesses face today is understanding and using their data in such a way that impacts their business and ultimately their bottom line. You need to be able to look at the data and facilitate trusted business decisions. Then, you need the ability to look at metrics and clearly understand the meaning behind those metrics.\nData analysis exists to help overcome these challenges and pain points, ultimately assisting businesses in finding insights and uncovering hidden value in troves of data through storytelling. As you read on, you will learn how to use and apply analytical skills to go beyond a single report and help impact and influence your organization by telling stories with data and driving that data culture.\nThe Power Query and Power Pivot features in Microsoft Excel can make a powerful combination. Power Query enables you to discover, connect to, and import data, and Power Pivot lets you quickly model that data.  You will learn how to use the DAX formula language to provide lookup abilities.\nI will walk you through step-by-step how to use Power Query to select data, prepare a query, cleanse data, and prepare data for Power Pivot. Also i will walks you through the Power Pivot workflow, showing how to create a data model, import additional data if needed, build relationships between data, and create calculations and measures.\nYou will learn hands on real-world scenarios for working together with Power Query and Power Pivot.\n\n\nLearning objectives\nPreparing queries\nCleansing data with Power Query\nEnhancing queries\nCreating a data model in Power Pivot\nBuilding relationships\nCreating Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts\nCreating Lookups\nUsing DAX to link data\nCreating data model\nCreating relationship between data sources\nAnalyzing data with PivotTables and PivotCharts\nUsing Power Query with PowerPivot\nRefreshing Data Source\nUpdating Queries\nCreating Macros\nEditing Macros\nVBA Scripting",

      "description": "Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data might be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\nPower BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:\nA Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.\nAn online software as a service (SaaS) service called the Power BI service.\nPower BI Mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.\nThese three elements—Power BI Desktop, the service, and the mobile apps—are designed to let you create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves you and your role most effectively.  Beyond those three, Power BI also features two other elements:\nPower BI Report Builder, for creating paginated reports to share in the Power BI service. Read more about paginated reports later in this article.\nPower BI Report Server, an on-premises report server where you can publish your Power BI reports, after creating them in Power BI Desktop\nHow you use Power BI can be based on which feature or service of Power BI is the best tool for your situation. For example, you can use Power BI Desktop to create reports for your own team about customer engagement statistics and you can view inventory and manufacturing progress in a real-time dashboard in the Power BI service. You can create a paginated report of mailable invoices, based on a Power BI dataset. Each part of Power BI is available to you, which is why it's so flexible and compelling.\nOne common workflow in Power BI begins by connecting to data sources in Power BI Desktop and building a report. You then publish that report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service, and share it so business users in the Power BI service and on mobile devices can view and interact with the report.",

By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.\nTableau is a widely used business intelligence (BI) and analytics software trusted by companies like Amazon, Experian, and Unilever to explore, visualize, and securely share data in the form of Workbooks and Dashboards. With its user-friendly drag-and-drop functionality it can be used by everyone to quickly clean, analyze, and visualize your team’s data. You’ll learn how to navigate Tableau’s interface and connect and present data using easy-to-understand visualizations. By the end of this training, you’ll have the skills you need to confidently explore Tableau and build impactful data dashboards.\nBusinesses collect and store massive amounts of data that track the items you browsed and purchased, the pages you've visited on their site, the aisles you purchase products from, your spending habits, and much more.\nWith data and information as the most strategic asset of a business, the underlying challenge that organizations have today is understanding and using their data to positively effect change within the business. Businesses continue to struggle to use their data in a meaningful and productive way, which impacts their ability to act.\nThe key to unlocking this data is being able to tell a story with it. In today's highly competitive and fast-paced business world, crafting reports that tell that story is what helps business leaders take action on the data. Business decision makers depend on an accurate story to drive better business decisions. The faster a business can make precise decisions, the more competitive they will be and the better advantage they will have. Without the story, it is difficult to understand what the data is trying to tell you.\nHowever, having data alone is not enough. You need to be able to act on the data to effect change within the business. That action could involve reallocating resources within the business to accommodate a need, or it could be identifying a failing campaign and knowing when to change course. These situations are where telling a story with your data is important.\n\n\nPython is a popular programming language.\nIt is used for:\nweb development (server-side),\nsoftware development,\nmathematics,\nData Analysis\nData Visualization\nSystem scripting.\nPython can be used for data analysis and visualization.\nThe Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modelling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\nPower BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\nPower BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:\nA Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.\nAn online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.\nPower BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.\nThese three elements—Power BI Desktop, the service, and the mobile apps—are designed to let you create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves you and your role most effectively.\nBeyond those three, Power BI also features two other elements:\nPower BI Report Builder, for creating paginated reports to share in the Power BI service. Read more about paginated reports later in this article.\nPower BI Report Server, an on-premises report server where you can publish your Power BI reports, after creating them in Power BI Desktop.",

      "description": "My goal with this course is for you to learn ggplot2 from the ground up. ggplot2 has a huge community and endless resources, but here's why I think this course might be for you:\nCreating data visualizations in ggplot2 is tough for beginners. You need to know about data types, geometric objects, aesthetics, aesthetic mappings, dozens of functions, faceting, scales, themes and much more. You'll find many resources on the internet that teach you this content. Finding these resources takes time, and often they don't teach the fundamentals you need to know to become an independent data visualization specialist in ggplot2. This course will get you up to speed with ggplot2. While creating this course I not only created the videos, but also a comprehensive package of educational materials. Here is what you will get from this course:\n\n\nMore than 12 hours of videos\n8 brand-new cheat sheets on the most fundamental concepts of ggplot2 which you won't find anywhere else on the internet\n3 educational web apps on three of the most fundamentals problems: findings aesthetics of geometric objects, finding scales, and designing your theme\nA repository with all the R-code for the course\nIn this course we will start with the most important concept of ggplot2, aesthetic mappings. We will then learn how to create the most basic plots. Once you are able to create these plots, we will discuss common pitfalls that beginners to ggplot2 often run into. In the next modules, you will learn how to customize aesthetic mappings with scales, how to create multiple plots by faceting, how to calculate summary statistics, and how to change the theme of your plots. Finally, you will get to know tips and tricks that everyone learning ggplot2 should know. Along the way, we will also create four best practice visualizations that cover all of the fundamental concepts we learn in this course.\nI am confident that you won't find similar material anywhere else on the internet and that you will truly understand ggplot2 from the ground up if you take this course.\nDisclaimer: We will cover version 3.3.4 of ggplot2.",

      "description": "A warm welcome to the Data Visualization with Python course by Uplatz.\n\n\nData Visualizations allow humans to explore data in many different ways and see patterns and insights that would not be possible when looking at the raw form. Humans crave narrative and visualizations allow us to pull a story out of our stores of data. Data visualization is the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns, trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed.\nAs datasets become bigger and more complex, only AI, materialized views, and more sophisticated coding languages will be able to glean insights from them. Advanced analytics is paving the way for the next wave of innovation. The human brain processes visual data better than any other kind of data, which is good because most of the information our brains process is visual. Visual processing and responses both occur more quickly compared to other stimuli.\nA good visualization could be the difference between hard to digest piles of data and useful business information. With increasing volume of data, it is next to impossible to rely on just one way frequency tables and statistics to understand the data. Good visualizations can accelerate the process of understanding data and gaining insights.\n\n\nWhy Python for Data Visualization?\nPython offers multiple great graphing libraries that come packed with lots of different features. No matter if you want to create interactive, live or highly customized plots python has an excellent library for you.\nPython programming language has different types of libraries for all kind of projects. Likewise, python has various libraries for visualization of Data, so that user can understand the dataset in very detailed way and analyze it properly.\nEach library of visualization has its own specification. Using the particular libraries for specific task helps the user to complete the task in more easy and accurate way. Some liberates work better than the others.\n\n\nPython uses two exclusive libraries for data visualization.\nMatplotlib\nPython based plotting library offers matplotlib with a complete 2D support along with limited 3D graphic support. It is useful in producing publication quality figures in interactive environment across platforms. It can also be used for animations as well. Matplotlib is a library used for plotting graphs in the Python programming language. It is used plot 2 - dimensional arrays. Matplotlib is built on NumPy arrays. It is designed to work with the border SciPy stack. It was developed by John Hunter in 2002. The benefit of visualization is that user can have visual access to large amounts of the dataset. Matplotlib is a library which is consists of various plots such as histogram, bar, line, scatter, etc. Matplotlib comes with a huge variety of plots. Plots are helpful for understanding patterns, trends and for making correlations. It has instruments for reasoning about quantitative information. As matplotlib was the very first library of data visualization in python, many other libraries are developed on top of it or designed to work parallel to it for the analysis of the dataset.\nSeaborn\nSeaborn is a library for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics in python. This library is built on top of the Matplotlib library. Seaborn offers various features such as built in themes, color palettes, functions and tools to visualize univariate, bivariate, linear regression, matrices of data, statistical time series etc. that allows us to build complex visualizations. Seaborn is a library of Python programming basically used for making statistical graphics of the dataset. It is also integrated closely with Pandas, which is used for the data structure of Datasets. Seaborn is very helpful to explore and understand data in a better way. It provides a high level of a crossing point for sketching attractive and informative algebraic graphics.\n\n\nSome of the other key Python libraries used in data visualization are:\nPandas visualization - easy to use interface, built on Matplotlib\nGgplot - based on R’s ggplot2, uses Grammar of Graphics\nPygal\nMissingno\nPlotly - can create interactive plots\nGleam\nLeather\nGeoplotlib\nBokeh\nFolium\n\n\nUplatz offers this complete course on Data Visualization with Python. This Data Visualization in Python course will help you use Python's most popular and robust data visualization libraries. Learn how to use Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, and others to create useful static and interactive visualizations of categorical, aggregated, and geospatial data.\n\n\nData Visualization with Python - Course Curriculum\n\n\n1.

They can work in many industries, including business, finance, criminal justice, science, medicine, and government.\n\n\nData analyst tasks and responsibilities\n\n\nA data analyst is a person whose job is to gather and interpret data in order to solve a specific problem. The role includes plenty of time spent with data, but entails communicating findings too.\n\n\nHere’s what many data analysts do on a day-to-day basis:\n\n\nGather data: Analysts often collect data themselves. This could include conducting surveys, tracking visitor characteristics on a company website, or buying datasets from data collection specialists.\n\n\nClean data: Raw data might contain duplicates, errors, or outliers. Cleaning the data means maintaining the quality of data in a spreadsheet or through a programming language so that your interpretations won’t be wrong or skewed.\n\n\nModel data: This entails creating and designing the structures of a database. You might choose what types of data to store and collect, establish how data categories are related to each other, and work through how the data actually appears.\n\n\nInterpret data: Interpreting data will involve finding patterns or trends in data that will help you answer the question at hand.\n\n\nPresent: Communicating the results of your findings will be a key part of your job. You do this by putting together visualizations like charts and graphs, writing reports, and presenting information to interested parties.",

They not only need to understand the data, but be able to provide insight and analysis through clear visual, written and verbal communication.\n\n\n\n\nSome responsibilities of a data analyst includes:\n\n\nDeveloping records management processes and policies\nidentify areas to increase efficiency and automation of processes\nset up and maintain automated data processes\nidentify, evaluate and implement external services and tools to support data validation and cleansing\nproduce and track key performance indicators\ndevelop and support reporting processes\nmonitor and audit data quality\nliaise with internal and external clients to fully understand data content\ngather, understand and document detailed business requirements using appropriate tools and techniques\ndesign and carry out surveys and analyse survey data\nmanipulate, analyse and interpret complex data sets relating to the employer's business\nprepare reports for internal and external audiences using business analytics reporting tools\ncreate data dashboards, graphs and visualisations\nprovide sector and competitor benchmarking\nmine and analyse large datasets, draw valid inferences and present them successfully to management using a reporting tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re getting ready to launch a new career as a data analyst, chances are you’ve encountered an age-old dilemma. Job listings ask for experience, but how do you get experience if you’re looking for your first data analyst job?\nThis is where your portfolio comes in. The projects you include in your portfolio demonstrate your skills and experience—even if it’s not from a previous data analytics job—to hiring managers and interviewers. Populating your portfolio with the right projects can go a long way toward building confidence that you’re the right person for the job, even without previous work experience.\nAs an aspiring data analyst, you’ll want to demonstrate a few key skills in your portfolio. These data analytics project ideas reflect the tasks often fundamental to many data analyst roles.\nThe hands on projects covered in this course includes :\n\n\nWeb scraping\nWhile you’ll find no shortage of excellent (and free) public data sets on the internet, you might want to show prospective employers that you’re able to find and scrape your own data as well. Plus, knowing how to scrape web data means you can find and use data sets that match your interests, regardless of whether or not they’ve already been compiled.\nWe will use  Python and  tools like Beautiful Soup to crawl the web for interesting data.\n\n\nData cleaning\nA significant part of your role as a data analyst is cleaning data to make it ready to analyze. Data cleaning (also called data scrubbing) is the process of removing incorrect and duplicate data, managing any holes in the data, and making sure the formatting of data is consistent.   We will perform  some practical data cleaning .\n\n\nExploratory data analysis (EDA)\n\n\nData analysis is all about answering questions with data. Exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short, helps you explore what questions to ask. This could be done separate from or in conjunction with data cleaning. Either way, you’ll want to accomplish the following during these early investigations.   We will undertake a data exploration project in this course.\n\n\nData Analysis & Transformation\n\n\nWe will  also perform some data analysis and transformation\n\n\nData Visualization\n\n\nData visualization is an important aspect of data analysis.   As a data analyst you should be able to present\ndata in a visual way that will help businesses make important decisions.",

Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, along with its interpreted nature, makes it a perfect language for data visualization that may be a wise investment for your future big-data needs.If you are a Python user who desires to enter the field of data visualization or enhance your data visualization skills to become more effective visual communicator, then this learning path is for you.\nWith this easy to follow, hands-on course you will initially begin with introduction to data visualization, and the techniques and libraries which can be leveraged with the Python language. Ten you will learn to program stunning & interactive Data Visualizations using bqplot, an open source Python library developed by Bloomberg. Furthermore, you will gain knowledge on how to programmatically create interactive network graphs and visualizations & then visualize data with the interactive Python visualization library, Bokeh. Finally, you will build interactive web visualizations of data using Python: you will choose a number of inputs your users can control, then use any Python graphing library to create plots based on those inputs.\nBy the end of this course you will be able to demonstrate visualizations with interesting, real-world data sets. Also you’ll be able to create effective visualizations for your data sets using tools: matplotlib, bqplot, NetworkX, Bokeh, and Dash in Python.\nContents and Overview\nThis training program includes 2 complete courses, carefully chosen to give you the most comprehensive training possible.\nThe first course, Learning Python Data Visualization begins with  visualization concepts so viewers can analyze large and small sets of data using libraries such as Matplotlib, IPython, and so on. This course primarily employs the IPython environment and matplotlib, with the following structure: Introduce key data visualization libraries (matplotlib and so on.) and cover data importing/exporting (CSV, Excel, JSON and so on), Introduce real-world data sets (to be visualized in the video), Visualization types/techniques (bar chart, histogram, scatter plot, geospatial, and so on); demonstrate how to customize visualizations. Introduce intermediate topics to create more advanced visualizations and using complex techniques, such as real-time data visualization. By the end of the course, you will be able to demonstrate visualizations with interesting, real-world data sets.\nIn the second course, Data Visualization Projects in Python you will start by programming stunning interactive Data Visualizations using bqplot, an open source Python library developed by Bloomberg. Then you will learn how to programmatically create interactive network graphs and visualizations. You will then programmatically visualize data with the interactive Python visualization library, Bokeh. Finally, you will build interactive web visualizations of data using Python: you will choose a number of inputs your users can control, then use any Python graphing library to create plots based on those inputs.\nAbout the Authors\nBenjamin Keller is a postdoctoral researcher in the MUSTANG group at Universität Heidelberg's Astronomisches Rechen-Institut.

      "description": "Business intelligence (BI) combines business analytics, data mining, data visualisation, data tools and infrastructure, and best practices to help organisations to make more data-driven decisions. In practice, you know you’ve got modern business intelligence when you have a comprehensive view of your organisation’s data and use that data to drive change, eliminate inefficiencies and quickly adapt to market or supply changes.  Business intelligence comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data analysis and management of business information.\n\n\nMicrosoft BI tools provide a solution for handling the volume of important business intelligence information continuously generated by modern companies. With the right tools, you can process huge amounts of data in mere seconds, and it is this part of the process that counts. Any business can collect information, but it takes skill and careful management using business intelligence tools to make it valuable. This is the essence of “business intelligence”: the ability to take vast quantities of market data and extract trends and patterns.\n\n\n\n\nThe Microsoft BI Suite is the software giant’s suite of tools designed for easy data processing. That’s putting it a bit simply, but these programs do have a simple objective. The system aims to help businesses turn all of that messy, complex information into extractable insights. It is one of the most popular BI solutions on the market right now.\n\n\nThe full range of tools enables businesses to direct data through IT systems, identify and isolate data, and create expansive reports on the current status of different departments. They include  (SQL Server Integration Services), SSAS (SQL Server Analytical Services) and SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) and Power BI\n\n\nWith these tools, any mass of data can be turned into a digestible report, dashboard, graph, spreadsheet or another format. You just need to input your parameters and let the system know what you need. The Microsoft business intelligence platform works by moving data from multifarious, unmanageable sources to a centralized architecture where it can be reconfigured.",

      "description": "Welcome!\nMy name is Ben Gutkovich and I’m the founder of ConsultingCase.Pro and the creator of the QuantMaster™ Ace the Interview Math Online Course. I’m a former McKinsey and Strategy& (PwC's Strategy Consulting arm) manager and interviewer, and an MBA graduate of London Business School.\nOver the past 3 years, I've coached hundreds of job candidates for consulting, finance and tech positions, and saw that many of them struggled to execute math calculations quickly and accurately. Interviewers use quantitative questions as a proxy for candidate's mental agility, and if you make mistakes and show lack of understanding of basic math concepts, you will not get the job, no matter how well you do in other parts of the interview.\nI created this online course to teach you the quantitative and mental calculation skills you need to succeed in interviews for top tier firms across industries. In this course, you will learn a comprehensive set of calculation methods designed specifically to enable you to perform Interview Math calculations quickly and easily, as well as get lots of practice in the most typical quantitative Interview problem types.\nThis course is suitable for aspiring management consultants preparing for Case Interviews, as well as candidates for many other job functions such as Product Management, Marketing, General Management, Private Equity, and Brand Management, at firms like Google, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Amazon, and many others.\nQuantMaster™ Ace the Interview Math is unique among quantitative Interview preparation resources because it uses on-demand video lessons to teach efficient calculation and problem-solving methods — instead of simply providing practice problems and answers. Furthermore, all the calculation methods and examples are based on questions used in actual Interviews.\nAfter learning the course material, candidates will dramatically increase their calculation speed and efficiency, and be well prepared for a wide range of quantitative Interviews questions.\nHundreds of students from leading universities worldwide, like Wharton, Harvard Business School, Stanford, MIT, Kellogg, London Business School, INSEAD, and many more, have used the QuantMaster™ Ace the Interview Math methods and techniques to join top-tier firms like McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, Google, Amazon, and Goldman Sachs.\nDiscover for yourself why people love QuantMaster and improve your own Interview performance by registering for the QuantMaster online course!",

Whether you’re preparing for an interviewing, refreshing on SQL concepts, or just wanting to learn this course will help you.\nThe instructional level is listed as “Beginner Level.” However, those taking this course do need to have some understanding of SQL. This course is not an introductory course. You will learn by attempting the question, using a hint if needed, then watching the video explanation. Video explanations are provided to show students how to answer the question; however, each question has multiple answers. The instructor simply shows students how he would answer the question.\nMicrosoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) will be the database management system used in the course. All the questions in the course are answered using the Microsoft Sample database, Pubs. The syntax used in SSMS is T-SQL. T-SQL is similar to syntax used in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Snowflake, MariaDB, etc., however, Microsoft SQL Server will be needed to load the Pubs database.\nList of commands used in course questions:\nSelect, From, Select Top, Where, Order by, Group by, Count, Inner Join, Distinct, Having, Sum, Avg, Min, Max, Create Table, Drop Table, Insert Into, And/Or, In/Not In, Between/Not Between, Like/Not Like, Case When, Concatenation, Format, Isnull, Alter Table, Update, DateName, Delete Row, Drop Column, Left/Right, Left Join, Inner Query (Subquery), Self Join",

Often, both pre-analysis and post-analysis visualizations can help one understand “what is going on in the data\" in a way that looking at numerical summaries of fitted model estimates cannot. The lattice package in R is uniquely designed to graphically depict relationships in multivariate data sets.\nThis course describes and demonstrates this creative approach for constructing and drawing grid-based multivariate graphic plots and figures using R. Lattice graphics are characterized as multi-variable (3, 4, 5 or more variables) plots that use conditioning and paneling. Consequently, it is a popular approach for, and a good fit to visually present the results of multi-variable statistical model fitting. The appearance of most of the plots, graphs and figures are determined by panel functions, rather than by the high-level graphics function calls themselves. Further, the user of lattice graphics has extensive and comprehensive control over many more of the details and features of the visual plots, far greater control that is afforded by the base graphics approach in R. The method is based on trellis graphics which were popularized in the S language developed by Bell Labs.",

But data alone isn’t much good unless it’s analyzed, understood, and acted upon. Data analysis is benefiting from new technology tools by allowing analysts to dig more deeply into supply chains. At the same time, human judgment remains the most important element in the analysis. Data is defined as facts, figures, or information that are stored in a variety of places such as invoices, contracts, and bills of lading. By collecting data, a business can improve shipment transparency, visibility, operational efficiency, and products and services. All of which attracts more users. Transparency and visibility are crucial, particularly if something goes wrong while shipments are in transit. By utilizing data, a split-second decision doesn’t have to make without adequate support. Transparency and visibility are also important when reviewing invoices and contracts with supply-chain partners. Despite good intentions, hidden costs can occur. They usually come in the form of surcharges such as extra delivery-area fees, additional handling, and fuel.. Consumption rates and inventory levels are among the data points critical to proper inventory planning and development.",

If you can only learn one tool or algorithm for machine learning or building predictive models now, what is this tool? Without a doubt, that is Xgboost! If you are going to participate in a Kaggle contest, what is your preferred modeling tool? Again, the answer is Xgboost! This is proven by countless experienced data scientists and new comers. Therefore, you must register for this course!\nThe Xgboost is so famous in Kaggle contests because of its excellent accuracy, speed and stability. For example, according to the survey, more than 70% the top kaggle winners said they have used XGBoost.\nThe Xgboost is really useful and performs manifold functionalities in the data science world; this powerful algorithm is so frequently utilized to predict various types of targets – continuous, binary, categorical data, it is also found Xgboost very effective to solve different multiclass or multilabel classification problems. In addition, the contests on Kaggle platform covered almost all the applications and industries in the world, such as retail business, banking, insurance, pharmaceutical research, traffic control and credit risk management.\nThe Xgboost is powerful, but it is not that easy to exercise it full capabilities without expert’s guidance. For example, to successfully implement the Xgboost algorithm, you also need to understand and adjust many parameter settings. For doing so, I will teach you the underlying algorithm so you are able to configure the Xgboost that tailor to different data and application scenarios. In addition, I will provide intensive lectures on feature engineering, feature selection and parameters tuning aiming at Xgboost. So, after training you should also be able to prepare the suitable data or features that can well feed the XGBoost model.\nThis course is really practical but not lacking in theory; we start from decision trees and its related concepts and components, transferring to constructing the gradient boot methods, then leading to the Xgboost modeling. The math and statistics are mildly applied to explain the mechanisms in all machine learning methods. We use the Python pandas data frames to deal with data exploration and cleaning. One significant feature of this course is that we have used many Python program examples to demonstrate every single knowledge point and skill you have learned in the lecture.",

      "description": "A) Purpose of Monte Carlo Simulation\nMonte Carlo Simulation is a computational technique used in complex systems where deterministic results (or precisely known input values) are difficult or impossible to obtain.\nThe main process is to generate random values for each input variable based on your knowledge of their behavior. The formulating would then be replicated over 1000s of instances, each with its own randomly extracted input variables. The resulting 1000s of output values can then be statistically analyzed to provide estimates with the required confidence.\nMonte Carlo Simulation will therefore resolve the problem analysts get when they are not sure of their estimates.\nB) Cases where it can be Used\nHere are some situations that can be resolved by applying Monte Carlo Simulation:\n1) When you need to estimate input variables in a formulation. Each estimate will have an error margin. Your output results will therefore have a compounded error, making it difficult for you to be precise and accurate.\n2) When designing a business process that has an elaborate quantitative formulation. Manually, such objectives as costing, efficiency, reliability and risk cannot easily be calculated to give specific answers. Monte Carlo Simulation can then be used to assist designers get answers that can be quoted within confidence intervals.\n3) When supporting Data Analysis, Data Science methods or Machine Learning methods that can only be verified using test results based on a large number of scenarios. Applications such as forecasting, optimization, regression, bootstrapping techniques, queuing systems and other system dynamics processes.\n4) When you have a formulation that requires the use of sensitivity analysis, influence testing and confidence intervals of the outcome and related risk analysis.\nC) An Example: Planning a Project\nWhen planning projects with a large number of tasks that have imprecise duration and costs, estimation errors will creep into the global duration and cost resulting in a compounded error. Each variation you try will result in a different critical path.\nMCS allows you to prepare 1000s of scenarios. Each one will represent an “instance” of your project. For each task, you will be able to sample a random value from a probability distribution that best represents the behavior of the duration or the cost of such tasks.\nThe 1000s of scenarios will then result in 1000s of total duration (critical path) or total costs. It can also result in many critical paths and can hence indicate which one is the most likely path your project will take. How does that help? You will be able to express your results with a measured degree of confidence.\nYou might conclude that 90% of your scenarios resulted in a project duration shorter than 34 days. MCS can tell you that there would be a 10% risk the task might have a duration longer than 34 days. If you are more risk averse, you might use a tighter confidence level such 5% of the time, the duration might then be longer than 38 days. Such “confidence” analysis of results can only be reached when we have 1000s of durations or costs, giving you a lot more confidence in your estimates than when entering a single fixed value for the duration or cost of each task.\nD) But why do we Need a Standardized MCS Process?\nI learnt so much from many wonderful MCS books and video courses. Such a variety of approaches made it clear that I was wasting time starting each model from scratch. More time was needed to understand how each developer approached their problem and how they developed the simulations. I needed a standardized MCS process that can be used every time I developed a new model. This resulted in the 8-step process we will be using in this course.\nSuch a standardized and segmented process would ease troubleshooting and debugging models. It would also make them more friendly to share. Moreover, you would be able to reuse some of these steps in future models.\nE) The Practical 8-Step Process for Developing Monte Carlo Simulation Models\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to use the 8 steps having learnt it through a documented Case Model:\nStep 1: express your problem statement and prepare the information you need in the coming steps. Develop a formulation that is static, that is, it would be based on single fixed estimates of input variables. This would help you validate the formulation early in the process.\nStep 2: identify the input variables in the model and determine the probability distributions that best represent each variable. In this step, and using the information from step 1, you will also be able to configure each distribution with using its proper parameters: means, rates, standard deviations.\nStep 3: develop your model using functions that extract random values from each of these distributions. Replace the fixed estimates used in Step 1 with dynamic random values extracted in Step 2. Each of the 1000s of scenarios would be an instant of your formulation containing different values of the input variables. This is the heart of the Monte Carlo model and it would result in 1000s of output results.\nSteps 4 to 7: develop and interpret the results with 5 analytic methods: frequency tables, combo charts showing the frequency and cumulative frequency percent of your output results, confidence intervals using percentiles, sensitivity and influence analysis.\nFinally, in Step 8 you will state your findings and answer the questions raised in the problem statement as well as suggest diverse extensions and improvements to the model on hand.\nF) Related Matter\nThe course includes many concrete models using the 8-step process. Various distributions will be clarified and used in these models: Uniform, Categorical (Discrete), Normal, Binomial, LogNormal, Geometric, Negative Binomial, Exponential, BetaPERT, etc. These will be explained and documented in detail along with examples and procedures to use them in Monte Carlo Simulation.\nAll lectures will be supported by a variety of resources:\n· Solved and documented MCS models in Excel (18 all in all)\n· Dedicated workbooks that animate and describe various probability distributions (10 all in all)\n· Some blank models that allow you to start from scratch\n· Templates that can be used by you\n· Links to Interesting articles and books\n· Detailed procedures for some elaborate formulations\n· Related lists",

Though market analysis is an appropriate activity for both for-profit and not-for-profit enterprise, market analysis alone may not fully connect with the mission-mindedness of the not-for-profit organization. Community analysis can support knowledge of the community, its structures, and market opportunities, but the service mission of not-for-profits often focus more on service gaps, collaborations, and community impact in areas where for-profit entities do not perceive a market. For that reason, a community analysis may be more appropriate when the motivations are social good as primary and profit as secondary.\nSecondary, but still important profit motive can be translated into sustainability for the social good you are performing through the business. This training operationalizes mission-driven community analysis in a way that illuminates vision, translates it into actionable goals, organizes groups for collective action, and evaluated both process and impact.\nWe achieve this through 3 products. You will have the ability to create the following after completing this training:\nA case for social care including environmental practice, which explains cultural, health, economic, political, and technological impacts on individual choice behavior.\nA community analysis report complete with information from 6 distinct areas explaining the community you intend to analyze.\nA foundation for collective activity with proposed intervention goals attending to expansion, partnership, and convening considerations.\nAn evaluation plan that included formative correction and summative innovation prompts, process mapping for replication, and impact evaluation for data-based storytelling.",

We will see much of that in this course.\nBasically, a sales analysis is a detailed report, or set of reports, that shows a business's sales performance, as well as customer data and generated revenue, profits, and profit margins. The report defines the strengths and weaknesses of products and sales efforts by referencing historical and current metrics to detect emerging trends that are most relevant to a company.\nSales and customer analysis provides critical values from which analysts can make important business decisions. This enables management to make data-driven decisions rather than relying on guesswork. With insights into various sales channels, companies can discover where their most-profitable customers lie, where additional promotions are needed, and which products need quicker turnover or retirement.\nA suite of customer and sales reports gives businesses the ability to pinpoint performance weaknesses and make effective improvements to promote sales, revenue, and profits.\nThere are at many types of customers, sales, and purchase analysis methods. Power BI and DAX have the breadth and depth of functionality to allow us to perform analysis such as:\n· Sales Trend Analysis\n· Sales Performance Analysis\n· Predictive Sales Analysis\n· Product Sales Analysis\n· Customer churn (retention)\n· Cluster Analysis\n· Cohort Analysis\n· Segmentation Analysis\n· Pareto Analysis\nIn this course you will learn how to perform all of these types of analyses and much more.

      "description": "MySQL, the most popular Open Source SQL database management system, is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation.\nThe SQL part of “MySQL” stands for “Structured Query Language”. SQL is the most common standardized language used to access databases. Depending on your programming environment, you might enter SQL directly (for example, to generate reports), embed SQL statements into code written in another language, or use a language-specific API that hides the SQL syntax.\nA database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such as MySQL Server. Since computers are very good at handling large amounts of data, database management systems play a central role in computing, as standalone utilities, or as parts of other applications.\nMySQL is Open source which means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify the software. Anybody can download the MySQL software from the Internet and use it without paying anything. If you wish, you may study the source code and change it to suit your needs.\nMicrosoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications—which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet). Microsoft markets at least a dozen different editions of Microsoft SQL Server, aimed at different audiences and for workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.\nDatabase migration is the process of migrating data from one or more source databases to one or more target databases by using a database migration service. When a migration is finished, the datasets in the source databases resides fully, though possibly restructured, in the target databases.\nIn this course you will learn how to migrate a database from MySQL into Microsoft SQL Server using SQL Server Migration Assistant for MySQL (SSMA). The migration will involve schema and data migration.",
