      "description": "Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information,informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains.In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.\nBusiness intelligence (BI) combines business analytics, data mining, data visualization, data tools and infrastructure, and best practices to help organisations to make more data-driven decisions. In practice, you know you’ve got modern business intelligence when you have a comprehensive view of your organisation’s data and use that data to drive change,eliminate inefficiencies and quickly adapt to market or supply changes.\nSQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.\nWhat is SQL?\nSQL stands for Structured Query Language\nSQL lets you access and manipulate databases\nSQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987\nWhat Can SQL do?\nSQL can execute queries against a database\nSQL can retrieve data from a database\nSQL can insert records in a database\nSQL can update records in a database\nSQL can delete records from a database\nSQL can create new databases\nSQL can create new tables in a database\nSQL can create stored procedures in a database\nSQL can create views in a database\nSQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views\n\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft.\nTransact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's  proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with relational databases\nMySQL is a DBMS, or database management system. It is developed, supported and distributed by Oracle, but since it is open-source it is freely available to anyone under the GPL. MySQL databases are relational, meaning that the data is split up between tables. MySQL is very fast and lightweight so you can run it alongside your other applications on a desktop or laptop. It can also be scaled up to take advantage of all the CPU power and memory available on a dedicated machine.\nPostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.\nMicrosoft Excel is one of the top tools for data analysis and the built-in pivot tables are arguably the most popular analytic tool.\nPower BI is Microsoft's interactive data visualization and analytics tool for business intelligence (BI).\nTableau is a powerful and fastest data visualization tool used in the Business Intelligence Industry. It helps in simplifying raw data in a very easily understandable format.\nIn this course we will be performing data analysis and business intelligence using MySQL, SQL,  Microsoft SQL ,PostgreSQL , Excel, Power BI and Tableau.",

Simply put,If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.\nIt is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it’s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people get interested data from database. It is also an English like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL query easily.\nSQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.\nYou can earn good money\nHow much time does it take to learn SQL?\nSQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.\nWhat are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?\nStart learning from the basics of SQL. The first 10 sections of the course cover the basics.\nOnce done with the basics, try your hands on advanced SQL. Next 10 sections cover Advanced topics\nPractice your learning on the exercise provided in every section.\nWhat's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?\nSQL is a language. Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"\nPostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.\nAll of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.\nWhat is BigQuery used for?\nBigQuery is a web service from Google that is used for handling or analyzing big data. Google BigQuery is part of the Google Cloud Platform. As a NoOps (no operations) data analytics service, Google BigQuery offers users the ability to manage data using fast SQL-like queries for real-time analysis.\nIs BigQuery free?\nFor users of Google BigQuery the first 10GB of storage per month is free and the first 1TB of query per month is free. Post these limits, Google BigQuery is chargeable.\nWhich is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?\nBoth are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.\nPostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.\nOpen source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.\nWho uses these databases?\nHere are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.\nGoogle BigQuery is used by companies such as Spotify, The New York Times, Stack Etc.",

      "description": "The first thing you need to know about this course, is that this is NOT your granddad’s Excel.\nInstead of the same old spreadsheet stuff, we’ll do a deep dive on a truly revolutionary set of tools that empower you to do industrial-strength Business Intelligence: the art and science of transforming data - usually massive amounts of it - into meaningful, actionable insights.\nIn the past, doing “real” BI meant using expensive enterprise software that only a select few people would have access to anyway. But with what you’ll learn in this course, you’ll be building robust Business Intelligence solutions in no time, using nothing more than an Excel spreadsheet on your desktop.\n\n\nFirst up, we’ll dive into Power Query, a feature-packed yet easy to use tool for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL for short) data from just about any source you can imagine into Excel. From text files to databases, wherever the data you want to analyze might be stored, you can use Power Query to pull it into Excel, and then transform it however you need to support your analysis.\nNext, there's an optional section on Pivot Tables, just in case you’re not already familiar with them. While Pivot Tables may not be a revolutionary new feature in and of themselves, they nonetheless play a crucial role in the Excel Business Intelligence landscape.\n\n\nWe’ll then learn to turn those Pivot Tables into “Power” Pivot Tables, by connecting them to the Excel Data Model...which is basically a relational database that lives right inside your Excel spreadsheet! This will allow us to mash up and analyze multiple datasets in a single Pivot Table...no VLOOKUPS required!\nAnd remember how Excel usually starts to sputter out once you try to play around with more than a couple hundred thousand rows of data? No more! Power Pivot let's you work with up to hundreds of millions of records in a single Excel file.\nThen, so we can get the absolute most out of our Data Model (and into our Power Pivot Tables), we'll learn DAX, an incredibly powerful formula language for creating complex calculations that you can drop right into your Pivots.\nSince the basics of DAX syntax are easy to pick up if you’re already familiar with Excel formulas, we'll venture into advanced topics like Time Intelligence, Iterator Functions, and Variables; and with exercises after almost every video, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to master what you’ve learned, right after you learn it.\nOf course, all that number crunching doesn't help much if we can't present those numbers in an intuitive, easily digestible way. That's why I close the course out with a series of powerful visualization techniques - from conditional formatting to Pivot Charts - that will transform your calculations into insights that can be used to make real-world decisions.\nWe’ll even explore techniques for building dynamic dashboards in Excel, using Slicers and Timelines to not only filter our charts, but actually change the metrics we display in them. And all supported by the Data Model’s capacity for juggling hundreds of millions of rows of data in a single spreadsheet.\nAnd in each section, I use hands-on demos, practical examples, and intuitive, common-sense explanations to teach you these concepts in a way that will help you see the connection between your new skills and the problems you’re trying to solve on the job.\nBut just as importantly, I’ve packed the course with TONS of exercises - ranging from straightforward to challenging - that will help you retain, and even build on, what you’ve learned.\nSo if you want to master these game-changing tools and build professional-grade Business Intelligence solutions right on your desktop, all you need is Microsoft Excel - and this course - to do it. I look forward to seeing you there!",

You can also take quizzes to check your understanding of concepts. Each section contains a practice assignment for you to practically implement your learning.\nWhat is covered in this course?\nThis course teaches you all the steps of creating a Linear Regression model, which is the most popular Machine Learning model, to solve business problems.\nBelow are the course contents of this course on Linear Regression:\n· Section 1 - Basics of Statistics\nThis section is divided into five different lectures starting from types of data then types of statistics\nthen graphical representations to describe the data and then a lecture on measures of center like mean\nmedian and mode and lastly measures of dispersion like range and standard deviation\n· Section 2 - Data Preprocessing\nIn this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then\nprepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.\nWe start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation and correlation.\n· Section 3 - Regression Model\nThis section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.\nWe have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you\nunderstand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand\nit, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.\nWe also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results, what are other variations to the ordinary least squared method and how do we finally interpret the result to find out the answer to a business problem.\nBy the end of this course, your confidence in creating a regression model in R will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use regression modelling to create predictive models and solve business problems.\n\n\nGo ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!\n\n\nCheers\nStart-Tech Academy\n\n\n------------\nBelow is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-\nWhat is Machine Learning?\nMachine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\nWhat is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\nLinear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.\nLinear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).\nWhen there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.\nWhen there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.\nWhy learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\nThere are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:\n1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique\n2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy\n3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret\n4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning\nHow much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?\nLinear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.\nWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\nYou can divide your learning process into 4 parts:\nStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\nUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\nProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the R environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in R\nUnderstanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture in R where we actually run each query with you.",

      "description": "Believe it or not, almost all online businesses today make use of recommender systems in some way or another.\nWhat do I mean by “recommender systems”, and why are they useful?\nLet’s look at the top 3 websites on the Internet, according to Alexa: Google, YouTube, and Facebook.\nRecommender systems form the very foundation of these technologies.\nGoogle: Search results\nThey are why Google is the most successful technology company today.\nYouTube: Video dashboard\nI’m sure I’m not the only one who’s accidentally spent hours on YouTube when I had more important things to do! Just how do they convince you to do that?\nThat’s right. Recommender systems!\nFacebook: So powerful that world governments are worried that the newsfeed has too much influence on people! (Or maybe they are worried about losing their own power... hmm...)\nAmazing!\n\n\nThis course is a big bag of tricks that make recommender systems work across multiple platforms.\nWe’ll look at popular news feed algorithms, like Reddit, Hacker News, and Google PageRank.\nWe’ll look at Bayesian recommendation techniques that are being used by a large number of media companies today.\n\n\nBut this course isn’t just about news feeds.\nCompanies like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify have been using recommendations to suggest products, movies, and music to customers for many years now.\nThese algorithms have led to billions of dollars in added revenue.\nSo I assure you, what you’re about to learn in this course is very real, very applicable, and will have a huge impact on your business.\n\n\nFor those of you who like to dig deep into the theory to understand how things really work, you know this is my specialty and there will be no shortage of that in this course. We’ll be covering state of the art algorithms like matrix factorization and deep learning (making use of both supervised and unsupervised learning - Autoencoders and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and you’ll learn a bag full of tricks to improve upon baseline results.\n\n\nAs a bonus, we will also look how to perform matrix factorization using big data in Spark. We will create a cluster using Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Most other courses and tutorials look at the MovieLens 100k dataset - that is puny! Our examples make use of MovieLens 20 million.\n\n\nWhether you sell products in your e-commerce store, or you simply write a blog - you can use these techniques to show the right recommendations to your users at the right time.\nIf you’re an employee at a company, you can use these techniques to impress your manager and get a raise!\n\n\nI’ll see you in class!\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\nThis course is not \"officially\" part of my deep learning series. It contains a strong deep learning component, but there are many concepts in the course that are totally unrelated to deep learning.\n\n\n\"If you can't implement it, you don't understand it\"\nOr as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: \"What I cannot create, I do not understand\".\nMy courses are the ONLY courses where you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch\nOther courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?\nAfter doing the same thing with 10 datasets, you realize you didn't learn 10 things. You learned 1 thing, and just repeated the same 3 lines of code 10 times...\n\n\nSuggested Prerequisites:\nFor earlier sections, just know some basic arithmetic\nFor advanced sections, know calculus, linear algebra, and probability for a deeper understanding\nBe proficient in Python and the Numpy stack (see my free course)\nFor the deep learning section, know the basics of using Keras\nFor the RBM section, know Tensorflow\n\n\nWHAT ORDER SHOULD I TAKE YOUR COURSES IN?:\nCheck out the lecture \"Machine Learning and AI Prerequisite Roadmap\" (available in the FAQ of any of my courses, including the free Numpy course)\n\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES\nEvery line of code explained in detail - email me any time if you disagree\nNo wasted time \"typing\" on the keyboard like other courses - let's be honest, nobody can really write code worth learning about in just 20 minutes from scratch\nNot afraid of university-level math - get important details about algorithms that other courses leave out",

You'll see the real experience of data cleaning. Data cleaning isn't always clearcut, and this is why we'll show you what it looks like to iterate changes on your dataset as new information presents itself during the data preparation/data munging process.\n*This is a very basic course geared toward people who have little experience with data cleaning.\n**Please note that in this course, we use an older version of Trifacta Wrangler.\nNote: Data analysts and scientists spend up to 80 percent of their time preparing and cleaning their data. This is a lot of time that could be used in more important phases of the data life cycle, so saving time at the data preparation stage gives you a competitive edge in the data space because you can use saved time toward more important things, like analyzing your data.\nForrester research identifies data preparation tools as “must haves.\" Trifacta Wrangler is one of those tools and the product is guided by a board of advisors that has the likes of DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher, among other notables.

Through the use of MySQL (an open source and free tool) we will explore various use cases like patient volumes, emergency room throughput, and procedures to learn new SQL and healthcare analytics skills. I will be taking an approach of presenting healthcare topics briefly before diving into working examples using SQL. My intent is to help us apply technical concepts of the SQL language while at the same time learning new healthcare knowledge. Following each lecture, there will be an assignment for students to really apply and grow beyond what we cover over video content. I have found this approach really helps with long term retainment of skills. This course is great for anyone new to healthcare and/or SQL and is meant to help others jump start a career in healthcare analytics.\nThis course was created by me - Mark Connolly, MEng. I'm currently a Business Intelligence Lead and co-lead for the virtual Tableau Healthcare User Group. I have almost 10 years of experience in the healthcare analytics space in general. I have used SQL heavily in my most recent role to answer many healthcare clinical analytics questions.\nBeyond my experience working directly with SQL, I have also developed internal Tableau training programs and provided 100's (if not 1000's) of hours of training support to analysts both at his current organization and externally. I am also the creator for the strongly reviewed Tableau for Healthcare course on Udemy.\nPlease note that this course utilizes training data and is not reflective of any current or past performance or clinical data for any patient, health system, insurance provider, or any other entity.

      "description": "Data manipulation is a vital data analysis skill – actually, it is the foundation of data analysis. This course is about the most effective data manipulation tool in R – dplyr!\n\n\nAs a data analyst, you will spend a vast amount of your time preparing or processing your data. The goal of data preparation is to convert your raw data into a high quality data source, suitable for analysis. More often than not, this process involves a lot of work. The dplyr package contains the tools that can make this work much easier.\n\n\ndplyr has a few important advantages over other data data manipulation tools or functions:\n\n\nit’s much faster (25-30 times faster)\nits code is easier to write and understand\nit can use chaining to build sequences of commands, thus making the code even cleaner and faster to execute\n\n\nFor these reasons, dplyr quickly began the most popular data manipulation tool among R data scientists. When you finish this course, you will be able to\n\n\nIt is a short course, but it is focused on the most essential commands and functions of the dplyr package, those commands that you will likely use most often.\n\n\nSo let’s see what you are going to learn in this course.\n\n\nThe first section covers the five core dplyr commands. These commands are: filter, select, mutate, arrange and summarise. You will need these commands practically every time when you work with dplyr. They are used to subset data frames, compute new variables, sort data frames, compute statistical indicators and so on. Here’s a few real life scenarios of their utilization:\n\n\nyou need to extract from your respondents data set the male subjects with an income greater than $30,000\nyou need to compute each respondent’s income per family member, knowing the total income and the number of family members\nyou have a data set with 27 variables, but you only need 6 for your analysis (so you want to remove the extra variables)\nyou have to sort your employees data set by salary\nyou need to compute the average satisfaction towards a product, knowing each individual customer satisfaction etc.\n\n\nThe second section approaches other important dplyr commands and functions. In this section you’ll learn:\n\n\nhow to count the observation in a certain group\nhow to extract a random sample from your data frame\nhow to extract the top entries from your data frame, based on a given variable\nhow to visualize the structure of your data set\nhow to use the set operations in dplyr (if you have used these operations in base R, you’ll see that dplyr takes them to a whole new level).\n\n\nIn the third section you’ll start to take advantage of the true power of dplyr. Here we’ll talk about chaining – creating sequences of dplyr commands that accomplish multiple tasks with one click only.\n\n\nThe fourth section is about joining data frames with dplyr. This is a very important topic, because many times your data will be found in several data frames. So you will need to join these data frames into only one, suitable for your analyses. We are going to look at five join types available in dplyr: inner_join, semi_join, left_join, anti_join and full_join. We are going to examine the output of each join type using a simple example.\n\n\nIn the fifth section we’ll learn how to combine the dplyr and ggplot2 (using chaining) commands to build expressive charts and graphs. For example, if you want to represent the income distribution for the subjects with a higher education only, or the relationship between income and education level for the female subjects only, in this section you will learn exactly how to do it.\n\n\nEvery command is illustrated with video, both the syntax and the output being explained in detail. At the end of the course, a big number of practical exercises are proposed. By doing these exercises you’ll actually apply in practice what you have learned.\n\n\nJoin this course right now and acquire a critical data analysis ability – data manipulation!",

      "description": "Complete Beginner Course\nIf you're looking for a tool that can help you get started on your research and analyses and have decided to go with Jamovi, then this is the right course for you. This course will give you an introductory overview of how to use Jamovi and what it's main features are. Anyone can take this course. You don't have to be a stats expert or some kind of special researcher. It's mainly about how to use the tool, Jamovi.\nGet Started with R Programming\nIf you're learning the R programming language, this is a handy tool to have under your belt. Its syntax mode can act like a little cheat code generator for you to use in R and instantaneously be able to do everything that you can do in Jamovi in RStudio.\nIn This Course\nYou'll get some information about Jamovi's user interface and how you can get it to do stuff. It's a pretty straight forward interface, there's actually not much explanation  needed. You'll be amazed and surprised at just how easy to use and intutitive Jamovi is. It's beatifully designed and great to use.\nYou'll find out just how easy it to bring your data into Jamovi, set your variables to ordinal, nominal, continuous, add some new computed and transformed variables, and use filters to focus on specific areas of your dataset.\nThen we'll take a detour and install R and RStudio and have a look at how you can bring in datasets open in Jamovi into RStudio just by typing two words, and how you can then easily copy/paste the R code from Jamovi. You just copy and paste it!\nAnother great feature in Jamovi is that you can install Modules wich are like add-ons or R packages. These allow you to do more cool stuff with Jamovi. We'll have a look at how to install them and I'll give you some tips on how to use two of them scatr and my favourite, Flexplot!\nAnalyses Demonstrations:\nWe're going to have a look at each of the analyses in Jamovi, with an example. The focus of this part of the course is just to give you a rudementary look at each of the analyses, and kinda  get a feel of what you can do with Jamovi's suite of analyses.\nIt includes all the basic good stuff:\nT-Test: Independent, Paired, and One-Sample\nANOVAS (one-way, factoral, repeated measures), ANCOVA (and MANCOVA), Non-parametric one way and repeated meausers ANOVA\nCorrelation & Regression, Logistic Regression (Binomial, Multinomial, Ordinal)\nFriequencies: One Sample Proportion Tests(Binomial and Chi Goodness of Fit), Contingency Tables (Chi test of association and McNemar), Log-Linear Regression)\nFactor Analyses (Reliability, Principle Component, Exploratory, and Confirmatory Anlyses)\nBut remember, that's not all. Jamovi's modules let you do a lot more. Everything from JASP's suite of Baysein statistics to Survival Analyses. Check it out, and explore.\nPracticing is Easy\nAs far as practice activities go, I encourage you to follow along with the same examples and repeat them using your own combination of variables and to experiment with using the code in R and seeing where it takes you. All these demonstration examples are pretty simple. It's really easy for anyone to swap out the variables used in any of the demonstrations with other variables in the same dataset or to go through other datasets and repeat the same analyses. Just give it a shot. There's even a module called R Datasets which installs a bunch of datasets for you to practice on. Explore, experiment and be creative!\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Get started with Jamovi today!!!\n\n\nMore about the Jamovi:\nData Science is really cool and awesome. As with anything you really want to get done, there's nothing more helpful than a good tool that can help you do the job. Jamovi pushes the envelope when it comes to something that's free, open, user-friendly and fun. It's features and specifications rival that of paid programs like SPSS, STATA and SASS.\nIt includes really awesome stuff and the best part is that it's all built on top of R. Hadley Wickham, a big name in data science, spoke about how GUIs aren't really great for data science. It's true, but in that same talk in the 2016 conference he mentions that, it's okay to copy/paste code. You don't have to be a coding dictionary to be good at R. That's another area where Jamovi shines and flexes its muscles. It's got syntax mode! It's like an R code cheat sheet generator. You can easily start to code in R and do everything you can do in Jamovi, in R, just by copy/pasting the code.\nIt's really great for a beginner who is just learning R. No one wants to start learning something and feel like it's so hard and like it'll take ages for them to actually start learning and be able to actually do anything. But with Jamovi's syntax mode, you can easily just start copy/pasting code into R and getting results right away. Who wouldn't want that?\nAnd since Jamovi's code is based on other packages as well, it's a really nice package to start working with and start learning with. It can help you get started.\nThe visualizations in Jamovi are stunning, amazing, and easy. The analyses are the best, so neatly organized and the changes show up in the results immediately.\nAfter seeing all these features of Jamovi, I tototally lost it. I said to myself how can something so cool, awesome, fun and insightful be free? Yes! It's all free.\nI asked myself, where has this tool been all my life? Why didn't I know about? I thought of all the opportunities that I had missed in my career. All the cool visualizations I could made to convey my points to my bosses and colleagues and other people. I thought of all the things that I could have understood better in the past if I had just known about Jamovi and been able to use it.\nSo, then I decided to create a course about this cool awesome Jamovi software so that everyone could benefit from it.",

IDEF0 is a powerful, yet simple, structured modelling method that allows you to visually represent the different levels of granularity of functions (also activities and processes), their inputs, outputs, mechanisms and controls. Therefore, IDEF0 will equip you with a very useful addition to your toolkit of techniques for information modelling and representation.\nIn this course you will learn IDEF0 from a practical perspective. The course covers all the necessary explanations around the fundamental and most commonly used building blocks of the graphical language, describing their meaning and how they are used. This leads to a number of examples and case studies that are discussed, analysed and solved so as to provide you with the best applied knowledge of IDEF0. You are also shown some key ways for practically presenting your models. A wealth of downloadable resources is provided, ranging from Microsoft Visio templates to fully-worked solutions, images, slides and more.\nThis course is chiefly targeted at business analysts, information modellers, data analysts, systems engineers, design engineers, etc., of all levels and who do not have prior exposure to IDEF0. Additionally, you are very welcome to take the course if you have an interest in the area of information representation through visual methods.",

This was an excellent course.\nExcellent course with a general overview of all the features that Looker Studio has to offer. Concise, simple to understand, great presentation and to the point. Excellent!\nVery thorough and concise course. I feel like I've gained all of the knowledge I need to get started with building effective reports in Looker Studio.

      "description": "Looking to get ECBA®, CCBA®, or CBAP® certified or recertified? - This course qualifies for 5 PD Hours/CDUs!\nOVER 40% OF PROJECTS FAIL BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PLANNING - BECOME ONE OF THE FEW BUSINESS ANALYSTS THAT ARE TRAINED IN USING PROJECT MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND SEE MORE PROJECTS THROUGH TO SUCCESS\nThe top-cited reason by organizations for not planning a project is not understanding how to plan.\nAnd since many organizations don’t have the resources to put a Business Analyst and a Project Manager on the same projects, they often expect the BA to take on the responsibilities of both.\nLeaving you in charge of the planning.\nAnd since the majority of Business Analysts aren’t trained in the role of project management – you’re often stuck in an embarrassing and stressful situation.\nThis course will teach you how to use project management techniques to put together a robust step-by-step project plan that’ll not only help ensure a project’s success but also save your organization time and money…\nAs well as keep you one step ahead of your competition while you do it.\nCourse enrollment grants you lifetime access, with no expiration, to all the course lectures, activities, handouts, and quizzes. In addition, you’ll also receive 1-on-1 support for any questions or uncertainties that come up. And this all comes with a money-back guarantee. You have nothing to lose and so much to gain.\n\n\nWhy do organizations tend to still execute projects without a plan?\nThe common reasons given are:\n1. We don’t have time to plan\n2. Plans only cause constraints and restrict our team\n3. Things change too much to plan for them\nAnd while these seem like legitimate reasons, they aren’t!\nTaking steps upfront to plan the project will actually:\n1. Help you understand and prioritize project activities – allowing you to manage your time and resources effectively\n2. Provide direction to team members about their roles and responsibilities – so they can focus on doing their jobs as well as possible, and not waste time struggling to understand what’s required of them\n3. Allow you to predict changes and possibilities – leaving you in a position to respond to stumbling blocks effectively and spend less time fighting fires\n\n\nLet’s hear what our students have to say:\n“The course is great for both new and experienced Business Analysts who want to streamline and finish their learning mode. It takes you step by step of the whole project planning phase. […] The course is perfect, it really teach you a lot, I know it because I have taken full business analysis courses online and offline from a couple of instructors and no one is better.” – Talai\n“Course continues to exceed my expectation. Jeremy presents the information in an easy to understand. I recommend his courses to all that have an interest in Business Analysis or Project Management.” - James\n“Jeremy's in-depth knowledge on the role of business analysis is quite transparent and shines through. Breaking down that role and clearly explaining the requirements and how to measure the KPI to be successful as a business analysis is quite informative. Thank you Jeremy.” - Saul\n\n\nBy this point, you’re probably sold on the virtues of planning…\nBut perhaps you’re intimidated by the idea of learning how to be able to plan any variety of projects – and indeed what aspects of a project you should be planning.\nIf so, don’t panic.\nThis course will take you through my 5-Step Project Planning Process. This process will act as a framework for you to use for all your future projects.\nThe BA Guide’s 5 Step Process to Plan a Project\nInitiate the Project Plan - Learn how to identify and engage with stakeholders, create a Project Charter, and conduct an official kick-off meeting\nCreate a Requirements Management Plan - Learn how to define the different aspects of the requirements including the level of detail, storage, access, traceability, reuse, and more, to give you an overview of what needs to be done.\nDefine the Project Plan Details - Learn how to break down the project, estimate the effort, and put together a project schedule that ensures the project is delivered on time.\nConduct Stakeholder Analysis & Engagement - Learn how to utilize various techniques to assign roles, responsibilities, and define a communication plan, so you can stay in control.\nSet Performance Measures - Learn to identify key performance indicators to later validate success and learn from areas of opportunity.\nWithin each step, you’ll learn the techniques, tools, and skills through the use of practical, real-world examples – meaning you won’t just understand the 5 steps, but you’ll also know how to apply them when the opportunity arises.\n\n\nWhat is included in the course?\n- Over 5 hours of high-quality video lectures that break down all the concepts covered into an easy to understand, step-by-step format.\n- A 35-page Student Workbook that will enhance your learning and your information retention from the course, as well as giving you reference material after you’ve completed the course.\n- 13 Business Analysis Templates so you have all the tools you need to immediately start putting together a project plan.\nIn addition to all the tools you’ll need to start planning the project, you’ll also get a foot into the field by way of an industry expert…\nI’m not just the instructor who wrote this course, I will also act as both a resource and a mentor to guide you to a long and rewarding career in Business Analysis!\n\n\nStill not sure? Hear what others had to say\n“The course is very practical and very helpful. Planning, communication and collaboration can save every project. I like much components breakdown of the project. And […] users stories and Agile approach were quite new for me, but Jeremy explained them very well.” – Yury\n“I've been working my way through The BA Guide (Jeremy Aschenbrenner) series, and this is #5 for me. These courses are so dependably excellent. Jeremy is deeply knowledgeable & experienced as a BA, and his presentation skills are superb. He also provides templates that alone are worth the price of the course. I can't recommend this series enough.” – Liz\n“Jeremy did a great job in explaining the process for Plan the Project course. He enumerated the expectations for each of the sections and provided tips on how to achieve it.” - Gerry\n\n\nStill not convinced?\nAnd if you’re still not sure – here’s my promise to you:\nThis course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee! That means, if you aren’t completely satisfied with your purchase, I’ll give you a full refund – no questions asked!\nWhether you are an aspiring or a seasoned Business Analyst, this course is a must.\n\nThis course is the third course of the Business Analysis Process Series:\nIdentify the Problem\nConduct a Strategy Analysis\n=> Plan the Project <=\nUnderstand and Elicit Requirements\nAnalyze, Model, and Organize Requirements\nManage, Prioritize, and Validate Requirements\nTransition to the Solution\nComplete a Solution Evaluation\nWhilst taking the previous courses isn’t a requirement, I do recommend it as it will help your understanding of the material covered as we will be building on skills and techniques taught in the previous course lectures.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have learned how to effectively plan a project and become an incredibly valuable Business Analyst who doesn't require a Project Manager to be successful.\nSo, if you’re ready to save your organization time and money and ensure the project you’re in charge of doesn’t become one of the 40% that fails due to poor planning, enroll today.",

      "description": "AI for Business – AI Applications for Business Success\nAI isn’t just a fancy concept that powers self-driving vehicles, robots, and high-tech companies.\nMost organizations – regardless of their size and industry – can benefit from the application of artificial intelligence.\nCharts and dashboards are useful tools, but they often struggle to analyze big and complex datasets. This is precisely when AI outperforms the traditional Business Intelligence approach! Correlation doesn’t imply causation, and this is a significant limitation of BI.\nArtificial Intelligence can help a company in a variety of ways – it can be employed to build customer retention models, increase gross revenue by optimizing your selling price, find a way to minimize costs and optimize business processes, and ultimately – to run an organization more effectively.\nThis is what AI for Business course aims to teach you.\nYour instructor, Horia Margarit, has earned two Bachelor’s degrees in Cognitive and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Master's degree in Statistics from Stanford University. With over 10 years of professional experience in the San Francisco Bay Area, he has differentiated himself by applying highly novel methods and approaches to tackling complex business problems. As a result, his predictions for business applications of AI have been featured in both CIO Magazine and Forbes. Horia’s primary focus is on technical underpinnings that maximize actual business and customer value.\nAll this makes him uniquely qualified to teach this topic.\nIn the course, you’ll get an overview of business analytics and find out how to define SMART goals and conduct SWOT analysis. You’ll go through the challenges and opportunities of supply chain analytics to then determine the business problem we’ll tackle throughout the course.\nMoreover, we will consider the key benefits and limitations of using business analytics approach to solving such problems.\nHaving laid the foundations, we’ll then dig deeper and focus on attainability. Even more so, you will discover how to leverage the power of AI in order to achieve the set business goals.\nHere, you will be able to:\n· Build an AI model from high fidelity data\n· Extract actionable explanations\n· Predict the outcome\n· Evaluate the quality of the predictions\nWe won’t spend too much time obtaining the data and building the AI model. Instead, we will focus on evaluating the performance of those methods.\nFor that, you will go through key algorithms like Gradient Boosted Machines and Convergent Cross Mapping. Most of all, you will have the chance to examine in great detail novel approaches to understanding model performance such as LIME and SHAP values.\nAnd that’s not all!\nAfter we’ve learned how to obtain accurate predictions from our models, we’ll find out how we can show the significance of the obtained results. To do so, we’ll rely on parametric tests. More specifically, we will be working with the hybrid experiment and quantile difference tests.\nTake your AI career to new heights!\nThis course is packed with valuable concepts and state-of-the-art techniques.\nEnroll now and start your journey to AI for business today!",

      "description": "The problem\nMost data analyst, data science, and coding courses miss a crucial practical step. They don’t teach you how to work with raw data, how to clean and preprocess it. This creates a sizeable gap between the skills you need on the job and the abilities you have acquired in training. Truth be told, real-world data is messy, so you need to know how to overcome this obstacle to become an independent data professional.\nThe bootcamps we have seen online, and even live classes neglect this aspect and show you how to work with ‘clean’ data. But this isn’t doing you a favor. In reality, it will set you back both when you are applying for jobs, and when you’re on the job.\n\n\nThe solution\nOur goal is to provide you with complete preparation using the NumPy package. This course will turn you into capable data analyst with a fantastic understanding of one of the most prominent computing packages in the world. To take you there, we will cover the following topics extensively.\n\n\n· The ndarray class and why we use it\n· The type of data arrays usually contain\n· Slicing and squeezing datasets\n· Dimensions of arrays, and how to reduce them\n· Generating pseudo-random data\n· Importing data from external text files\n· Saving/Exporting data to external files\n· Computing the statistics of the dataset (max, min, mean, variance, etc.)\n· Data cleaning\n· Data preprocessing\n· Final practical example\n\n\nEach of these subjects builds on the previous ones. And this is precisely what makes our curriculum so valuable. Everything is shown in the right order and we guarantee that you are not going to get lost along the way, as we have provided all necessary steps in video (not a single one skipped). In other words, we are not going to teach you how to concatenate datasets before you know how to index or slice them.\nSo, to prepare you for the long journey towards a data science position, we created a course that will show you all the tools for the job: The Preprocessing Data with NumPy course [MG1] .\nWe believe that this resource will significantly boost your chances of landing a job, as it will prepare you for practical tasks and concepts that are frequently included in interviews.\n\n\nNumPy is Python’s fundamental package for scientific computing. It has established itself as the go-to tool when you need to compute mathematical and statical operations.\nWhy learn it?\nA large portion of a data analyst’s work is dedicated to preprocessing datasets. Unquestionably, this involves tons of mathematical and statistical techniques that NumPy is renowned for. What’s more, the package introduces multi-dimensional array structures and provides a plethora of built-in functions and methods to use while working with them. In other words, NumPy can be described as a computationally stable state-of-the-art Python instrument that provides great flexibility and can take your analysis to the next level.\n\n\nSome of the topics we will cover:\n\n\n1. Fundamentals of NumPy\n2. Random Generators\n3. Working with text files\n4. Statistics with NumPy\n5. Data preprocessing\n6. Final practical example\n\n\n\n\n1. Fundamentals of NumPy\nTo fully grasp the capabilities of NumPy, we need to start from the fundamentals. In this part of the course, we’ll examine the ndarray class, discuss why it’s so popular and get familiar with terms like “indexing”, “slicing”, “dimensions” and “reducing”.\nWhy learn it?\nAs stated above, NumPy is the quintessential package for scientific computing, and to understand its true value, we need to start from its very core – the ndarray class. The better we comprehend the basics, the easier it’s going to be to grasp the more difficult concepts. That’s why it’s fundamental to lay a good foundation on which to build our NumPy skills.\n\n\n2. Random Generators\nAfter we’ve learned the basics, we’ll move on to pseudo-random data and random generators. These generators will help construct a set of arbitrary variables from a given probability distribution, or a fixed set of viable options.\nWhy learn it?\nWorking in a data-driven field, we sometimes need to construct partially arbitrary tests to see if our code works as intended. And here lies the value of random generators, as they allow us to construct datasets of pseudo-random data. The added benefit of random generators is that we can set a seed if we wish to replicate a particular randomization, but we’ll go into all the details in the course itself.\n\n\n3. Working with text files\nExchanging information with text files is practically how we exchange information today. In this part of the course, we will use the Python, pandas, and NumPy tools covered earlier to give you the essentials you need when importing or saving data.\nWhy learn it?\nIn many courses, you are just given a dataset to practice your analytical and programming skills. However, we don’t want to close our eyes to reality, where converting a raw dataset from an external file into a workable Python format can be a massive challenge.\n\n\n4. Statistics with NumPy\nOnce we’ve learned how to import large sets of information from external text files, we’ll finally be ready to explore one of NumPy’s strengths – statistics. Since the package is extremely computationally durable, we often rely on its functions and methods to calculate the statistics of a sample dataset. These include the likes of the mean, the standard deviation, and much more.\nWhy learn it?\nTo become a data scientist, you not only need to be able to preprocess a dataset, but also to extract valuable insights. One way to learn more about a dataset is by examining its statistics. So, we’ll use the package to understand more about the data and how to convert this knowledge into crucial information we can use for forecasting.\n\n\n5. Data preprocessing\nEven when your dataset is in clean and comprehensible shape, it isn’t quite ready to be processed for visualizations and analysis just yet. There is a crucial step in between, and that’s data preprocessing.\nWhy learn it?\nData preprocessing is where a data analyst can demonstrate how good or great they are at their job. This stage of the work requires the ability to choose the right statistical tool that will improve the quality of your dataset and the knowledge to implement it with advanced pandas and NumPy techniques. Only when you’ve completed this step can you say that your dataset is preprocessed and ready for the next part, which is data visualization.\n\n\n6. Practical example\nThe course contains plenty of exercises and practical cases. What’s more, in the end, we have included a comprehensive practical example that will show you how everything you have learned along the way comes nicely together. This is where you will be able to appreciate how far you have come in your journey on mastering NumPy in your pursuit of a data career.\n\n\nWhat you get\n· Active Q&A support\n· All the NumPy knowledge to become a data analyst\n· A community of aspiring data analysts\n· A certificate of completion\n· Access to frequent future updates\n· Real-world training\n\n\nGet ready to become a NumPy data analyst from scratch\nWhy wait? Every day is a missed opportunity.\nClick the “Buy Now” button and become a part of our data analyst program today.",

      "description": "Are you one of the people that would like to start a data science career or are you just fond of using data for data analysis in your spare time or for your job?  Do you use spreadsheets for data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, and data analysis? I think it is time to enhance your hobby or your career path with learning adequate skills such as R.\nR is s a programming language that enables all essential steps when you are dealing with data like:\nimporting,\nexporting,\ncleaning,\nmerging,\ntransforming,\nanalyzing,\nvisualizing,\nand extracting insights from the data.\nOriginally R began as a free software environment for statistical computing with graphics supported. Over the years with the rapid development of computing power and the need for tools used for mining and analyzing tons of data that are being generated on every step of our lives, R has emerged into something much greater than its original laid path. Nowadays the R community is vast, every day thousands of people start learning R, and every day new R's libraries are being made and released to the world. These libraries solve different users' needs because they provide different functions for dealing with all kinds of data.\nIf you are still not convinced to join me on a journey where foundations for your R skills will be laid, please bear with me a bit more. In this R for Beginners course, you will dive into essential aspects of the language that will help you escalate your learning curve. Course first gently touches the basics like:\nhow to install R and how to install R's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) RStudio,\nthen you will learn how to create your first R script and R project folder,\nR project folder will be your baseline folder where all your scripts and assignments will be saved,\nyou will learn how to install different R packages and how to use functions provided with each package.\nAfter these first steps, you will dive into sections where all major R data structures are presented. You will be able to:\ndifferentiate among each data structure,\nuse built-in functions to manipulate data structures,\nreshape, access elements, and convert R objects,\nimport data from many different sources into R's workspace and\nexport R objects to different data sources.\nWhen you will have a grasp of what R is capable of, a section devoted to programming elements will guide you through essential steps for writing a programming code that can execute repetitive tasks. Here you will master:\nyour first loops,\nconditional statements,\nyour custom made functions,\nand you will be able to optimize your code using vectorization.\nIt is said that a picture can tell an observer a powerful story and holds a stronger message than a thousand words combined. In the final section of this course, the greatest R's power is revealed, the power to tell the story by using data visualization. Here you will master how to build:\nscatterplots,\nline charts,\nhistograms,\nbox plots,\nbar charts,\nmosaic plots,\nhow to alter R's default graphical parameters to make beautiful figures,\nand how to export a figure from R to a proper format for further sharing with your colleagues.\nIf you are still not convinced to start learning R, I will share with you how the course is structured:\nEach section holds separate exercises covering learning material that is related to the section's topic.\nNormally each exercise begins with a short intro that provides a basic understanding of the topic, then a coding exercise is presented.\nDuring coding exercise, you will write the R code for executing given tasks.\nAt the end of each section, an assignment is presented.\nEach assignment tests the skills you have learned during a given section.\nIn the last two assignments, you will write a code to build a simulation environment where you will execute the simulation and present the results with proper visualization techniques.\n\n\nDo not lose more time and please enroll in the course today. I guarantee you will learn a lot and you will enjoy the learning process.",

      "description": "Are you looking to learn how to do Data Mining like a pro? Do you want to find actionable business insights using data science and analytics and explainable artificial intelligence? You have come to the right place.\nI will show you the most impactful Data Mining algorithms using Python that I have witnessed in my professional career to derive meaningful insights and interpret data.\nIn the age of endless spreadsheets, it is easy to feel overwhelmed with so much data. This is where Data Mining techniques come in. To swiftly analyze, find patterns, and deliver an outcome to you. For me, the Data Mining value added is that you stop the number crunching and pivot table creation, leaving time to come with actionable plans based on the insights.\nNow, why should you enroll in the course? Let me give you four reasons.\nThe first is that you will learn the models' intuition without focusing too much on the math. It is crucial that you know why a model makes sense and the underlying assumptions behind it. I will explain to you each model using words, graphs, and metaphors, leaving math and the Greek alphabet to the bare minimum.\nThe second reason is the thorough course structure of the most impactful Data Mining techniques for Data Science and Business Analytics. Based on my experience, the course curriculum has the algorithms I believe to be most impactful, up-to-date, and sought after. Here is the list of the algorithms we will learn:\nSupervised Machine Learning\nSurvival Analysis\nCox Proportional Hazard Regression\nCHAID\nUnsupervised Machine Learning\nCluster Analysis - Gaussian Mixture Model\nDimension Reduction – PCA and Manifold Learning\nAssociation Rule Learning\n· Explainable Artificial Intelligence\nRandom Forest and Feature Seletion and Importance\nLIME\nXGBoost and SHAP\nThe third reason is that we code Python together, line by line. Programming is challenging, especially for beginners. I will guide you through every Python code snippet. I will also explain all parameters and functions that you need to use, step by step. In the end, you will have code templates ready to use in your problems.\nThe final reason is that you practice, practice, practice. At the end of each section, there is a challenge. The goal is that you apply immediately what you have learned. I give you a dataset and a list of actions you need to take to solve it. I think it is the best way to really cement all the techniques in you. Hence, there will be 2 case studies per technique.\nI hope to have spiked your interest, and I am looking forward to seeing you inside!",

I enjoy Jeremy's personality, and I can tell that he really enjoys helping others learn and giving them the tools to help them progress in their careers.\"  -Samantha B.\n\"Excellent...just what I need!\" -Syed\n\n\nWhy should I enroll?\nProject Management is an extremely deep and wide-ranging topic. Many colleges today have four-year degrees strictly focusing on managing projects. This course is designed to take the important aspects of all those classes and align them into one bite-sized course. You will learn how to successfully play both the Business Analyst and Project Manager roles.\nI cut out all of the fluff and unnecessary steps to focus your learning on what is important.\n\n\nWhat bonuses are included?\nYou receive a Stakeholder Map template! This template will allow you to be effective and efficient in creating Stakeholder Maps.\nAlso included is a RACI Matrix template! This template will enable to you accurately assign and document stakeholder responsibilities for your projects.\nOutside of the templates, you also gain access to an industry expert! I am not just the instructor of this course, I am also a resource and a mentor to give you guidance and tips to begin or advance your career.\n\n\n\nStill not convinced?\n\"Really enjoying course. I'm doing this after the BA Fundamentals course and it is piecing a lot of the Project stuff together for me. Very helpful.\" -Bede J.\n\"I am getting to learn more than I expected,interesting!! I got what I was exactly looking for,especially the gaps that I had to fill in. Since I am a person from different country & have migrated to a different country & though certain principles as a PM/BA don't change but some do, & the same made me to take this course to fill in those gaps. I am confident that this is really creating hope & confidence in everyone like me who is aspiring to be a PM/BA.Thanks Jeremy\" -John S.\n\n\nYou have nothing to lose! This course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nDuring many consulting projects, you will have to map business processes. This will help you improve or change the existing processes. There are many ways in which you can do that. Not all of them will be understood by the customer, who will be using the processes in practice. Therefore, I will teach how to map business processes in practice using different methods. You will also learn which method to use in a specific situation.\nIn the course you will learn the following things:\nHow to map processes using different methods (essential concepts)\nHow to decide which way of process mapping is optimal for your customer\nWhat tools to use for process mapping\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excel files as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nDuring many consulting projects, you have to understand, map, and present key processes. After optimizing those processes, you will also have to create manuals presenting new processes. To do that efficiently you have to master the essential techniques used in process mapping. Most firms don’t give you the full toolbox that you need. This may lead to huge frustration during consulting projects and a lot of inefficiencies.\nTherefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students understand or refresh the main skills and tools that they need to map processes efficiently. The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know how to manage processes and what technique is the right one.\nTo sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of process mapping. That is why I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts. The course will help you become an expert in process mapping on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:\nHow to map processes using different methods (essential concepts)\nHow to decide which way of process mapping is optimal for your customer\nWhat tools to use for process mapping\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.\nHow is the course organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little introduction to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized\nHow to Map Business Processes. There are many different ways to map business processes. In this section, we will show you how to use the most popular ones in practice. We will discuss flowcharts, BPMN, descriptive mapping, Gantt Charts, and RACI.\nCase Study in Business Process Mapping. In this section, we will map processes in a firm that is producing educational content and courses. We will use BPMN, RACI, and descriptive methods for process mapping.\nTools for business process mapping. You can use different tools to map processes. In this section, we will discuss the selected one that you can find useful when doing process mapping.\nWhich method to choose? There are plenty of methods to map processes. Not all of them will be a good idea. In this section, we will see how to pick the optimal method for a specific situation.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\n1. Useful frameworks and techniques\n2. Analyses showed in the course\n3. Additional resources\n4. Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies\n5. Links to books worth reading\nWhat will you learn?\nHow to map processes using different methods (essential concepts)\nHow to decide which way of process mapping is optimal for your customer\nWhat tools to use for process mapping\nHow to use and create a RACI map of a process\nEssential symbols and rules used in BPMN\nCreate simple maps of processes in Excel\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nBusiness Analysts\nProject Managers\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic or intermediate Excel\nBasic knowledge of economics\nBasic or intermediate knowledge of finance & accounting",

This is a lengthy document which requires some professionalism in how it's written, the content in it, its formatting, and the ultimate usefulness of the information it contains.\nIt's difficult to get all these elements right at the same time, but now with this course, you will be able to write and accurate and well-researched report in relatively little time, and without worrying whether you are on the right track.\nImagine your boss at work tells you to write an analytical report about some topic. The first reaction may be pure panic. How do you write one? What does the boss want in the report? How long should it be? Does it need graphs and charts? These are just a few of the questions that might run through your mind in the first few seconds.\nThis course will walk you through how to answer each of these questions for your unique situation. It will immediately decrease your panic and stress levels, and you will be able to write a professional report section by section as you are following each video in this course.\nANALYTICAL REPORT AND INFORMATIONAL REPORT\nThis course will show you how to write an analytical report. It's very similar to writing an informational report with just a few extra sections. So even though the example in the course will be an analytical report, you would also be able to write an informational report with the guidance of this course.\nInvest in your future! Enroll today!",

      "description": "PLS-SEM is a composite-based approach to SEM that aims at maximizing the explained variance of dependent constructs in the path model. Researchers and practitioners use PLS-SEM, especially when they conduct studies on success factors and the sources of competitive advantage.\nCompared to other SEM techniques, PLS-SEM allows researchers to estimate very complex models with many constructs and indicator variables. Furthermore, PLS-SEM allows for estimating reflective and formative constructs and generally offers much flexibility in terms of data requirements. The goal of PLS-SEM is the explanation of variances (prediction-oriented character of the methodology) rather than explaining covariances (theory testing via covariance-based SEM, CB-SEM). The application of the PLS-SEM method is of high interest if the assumptions of CB-SEM are violated and the proposed cause-and-effect relationships are not sufficiently explored.\nThe course will include the following aspects:\nWhy is data analysis required?\nBasic concepts related to SEM\nData analysis using SPSS and SmartPLS\nMeasurement model analysis\nStructural model analysis\nMediator/Moderator analysis\nAdvanced issues in SmartPLS\nExplanation in APA style\nReal exercise from Fiverr projects\nGetting started with Fiverr gigs\nTips and tricks and many more\nThe course features include but are not limited to:\nCompetitive edge for pursuing PhD and Master's\nRequired tool for scholarly publication\nHigh acceptance rate by top business journals\nEasy explanation of the statistical analysis\nFocus on both theory and practice\nBecome a global data analyst and freelancer\nExcellent carrier opportunity\nHuge demand in local and global markets\nSoftware package: SmartPLS 4, SPSS 25.0\n\n\nWho should attend?\nResearch scholars, faculty members, university students, and individuals who are engaged in or interested in contemporary statistical techniques\n\n\nPrerequisite: Basic knowledge of multivariate techniques such as factor analysis and multiple regression.\n\n\nThanks and Regards\nShahedul Hasan\nResearch Assistant & Independent Researcher.\nBBA & MBA, University of Dhaka.\nEx-Lecturer, East Delta University.\nData Analysis Instructor, Instructory and Udemy.\nTop Rated Freelancer, Upwork.\nEditorial Review Board Member, Virtual Economics & Transnational Marketing Journal.\nEditor, Global Journal of Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Leadership.\nEditorial Assistant, Journal for the Study of Cooperative and Experiential Education.",

      "description": "I've been using visualization tools such as Tableau for a very long time and before that Excel. When data is clean its so much fun to do visualizations and reporting. However, in reality, data is more often than not very dirty, messy, incomplete or needs to be combined with other data sets.\nTherefore, you need a tool that can help you combine, consolidate and manipulate data in just the way you need it. In addition this, the other problem with standard business processes is the repetitive manual work we need to perform every single day. The routine is always the same. Data comes in, we filter here and there, do some calculations and send it out. Wouldn't it be nice to automate this without needing to know programming languages such as VBA, SQL or Python?\nWell the answer is Alteryx! Alteryx has built in, drag and drop tools designed specifically to make the data cleansing process easier. What would usually take me hours to do in Excel I can do in just minutes in some cases. The beauty is that once I've set it up the first time all I need to do is press RUN! This saves me a lot of time!\n***\nThe other benefit of Alteryx is the ability to perform MACHINE LEARNING analysis. Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence in some circles, is the ability to predict and classify data. For example, when watching Netflix, they collect your viewing habits to find recommendations for movies you may like. Or on Amazon and eBay, your buying habits are analyzed to predict the most likely items you'd want to but in the future. But it doesn't stop here! Machine Learning is a MASSIVE and EXCITING space to get into!\nif you're like, who doesn't have a Computer Science, Programming or Data Science background then this course is for you. No fancy languages or terminology. In this course I'll teach you the basics of Alteryx and ultimately get you started on Machine Learning!",

Please review the prerequisite skills or complete the beginner SQL course before taking this one!\n\n\nIf you want to develop practical, real-world database analytics & business intelligence skills using advanced SQL, you're in the right place.\n\n\nThis course is unlike anything you’ve seen before. Instead of using random sample data and obscure demos, we’ll be working with a rich, custom-built ecommerce database that we’ve designed from scratch to help you apply your SQL skills to real projects and learn how to truly THINK like a data analyst.\n\n\nYou’ll be playing the role of a newly hired Database Analyst for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an eCommerce start-up, and will be working directly with the CEO, Marketing Director and Website Manager to help grow the business and analyze performance along the way. You'll use a range of advanced SQL tools and techniques, and work through actual projects that data analysts and business intelligence professionals work on every day.\n\n\nCOURSE OUTLINE:\n\n\nPrerequisite SQL Skills Assessment\nIn this section we'll address the core SQL/MySQL skills that you should be comfortable with before starting the course, including SELECT statements, aggregate functions, and table joins. If you aren't sure how your skills stack up, we've included a quiz to assess your baseline SQL knowledge.\n\n\nMySQL Setup & Install\nFor students who haven't completed our intro course, we'll demonstrate exactly how to download and install the tools that we'll need to access MySQL, including MySQL Community Server & MySQL Workbench. We'll share download guides for both Mac & PC, and run our first piece of SQL code to generate the project database that we'll analyze throughout the course.\n\n\nTraffic Analysis & Optimization\nIn this section we’ll use MySQL to analyze where our website traffic is coming from, how different sources perform in terms of traffic volume and conversion rates, and how we can adjust bids to optimize our budgets.\n\n\nWebsite Measurement & Testing\nIn this section we'll dive into page-level website data to compare traffic and conversion rates, and use MySQL to build and analyze conversion funnels to help optimize the customer purchase experience.\n\n\n*MID-COURSE PROJECT: Preparing data for the executive board meeting\n\n\nChannel Analysis & Optimization\nIn this section we’ll dig deeper into our traffic channel mix, explore paid vs. free traffic, break down performance by device type, and write advanced SQL queries to conduct some time-series analyses to understand trending and seasonality.\n\n\nProduct-Level Analysis\nIn this section we’ll use MySQL to break down product-level sales and conversion rates, analyze cross-selling patterns, and use refund rates to keep a pulse on quality.\n\n\nUser-Level Analysis\nIn this section we’ll take a closer look at user behavior and repeat sessions, and use MySQL data analysis techniques to identify our most valuable customers and explore which channels they are coming from.\n\n\n*FINAL PROJECT: Building a data-driven growth story for potential investors\n\n\nUnlike other SQL courses, this one is uniquely designed to sharpen your business intelligence and analytical thinking skills; as you complete course projects and exercises, you’ll actually see patterns and trends emerging in the data based on your findings. For those looking to pursue a career in analytics, this course is a must.\n\n\nEnroll today and get LIFETIME access to:\n8+ hours of high-quality video\nDownloadable MySQL ebook\nQuizzes and hands-on projects\nMid-course and Final SQL projects\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This course does NOT cover building, altering, or maintaining SQL/MySQL databases. Our goal here is to focus on data exploration and database analysis using MySQL and MySQL Workbench (we'll cover database administration tools in a separate course).\n\n\nHappy analyzing!\n-John (Lead SQL Instructor & MySQL Expert, Maven Analytics)\n\n\n______________________________\nLooking for the full business intelligence stack? Search for \"Maven Analytics\" to browse our full course library, including Excel, Power BI, MySQL, and Tableau courses!\n\n\nSee why John is one of the TOP-RATED SQL/MySQL Instructors on Udemy:\n\"I totally loved this course! Everything was easy to understand, but it moved at a fast enough pace that I never got bored. I learned SO much about MySQL and had fun doing it. In fact, at the end of the day I didn't want to stop learning -- I wanted to keep charging on to the next lesson!\"\n- Ann S.\n\"This is an excellent advanced course! I've taken both SQL courses from Maven Analytics and highly recommend both. The best part of this course is the detail they included by building a real world e-commerce database. It's much easier to grasp the concepts when you can see how they're literally applied to scenarios and outcomes as opposed to just theory. Great work!\"\n- Dan S.\n\"John's deep understanding of SQL and database analysis and ability to explain those tools is really unmatched. I've taken other SQL and MySQL courses and tried reading books, but this course is by far the most effective. Excited to see more courses from John!\"\n- Steven M.",

An excellent presentation for anyone wanting to become more acquainted with the procedures involved in process mapping.” - Robert\n\n\nThe BA Guide’s TEACH, SHOW, DO technique\nThis course makes use of The BA Guide’s TEACH, SHOW, DO technique – a method I’ve developed over my years of experience in the industry training and managing Business Analysts. This technique will help ensure you with total comprehension of the topic at hand and maximum information retention long after the course is finished.\nTEACH – You first learn the concept, in detail, from the ground up. But I won’t simply teach you the concept in isolation – you’ll learn HOW and WHEN to use it too.\nSHOW – Once you fully understand the concept, we enhance that by walking you step-by-step through real-world examples – so you can see exactly how the concept would pan out if you were to apply it in the real world.\nDO – Firmly cement everything you’ve learned so far and put your new knowledge to the test by completing the included activities and quizzes.

It powers the most commonly used database engines like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and MySQL. Simply put, If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.\n\n\nIt is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it’s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people to get interesting data from the database. It is also an English-like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL queries easily.\n\n\nSQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.\n\n\nYou can earn good money\nHow much time does it take to learn SQL?\nSQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.\nWhat are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?\nStart learning from the basics of SQL. The first 10 sections of the course cover the basics.\nOnce done with the basic try your hands on advanced SQL. Next 10 sections cover Advanced topics\nNext few sections will cover help you with interviews and Vivas.\nPractice your learning on the exercise provided in every section.\nWhat's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?\nSQL is a language. Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"\nPostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.\nAll of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.\nWhich is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?\nBoth are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.\nPostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.\nOpen source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.\nWho uses these databases?\nHere are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.\nWhat's special about this course?\nThe course is created on the basis of three pillars of learning:\nKnow (Study)\nDo (Practice)\nReview (Self feedback)\nKnow\nWe have created a set of concise and comprehensive videos to teach you all the SQL related skills you will need in your professional career.\nDo\nWe also provide Exercises to complement the learning from the lecture video. These exercises are carefully designed to further clarify the concepts and help you with implementing the concepts on practical problems faced on-the-job.\nReview\nCheck if you have learnt the concepts by executing your code and analyzing the result set. Ask questions in the discussion board if you face any difficulty.\nBonus Lectures\nApart from this, their is a bonus section which covers important topics from the view of job interviews and Vivas.\nThe Authors of this course have several years of corporate experience and hence have curated the course material keeping in mind the requirement of SQL in today's corporate world.",

We will start at a very basic overview, and then proceed to more advanced topics related to GIS.\nThrough a series of lectures, I will work side-by-side with you to develop SQL queries that perform advanced GIS tasks, some of which might be impossible to perform in the GUI. Once my students learn GIS, they very rarely want to return back to using the GUI.\nBy writing SQL code alongside me, you will see how solving GIS tasks in SQL is like a second nature. This is a very comprehensive course that should take multiple days to complete - but don't worry about that - you will be having a lot of fun learning how powerful SQL can be, and continually ask yourself \"why didn't I start using SQL sooner!\"",

      "description": "*Update: machine learning forecasting with tidy models is added in the last chapter (Aug 2023)\n\n\n\n\nmade by a supply chainer for supply chainers.  A course designed for the modern supply chain profession.\n\n\n\" 60000 Professionals are using inventorize across R & Python. Know how to use it only in this course\"\n\n\nIt's been seven years since I moved from Excel to R and since then I have never looked back! With eleven years between working in Procurement, lecturing in universities, training over 70000 professionals in supply chain and data science with R and python, and finally opening my own business in consulting for five years now. I am extremely excited to share with you this course and learn with you through this unique rewarding course. My goal is that all of you become experts in data science and supply-chain. I have put all the techniques I have learned and practiced in this one sweet bundle of data science and supply chain.\nAs a consultancy, we develop algorithms for retailers and supply chains to make aggregate and item controllable forecasting, optimize stocks, plan assortment and Maximize profit margin by optimizing prices. 13000 people are already using our free package for supply chain analysis \"Inventorize\" and we can't wait to share its capabilities with you so you can start dissecting supply chain problems...for free!\nThe motivation behind this project is filling the gap of finding a comprehensive course that tackles supply chains using data science. there are courses for data science, forecasting, revenue management, inventory management, and simulation modeling. but here we tackle all of them as a bundle. Lectures, Concepts, codes, exercises, and spreadsheets. and we don't present the code, we do the code with you, step by step.\nthe abundance of data from customers, suppliers, products, and transactions have opened the way for making informed business decisions on a bigger and more dynamic scale that can no longer be achieved by spreadsheets. In this course, we learn data science from a supply chain mindset.\nDon't worry If you don't know how to code, we learn step by step by applying supply chain analysis!\n*NOTE: Full course includes downloadable resources and R project files, homework and course quizzes, lifetime access, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nWho this course is for:\n· If you are an absolute beginner at coding, then take this course.\n· If you work in supply-chain and want to make data-driven decisions, this course will equip you with what you need.\n· If you work as a demand planner and want to make aggregate and item controllable forecasting, take this course.\n· If you are an inventory manager and want to optimize inventory for 1000000 products at once, then this course is for you.\n· If you work in finance and want to forecast your budget by taking trends, seasonality, and other factors into account then this course is just what you need.\n· If you are a seasoned R user, then take this course to get up to speed quickly with R capabilities. You will become a regular R user in no time.\n· If you want to take a deep dive (not just talking) in supply chain management, then take this course.\n· If you want to apply machine learning techniques for supply -chain, we will walk you through the methods of supervised and unsupervised learning.\n· If you are switching from Excel to a data science language. then this course will fast track your goal.\n· If you are tired of doing the same analysis again and again on spreadsheets and want to find ways to automate it, this course is for you.\n· If you are frustrated about the limitations of data loading and available modules in excel, then Moving to R will make our lives a whole lot easier.\n\n\nCourse Design\nthe course is designed as experiential learning Modules, the first couple of modules are for supply chain fundamentals followed by R programming fundamentals, this is to level all of the takers of this course to the same pace. and the third part is supply chain applications using Data science which is using the knowledge of the first two modules to apply. while the course delivery method will be a mix of me explaining the concepts on a whiteboard, Presentations, and R-coding sessions where you do the coding with me step by step. there will be assessments in most of the sections to strengthen your newly acquired skills. all the practice and assessments are real supply chain use cases.\nSupply chain Fundamentals Module includes:\n1- Introduction to supply chain.\n2- Supply chain Flows.\n3- Data produced by supply chains.\nR Programming Fundamentals Module includes:\n1- Basics of R\n2- Data cleaning and Manipulation.\n3- Statistical analysis.\n4- Data Visualization.\n5- Advanced Programming.\nSupply chain Applications Module include :\n1- Product segmentations single and Multi-criteria\n2- Supplier segmentations.\n3- Customers segmentations.\n4- Forecasting techniques and accuracy testing.\n5- Forecasting aggregation approaches.\n6- Pricing and Markdowns optimization Techniques.\n7- Inventory Policy and Safety stock Calculations.\n8- Inventory simulations.\n9- Machine Learning for supply-chain.\n10- Product Recommendations for customers.\n11- Simulations for optimizing Capacity and Resources.\n\n\n*NOTE: Many of the concepts and analysis I explain first in excel as I find excel the best way to first explain a concept and then we scale up, improve and generalize with R. By the end of this course, you will have an exciting set of skills and a toolbox you can always rely on when tackling supply chain challenges. The course may take from 12-16 weeks to finish, 4-5 hours of lectures, and practice every week.\n\n\n*Bonus: one hour webinar of Intro to machine learning where I am the panelist for NOBLE PROG; the host and organizer of the webinar event. the webinar has a demo on how to use orange for data mining.\n\n\n\n\nHappy Supply Chain mining!\nHaytham\nRescale Analytics\n\n\nFeedback from Clients and Training:\n\n\n\"In Q4 2018, I was fortunate to find an opportunity to learn R in Dubai, after hearing about it from indirect references in UK.\n\n\nI attended a Supply Chain Forecasting & Demand Planning Masterclass conducted by Haitham Omar and the possibilities seemed endless. So, we requested Haitham to conduct a 5-day workshop in our office to train 8 staff members, which opened us up as a team to deeper data analysis. Today, we have gone a step further and retained Haitham, as a consultant, to take our data analysis to the next level and to help us implement inventory guidelines for our business. The above progression of our actions is a clear indication of the capabilities of Haitham as a specialist in R and in data analytics, demand planning, and inventory management.\"\n\n\nShailesh Mendonca\nCommercial lead-in Adventure AHQ- Sharaf Group\n\n\n\n\n“ Haytham mentored me in my Role of Head of Supply Chain efficiency. He is extremely knowledgebase about the supply concepts, latest trends, and benchmarks in the supply chain world. Haytham’s analytics-driven approach was very helpful for me to recommend and implement significant changes to our supply chain at Aster group”\nSaify Naqvi\nHead of Supply Chain Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n“I participated to the training session called \"Supply Chain Forecasting & Management\" on December 22nd 2018. This training helped me a lot in my daily work since I am working in Purchase Dpt. Haytham have the pedagogy to explain us very difficult calculations and formula in simple way. I highly recommend this training.”\nDjamel BOUREMIZ\nPurchasing Manager at Mineral Circles Bearings",

      "description": "update : machine learning forecasting is added as the last chapter (Aug 2023)\n\n\nHello :)\n\n\n\n\nForecasting has been around for 1000s of years. it stems from our need to plan so we can have some direction for the future. We can consider forecasting as the stepping stone for planning. and that's why it is as important as ever to have good forecasters in institutions, supply chains,  companies, and businesses.\nWith the ever-growing concerns of sustainability and Carbon-footprint. Would you believe it? a good forecast actually contributes to saving resources through the value chain and actually saving the planet. one forecaster at a time. needless to mention, forecasting is integral in marketing, operations, finance, and planning for supply chains.  Pretty much everything\n\n\nThis course is aimed to orient you to the latest statistical forecasting techniques and trends. but first, we need to understand how forecasting works and the reasoning behind statistical methods, and when each method is suitable to be used.  that's why we start first with excel and we scale with R. \"Don't worry if you don't know R, Crash fundamental sections are included!.\nthe course is for all levels because we start from Zero to Hero in Forecasting.\nin this course we will learn and apply :\n1- Time Series Decomposition in Excel and R.\n2- Univariate analysis for time series in Excel and R.\n3- Bivariate analysis and auto-correlation in Excel and R.\n4- Smoothing the time series and getting the Trend with Double and centered moving average.\n5- seasonally adjusting the time series.\n6- Simple and complex forecasts in Excel.\n7- Use transformations to reduce the variance while forecasting.\n8-Generating and Calibrating Forecasting in Excel.\n9- Learning R and using it as an everyday tool for forecasting.\n10- Using the Fable Package for advanced forecasting methods and aggregations.\n11- Using Forecast package for grid search on ARIMA.\n12- Applying a workflow of different models in two lines of code.\n13- Calibirating forecasting methods.\n14- Applying Hierarchical time series with Bottom-up, middle out, and Top-down Approaches.\n16-  Use the new R-Fable reconciliation method for aggregation.\n15- Using Fable to generate forecasts for 10000  time-series and much more !!\n*NOTE: Many of the concepts and analysis I explain first in excel as I find excel the best way to first explain a concept and then we scale up, improve and generalize with R. By the end of this course, you will have an exciting set of skills and a toolbox you can always rely on when tackling forecasting challenges.\n\n\n\n\nHappy Forecasting!\nHaytham\nRescale Analytics\n\n\nFeedback from Clients and Training:\n\n\n\"In Q4 2018, I was fortunate to find an opportunity to learn R in Dubai, after hearing about it from indirect references in UK.\n\n\nI attended a Supply Chain Forecasting & Demand Planning Masterclass conducted by Haitham Omar and the possibilities seemed endless. So, we requested Haitham to conduct a 5-day workshop in our office to train 8 staff members, which opened us up as a team to deeper data analysis. Today, we have gone a step further and retained Haitham, as a consultant, to take our data analysis to the next level and to help us implement inventory guidelines for our business. The above progression of our actions is a clear indication of the capabilities of Haitham as a specialist in R and in data analytics, demand planning, and inventory management.\"\n\n\nShailesh Mendonca\nCommercial lead-in Adventure AHQ- Sharaf Group\n\n\n\n\n“ Haytham mentored me in my Role of Head of Supply Chain efficiency. He is extremely knowledgebase about the supply concepts, latest trends, and benchmarks in the supply chain world. Haytham’s analytics-driven approach was very helpful for me to recommend and implement significant changes to our supply chain at Aster group”\nSaify Naqvi\nHead of Supply Chain Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n“I participated to the training session called \"Supply Chain Forecasting & Management\" on December 22nd 2018. This training helped me a lot in my daily work since I am working in Purchase Dpt. Haytham has the pedagogy to explain us very difficult calculations and formula in a simple way. I highly recommend this training.”\nDjamel BOUREMIZ\nPurchasing Manager at Mineral Circles Bearings",

In the first part, students are introduced to the theory behind logistic regression. The theory is explained in an intuitive way. The math is kept to a minimum. The course starts with an introduction to contingency tables, in which students learn how to calculate and interpret the odds and the odds ratios. From there, the course moves on to the topic of logistic regression, where students will learn when and how to use this regression technique. Topics such as model building, prediction, and assessment of model fit are covered. In addition, the course also covers diagnostics by covering the topics of residuals and influential observations.\nIn the second part of the course, students learn how to apply what they learned using Stata. In this part, students will walk through a large project in order to understand the type of questions that are raised throughout the process, and which commands to use in order to address these questions.",

      "description": "Python, SQL, and Tableau are three of the most widely used tools in the world of data science.\nPython is the leading programming language;\nSQL is the most widely used means for communication with database systems;\nTableau is the preferred solution for data visualization;\nTo put it simply – SQL helps us store and manipulate the data we are working with, Python allows us to write code and perform calculations, and then Tableau enables beautiful data visualization. A well-thought-out integration stepping on these three pillars could save a business millions of dollars annually in terms of reporting personnel.\nTherefore, it goes without saying that employers are looking for Python, SQL, and Tableau when posting Data Scientist and Business Intelligence Analyst job descriptions. Not only that, but they would want to find a candidate who knows how to use these three tools simultaneously. This is how recurring data analysis tasks can be automated.\nSo, in this course we will to teach you how to integrate Python, SQL, and Tableau. An essential skill that would give you an edge over other candidates. In fact, the best way to differentiate your job resume and get called for interviews is to acquire relevant skills other candidates lack. And because, we have prepared a topic that hasn’t been addressed elsewhere, you will be picking up a skill that truly has the potential to differentiate your profile.\nMany people know how to write some code in Python.\nOthers use SQL and Tableau to a certain extent.\nVery few, however, are able to see the full picture and integrate Python, SQL, and Tableau providing a holistic solution. In the near future, most businesses will automate their reporting and business analysis tasks by implementing the techniques you will see in this course. It would be invaluable for your future career at a corporation or as a consultant, if you end up being the person automating such tasks.\nOur experience in one of the large global companies showed us that a consultant with these skills could charge a four-figure amount per hour. And the company was happy to pay that money because the end-product led to significant efficiencies in the long run.\nThe course starts off by introducing software integration as a concept. We will discuss some important terms such as servers, clients, requests, and responses. Moreover, you will learn about data connectivity, APIs, and endpoints.\nThen, we will continue by introducing   the real-life example exercise the course is centered around – the ‘Absenteeism at Work’ dataset. The preprocessing part that follows will give you a taste of how BI and data science look like in real-life on the job situations. This is extremely important because a significant amount of a data scientist’s work consists in preprocessing, but many learning materials omit that\nThen we would continue by applying some Machine Learning on our data. You will learn how to explore the problem at hand from a machine learning perspective, how to create targets, what kind of statistical preprocessing is necessary for this part of the exercise, how to train a Machine Learning model, and how to test it. A truly comprehensive ML exercise.\nConnecting Python and SQL is not immediate. We have shown how that’s done in an entire section of the course. By the end of that section, you will be able to transfer data from Jupyter to Workbench.\nAnd finally, as promised, Tableau will allow us to visualize the data we have been working with. We will prepare several insightful charts and will interpret the results together.\nAs you can see, this is a truly comprehensive data science exercise. There is no need to think twice. If you take this course now, you will acquire invaluable skills that will help you stand out from the rest of the candidates competing for a job.\nAlso, we are happy to offer a 30-day unconditional no-questions-asked-money-back-in-full guarantee that you will enjoy the course.\nSo, let’s do this! The only regret you will have is that you didn’t find this course sooner!",

      "description": "New to Tableau? or Just looking to fill in knowledge gaps?\nThis course is designed for both needs. Using real open source data you will become technically fluent in using tableau, one of the best data visualization software on the market. This course is the result of over five years of experience in tableau. The course is split into three stages, each designed to give a solid foundation in tableau without leaving the student with knowledge gaps.\nIf you are a complete beginner or have Basic knowledge you should start at stage one.\nIf you have experience in Tableau  you should start at stage two, but review any gaps in stage one you have.\nIf you would like to know exactly what skills you will learn please view the full technical list at the bottom of this description box. Please note this course doesn't cover updates since 2022\n\nWhy a course by Jamie Fry?\nI have 10 years experience with tableau in the workplace. I've watched it grow from simple drag and drop tool into a extremely powerful visualisation software, from a Private company to an IPO. I am not a full time udemy instructor, which i believe is a strength. What i will teach you i use everyday in my workplace, for all different manner of clients across the globe. My technical teaching of this tool comes with real workplace Do's and Don'ts, teaching you will not get from full time instructors that have been out of the workplace for a number of years. I teach tableau in classrooms face to face and via video conferencing, and years of this experience has led to this streamlined course. Please see my Bio for more information on my academic and professional background.\n\n\n\n\nThe three stages of this course:\nStage 1: The Apprentice\n\nThe absolute fundamentals of tableau. Hit the ground running by learning all the basics, and how tableau manipulates your data. Even students with existing knowledge may learn something here.\nStage 2: The Master\nAdvance your data visualisation skills and learn to leverage your data. Students will learn the bulk of tableau here.\nStage 3: The Hero\nPut all your skills learned to the test, and learn even more by completing a fully interactive workbook consisting of three linked dashboards. You will learn advanced dashboard skills here whilst bringing together all your knowledge.\nBonus Lectures:\n\nA number of bonus lectures have been added to enhance your skills once you have completed the course. These include new chart types such as the \"Waterfall\" chart which cannot done by the \"show me\" tab in tableau.\n\n\nA full list of what technical skills you will Learn:\nDashboard Functionality\nActions (Filter, Highlight and URL)\nNavigation between dashboards via actions\nParameters: The Fundamentals\nParameters: Switching between measures\nParameters: As a global filter\nDashboard Design: Make it look good\nDashboard Design: Make it function well\nReview & Publishing\nWhen to use storyboards vs dashboards\n\n\nChart Types\nText Tables\nHeat Maps\nHighlight Tables\nWaterfall Chart (BONUS)\nSymbol Maps\nFilled Maps\nPie Charts\nBar Charts\nStacked Bars\nSide by Side Bars\nDuel Axis Charts\nTree Maps\nScatter Plots\nArea Charts\nBox and Whisker\nHistogram\nBullet\nBubbles\nControl Charts\nWord cloud (BONUS)\n\n\nTableau Essentials\nConnecting to Data\nLevel of Detail (LOD)\nWhat \"Good\" data Looks like\nDashboards and Stories\nHow tableau pivots on your data\nHierarchies\nBins and Distributions\nCalculated Fields\nTable Calculations\nTableau Calculations as functions\nWindow calculations\nData blending and joining\nReference lines & bollinger bands\nForecast\nTrend line\nClustering\nFilters, including the context filter\nGrouping & Sets\nUsing time series charts\nFormatting (colours, fonts etc)\nCustom colours\nCustom shapes\nWMS Mapping\nPackaging workbooks\nNotable features which are NOT covered:\nUsing APIs (web data connectors)\nTableau Server (you should not need to buy courses on this, support is included in Tableaus fee when you buy the server).",

No matter which data you use or which analysis you want to perform, data cleaning will be a part of the process. Therefore it is a wise decision to invest your time to properly learn how to do this.\nNow as you can imagine, there are many things that can go wrong in raw data. Therefore a wide array of tools and functions is required to tackle all these issues. As always in data science, R has a solution ready for any scenario that might arise. Outlier detection, missing data imputation, column splits and unions, character manipulations, class conversions and much more - all of this is available in R.\nAnd on top of that there are several ways in how you can do all of these things. That means you always have an alternative if you prefer that one. No matter if you like simple tools or complex machine learning algorithms to clean your data, R has it.\nNow we do understand that it is overwhelming to identify the right R tools and to use them effectively when you just start out. But that is where we will help you. In this course you will see which R tools are the most efficient ones and how you can use them.\nYou will learn about the tidyverse package system - a collection of packages which works together as a team to produce clean data. This system helps you in the whole data cleaning process starting from data import right until the data query process. It is a very popular toolbox which is absolutely worth it.\nTo filter and query datasets you will use tools like data.table, tibble and dplyr.\nYou will learn how to identify outliers and how to replace missing data. We even use machine learning algorithms to do these things.\nAnd to make sure that you can use and implement these tools in your daily work there is a data cleaning project at the end of the course. In this project you get an assignment which you can solve on your own, based on the material you learned in the course. So you have plenty of opportunity to test, train and refine your data cleaning skills.\nAs always you get the R scripts as text to copy into your RStudio instance. And on course completion you will get a course certificate from Udemy.\nR-Tutorials Team",

      "description": "It is becoming ever more important that companies make data-driven decisions.\nWith big data and data science on the rise, we have more data than we know what to do with.\nOne of the basic languages of data analytics is SQL, which is used for many popular databases including MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and even big data solutions like Hive and Cassandra.\nI’m going to let you in on a little secret. Most high-level marketers and product managers at big tech companies know how to manipulate data to gain important insights. No longer do you have to wait around the entire day for some software engineer to answer your questions - now you can find the answers directly, by yourself, using SQL!\nIn this course, The Complete SQL Bootcamp for Data Science, Analytics, and Marketing, we'll start from the basics - installing SQL onto your Mac, Linux, or Windows machine and explaining what a relational database is. Next, we'll look at basic tasks like creating tables and loading data into those tables. We will look at a wide variety of SQL commands and I will show you how to speed things up using indexes.\nOnce you know all the SQL commands we will start doing advanced examples - answering questions marketers and business people often have, like where are customers dropping off in our sales funnel? And which of our locations has the highest revenue?\nIn the last section, we'll do Advanced SQL queries on Spark, the big data framework that is the successor to MapReduce and also runs on top of Hadoop. I will teach you how to install Spark, create a cluster very quickly on Amazon EC2, and run SQL queries, allowing you to apply everything you learned up until this point in a big data environment.\nDo you want to know how to optimize your sales funnel using SQL, look at the seasonal trends in your industry, and run a SQL query on Hadoop? Then join me now in my new class on SQL! Dominate data analytics, data science, and big data!\n\n\n\n\nTIPS (for getting through the course):\nWatch it at 2x to learn twice as fast!\nTake handwritten notes. This will drastically increase your ability to retain the information.\nAsk lots of questions on the discussion board. The more the better!\nWrite code yourself, don't just sit there and look at my code.",

      "description": "Now updated for Elasticsearch 9! (Almost all lessons are compatible with Elasticsearch 8 as well.)\nElasticsearch and  the Elastic Stack are important tools for managing massive data. You need to know the problems it solves and how it works to design the best systems, and be the most valuable engineer you can be.\nElasticsearch is a powerful tool for analyzing big data sets in a matter of milliseconds! It’s increasingly popular technology for powering search and analytics on big websites, and a valuable skill to have in today's job market. This course covers it all, from installation to operations. Learn how to use Elasticsearch and implement it in your work within the next few days.\nWe've teamed up with Coralogix to co-produce the most comprehensive Elastic Stack course we've seen— with over 100 lectures including 14 hours of video.\nWe'll show you how to set up search indices on an Elasticsearch 9 cluster, and query that data in many different ways. Fuzzy searches, partial matches, search-as-you-type, pagination, sorting - you name it. And it's not just theory, every lesson has hands-on examples where you'll practice each skill using a virtual machine running Elasticsearch on your own PC.\nYou'll learn how to use Elasticsearch as a vector database or vector store, an important component of modern generative AI applications.\nWe cover, in depth, the often-overlooked problem of importing data into an Elasticsearch index. Whether it's via raw RESTful queries, scripts using Elasticsearch API's, or integration with other \"big data\" systems like Spark and Kafka - you'll see many ways to get Elasticsearch started from large, existing data sets at scale. We'll also stream data into Elasticsearch using Logstash and Filebeat - commonly referred to as the \"ELK Stack\" (Elasticsearch / Logstash / Kibana) or the \"Elastic Stack\".\nElasticsearch isn't just for search anymore - it has powerful aggregation capabilities for structured data, which allows you to glean new insights from your indexed data. We'll bucket and analyze data using Elasticsearch, and visualize it using the Elastic Stack's web UI, Kibana and Kibana Lens.\nYou'll learn how to manage operations on your Elastic Stack, monitoring your cluster's health, and how to perform operational tasks like scaling up your cluster, and doing rolling restarts. We'll also spin up Elasticsearch clusters in the cloud using Amazon Opensearch Service and the Elastic Cloud.\nElasticsearch is positioning itself to be a much faster alternative to Hadoop, Spark, and Flink for many common data analysis requirements.  It's an important tool to understand, and it's easy to use! Dive in with me and I'll show you what it's all about.",

We learn how to do univariate analysis and bivariate analysis then we cover topics like outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation, and correlation.\nPart 4 - Linear regression model for predicting metrics\nThis section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.\nWe have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.\nI am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge on Data Analysis, and the skillsets of a Data Analyst to immediately see practical benefits in your workplace.\nGo ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1 of this Data Analyst Skillpath course!\nCheers\nStart-Tech Academy",

      "description": "Instructor Symon He hosts near daily LIVE office hours on TikTok 10:30PM PDT. Find him @SymonHe.\n\n\nIbadullah Khalil - 5 Stars\n“A great instructor and guide for the course. All topics were well driven and to the point with no gibberish language used to make it difficult for the learners just like other instructors. A highly recommended course for every beginner who aims to become a data analyst”\nJianyong Chen - 5 Stars\n“This is one of the best course I took on Udemy so far. The instructors explained everything in detail and there are practices after each section. Make sure you download all the files, practice on your own, and you will learn a lot. Highly recommend!”\nEvery business generates data.  But whether you're able to turn that into useful insights depends on your ability to process, manipulate, and ultimately translate that data.\nWhether you're working for a company or running your own, being able to make better decisions requires you to be able to analyze and interpret data.\nWhat data do you need? How do you prep that data? How do you analyze it to answer specific questions?\nIn this course, we're going to show you step-by-step, exactly how to do that, by starting with the very basics.\nWhy Microsoft Excel?\nThis course is as much about Excel, if not more, than data analysis concepts and techniques. Why?\nExcel is still the most popular tool used by analysts in all industries, across all roles.  It's used by financial analysts, marketing analysts, sales analysts, and of course, data analysts.\n\n\nYes, there are many tools out there but if you learn and master the core concepts and techniques of data analysis in Excel, you'll be able to apply your knowledge to a broad range of applications.\nDon’t underestimate Excel--a single worksheet can technically hold more than 17 BILLION data points (granted, it will make your computer REALLY slow). Fortunately, most of us running analysis will need to process far fewer data points than that. Still, it speaks to the power of the program.\nMaurizio Zippo - 5 Stars\n“This is one of the best course I have ever taken and thoroughly enjoyed. Highly recommended if you want to brush up your existing Excel Skills and to learn how to build some complicated formulae. The Pivot Table and Charts were something I always struggled with but thanks to Symon and Travis' explanations they are now so easy to use every day at work, saving me tonnes of time! Many Thanks Symon and Travis for putting together this great course you are my Excel heroes! The case studies on Cryptocurrency and The Start Up Market are absolute gems! I can't wait to get started with your next course.”\nWhy learn from us?\nBy signing up with us, you will be learning from two instructors with a combined 35 years of relevant experience across a wide range of analyst roles.\nTravis has been a digital marketer, investor, and entrepreneur for 20 years. He’s led growth in Asia for Groupon and even helped build Excel when he was as an engineer at Microsoft.  He is a data analysis and data visualization expert who pulls from his industry experience to teach some of the advanced data analysis topics you’ll find in this course.\nSymon has been interpreting and analyzing data for 15 years.  He has served as a financial analyst, marketing analyst, and even head of marketing analytics across half a dozen industries.  If you look at his other courses on Udemy, you'll see that he is an Excel and analysis ninja, having taught nearly 180,000 students with over 18,000 reviews.\nTogether, we’ve pulled directly from our personal experience and put everything we could into this course. In fact, all of the case studies you’ll find inside are inspired by real-world projects we’ve worked on.\nWhat if I don't have any data analysis or Excel background?\nNo worries! This is why we start with the very basics in our foundational sections, which is designed to get you familiar with Excel before we move on to more advanced topics.  You can be a complete beginner and take this course.  It might sometimes feel like you're drinking out of a fire hose, but if you put in the time and effort we promise you’ll see results by following our course and doing the exercises.\nWe then progressively increase the difficulty as you move along in the course, culminating in advanced techniques taught through our case studies.\nIf you do have an Excel background, you can skip or skim through the foundational sections and move directly into the more advanced topics.\nStephen Dias - 5 Stars\n“If you're trying to learn the foundations of excel this course is all you need.”\nBrandon Parker - 5 Stars\n“I have a lot of experience building excel models and purchased the course for the case studies. I didn't expect to learn much from the introductory parts but was surprised to find additional keyboard shortcuts I had never learned as well as powerful new functions that will make my life a lot easier. This course helped me brush up on functionality that I often neglected while using excel and was super comprehensive. I look forward to continuing using this course as additional case studies are added and highly recommend it for even excel experts.”\nLearn through practice.\nLike most things in life, becoming proficient at data analysis in Excel takes practice.  A lot of practice.\nSure, you'll pick up plenty just from watching, but you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't download our more than 100 custom-built Excel practice files specifically designed to help you master the program.\nWe're not done adding all our content yet, either.  This class was initially created an \"intro\" course, but it will soon become a complete coverage of all things data analysis in Excel.\nIn conclusion, does any of the following apply to you?\n1.     Do you want to really know your way around Excel?\n2.     You have data for your work or business but you're not sure what to make of it?\n3.     You might know your way around Excel but you're not confident about turning data into business insights\n4.     You frequently receive Excel spreadsheets from others but want to better understand how they arrived at their conclusions?\n5.     You want to learn the best practices when it comes to using Excel for data analysis.\n6.     You are intimidated by spreadsheets and terms like Pivot Tables and VLookups\n7.     You want to learn a skill set that is useful for any role in any industry you get into later.\n\nIf so, then take charge and take our course.\nYou have absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a solid-as-an-oak-tree 30-day money back guarantee.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\n\nSo if you're ready to go from data deficient to data proficient, enroll now!",

      "description": "Data is a requirement these days to run effective marketing campaigns. Application of Big Data starts with understanding the fundamentals of data and SQL.\nIf you are already familiar with SQL then you can skip this course. This course teaches you all the SQL you need as a Digital Marketing Analyst or  a Web Analyst.  This course won't go into advanced level SQL concepts as that is not required to your job as as a Digital Marketing Analyst/Web Analyst. I strongly believe in short and simple courses that can get you ready in few hours as opposed to days.\nHowever, if you ever get stuck or need something that I don't cover in this course then feel free to reach out to me.\nMarketers and Marketing Analysts generally depend on the tools or IT department to help them pull the data for marketing purposes. IT leaves you hanging because they have other priorities as a results Marketing Analysts have to know how write SQL on their own so that they are not dependent on IT. This course is for those marketers who would like to know how to use SQL to conduct their marketing analysis.\nIf you are trying for a job as a Marketing Analysts then this course is a must for you. This will help your resume shine and put you ahead of other similar candidates. The more you can handle technology and data these days the better it differentiates you from the rest of the pack.\nThe course uses MYSQL to show how SQL works but all the leanings and syntax are applicable to other databases such Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle as well.\nThis course is a must have for Web Analytics, Digital Analytics and Marketing Analytics.  This course will put you way ahead of other folks doing or seeking similar jobs. I have used the same course to train members of my team so you can be assured that this is tried and tested curriculum.\nWhy you should learn from me?\nI have been in Digital Marketing and Analytics for over 15 years. I have trained people from diverse backgrounds and have converted them into high performing Digital Marketers and Analysts.  I understand both the technology and marketing side of business.  I have dealt with many analytics technologies way before Google Tag manager existed and know the inner working of Digital Analytics.\nI have extensively worked with companies like Microsoft, Starbucks, Wall Street Journal, ESPN, T-Mobile to name few and helped them Data Driven Marketing Decisions.\nIn addition, I have developed various course and taught students from all over the world. I am online instructor for University of British Columbia (Canada), University of Washington (USA), Bellevue College (USA) and Digital Analytics Association.\nI have an engineering degrees and an MBA.",

      "description": "Ever wondered how AI technologies like OpenAI ChatGPT, GPT-4, DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion really work? In this course, you will learn the foundations of these groundbreaking applications.\nWelcome! This is Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Data Science Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python.\nOne question or concern I get a lot is that people want to learn deep learning and data science, so they take these courses, but they get left behind because they don’t know enough about the Numpy stack in order to turn those concepts into code.\nEven if I write the code in full, if you don’t know Numpy, then it’s still very hard to read.\nThis course is designed to remove that obstacle - to show you how to do things in the Numpy stack that are frequently needed in deep learning and data science.\nSo what are those things?\nNumpy. This forms the basis for everything else.  The central object in Numpy is the Numpy array, on which you can do various operations.\nThe key is that a Numpy array isn’t just a regular array you’d see in a language like Java or C++, but instead is like a mathematical object like a vector or a matrix.\nThat means you can do vector and matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\nThe most important aspect of Numpy arrays is that they are optimized for speed. So we’re going to do a demo where I prove to you that using a Numpy vectorized operation is faster than using a Python list.\nThen we’ll look at some more complicated matrix operations, like products, inverses, determinants, and solving linear systems.\nPandas. Pandas is great because it does a lot of things under the hood, which makes your life easier because you then don’t need to code those things manually.\nPandas makes working with datasets a lot like R, if you’re familiar with R.\nThe central object in R and Pandas is the DataFrame.\nWe’ll look at how much easier it is to load a dataset using Pandas vs. trying to do it manually.\nThen we’ll look at some dataframe operations useful in machine learning, like filtering by column, filtering by row, and the apply function.\nPandas dataframes will remind you of SQL tables, so if you have an SQL background and you like working with tables then Pandas will be a great next thing to learn about.\nSince Pandas teaches us how to load data, the next step will be looking at the data. For that we will use Matplotlib.\nIn this section we’ll go over some common plots, namely the line chart, scatter plot, and histogram.\nWe’ll also look at how to show images using Matplotlib.\n99% of the time, you’ll be using some form of the above plots.\nScipy.\nI like to think of Scipy as an addon library to Numpy.\nWhereas Numpy provides basic building blocks, like vectors, matrices, and operations on them, Scipy uses those general building blocks to do specific things.\nFor example, Scipy can do many common statistics calculations, including getting the PDF value, the CDF value, sampling from a distribution, and statistical testing.\nIt has signal processing tools so it can do things like convolution and the Fourier transform.\nIn sum:\nIf you’ve taken a deep learning or machine learning course, and you understand the theory, and you can see the code, but you can’t make the connection between how to turn those algorithms into actual running code, this course is for you.\n\n\n\"If you can't implement it, you don't understand it\"\nOr as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: \"What I cannot create, I do not understand\".\nMy courses are the ONLY courses where you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch\nOther courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?\nAfter doing the same thing with 10 datasets, you realize you didn't learn 10 things. You learned 1 thing, and just repeated the same 3 lines of code 10 times...\n\n\nSuggested Prerequisites:\nmatrix arithmetic\nprobability\nPython coding: if/else, loops, lists, dicts, sets\nyou should already know \"why\" things like a dot product, matrix inversion, and Gaussian probability distributions are useful and what they can be used for\n\n\nWHAT ORDER SHOULD I TAKE YOUR COURSES IN?:\nCheck out the lecture \"Machine Learning and AI Prerequisite Roadmap\" (available in the FAQ of any of my courses)",

Everything is here, in this course, explained visually, step by step.\nSo, what will you learn in this course?\nFirst of all, you will learn how to manipulate data in R, to prepare it for the analysis: how to filter your data frame, how to recode variables and compute new variables.\nAfterwards, we will take care about computing the main statistical figures in R: mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis etc., both in the whole population and in subgroups of the population.\nThen you will learn how to visualize data using tables and charts. So we will build tables and cross-tables, as well as histograms, cumulative frequency charts, column and mean plot charts, scatterplot charts and boxplot charts.\nSince assumption checking is a very important part of any statistical analysis, we could not elude this topic. So we’ll learn how to check for normality and for the presence of outliers.\nFinally, we will perform some basic, one-sample statistical tests and interpret the results. I’m talking about the one-sample t test, the binomial test and the chi-square test for goodness-of-fit.\nSo after graduating this course, you will know how to perform the essential statistical procedures in the R program.

After all, marketing is what helps you attract new customers and grow your business. But what you may not realize is that marketing automation is essential to successful marketing.\n\n\nMarketing automation is a tool that helps businesses automate their marketing tasks. It can help with things like email marketing, social media campaigns, and targeted ads. By automating these tasks, businesses can save time and money while still getting the results they need from their marketing efforts.\n\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of marketing automation is that it allows businesses to nurture leads. Lead nurturing is the process of building relationships with potential customers. By automating this process, businesses can save time and money while still developing valuable relationships with their leads.\n\n\nAnother benefit of marketing automation is that it can help businesses segment their customers. Segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into smaller groups. This can be done based on things like demographics, interests, or even purchase history. By segmenting their customers, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns that are more likely to convert.\n\n\nLast but not least, marketing automation can help businesses track their results. By tracking their results, businesses can see what's working and what's not. This information is essential for making necessary adjustments to future marketing campaigns.\n\n\nAs you can see, marketing automation is a powerful tool that can help businesses save time and money while still getting the results they need. If you're not using marketing automation, now is the time to start. Your business will thank you for it.\n\n\n\n\nMy goal is to help you automate your business and marketing, so you have more time to focus on what's really important in your business.\n\n\nGet ready to have plenty of free time while your business grows exponentially.\n\n\nENROLL now and see you in the course!",

      "description": "Note: The course is COMPLETE now.\nThis course, extended over seven sections, provides a comprehensive introduction to Stata and Statistics. The aim of the course is to teach all the variables, and the relevant Stata commands, used in Statistics. These variables are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio variables.\nThere are two alternative ways to undertake the course.\n1. If you have a basic understanding of Stata, you can directly start from section 3, which teaches Data Management. You should then proceed to section 4 on Descriptive Statistics, which is common to all types of research. Section 5 analyses a relationship and interprets it between Nominal/Ordinal variables. Examples of these types of variables are gender, race, employment status, ethnicity, levels of satisfaction, customer service quality, hair color, and religion among others. Section 6 investigates a relationship and interprets it between the Nominal/Ordinal variable and the Interval/Ratio variable. Section 7 finds an effect of one Interval/Ratio variable on another Interval/Ratio variable. Examples of these types of variables are age, income, prices, exam scores, temperature, distance, and area among others.   Note: If you adopt this strategy, you may need to go back to the second section, if you have any trouble understanding a particular Stata command in sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The advantage of this strategy is you will study the more important content first.\n2. Alternatively, you can follow the exact order of the course, starting from section 1 and then proceeding to the next section until you reach the section 7.  If you follow this strategy, make sure you do not give up in the middle of the course. The research shows that, and this course is not an exception, some students do not complete the entire course. In this course, the first 3 sections are meant to prepare you for the next 4 sections. Therefore, quitting in the first half of the course will deprive you of the intended benefits.\nWhichever alternative you choose, you must download the resources and practice with me during the lectures. In addition, you must attempt all exercises given at the end of each section.\nCaptions: Each video/lecture is accompanied by accurate captions to enhance your comprehension of the course contents.\nResources: You will be provided with a separate data set for each section to practice with me during the lectures. You will also be given a separate data set to attempt the exercises at the end of each section. You will obtain five do-files, one on data management, and the remaining four on data analysis. The only prerequisites for the course are to install Stata on your computer and remain committed.\nGood Luck!",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nThis course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in business analysis through a series of practical cases. It is designed for people who want to become business analysts or do a lot of business analyses at their work.\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated in a total of 2 billion of additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nThe companies I have worked with so far as a Board Member (I am usually, the Chief Restructuring Officer, VP responsible for Strategy and Development) still have huge problems with properly analyzing intermediate and advanced issues – they are usually preoccupied with current activities, and have close to no time for business analysis and strategic decision. Moreover, they do not know how to approach any subject from an analytical point of view to make sure that they are making the right decision. Therefore, quite often they hire consultants who in turn lack the practical knowledge and experience. This course is my small contribution to improving both consulting as well as operational and strategic analyses in FMC, SMCG, and B2B companies including also online models like e-commerce, SaaS, and marketplaces.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you do the business analyses as well as the quality of the conclusions coming out of available in your company data. Every business analysis is well described and presented in the form of Excel, attached to the lecture. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course, you will know:\nHow to analyze different aspects of sales, marketing, and operations?\nHow to draw conclusions from those analyses – both for current operations as well as strategic ones?\nHow to be efficient in your work as an analyst?\nHow to build Excels and PowerPoints so that it is understandable for you and your team, even after some time?\nChose the right business analysis to identify problems and opportunities\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on the role of business analyst – what skills, education, and knowledge is required from you and what are the available career paths for you\nTools. In the second section, we briefly go through the main tools and concepts for business analysts. We devote some time to the most popular ones: Excel and PowerPoint\nBusiness modeling - example of analyses. On some occasions, you analyze the whole business to see what is the logic behind it. Here we show how to prepare the model in Excel for some of the business models\nSales & Marketing. Analyzing the market, sales activities, efficiency, and the potential for expansion are some of the most typical tasks set for business analysts. Here I provide you with plenty of practical real-life examples of problems and solutions. Every business analysis also shows you the potential for increased sales or margin.\nOperations. Quite often business performance depends on Operational Excellence. In this section, we will show you examples of analysis from logistics, production, production planning, and other supply chain issues. Every business analysis here will show you possible savings or opportunities to increase capacity.\nManagement Consulting Presentations. In this section, I will show you the essential things you need to create a consulting presentation during management consulting projects.\nCases for training analytical skills. In the last 4 sections, we will show you a lot of short analytical case studies that will help you improve your analytical skills.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nExcels with analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nEvery business analysis is well described, available as a downloadable Excel file, and can be easily modified to meet your needs",

      "description": "Master One of the Most In-demand Skills for Data Analysts in 2025!\nThis guided bootcamp will take absolute beginners through the basics of SQL to an ability to write queries with confidence. Nowadays, with so many companies relying on big data analytics for decision-making, analysts with good SQL skills are some of the most sought after by employers. Whether you're in marketing, operations or finance, this course will help you gain lots of practice and confidence in your SQL skills.\nThe Practical SQL Bootcamp for Data Analysts and Data Scientists course is a step-by-step guide to learning the fundamental SQL commands commonly used by analysts and future data scientists in their day-to-day tasks. The course walks you through each SQL command, provides examples for applying such command in typical query that analysts use in their day-to-day job and then allows you to apply or test what you've learned through exercises and challenges.\nBonuses available:\nSUPER BONUS 1: SQL Oral Interview Test Prep Questions\nSUPER BONUS 2: SQL Technical Written Interview Prep Questions\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nAbsolute beginners in SQL can take this course\nYou'll go from not knowing anything about SQL to being someone ready for SQL technical interview and confident with their SQL skills.

You'll learn the essential commands used by actual business analysts, data analysts or data scientists in their day-to-day jobs.  You will be doing a lot of data manipulation and analysis!\nThose who want to learn PostgreSQL!\nPostgreSQL is arguably the most advanced and powerful open-source enterprise class relational database system. It's also free! A lot of companies use PostgreSQL. The commands that you will learn in this course do apply to other relational databases as well such as MySQL.\n\n\n\n\nWhat this course is NOT?\nThe course is not going to teach you how to create a database or how to manage database. If you find yourself in tutorials talking about things like: CREATE DATABASE, DROP DATABASE, INSERTING DATA, etc., you've gone down the wrong rabbit hole! These tasks are usually done by engineers and database administrators - not analysts or data scientists.  Pick tutorials that are geared towards DATA ANALYSIS.\n\n\nOk, you'll learn how to code using SQL and at the same time learn how to think critically when analyzing data!\nBy the end of the course, you'll learn how to:\nRetrieve data from specific tables\nFilter rows or get the desired observations for your analysis\nAdvanced filter functions that include pattern matching\nLimit the output to a number of rows rather than show the full dataset\nOrder or sort the output based on desired columns\nBe able to join multiple tables together to get the needed attributes\nConduct arithmetic operations\nRename your attributes\nSummarize data by performing data aggregations\nPerforming data aggregations and arithmetic operations by subgroups\nHow to structure data for analysis\nLearn how to use subquery to make your coding and querying a lot more efficient\nBe able to use if/then statements\nData cleaning such as extracting a subset of string from the left, right or middle\nConcatenating columns\nNew Bonus! SQL Interview Questions\n*Please refer to the class curriculum below for the particular SQL commands covered.\n\n\nLEARN TO CODE BY DOING\nStart coding like analysts do with hands on exercises and challenges that use real-world database. The examples are meant to help you understand the concept in a practical way; the exercises are meant to help you apply what you've learned; and the challenges are meant to further test your knowledge and perfect your new skills.\nGET PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK FROM THE INSTRUCTOR\nThe instructor aims to assist each student in their learning. The instructor gives her personalized feedback to the student's weekly challenge (upon submission). Solutions are also available for students to review.\nGET ASSISTANCE FROM THE INSTRUCTOR AS NEEDED\nNo need to feel stuck on any concept or challenge! You can easily send a message to the instructor or send an email if you need help. Our students are on our priority list!\nJOIN THE COMMUNITY OF LEARNERS\nJoin the community of students and learn SQL together, and maybe meet new friends along the way.\nGET A COURSE CERTIFICATE\nStudents who pass all the challenges will get a course certificate! You may also get LinkedIn recommendation (upon request)\n\n\nHoping to embark on a data analyst or data scientist career? Learn SQL -- one of the most in-demand data analytic skills today.\nAs a previous Professor and now a Statistics/Analytics content manager for an education tech company, I use a teaching method that makes it super easy for students to learn. I teach SQL in a practical way so I explain concepts with examples, then you have an opportunity to apply what you've learned through exercises and further test your knowledge with weekly challenges.\n\n\nWHAT SOME OF MY STUDENTS SAY ABOUT THE COURSE:\n\"It was a great course and very easy to follow especially for someone who had no experience in SQL. The examples given were simple and Dr. Cas breaks it down really well so you can understand better. She walks you through all the different queries thoroughly and also writes down some helpful hints if you get stuck. She was also very attentive when I got stuck on one of the challenges and reached out to her one late night. She helped me understand it better by giving me more guidance and helped me think outside the box.\nOverall, this was a great course to take and now I have another skill under my belt all thanks to Dr. Cas! Thanks for everything!\"\n- Karla Flores, Senior Financial Analyst, Adobe (California, USA)\n\n\n\"Excellent course and terrific inputs about every query. Majority of the job interviews that I appeared before this course had questions on SQL and I used to mess it up since I didn't have my basics strong.This course not just helped me with the basics but also with the advanced concepts. It's absolutely brilliant. I just feel completely charged up to attend any DS interview where SQL is a skill set that is asked. My motivation was not to give any chance to the interviewer/recruiter is to not provide any more opportunities to them to reject me and this helped me at least get to that stage. Rest of the outcome depends on the practice that I do. Only need some practice on the Data Cleaning section else I think I am prepared from an interview standpoint. Thanks for all the inputs and support Ava.\" - R Suraj Kumar\n\n\n\"This was my first time taking an online data analysis class outside an academic setting. I worried about how the design would work for me as a working professional and if it would enable me grasp the material, but I must say that everything about the online course was smooth, convenient, and enjoyable.\nThe concise tutorial videos, quizzes with solutions and availability of the instructor, made it easy for me to understand the topics. The method, order, and scheduling were accommodating and in my opinion, makes it convenient for anyone, anywhere to take the course, and of course, the content was very useful to me.\nI'm glad I took this course and I will strongly recommend it and others to follow, to anyone trying to develop more skills for data analysis. \"\n- Clare Ofodile, Project Manager, Quality Assurance and Research Development Agency Nigeria (Lagos, Nigeria)\n\n\n\"I like this course as it is very easy to understand and relevant for a beginner like me. I wish I could have some more courses like this one. I really enjoyed it and I started to like SQL more. A big thank you to my teacher!\" - Ana Rotari\n\nThis instructor is highly effective and efficient in getting the critical knowledge across. Unlike other courses, this one did not drag. Time was well managed with the instructor's teaching approach.

      "description": "The practice of Business Analysis revolves around the formation, transformation and finalisation of requirements to recommend suitable solutions to support enterprise change programmes. Practitioners working in the field of business analysis apply a wide range of modelling tools to capture the various perspectives of the enterprise, for example, business process perspective, data flow perspective, functional perspective, static structure perspective, and more. These tools aid in decision support and are especially useful in the effort towards the transformation of a business into the \"intelligent enterprise\", in other words, one which is to some extent \"self-describing\" and able to adapt to organisational change.\nHowever, a fundamental piece remains missing from the puzzle. Achieving this capability requires us to think beyond the idea of simply using the current mainstream modelling tools. Instead, we need to take into account methods that provide a basis for sharing meaning at both human and computational level, and that are geared to capturing the semantics (i.e. the meaning) of entities that describe our enterprise perspectives. This is where the concept of ontologies come in. Ontologies are representations that provide a basis for sharing meaning at human and computational level, and are an invaluable addition to any business analyst's toolkit.\nOntologies help you formally represent domain knowledge that is accurate and reusable, which aligns very well with your reuse strategy for enterprise knowledge. Ontologies are platform-agnostic knowledge models and building them does not require you to have any extensive technical or software engineering skills. This means that as business analyst, you are able to produce the blueprints for any system or software design project, allowing you to more rapidly prototype information structures and test them out before passing your specifications over to software engineers to implement. Consequently, ontology modelling empowers business analysts as information and knowledge architects.\nIn addition, ontologies are extremely relevant to the area of information systems interoperability, providing you with the mechanisms to drive semantic data exchange and federation across multiple information sources and repositories. They can also be extended into structured knowledge bases for constantly-evolving linked data that have complex relationships and are held in dynamic schemas, thereby responding very well to changes in organisational knowledge. The thing is - that's just a glimpse of some of the useful benefits of ontologies from a business analysis standpoint - ontologies, in practice, do much more than that!\nThis course is intended to be a game changer, focusing on providing a comprehensive introduction to ontologies in the context of business analysis application, in order to encourage the adoption of the approach. The material provided in the course covers relevant background information to get comfortable with the concepts being explained, the justifications for applying ontologies in business analysis practice, walkthrough examples, and other important details that are pertinent for you to be able to hit the ground running with using ontologies within your own business analysis pipeline. Become a pioneer of applied ontology in the field of business analysis and lead the way to telling your success story!",

      "description": "Business analytics and AI are two of the hottest topics in the fashion industry.\nNot only that: the global brands that rely on intelligent data collection and processing have a strong competitive advantage over the ones that are data blind.\nAnd this shouldn’t come as a surprise, right?\nWe live in the 2020s.\nToday, in almost all industries, the most successful businesses leverage user data to extract meaningful insights and tailor their products to satisfy user wants and needs.\nNetflix recommends to us the movies and TV series we want to see next.\nInstagram knows which photos we want in our feed.\nSo… naturally … fashion brands would want to know which clothes we want to wear, what impact the discounts have on us, and how likely it is that we’ll return after our first purchase.\nTop executives understand long-term gains in the fashion industry aren’t about one-off transactions. Instead, successful brands want to win us over for the long run. The best way to do that is by employing a strategy centered around hyper-personalization. This means leveraging analytics, data science, and AI to deliver a first-rate experience that will make us a repeated customer.\nPretending that current fashion trends are the same as they were a decade ago is as detrimental as operating without leveraging insights from data. The best brands will surpass you because they will:\nPrice items correctly\nKnow when to discount an item\nRecommend the right items\nExcel at engaging customers online\nStock the right styles\nBe able to choose the right colors, fabrics, and sizes\nSupply stores on time and efficiently\nThe goal of this course is to help you learn about analytics in the fashion industry. We want to help you understand the ways in which different types of analysis can be applied in the fashion world and why that would be helpful in practice.\nTo provide invaluable insights that correspond to the best practices in the industry, we partnered with an experienced executive who’s worked with some of the biggest brands in the industry. His current work contract doesn’t allow us to share more info. However, his working title as Director of Data and Analytics for one of the biggest companies in the industry speaks volumes of his expertise of the topics we’ll cover together.\nThis course is an invaluable opportunity for anyone who works in fashion or who wants to work in fashion and become a high-level executive. Moreover, the course can also be useful to data practitioners who would like to specialize/get hired in the fashion industry. Some of the interesting topics we will cover are:\nProduct recommendations\nConsumer-driven marketing\nDigital & web analytics\nIntegrated demand forecasting\nSupply chain analytics for fashion companies\nStore localization, clustering, and in-store optimization\nPricing optimization, and\nAI for uncovering fashion trends\n\n\nThis course offers tremendous upside for the time you will dedicate to it. Not only can it be career-changing if you work in fashion, but it can also inspire you to transform your business if you’re a fashion entrepreneur who wants to succeed in the years to come.",

      "description": "Welcome to Mastering Data Visualization! In this course, you're going to learn about the Theory and Foundations of Data Visualization so that you can create amazing charts that are informative, true to the data, and communicatively effective.\nHave you noticed there are more and more charts generated every day? If you turn on the TV, there's a bar chart telling you the evolution of COVID, if you go on Twitter, boom! a lot of line charts displaying the evolution of the price of gas. In newspapers, lots and lots of infographics telling you about the most recent discovery... The reason for that is that now we have lots of data, and the most natural way to communicate data is in visual form: that is, through Data Visualization. But, have you noticed all of the mistakes in those visualizations? I have to tell you, many of the charts that I see regularly have one problem or another. Maybe their color choices are confusing, they chose the wrong type of chart, or they are displaying data in a distorted way.\nActually, that happens because more and more professional roles now require to present data visually, but there's few training on how to do it correctly. This course aims to solve this gap. If there's one thing I can promise you is that, after completing this course, you'll be looking at charts at a completely different way. You will be able to distinguish good and bad visualizations, and, more importantly, you will be able to tell when a graph is lying and how to correct it.\nIf you need to analyze, present or communicate data professionally at some point, this course is a must. Actually, even if you don't need to actually draw plots for a living, this course is hugely useful. After all, we are all consumers of data visualizations, and we need to identify when charts are lying to us. (As an example, my mother attended one of my classes and now she's spotting mistakes in a lot of the media she sees everyday!)\nI really encourage you to deepen your knowledge on Data Visualization. It's not a difficult topic, and we will start from the basics. You don't need any previous knowledge. I'll teach you everything you need to know along the way and we'll go straight to the point. No rambling. I really hope to see you in class!",

      "description": "Hi! Welcome to Credit Risk Modeling in Python. This is the only online course that teaches you how banks use data science modeling in Python to improve their performance and comply with regulatory requirements. This is the perfect course for you, if you are interested in a data science career. Here’s why:\n· The instructor is a proven expert, holding a PhD from the Norwegian Business school and having taught in world renowned universities such as HEC, the University of Texas, and the Norwegian Business school).\n· The course is suitable for beginners. We start with theory and initial data pre-processing and gradually solve a complete exercise in front of you\n· Everything we cover is up-to-date and relevant in today’s development of Python models for the banking industry\n· This is the only online course that provides a complete picture of credit risk in Python (using state of the art techniques to model all three aspects of the expected loss equation - PD, LGD, and EAD) including creating a scorecard from scratch\n· Here we show you how to create models that are compliant with Basel II and Basel III regulations that other courses rarely touch upon\n· We are not going to work with fake data. The dataset used in this course is an actual real-world example\n· You get to differentiate your data science portfolio by showing skills that are highly demanded in the job marketplace\n· What is most important – you get to see first-hand how a data science task is solved in the real-world\n\n\nMost data science courses cover several frameworks but skip the pre-processing and theoretical part. This is like learning how to taste wine before being able to open a bottle of wine.\nWe don’t do that. Our goal is to help you build a solid foundation. We want you to study the theory, learn how to pre-process data that does not necessarily come in the ‘’friendliest’’ format, and of course, only then we will show you how to build a state of the art model and how to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n\nThroughout the course, we will cover several important data science techniques.\n- Weight of evidence\n- Information value\n- Fine classing\n- Coarse classing\n- Linear regression\n- Logistic regression\n- Area Under the Curve\n- Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve\n- Gini Coefficient\n- Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n- Assessing Population Stability\n- Maintaining a model\n\n\nAlong with the video lessons you will receive several valuable resources that will help you learn as much as possible:\n· Lectures\n· Notebook files\n· Homework\n· Quiz questions\n· Slides\n· Downloads\n· Access to Q&A where you could reach out and contact the course tutor.\n\n\nSigning up for the course today could be a great step towards your career in data science. Make sure that you take full advantage of this amazing opportunity!\nSee you on the inside!",

      "description": "Have you ever had analytical questions that are easy to ask, but surprisingly hard to answer with regular analytical tools? Do you often find yourself asking questions involving different data layers? Like comparing a single category to a whole table; or applying filters on particular fields; or tracking the behaviour of custom cohorts over time - just to mention a few classic examples.\nDo you want to know how to compare data aggregated at different levels of granularity?\n\nDo you often bump into the error message: 'Cannot mix aggregate and non-aggregate values'?\n\nDo Tableau terms FIXED, INCLUDE or EXCLUDE confuse you? Are you struggling choosing the right one for particular tasks?\nDo you want to step up your daily analytical game and gain new, useful skills?\nIf you are a passionate Tableau user and you can associate yourself with one or more of the questions above, then this course is for you. Scenarios like the ones mentioned above occur on a daily basis, and they can cause quite a bit of headache for the analyst. Tableau has many great tools and functions including table calculations that make everyday life easier for the data scientist.\nOne strong point of the software is its responsiveness. Plotting measures against variables has never been easier: each change to the shelves is instantly and automatically applied on the view - a great environment to interact with the data. This strong point, however, can easily be turned into a weakness, if you want your analysis to step out of the borders of the view level of detail.\nIn Tableau, to solve classic analytical problems (such as cohort analysis, retention analysis or binning aggregates by dimensions), or to proceed with special filtering scenarios (like proportional brushing or relative comparisons) you need to be familiar with a special tool set called the level of detail (LOD) expressions.\nIn this course, you will learn about the general mechanics of LOD expressions both in theory and practice. We start from the very basics and then we proceed to more advanced techniques in a stepwise manner. If you are not familiar with the concept of LOD expressions yet, but you are already a Tableau user, then taking this course will most probably improve your analytical skills and broaden your tool set.\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to solve all above mentioned analytical challenges and even more, because LOD expressions let the analyst come up with creative solutions for custom scenarios. Instead of asking the questions you can be the one in the office who always has a practical answer or a constructive idea. Take a look at the content of this course, and I bet you won’t regret it.",

      "description": "If you are a current or aspiring IT professional in search of sound, practical techniques to plan, design, and build a data warehouse or data mart, this is the course for you.\nDuring the course, you’ll put what you learn to work and define sample data warehousing architectures and dimensional data structures to help emphasize the best practices and techniques covered in this course. Each section has either scenario based quiz questions or hands on assignments that emphasizes key learning objectives for that section’s material. This way, you can be confident as you move through the course that you’re picking up the key points about data warehousing.\nTo build this course, I drew from more than 30 years of my own data warehousing work on more than 40 client projects and engagements. I’ve been a thought leader in the discipline of data warehousing since the early 1990s when modern data warehousing came onto the scene. I’ve literally seen it all...and written about the discipline of data warehousing in books such as the original Data Warehousing For Dummies ® , along with articles, white papers, and as a monthly data warehousing columnist. I’ve led global consulting practices delivering data warehousing (and its related discipline, business intelligence) to some of the most recognizable brand name customers, along with smaller-sized organizations and governmental agencies. My own consulting firm, Thinking Helmet, Inc., specializes in data warehousing, business intelligence, and related disciplines. I’ve rolled up my sleeves and personally tackled every aspect of what you’ll learn in this course. I’ve even learned a few painful lessons, and have built a healthy share of “lessons learned” into the course material.\nIn this course, I take you from the fundamentals and concepts of data warehousing all the way through best practices for the architecture, dimensional design, and data interchange that you’ll need to implement data warehousing in your organization. You’ll find many examples that clearly demonstrate the key concepts and techniques covered throughout the course. By the end of the course, you’ll be all set to not only put these principles to work, but also to make the key architecture and design decisions required by the “art” of data warehousing that transcend the nuts-and-bolts techniques and design patterns.\nSpecifically, this course will cover:\nFoundational data warehousing concepts and fundamentals\nThe symbiotic relationship between data warehousing and business intelligence\nHow data warehousing co-exists with data lakes and data virtualization\nYour many architectural alternatives, from highly centralized approaches to numerous multi-component alternatives\nThe fundamentals of dimensional analysis and modeling\nThe key relational database capabilities that you will put to work to build your dimensional data models\nDifferent alternatives for handling changing data history within your environment, and how to decide which approaches to apply in various situations\nHow to organize and design your Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) capabilities to keep your data warehouse up to date\n\n\nData warehousing is both an art and a science. While we have developed a large body of best practices over the years, we still have to make this-or-that types of decisions from the earliest stages of a data warehousing project all the way through architecture, design, and implementation. That’s what I’ve instilled into this course: the fusion of data warehousing art and science that you can bring to your organization and your own work. So come join me on this journey through the world of data warehousing!",

Context is critical, and it most definitely applies to learning how to work with data. Before even touching a data tool, amongst many other things, we believe it's vital that one fully understands the context surrounding data.\nFrom there you'll delve deep in to the differences between Data Analytics, Data Science, and Data Engineering, and how each of these roles provide value in their own way. In addition, you'll gather a deep understanding of the tools used by professionals – which are the most popular, when one would be preferred over another, and how they can be used in collaboration.\nNext, you'll learn about the technical processes that encompass the lineage of data. This section will enable you to internalize the concept of a Data Pipeline, and start building-up a lexicon and literacy for how data moves from collection to analysis.\nFinally, you'll see a step-by-step learning roadmap to become a practitioner of Data Analytics. In this section you'll gain access to recommended steps to take after this course, and career paths that are most relevant.\nOne of the biggest challenges in getting started with data is finding the right place to start, we believe this is it.

      "description": "Understanding how to work with data is an increasingly important skill. Businesses collect huge volumes of data and they expect their workforce to be able to use that data to inform decision making and to justify new strategies, products, and business processes. Fortunately, if you have basic math skills (arithmetic and some exposure to algebra) then you have the skills needed to be data literate.\nThis course starts by introducing you to the business factors that are driving the need for data literacy and then we'll turn our attention to working with data. We start at the beginning by defining data and reviewing characteristics of data, including the difference between quantitative data and qualitative data, types of data, and levels of measurement.\nYou will learn how to analyze data to gain insights using descriptive statistics, such as comparing the sales performance of several retail stores. You will also see how to compare results of different options, such as determining which of two different advertising campaigns is more effective. If you need to plan ahead to ensure you have enough inventory to meet future demand, then you are making forecasts. In this course, you'll learn how to make more informed forecasts using data at your disposal.\nOf course, you will often need to share the results of your data analysis so this course includes a detailed example of how to collect data to support an idea and how to present the results of your findings so others can share in your insights.\nData is a resource that can help you do your job better and data literacy gives you the tools to tap into that valuable resource. Let's get started working with data.",

Either way, this course is for you!\nThis course literally includes 101 Practice SQL Questions! In fact, majority of questions include multiple parts. Including those multiple parts students get access to 286 practice questions. This gives individuals ample opportunity to try, fail, learn, and succeed.\nThe instructional level is listed as “All Levels.” However, those taking this course do need to have some basic understanding of SQL. The course includes basic, intermediate, and advanced questions. This course will not teach you concepts step-by-step. You will learn by attempting the question, using a hint if needed, then watching the video explanation. Video explanations are provided to show students how to answer the question; however, each question has multiple answers. The instructor simply shows students how he would answer the question.\nMicrosoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) will be the database management system used in the course. All the questions in the course are answered using the Microsoft Sample database, AdventureWorks. The syntax used in SSMS is T-SQL. T-SQL is similar to syntax used in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Snowflake, MariaDB, etc., however, Microsoft SQL Server will be needed to load the AdventureWorks database.\nList of commands used in course questions:\nBasic concepts: Select, From , Where , Order by , Group by , Count, Inner Join, Select Into, Distinct, Having, Create Database, Use Database, Sum, Avg, Min, Max, Create Table, Drop Table, Insert Into\nIntermediate Concepts: And/Or, In/Not In, Between/Not Between, Like/Not Like, Case When, Concatenation, Left/Right Join, Format, Left/Right, Declare (local variable), Alter Table, Drop Column, Alter Column, Update, GetDate, DateAdd, DatePart, DateDiff, DateName, Month, Year, Day, Len, NewID\nAdvanced Concepts: Truncate, Delete, Exists, Inner Query (Subquery), Stored Procedure, CTEs , Temp Tables, Union, Self-Join, Cross Join, Convert, Cast, IsNull, Nullif, Coalesce, Lag, Lead, Ceiling, Floor, Views, Alter View, Foreign Keys, Default Constraints, Rollup, Pivot, Unpivot, Over, Partition, Rank, Row_Number, NTile, Percent_Rank, Choose, IIF, User Defined Types, Rollback, Begin Transaction, Commit, While loop - Batching, CharIndex, Triggers, Function, Cross Apply, Outer Apply, Index",

      "description": "“I solve problems you don’t know you have, in ways you can’t understand” (I am a Business Analyst).\nThe role of the Business Analyst is much more complex than the people perceive it to be and sometimes it can be a challenge to understand all its facets.\nIn the Business Analysis Essentials we went over the theoretical concepts of Business Analysis. In this course, we are applying the concepts in a simulated project environment, looking at the tasks and deliverables that a Business Analyst has to produce during the life of a project.\nMaster the BA tasks and deliverables\nEstimating the project specific  tasks\nUnderstand the deliverables\nApply the elicitation techniques\nProduce the business and process flows\nFace the project challenges\nWrite effective and clear requirements\nUnderstand how to overcome the obstacles\nMost of the Business Analysis courses are teaching the theoretical concepts but they don’t provide enough understanding of what the Business Analysts do on a daily basis during the project.\nThis course aims to overcome these shortcomings and walk you through a complete project from the Business Analyst’s point of view, starting with the project initiations, project planning, requirements elicitation, requirements communications, various traps that you may encounter on the way, all the way till you get your requirements signed off and you have to provide development and test support.\nContents and Overview\nThis course contains over 40 lectures and more than 3 hours of contents. The course is designed for beginners to intermediate Business Analysts, but a bit of prior experience would help to understand better the project challenges. If you are new to the Business Analysis world, I recommend you take the Business Analysis Essentials course first in order to grasp the theoretical concepts, before seeing how they are being applied in practice.\nWhile Business Analysis Essentials is not a pre requisite for this course, it would help you to cement the concepts taught there through a combination of theory (Business Analysis Essentials) and practice (Business Analysis Demonstrated).\nBy the end of this course, you will have a complete understanding of how to use the Business Analysis techniques, what challenges you will be facing during a project, what documents you need to deliver, how to get the business buy in to sign off the requirements, what type of communication challenges the project may present and how to overcome them.\n\n\nWhat are the requirements for this course?\nYour willingness to learn\nA basic understanding of the SDLC (refer to Business Analysis Essentials)\n\n\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\nOver 40 lectures and 3 hours of content\nStep by step instructions about what you need to do in a project as a Business Analyst\nYou will be able to be more effective and successful in your job as a Business Analyst\nA complete picture of what the Business Analysts tasks are in projec\n\n\nWho is the audience?\nEveryone who wants to gain more insight about Business Analysis\nStudents who want to pursue a Business Analyst career\nJunior or Intermediate Business Analysts who want to become more effective\nSenior Business Analysts who need a refresher of the Business Analysis concepts",

This course on advanced SQL for data analysis  has everything that isn't covered in introductory SQL courses.\nThe curriculum goes DEEP, spanning all the advanced techniques you'll ever need to wrangle and analyze data in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\nAnd these concepts aren't presented in isolation; everything is taught in the context of real-world analytics scenarios, meaning you'll be ready to apply these techniques on the job from day one.\n\n\nHere's a look at just some of the things you'll get out of this course:\nMake the leap to Senior Analyst by mastering advanced data wrangling techniques with SQL\nBecome the resident SQL expert on your team\nPerform nuanced analysis of large datasets with Window Functions\nUse subqueries, CTEs and temporary tables to handle complex, multi-stage queries and data transformations\nWrite efficient, optimized SQL\nLeverage indexes to speed up your SQL queries\nSupercharge your SQL knowledge with procedural programming techniques like variables and IF statements\nProgram database objects like user defined functions and stored procedures that will make life easier for you AND your teammates\nMaster useful tips and tricks not found in most database courses, like Dynamic SQL\nGain an intuition for what technique to apply and when\nTrain your brain with tons of hands-on exercises that reflect real-world business scenarios\n\n\nWhat makes this course different\nThere are three things that really set this course apart.\nFirst is its scope. We'll dig deep into the advanced toolbox that SQL has to offer, uncovering techniques to solve problems that leave even senior analysts scratching their heads.\nSecond is a relentless focus on that practical, real-world applications. Techniques are taught not as abstract concepts, but rather as solutions to common data wrangling and analytics problems. And whenever possible, these techniques are presented, not in isolation, but in combination with other things that have already been covered. This \"spiral\" approach reinforces concepts you've learned so they stay with you long after taking the course.\nFinally, and most importantly, the course provides a treasure trove of coding exercises that give you ample opportunity for hands-on practice. And these exercises are distributed throughout the course - not clustered together after hours of videos. This means you'll have an opportunity to practice every concept you learn, right after you learn it.\nSo if you want to go from SQL apprentice to SQL master, enroll today. I look forward to seeing you in the course.",

      "description": "About the course\n\nAn important aspect for many organizations is the flow of work between different parts of the organization. Traditionally, experts would use business process modeling techniques to visualize how these processes should be. This is a very labor intensive exercise. Moreover, in practice, the actual process may be very different from what is drawn on paper. This gap can be filled by applying process mining. Process Intelligence & Process Mining uses actual data to visualize what the process is, rather than what the process is thought to be.\nProcess Intelligence & Process Mining is a relatively young research discipline that sits between computational intelligence and data mining on the one hand, and process modeling on the other hand. The idea of process mining is to discover, monitor and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from data readily available in an organization’s information systems. It is a tool to improve the design, redesign, control, and support of operational business processes.\nIn this course, students are introduced to the discipline of process mining using a healthy blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice. The theoretical parts of this course are drawn from leading academic publications. The hands-on practice parts will be conducted in the leading process mining software application that is democratizing process mining for the masses, Celonis Free Plan (formely Celonis Snap). In addition to this, other tools and concepts are covered to prepare you for any platform.\n\n\nImportant: Please note, due to recent updates by Celonis, some features have been put behind a paywall. This means that you can not use these features in the free version, but instead need a Celonis licence. The sections of this course that showcase features that are behind a paywall, are now labeled as 'Celonis Licence needed'.\n\n\nBONUS MATERIAL: Get unlimited acces to my free process mining tool powered by PM4Py, plus Learn how to build your own process mining tool using Vibe coding.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\n\n\nThis course is most valuable for people that work in an organization in which products and services are the result of processes that leave a digital footprint. Examples are people advising organizations on:\n\n\nAssembly line industrial manufacturing;\n\n\nCoordinating patient journeys through a hospital;\n\n\nThe flow of loan applications at a bank;\n\n\nLogistic coordination and supply chain management;\n\n\nCustomer journeys.\n\n\n\n\nThis course will radically transform the ability of students to discover, monitor and enhance these processes\n\n\nIn addition to this, people that work with systems such as Scientific management (Taylorism), Kanban, Kaizen, Lean Six Sigma, Theory of Constraints, Bottleneck Identification and Just-In-Time (JIT) will greatly benefit from this course, because process mining unlocks a data-driven factor into these approaches to production process management.\n\n\nOther types of students that will benefit from this course are:\n\n\nIndividuals with a background in business process management, process mapping, flowcharting and business process modelling (BPM / BPMN).\n\n\nIndividuals with a background in data science that want to acquire skills that directly contribute to the value chain of organizations.\n\n\nIndividuals responsible for creating a Digital Twin of an organization and/or involved in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) projects (such as UiPath), that need to have a clear grasp on the ongoing processes in an organization in order to be able to prioritize competing process automation projects.\n\n\nIndividuals in charge of process auditing.\n\n\nIndividuals curious about process mining.\n\n\nWhat this course is NOT about:\n\n\n- This course is intended to be hands-on and practical. Therefore, only limited attention will paid to the underlying (alternative) theories of process modelling and mining. The focus will be on applied process mining with Celonis Free Plan (formerly Celonis Snap).\n\n\n- Although process mining overlaps with the domain of business process modeling & notation (BPMN), this course is not about BPMN. BPMN is only elaborated on in the context that is relevant for process mining, such as conformance checking.\n\n\n- Although process mining overlaps with the domain of data science, this course is not about data science. Data science is only elaborated on in the context that is relevant for process mining.\n\n\n- This course will not cover how to integrate Celonis with an organization's information system and/or data warehouse as part of its information architecture.",

Even neural networks geeks (like us) can’t help, but admit that it’s these 3 simple methods - linear regression, logistic regression and clustering that data science actually revolves around.\nSo, in this course, we will make an otherwise complex subject matter easy to understand and apply in practice.\nOf course, there is only one way to teach these skills in the context of data science - to accompany statistics theory with practical application of these quantitative methods in Python.\nAnd that’s precisely what we are after. Theory and practice go hand in hand here.\nWe have developed this course with not one but two machine learning libraries – StatsModels and sklearn. As our practical experience showed us, they have different use cases and should be used together rather than independently.\nYet another advantage of taking this course? We are very conscious that data science theory is often overlooked.You can’t teach someone to run before they know how to walk. That’s why we will start slowly and continue by building complex ML models.\nBut don’t assume you’ll be bored by theory.\nOn the contrary! We have prepared a course that will get you results and will foster your interest in the subject matter, as it will show you that machine learning is something you can do, too (with the right teacher by your side).\nWell, we hope you are as excited as we are, as this course is the door that can open countless opportunities in the data science world for you. This is a course you’ll be actually eager to complete.\nOn top of that we are happy to offer a 30-day money back guarantee. No risk for you. The content of the course is so outstanding , that this is a no-brainer for us We are 100% certain you will love it.\nWhy wait any longer? Every day is a missed opportunity.\nClick the “Buy Now” button and let’s start (machine) learning together!",

      "description": "Hi Folks,\nThis side Lokesh Lalwani. I am the instructor of this course and would like to share a word about this course with you.\nThis course is for a beginner and someone who would like to brush up on the core concepts in Power BI. The best part is that you will learn all this in the shortest possible time i.e. just 1 day.\nIts been over 10 years that I am into training and consulting and trained over 1000's of professionals from companies like EY, PWC, KPMG, Honda, Volvo, Amazon, etc. and my approach to sharing my knowledge is always practical. I only share knowledge on any feature or tool when I am 100% sure and understand its usage. Maybe that is the reason that since I have started my journey as a trainer, I always got a 5-star review from my participants. That is why I am sure that you will love the content of the course too. My course are already subscribed by 1000's of professionals around the globe on this amazing platform.\nIn this course first, I will start explaining some important concepts around Power BI through a presentation and then will understand our case study files. Then will start the flow by connecting to data, then transforming (cleaning) the data, and finally loading the same in the Power BI desktop application (ETL process).\nOnce the data is being loaded, we will understand how to build a data model (this module is specially designed for people who are from non-technical backgrounds... like me). In this module, we will understand how different concepts of Data modeling like Primary and foreign key, filter flow, relationship cardinality, star and snowflake schema, etc.\nOnce the model is in place we will be finding insights through Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). This is a formula language and in my view this the hardest part of Power BI flow. We will be understanding the most commonly used PBI DAX functions.\nThe moment we have DAX in place, we will jump in Report Building. Here we will be inserting some amazing visuals and building a report theme too.\nAnd finally will be publishing the report on the Power BI service environment.\nHope you are already excited to be a part of this amazing journey. So don't wait just signup and I'll see you in the course :)",

      "description": "What is the aim of this course?\nAs a business analyst or management consultant, you are delivering your advice, observation, and analyses using presentations. During some projects, you may be producing as many as 200-300 slides. Slide preparation is very time-consuming and you have to make sure that you structure your work properly to deliver according to promised deadlines.\nIn this course, you will learn how to prepare a great presentation for your customer that will help you deliver your thoughts in a coherent manner and win him over. I will teach you how to prepare the presentation in the right order so you do not waste your time. You will also learn what type of slides you can consider and when you should use a specific type of slide. You will also find in the course examples of presentations from management consulting along with useful templates you can use for your own goals.\nThis course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated in total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.\nI teach through cases, using the 80/20 rule so most of the lectures will be case studies showing examples of how to put something on a slide. Those slides are based on real-life examples. You will also learn the order in which you should do things in order to deliver nice, coherent, and understood by your customer, presentations within the deadlines. For every lecture, you will also find attached additional resources. Thanks to this, as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made materials that will help you in your first year as a business analyst / junior consultant.\nWhy have I decided to create this course?\nPresentations are not something people learn in school or even at universities. For most people, it is difficult to read presentations and express themselves using slides. Many people, experience also in the beginning problems in proper structuring of the whole presentation. They cannot make it understandable for the customer and quite often the presentation lacks flow.  The biggest problem in consulting is that the presentation determines the analyses that you have to make. If your presentation draft is not well structured and thought-through you will not be efficient with interviews, data gathering, and analyses. Therefore, I found it critical to teach all my co-workers and employees how to express themselves. In this way, I made their work (not only related to presentation) much more efficient and also my life much easier :). Learn from this course and apply it also in your work\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of cases, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you work. You will learn how to prepare a great presentation both for internal as well as external purposes. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. My intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to structure the subject that the presentation is addressing?\nIn what order you should approach the preparation of the presentation?\nHow to prepare the sketch and the template of the presentation?\nWhat type of slides and when you can use them?\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into 7 sections. Currently, you will find the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on the role of presentation in consulting and when you actually prepare presentations\nCreating the template. In the second section, how to go from a general idea (i.e. from an issue tree) to a sketch and how to transform the sketch into a template\nFilling in the slides. In the next section, I will talk about general rules concerning the filling in the slides, the flow that you achieve, and how different is the template vs the end-product\nDelivery of the presentation.  In section 4 we will talk briefly about the delivery of the presentation: how to do it and how different is the written presentation from the presentation that can be delivered to the audience.\nTypes of charts you can use. In section 5 I will go through many types of slides and will show you what you can use for a specific purpose\nExample of presentations. In the next section, I show examples of real presentations and will discuss how I have structured them in such a way.\nWe will be adding new lectures in the coming months\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nTemplates of slides\nExamples of presentations shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nCreate a great presentation in the style of top consulting firms\nUnderstand the main challenges in preparing the management consulting presentation\nExpress yourself with slides\nRead presentation\nCreate the flow in the story told via presentation\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nManagement Consultants\nStudents of Business Schools\nResearchers\nBusiness Analysts",

However, these core tasks are commonly associated with this job:\nIntegrate Data\nSQL data analysts integrate data from multiple data sets into o:ne database system to streamline information.\nCreate Database Functions\nSQL data analysts program specific database functions to create database triggers and design data tables.\nDesign Reports\nAfter reviewing and analysing data, SQL data analysts design reports to show statistics and other information about specific database topics.\nClean Database\nSQL data analysts remove dead data files and other irrelevant information to free up database space.\nWrite Scripts\nSQL data analysts write scripts to analyse data and perform specific data queries.\nResolve Data Issues\nSQL data analysts isolate and resolve issues with data and databases.\nAdd Data\nSQL data analysts collect data from multiple sources and add it to the database.\n\n\nWe will be performing data analysis using SQL on relational databases like: MySQL, PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server.\nA relational database is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.  A relational database includes tables containing rows and columns. For example, a typical business order entry database would include a table that describes a customer with columns for name, address, phone number and so forth.\nSQL or Structured Query Language is a critical tool for data professionals. It is undoubtedly the most important language for getting a job in the field of data analysis or data sciences. Millions of data points are being generated every minute. And raw data does not have any story to tell. After all this data gets stored in databases and professionals use SQL to extract this data for further analysis.",

      "description": "How important is database management in the age of big data and analytics?\nIt is really important.\nHow many employers would be happy to hire employees who can use data for the purposes of business intelligence?\nAll of them.\nHow many people have these skills?\nNot enough.\nThis is why now is the time to learn SQL and gain a competitive advantage in the job market. Remember, the average salary of a SQL developer is $123,400! That’s a lucrative career.\nHow come?\nWell, when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business. For instance,  database management is the foundation for data analysis and intelligent decision making.\nWorried that you have no previous experience?\nNot an issue. We will start from the very basics and gradually teach you everything you need to know. Step by step. With no steps skipped.\nWhy take this course in particular? Isn’t it like the rest of the SQL courses out there?\nWe would like to think it isn’t. Our team worked hard to create a course that is:\nEasy to understand\nTime efficient and concise\nShows how SQL can be crucial for data analytics and business intelligence\n\n\nComprehensive – it covers several topics not shown in other SQL courses\n\n\nPractical – it teaches you how to work with a real-life database\n\n\nCorresponds to professional best practices\nTaught in MySQL – The most popular SQL database management system\nContains plenty of downloadable exercises, course notes, and quiz questions\nSome of these aspects have been covered in other courses. Others haven’t. However, no one provides such a variety of topics in one place.\nWe firmly believe this course is the best training material out there. It is a truly interactive experience preparing you for a real-life working environment.\nWe love teaching\nSo far, over 3,000,000 students have taken our courses here on Udemy. Teaching is what we do best, and we take pride in going the extra mile to create the most engaging content for you, our students. Our mission is to help you bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge taught at school and in universities and the practical application required at the workplace.\nSo, why do you need to enroll in this course and learn SQL?\nSalary/Income. As we pointed out earlier, learning SQL is a great opportunity. There is a significant surge in demand for skills revolving around database management, database administration, and business analysis relying on data. Companies will pay top dollars for specialists who have such know-how\nProfession of the future. In the years to come, data will only grow in importance and size. Therefore, it is great to pick up a skill that will likely increase in demand over the years to come\nAnalytical reasoning. Programming languages are a great way to train your mind. Furthermore, understanding a business task and looking for its solution through writing code can be really interesting and stimulating once you become familiar with the basics\nWhat about certificates? Do you provide a certificate?\nUpon completion of the course, you will be able to download a certificate of completion with your name on it. Then, you can upload this certificate on LinkedIn and show potential employers this is a skill you possess.\nSounds awesome, right?\nSo, what are you waiting for?

      "description": "This is just the SAS SQL portion of my larger SAS Programming Complete Course. Ideal for students who are fairly comfortable with SAS Base but have not used SAS SQL all that much.\nThe goal of the course is to teach you SQL as it relates to the SAS programming language.  In other words, you will learn SAS SQL. This means that you should have a good grasp of the SAS data step already! SQL is especially utilized for extracting/selecting data from database tables, and also manipulating that data.\nIf you're looking to gain a skill that is the PERFECT compliment to your knowledge with the SAS data step, this is the course. Employers often want employees to understand the SAS data step, and also how SQL is incorporated into the SAS Programming language.\nWhether you are looking for a new job, looking to move up at your current company, or looking to get into a respected well-paying career after school..SAS SQL will get you that much closer.\nThe course has four main sections. The first section is Base Knowledge. You will learn about SQL syntax, including specifics on the Select and Where clause. You will also learn about Case Logic and Summary Functions. The second section is about Joining tables. I show you how to use the inner join, join three tables, left/right join, and full join. The third section is Working with Tables. I show you how to create a table, Alter columns (add, modify, delete) and how to Insert Rows in different ways. The final section is on Practical/Useful applications of SQL. For example, you'll learn how to Compare tables, find duplicate observations/get rid of them, how to sort the way you want to, and how to update a table under certain conditions.\nEach section has video lessons, followed by a Quiz (that tests general knowledge), and then an Assignment (that requires you to apply what you've learned.)\nFinally, you have nothing to lose. This course has a 30-day money back guarantee. Buy the course today and add another essential sas programming skill to your resume.

I recently finished a PhD at Cambridge University (Tropical Ecology and Conservation).\nI have several years of experience in analyzing real life data from different sources  using data science related techniques and producing publications for international peer reviewed journals.\nOver the course of my research I realized almost all the Python data science courses and books out there do not account for the multidimensional nature of the topic and use data science interchangeably with machine learning..\nThis gives students an incomplete knowledge of the subject. My course, on the other hand, will give you a robust grounding in all aspects of data science within the PyTorch framework.\nUnlike other Python courses and books, you will actually learn to use PyTorch on real data!  Most of the other resources I encountered showed how to use PyTorch on in-built datasets which have limited use.\nDISCOVER 7 COMPLETE SECTIONS ADDRESSING EVERY ASPECT OF PYTORCH:\n• A full introduction to Python Data Science and powerful Python driven framework for data science, Anaconda\n• Getting started with Jupyter notebooks for implementing data science techniques in Python\n• A comprehensive presentation about PyTorch installation and a brief introduction to the other Python data science packages\n• A brief introduction to the working of important data science packages such as Pandas and Numpy\n• The basics of the PyTorch syntax and tensors\n• The basics of working with imagery data in Python\n• The theory behind neural network concepts such as artificial neural networks, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN)\n• You’ll even discover how to create artificial neural networks and deep learning structures with PyTorch (on real data)\nBUT,  WAIT! THIS ISN'T JUST ANY OTHER DATA SCIENCE COURSE:\nYou’ll start by absorbing the most valuable PyTorch basics and techniques.\nI use easy-to-understand, hands-on methods to simplify and address even the most difficult concepts.\nMy course will help you implement the methods using real data obtained from different sources. Many courses use made-up data that does not empower students to implement Python-based data science in real -life.\nAfter taking this course, you’ll easily use packages like Numpy, Pandas, and PIL to work with real data in Python along with gaining fluency in PyTorch. I will even introduce you to deep learning models such as Convolution Neural network (CNN) !!\nThe underlying motivation for the course is to ensure you can apply Python-based data science on real data into practice today, start analyzing data for your own projects whatever your skill level, and impress your potential employers with actual examples of your data science abilities.\nIt is a practical, hands-on course, i.e. we will spend some time dealing with some of the theoretical concepts related to data science. However, the majority of the course will focus on implementing different techniques on real data and interpret the results. Some of the problems we will solve include identifying credit card fraud and classifying the images of different fruits.\nAfter each video, you will learn a new concept or technique which you may apply to your own projects!\nJOIN THE COURSE NOW!\n#deep #learning #neural #networks #python #ai #programming",

      "description": "Today we live in a world where tons of data is generated every second. We need to analyze data to get some useful insight. One of the strongest weapons for data insight is data visualization. Probably you have heard this one before: \"A picture tells more than a thousand words combined \". Therefore to tell stories from the data we need tools for producing adequate and amazing graphics.  Here R as one of the most rapidly growing tools in the fields of data science and statistics provides needed assistance. If you combine R with its library ggplot2  you get one of the deadliest tools for data visualization, which grows every day and is freely accessible to anyone.\n\n\nThis course is designed to first give you quick and proper theoretical foundations for creating statistical plots. Then you dive into the world of exploratory data analysis where you are confronted with different datasets and creating a wide variety of statistical plots.\n\n\nIf you take this course, you will learn a ton of new things.  Here are just a few topics you will be engaged with:\nThe grammar of graphics (the idea behind statistical plots, the foundation of ggplot2)\nData transformation with dplyr and tidyr (crash course included)\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) (statistical plots for exploring one continuous or one discrete variable)\nEDA for exploring two or more variables (different statistical plots)\nCombine ggplot2 with RMarkdown to wrap up your analysis and produce HTML reports\nCreate some additional types of plots by combining ggplot2 and supplementary libraries (word cloud, parallel coordinates plot, heat map, radar plot, ...)\nDraw maps to show the spread of coronavirus disease\nCustomize the plot's theme\nCreate subplots using cowplot library\nHighlight data on your plot with gghighlight library\nand much more...\n\n\nCourse includes:\nover 20 hours of lecture videos,\nR scripts and additional data (provided in the course material),\nengagement with assignments, where you have to test your skills,\nassignments walkthrough videos (where you can check your results).\nAll being said this makes one of Udemy's most comprehensive courses for data visualization using R and ggplot2.\n\n\nEnroll today and become the master of data visualization!!!",

The 2nd edition features content on causation, predictive models, and AI/ML fundamentals, including generative AI.\nYou'll learn how to:\nTrack churn accurately\nAnalyze NPS and CSAT in new ways\nConstruct predictive customer health dashboards\nForecast renewal revenue with precision\nImprove your processes\nAs a result, you'll facilitate better decisions and improve operational performance.\nIn this age of easy data visualization and generative AI, why does this course make sense? Well, more and more people these days are loading raw data into genAI, asking it to find patterns, and following whatever advice comes back. And new software is coming to market designed specifically for this purpose. Having AI do your data analysis is certainly easier than doing it yourself, but it’s a recipe for disaster.\nWhy? No AI is capable of understanding meaning. That requires humans, and likely will for many years to come. You must know more than your AI \"Copilot\" in order to check its work.\nThis course features downloadable exercises in Excel to practice applying the concepts, quizzes to reinforce learning, and a valuable CSMath Handy Equations and Procedures Guide for using your new skills on the job.",

With sentiment analysis you find out if the crowd has a rather positive or negative opinion towards a given search term. This search term can be a product (like in the course) but it can also be a person, region, company or basically anything as long as it is mentioned regularly on Twitter.\nWhile R can directly fetch the text data from Twitter, clean and analyze it, Tableau is great at visualizing the data. And that is the power of the method outlined in this course. You get the best of both worlds, a dream team.\nContent overview and course structure:\nThe R Side\nGetting a Twitter developers account\nConnection of Twitter and R\nGetting the right packages for our approach\nHarvesting Tweets and loading them into R\nRefining the harvesting approach by language, time, user or geolocation\nHandling Twitter meta data like: favorites, retweets, timelines, users, etc\nText cleaning\nSentiment scoring via a simple lexicon approach (in English)\nData export (csv) for further Tableau work\nTableau Side:\nData preparation for visualizations\nQuick data exploration\nDashboards\nVisualizing -\nPopularity of different products\nPopularity between different locations on a map\nChanges in popularity over time\nYou only need basic R skills to follow along. There is a free version of Tableau called Tableau public desktop, or even better: as a full time college student you can get a free but full version of Tableau desktop professional.\nThe course comes with the R code to copy into your R session.\nDisclaimer required by Twitter: 'TWITTER, TWEET, RETWEET and the Twitter logo are trademarks of Twitter, Inc or its affiliates.'",

      "description": "Microsoft Analysis Services abbreviated as SSAS consist of two modes.\n1- SSAS Tabular Mode\n2- SSAS Multidimensional mode\n\n\nThis course is purely based on SSAS Tabular model. Tabular model in analysis services runs in memory or in the direct query mode. There are different data sources available that can be used to feed data to a tabular model.\nWhen we use the direct query in the Power BI desktop, all the time we fight with the performance issue. Power BI desktop fires SQL queries during refreshing dashboards or doing some interactions. SQL Server needs to run these queries and send the result back to the Power BI which causes performance issue. But with the help SSAS Tabular model, we can design and develop the data model according to the business process requirement, add KPIs, DAX measures, calculated columns, and finally, this model is deployed on the SSAS analysis server.\nWe can connect the Power BI desktop or SSRS to the SSAS tabular model and fetch the data to show on reports & dashboards. SSAS tabular model provides great flexibility in terms of performance and security.\nIn this course, you will learn the following topics\n-  How to install SSAS Tabular instance\n- How to import AdventureWorks database\n- Start schema vs snowflake schema\n- Different features in SSAS Tabular models\n- Role-playing dimensions\n- How to deploy SSAS Tabular model\n- How to create hierarchies\n- Perspectives in SSAS tabular model\n- DAX and calculated columns in SSAS tabular model\n- How to create KPIs\n- Partitions in SSAS tabular model\n- Tabular model processing options\n- Row-level security in SSAS tabular model\n- Tabular model deployment via script\n\n\nWhenever new features in the Tabular model will come, I will keep this course up to date.\nI wish you all the best to learn how to create and deploy SSAS tabular models.",

But what if the buck stops with you? What if you’re the person responsible for controlling how Power BI is used and implemented within your organization? If that’s the case, then this is the course for you.\nThis training is designed for Fabric administrators who manage Power BI, as well as Power Platform admins and Microsoft 365 admins who share responsibilities for data governance and analytics services.\nEffective Power BI administration and data governance are critical to a successful deployment across your organization. As part of Microsoft Fabric, Power BI integrates with a suite of data services, making governance even more essential to ensure consistent, high-quality data and smooth collaboration.\nThis course provides the framework necessary to successfully integrate Power BI into your corporate environment. You’ll learn how to configure key tenant settings and set up various options in the Power BI service according to best practices.\nThere are no special prerequisites for this course; however, a basic understanding of Power BI fundamentals is recommended.\nThe Power BI administrator role (now part of the Fabric Administrator role) comes with a wide range of responsibilities. This course is designed to equip administrators with the knowledge and confidence to fulfill their role effectively and ensure a smooth Power BI implementation within the Microsoft Fabric ecosystem.\nAbout Power BI\nPower BI is a leading self-service business intelligence platform that enables business users to collect, transform, analyze, and visualize organizational data. It consists of desktop applications, a cloud-based service, and mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android. Users can build interactive reports and dashboards to gain actionable insights quickly.\nSince its launch in 2016, Power BI has become one of the most popular self-service BI tools on the market. Its deep integration with other Microsoft services has driven rapid adoption and widespread use in a variety of industries and organizations.\nWhy Self-Service BI Matters\nWith self-service BI, the goal is to empower business users to leverage their domain expertise to create reports and insights tailored to their teams’ needs—without depending entirely on IT specialists. However, this approach comes with its own set of challenges, including maintaining data quality, consistency, and governance.\nThroughout the course, we’ll explore these challenges and provide strategies to overcome them, ensuring your organization strikes the right balance between user autonomy and effective administration",

Are you afraid you will pick the wrong test? Or make a mistake in your calculations and misinterpret your data? In short: are you afraid of stats?\nIf so, you've come to the right place! I'm here to demonstrate that your fear of statistics is unfounded.\nDespite what many people think, you don't need to learn complex mathematical formulae to perform statistical analyses. You just need to learn two things.\nFirst, you need to know how to choose the right statistical test.\nThen, you need to know how to do the analysis in computer software like SPSS so you can draw conclusions from your data.\nIt's that easy!\nThis course will show you how to pick the right statistical test by answering four simple questions about your data and your research methodology. I call these the building blocks of statistical analysis, and it involves no maths at all.\nThen you'll learn how to use SPSS to do the hard work for you. Even if you've never used SPSS, I'll help you get comfortable with the program. You'll learn how to open SPSS, enter data into the program and save it. Next you'll learn how to use SPSS to obtain descriptive statistics such as the mean, median, mode and frequencies. Then you'll discover how to use SPSS to calculate inferential statistics such as the t-test, correlation, Chi-square, ANOVA and regression.\nThe ability to perform quantitative data analysis is becoming an increasingly important skill for researchers to possess. Adding these skills to your CV will make you more employable and give you the confidence you need to start analysing your data today.",

      "description": "Are you interested in learning how data can help a business thrive and prosper?\nDo you want to be able to leverage the value of your business data?\nIf so, then this is the perfect course for you!\nThe hype around AI, data science, analytics and business intelligence is at its peak. Almost all companies are aware that data can help them improve their performance in some way, shape, or form. However, the majority of business executives commit the same crucial mistake:\n“Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat’’\nSun Tzu, Chinese military strategist\nCollecting and analysing data for the sake of working with numbers is far from optimal.\nData is only as valuable as the insights you will obtain from it.\nSo, to position your business for success in today’s AI and data-driven world, you have to start by reflecting on several key questions.\nWhat are the key decisions your company will make that can be improved with the right data?\nHow is data going to help your firm improve and automate business processes?\nIn what way can data make your products or services better?\nTo what extent is your business’s data valuable to external parties who might be willing to pay for it?\nIt is much better to try and answer such fundamental questions first, rather than focusing extensively on data analysis techniques and data storage infrastructure requirements before you have defined a roadmap of how data will help your business in the long run.\nA smart business executive focuses on data strategy first.\nIn this course, we will cover several important topics that will prove to be invaluable if you are:\n- a business owner,\n- a business executive\n- an aspiring data practitioner.\nWe will provide context and help you understand why data is one of the most important for any business today. We’ll talk about hundreds of ways companies have benefited from a well-structured data strategy in real life. By the end of the course you will be able to recognize data-related opportunities in your own organization.\nThe course starts by focusing on the main ways in which data can help a business:\n- use data to improve business decisions.\n- use data to understand your customers and markets\n- use data to provide more intelligent products and services\n- use data to improve your business processes.\n- use data to generate a meaningful revenue stream\nWe’ll discuss how companies have benefited from data in each of these scenarios and the practical implications you need to bear in mind before embarking on your data projects.\nThen, in the next section of the course, we will do one of my favorite exercises that I do when working with and consulting for my clients. I will show you how to define your data use cases. We will brainstorm the data opportunities for your business and identify possible data use cases, ensuring a clear link to your strategic business goals. We will take this process as an opportunity to review your existing strategy to ensure it is still relevant in today's business world. We will then make sure you don't fall into the trap of identifying too many use cases - it is not about finding as many as you can, rather than the most important ones.\nThen the course continues by focusing on sourcing and collecting data. An important topic that involves several key considerations. We will distinguish between structured and unstructured data, internal and external data, and so on. By the end of this section, you will have an idea how a company should approach data collection, and understand the different sources of data that could be used besides internal data.\nThis is a truly comprehensive course. We’ve also included sections on:\n- Data governance, ethics, and trust\n- How to turn data into insights (a brief description of the various techniques that can be used to analyze data)\n- How to create the appropriate technology and data infrastructure in your company\n- How to build the necessary data competencies in your organization\n- How to execute and revisit your data strategy\nI’m very excited that you are interested in this subject because I believe that this is one of the most fascinating aspects of today’s business world. Innovation through the use of data and data analysis is something I am very passionate about. I’ll be happy if you start or advance your data analysis journey with the Data Strategy course and I hope I will see you inside the course!\nBernard Marr",

With this Hadoop tutorial, you'll not only understand what those systems are and how they fit together - but you'll go hands-on and learn how to use them to solve real business problems!\nLearn and master the most popular data engineering technologies in this comprehensive course, taught by a former engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb. We'll go way beyond Hadoop itself, and dive into all sorts of distributed systems you may need to integrate with.\n\n\nInstall and work with a real Hadoop installation right on your desktop with Hortonworks (now part of Cloudera) and the Ambari UI\nManage big data on a cluster with HDFS and MapReduce\nWrite programs to analyze data on Hadoop with Pig and Spark\nStore and query your data with Sqoop, Hive, MySQL, HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB, Drill, Phoenix, and Presto\nDesign real-world systems using the Hadoop ecosystem\nLearn how your cluster is managed with YARN, Mesos, Zookeeper, Oozie, Zeppelin, and Hue\nHandle streaming data in real time with Kafka, Flume, Spark Streaming, Flink, and Storm\nSpark and Hadoop developers are hugely valued at companies with large amounts of data; these are very marketable skills to learn.\nAlmost every large company you might want to work at uses Hadoop in some way, including Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, IBM,  Spotify, Twitter, and Yahoo! And it's not just technology companies that need Hadoop; even the New York Times uses Hadoop for processing images.\nThis course is comprehensive, covering over 25 different technologies in over 14 hours of video lectures. It's filled with hands-on activities and exercises, so you get some real experience in using Hadoop - it's not just theory.\nYou'll find a range of activities in this course for people at every level. If you're a project manager who just wants to learn the buzzwords, there are web UI's for many of the activities in the course that require no programming knowledge. If you're comfortable with command lines, we'll show you how to work with them too. And if you're a programmer, I'll challenge you with writing real scripts on a Hadoop system using Scala, Pig Latin, and Python.\nYou'll walk away from this course with a real, deep understanding of Hadoop and its associated distributed systems, and you can apply Hadoop to real-world problems. Plus a valuable completion certificate is waiting for you at the end!\nPlease note the focus on this course is on application development, not Hadoop administration. Although you will pick up some administration skills along the way.\nKnowing how to wrangle \"big data\" is an incredibly valuable skill for today's top tech employers. Don't be left behind - enroll now!\n\n\n\"The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop... was a crucial discovery for me. I supplemented your course with a bunch of literature and conferences until I managed to land an interview. I can proudly say that I landed a job as a Big Data Engineer around a year after I started your course. Thanks so much for all the great content you have generated and the crystal clear explanations. \" - Aldo Serrano\n\n\"I honestly wouldn’t be where I am now without this course. Frank makes the complex simple by helping you through the process every step of the way. Highly recommended and worth your time especially the Spark environment.   This course helped me achieve a far greater understanding of the environment and its capabilities.  Frank makes the complex simple by helping you through the process every step of the way.

      "description": "Course Description:\nWhat sets exceptional leaders apart in today’s workplace? It’s not just technical expertise—it’s the ability to understand, connect, and inspire. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the secret ingredient to creating cohesive, high-performing teams, and this course will show you how to master it!\nImagine a team where every member feels understood, valued, and empowered to contribute their best. What if you could turn conflicts into opportunities, foster trust that inspires collaboration, and create an environment where resilience and innovation thrive? This is the power of Emotional Intelligence.\nIn “Emotional Intelligence in Teams and Collaboration,” you’ll explore how EI transforms the way teams communicate, connect, and overcome challenges. By developing key EI skills like self-awareness, empathy, and emotional regulation, you’ll gain the tools to build cohesive, high-performing teams that adapt gracefully to change.\nThis course combines research-backed insights with practical strategies to help you foster trust, resolve conflicts, and lead with authenticity. Whether you’re a team leader, manager, or aspiring leader, you’ll leave equipped to create a team culture where everyone thrives.\nCourse Overview\nThe course is divided into four sections, each building on the last to help learners understand and apply emotional intelligence in team settings:\nSection 1: Introduces the foundational concepts of EI and its importance in the workplace.\nSection 2: Focuses on developing self-awareness and self-regulation skills.\nSection 3: Explores social awareness and relationship management techniques.\nSection 4: Culminates in applying these concepts to real-world scenarios, equipping learners with the tools to create resilient, collaborative, and inclusive teams.\nWhat Sets This Course Apart?\nUnlike traditional team-building programs that rely on one-size-fits-all activities or superficial communication tips, this course delves into the deeper, human-centered competencies that drive meaningful collaboration.\nWe integrate research-backed frameworks with practical tools. This ensures you’ll gain both an intellectual understanding of EI concepts and the tactical skills needed to implement them effectively in your own work environment.\nBeyond learning how EI influences collaboration, you’ll discover how to:\nFoster psychological safety.\nEncourage open feedback loops.\nResolve tension productively.\nWhether you’re a team leader, project manager, or aspiring leader, this course equips you to create adaptive teams with strong emotional foundations—teams that not only deliver results but also support individual well-being and sustainable organizational growth.\nWho Will Benefit from This Course?\nThis course is ideal for anyone who leads, collaborates, or contributes within a team setting—regardless of industry or organizational size.\nTeam leaders, project managers, HR professionals, consultants, and aspiring leaders seeking to strengthen their ability to guide others through complex interpersonal dynamics will find immediate value. Additionally, team members wishing to enhance their influence, communication, and conflict-resolution skills will benefit as much as those in formal leadership roles.\nWhether you’re part of a well-established team looking to improve trust and synergy, or guiding a newly formed group through growing pains, this course will help you create an environment where every individual can thrive.\nWhat Will You Learn?\nBy the end of this course, you will:\nDevelop a Strong EI Foundation: Gain deeper self-awareness, learn to recognize your emotional states, and understand how they influence your leadership and teamwork styles.\nStrengthen Interpersonal Understanding: Enhance your capacity for empathy, enabling you to better read team members’ emotions, motivations, and concerns.\nImprove Communication & Feedback Loops: Acquire communication strategies that increase clarity, reduce misunderstandings, and encourage open, honest dialogue within your team.\nNavigate Conflict Productively: Learn to approach disagreements with curiosity and compassion, transforming potential friction into opportunities for growth and innovation.\nFoster a Culture of Trust & Psychological Safety: Discover how to create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas, taking risks, and learning from mistakes without fear of judgment.\nLead and Influence with Emotional Intelligence: Translate emotional insights into tangible leadership actions, guiding your team toward higher performance, resilience, and collective well-being.\nHow Will This Course Help You Professionally?\nAs today’s workplace grows increasingly diverse, distributed, and fast-paced, professionals who excel at navigating human dynamics stand out. This course empowers you to become a more empathetic, adaptable, and strategically engaged leader or team member. By honing your emotional intelligence, you’ll be better positioned to:\nEnhance Leadership Credibility: Strengthen trust with colleagues, stakeholders, and clients by demonstrating genuine understanding and care in all your interactions.\nBoost Team Performance: Use emotional intelligence to create an environment where healthy debate leads to innovation, and where team members are motivated to go the extra mile.Improve Adaptability in Complex Situations: Quickly assess interpersonal challenges, regulate your emotional responses, and employ EI-driven tactics to resolve issues effectively.\nIncrease Influence and Career Growth: Leaders with high EI often find themselves tapped for more responsibility and visibility, as their emotional insights translate into tangible organizational successes.\nReal-World Applications and Case Studies\nTo bridge theory and practice, you’ll dive into realistic business scenarios that highlight the impact of EI on team effectiveness.\nFrom product development groups working under tight deadlines to cross-functional teams navigating organizational change, you’ll analyze how emotional intelligence principles guide better decision-making, communication, and conflict resolution. Through exploring both success stories and lessons from teams that struggled, you’ll gain the perspective needed to proactively apply these concepts in your own professional environment.\nYou’ll emerge from the course with a toolkit you can immediately deploy—be it during a team kickoff meeting, a challenging client negotiation, or a performance review session.\nInteractive and Hands-On Learning\nWe believe that the best way to internalize new skills is to practice them. Throughout the course, you’ll engage in:\nReflective Exercises: Engaging with journaling prompts and self-assessments will help you identify your emotional strengths, blind spots, and growth areas.\nRole-Plays and Scenario Simulations: Participating in interactive exercises will put you in the driver’s seat, requiring you to navigate difficult team conversations, manage emotionally charged situations, and test out new communication strategies.\nPeer Feedback Sessions: Exchanging feedback with fellow learners will deepen your understanding of how others perceive your communication style and emotional awareness.\nCapstone Project: Applying EI frameworks to a real or hypothetical team challenge, you’ll leave with a tangible action plan tailored to your workplace, ensuring that your learning extends far beyond this course.\nWhat Problem Does This Course Solve?\nMany teams struggle with hidden tensions, miscommunications, and ineffective collaboration that stifle innovation and hinder performance. Traditional training often emphasizes technical skills or process optimizations but overlooks the human factors that drive engagement and synergy. This course addresses that gap by placing emotional intelligence at the center of team development. It offers a roadmap to identify and dismantle interpersonal barriers, ensuring that team dynamics become a source of strength rather than a point of friction. Ultimately, it helps you cultivate a work environment that is more cohesive, communicative, and resilient—one where team members feel understood, supported, and empowered to reach their collective potential.\nA Focus on Ethical Leadership\nEmotional intelligence is inherently linked to ethical leadership. By learning to empathize with team members, appreciate diverse perspectives, and respond thoughtfully to challenges, you naturally create a more inclusive and respectful workplace culture. This course will highlight practices that not only improve performance but also uphold principles of fairness, integrity, and inclusivity. Participants will learn how to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard, reduce biases that may emerge in team interactions, and build psychological safety. This ethical lens ensures that as you improve your EI competencies, you also elevate your team’s moral and cultural standards.\nContinuous Learning and Future-Proofing Your Career\nAs organizations evolve—adopting new technologies, business models, and global strategies—the ability to adapt emotionally and socially becomes a key competitive advantage. Emotional intelligence isn’t a static skill; it’s a mindset you can continually refine to meet the demands of an ever-changing workplace. By internalizing the EI principles and practices from this course, you equip yourself to lead through uncertainty, guide teams through transition, and remain a vital asset to any organization. In essence, nurturing your EI is an investment in your professional resilience, ensuring that you remain relevant, impactful, and prepared for the future of work.\nJoin us in Emotional Intelligence in Teams and Collaboration and become the kind of leader who fosters trust-driven teams, cultivates meaningful connections, and adapts gracefully in a rapidly evolving workplace.",

      "description": "Welcome to \"ESG Performance Measurement: A Guide to Selecting and Monitoring Environmental, Social and Governance Metrics\". In this course we explore the world of ESG metrics; the range of measures available; how to select appropriate measures for your organisation and how to interpret the results and determine impact.\n\n\nMeasures of environmental, social, and governance performance are becoming increasingly important. Regulators want to see them in annual reports and organisations now want to prove to their stakeholders and society at large that they are not damaging the environment and the communities they work in. In fact most organisations want to show that they are reducing their footprint, and many want to actively improve the environments and communities they impact.\n\n\nESG metrics are not always easy to measure and its often difficult to correlate actions with impact.  In this course I  explore environmental, social, and governance performance measurement and how monitoring ESG performance can contribute, in some small way, to saving lives and habitats and improving the state of this planet of ours.\n\n\nTopics covered include:\n- Why ESG indicators are important\n- Current sustainability reporting standards\n- The main ESG investment ratings\n- The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n- Planetary Boundaries\n- Input, Output and Impact Measures\n- The World Economic Forum ESG metrics\n- The most important environmental, social and governance metrics\n- How to select appropriate ESG indicators for your organisation\n- Analysing and improving ESG performance\n- Calculating an organisation's greenhouse gas emissions\n\n\nLet's go on an ESG journey.

      "description": "This course will guide you on what optimization is and what metaheuristics are. You will learn why we use metaheuristics in optimization problems as sometimes, when you have a complex problem you'd like to optimize, deterministic methods will not do; you will not be able to reach the best and optimal solution to your problem, therefore, metaheuristics should be used.\nThis course covers information on metaheuristics and four widely used techniques which are:\nSimulated Annealing\nGenetic Algorithm\nTabu Search\nEvolutionary Strategies\nBy the end of this course, you will learn what Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search, and Evolutionary Strategies are, why they are used, how they work, and best of all, how to code them in Python! With no packages and no libraries, learn to code them from scratch!! You will also learn how to handle constraints using the penalty method.\nHere's the awesome part --> you do NOT need to know Python programming!\nThis course will teach you how to optimize continuous and combinatorial problems using Python\nWhere every single line of code is explained thoroughly\nThe code is written in a simple manner that you will understand how things work and how to code the algorithms even with zero knowledge in Python\nBasically, you can think of this as not only a course that teaches you 4 well known metaheuristics, but also Python programming!\nPlease feel free to ask me any question! Don't like the course? Ask for a 30-day refund!!\n\n\nReal Testaments -->\n1) \"I can say that this is the best course I've had on Udemy ! Dana is a very good instructor. She not only explains the problems and the coding, but also reassures you and remove the fears you might have when learning complex concepts. For someone with a business background, this topic was close to a nightmare ! I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in learning about Metaheuristics. Again, big THANK YOU Dana ! :)\" -- Logistics Knowledge Bank, 5 star rating\n2) \"I am half way through the course. What I learnt so far is far beyond what I expected. What I really liked is the applicability of the examples to real world problems. The most exciting feature in the course is the hands on, what you learn will be implemented in python and you can follow every single step. If you did not understand, the instructor is there to help. I even felt like it is a one to one course. Thanks a lot to the instructor.\" -- Ali, 5 star rating\n3) \"The best introduction to Metaheuristics bar none. Best value course on Udemy. I love that we cover a bit of theory and code the actual algorithm itself. The course doesn't just give you some package to use but presents you with code very easy to follow. The code is not optimized or written for maximum performance but for maximum readability. This means you can play around with it once you really understand it and speed it up. Thank you Dana for this amazing course. It has given me the confidence to code my own slightly more advanced algorithms from Sean Luke's book: Essential Metaheuristics. I feel the two are great companions.\" -- Dylan, 5 star rating\n4) \"It is a great introduction to Metaheuristics. The course deserves five stars for the overall information on this topic. The instructor is talented and knowledgeable about the optimization problems. I recommend the course for someone looking to solve an optimization problem.\" -- Abdulaziz, 5 star rating\n5) \"I still not finished the course, but until now, I am really satisfied with I've seen. THEORETICAL EXPLANATIONS: Dana is very didactic, before presenting the code she always briefly present the theory in a simple way, much easier to understand than books and journal papers explanations. Of course, it is necessary to complement this with other materials, but if you already have a theoretical base, it is just great! Dana, I loved your explanation about crossover and mutation! FOR BEGINNERS IN PYTHON: I am a beginner in Python and even in programming, so Dana's code helped me a lot to understand the meaning of each step and variable since she wrote a very readable code. GOOD TIME-MANAGEMENT: Dana presents the code already done but she explains what she has done in each step. Thus, in 5 minutes we can learn a lot, without being bored. I prefer this way of doing because I've done courses with teachers that do the code during the classes and we waste a lot of time fixing errors and bugs. She is objective and efficient on teaching, I like that. There are things not totally clear to me on courses, so I ask questions to Dana. She takes some days to give us an answer, but she replies anyway. I would appreciate an example of constraint handling for combinatorial problems.\" -- Rachel, 4.5 star rating\n6) \"Nice course that really does explain Metaheuristics in a very practical way. Highly recommended!\" -- David, 5 star rating",

      "description": "The problem\nMost data analyst, data science, and coding courses miss a critical practical step. They don’t teach you how to work with raw data, how to clean, and preprocess it. This creates a sizeable gap between the skills you need on the job and the abilities you have acquired in training. Truth be told, real-world data is messy, so you need to know how to overcome this obstacle to become an independent data professional.\nThe bootcamps we have seen online and even live classes neglect this aspect and show you how to work with ‘clean’ data. But this isn’t doing you a favour. In reality, it will set you back both when you are applying for jobs, and when you’re on the job.\nThe solution\nOur goal is to provide you with complete preparation. And this course will turn you into a job-ready data analyst. To take you there, we will cover the following fundamental topics extensively.\nTheory about the field of data analytics\nBasic Python\nAdvanced Python\nNumPy\nPandas\nWorking with text files\nData collection\nData cleaning\nData preprocessing\nData visualization\nFinal practical example\nEach of these subjects builds on the previous ones. And this is precisely what makes our curriculum so valuable. Everything is shown in the right order and we guarantee that you are not going to get lost along the way, as we have provided all necessary steps in video (not a single one skipped). In other words, we are not going to teach you how to analyse data before you know how to gather and clean it.\nSo, to prepare you for the entry-level job that leads to a data science position - data analyst - we created The Data Analyst Course.\nThis is a rather unique training program because it teaches the fundamentals you need on the job. A frequently neglected aspect of vital importance.\nMoreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course provides complete preparation for someone who wants to become a data analyst at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save). We believe that this resource will significantly boost your chances of landing a job, as it will prepare you for practical tasks and concepts that are frequently included in interviews.\nThe topics we will cover\n1. Theory about the field of data analytics\n2. Basic Python\n3. Advanced Python\n4. NumPy\n5. Pandas\n6. Working with text files\n7. Data collection\n8. Data cleaning\n9. Data preprocessing\n10. Data visualization\n11. Final practical example\n\n\n1. Theory about the field of data analytics\nHere we will focus on the big picture. But don’t imagine long boring pages with terms you’ll have to check up in a dictionary every minute. Instead, this is where we want to define who a data analyst is, what they do, and how they create value for an organization.\nWhy learn it?\nYou need a general understanding to appreciate how every part of the course fits in with the rest of the content. As they say, if you know where you are going, chances are that you will eventually get there. And since data analyst and other data jobs are relatively new and constantly evolving, we want to provide you with a good grasp of the data analyst role specifically. Then, in the following chapters, we will teach you the actual tools you need to become a data analyst.\n2. Basic Python\nThis course is centred around Python. So, we’ll start from the very basics. Don’t be afraid if you do not have prior programming experience.\nWhy learn it?\nYou need to learn a programming language to take full advantage of the data-rich world we live in. Unless you are equipped with such a skill, you will always be dependent on other people’s ability to extract and manipulate data, and you want to be independent while doing analysis, right? Also, you don’t necessarily need to learn many programming languages at once. It is enough to be very skilled at just one, and we’ve naturally chosen Python which has established itself as the number one language for data analysis and data science (thanks to its rich libraries and versatility).\n3. Advanced Python\nWe will introduce advanced Python topics such as working with text data and using tools such as list comprehensions and anonymous functions.\nWhy learn it?\nThese lessons will turn you into a proficient Python user who is independent on the job. You will be able to use Python’s core strengths to your advantage. So, here it is not just about the topics, it is also about the depth in which we explore the most relevant Python tools.\n4. NumPy\nNumPy is Python’s fundamental package for scientific computing. It has established itself as the go-to tool when you need to compute mathematical and statical operations.\nWhy learn it?\nA large portion of a data analyst’s work is dedicated to preprocessing datasets. Unquestionably, this involves tons of mathematical and statistical techniques that NumPy is renowned for. In addition, the package introduces multi-dimensional array structures and provides a plethora of built-in functions and methods to use while working with them. In other words, NumPy can be described as a computationally stable state-of-the-art Python instrument that provides flexibility and can take your analysis to the next level.\n5. Pandas\nThe pandas library is one of the most popular Python tools that facilitate data manipulation and analysis. It is very valuable because you can use it to manipulate all sorts of information - numerical tables and time series data, as well as text.\nWhy learn it?\nPandas is the other main tool an analyst needs to clean and preprocess the data they are working with. Its data manipulation features are second to none in Python because of the diversity and richness it provides in terms of methods and functions. The combined ability to work with both NumPy and pandas is extremely powerful as the two libraries complement each other. You need to be capable to operate with both to produce a complete and consistent analysis independently.\n6. Working with text files\nExchanging information with text files is practically how we exchange information today. In this part of the course, we will use the Python, pandas, and NumPy tools learned earlier to give you the essentials you need when importing or saving data.\nWhy learn it?\nIn many courses, you are just given a dataset to practice your analytical and programming skills. However, we don’t want to close our eyes to reality, where converting a raw dataset from an external file into a workable Python format can be a massive challenge.\n7. Data collection\nIn the real world, you don’t always have the data readily available for you. In this part of the course, you will learn how to retrieve data from an API.\nWhy learn it?\nYou need to know how to source your data, right? To be a well-rounded analyst you must be able to collect data from outside sources. This is rarely a one-click process. This section aims at providing you with all the necessary tools to do that on your own.\n8. Data cleaning\nThe next logical step is to clean your data. This is where you will apply the pandas skills acquired earlier in practice. All lessons throughout the course have a real-world perspective.\nWhy learn it?\nA large part of a data analyst’s job in the real world involves cleaning data and preparing it for the actual analysis. You can’t expect that you’ll deal with flawless data sources, right? So, it will be up to you to overcome this stage and clean your data.\n9. Data preprocessing\nEven when your dataset is clean and in an understandable shape, it isn’t quite ready to be processed for visualizations and analysis just yet. There is a crucial step in between, and that’s data preprocessing.\nWhy learn it?\nData preprocessing is where a data analyst can demonstrate how good or great they are at their job. This stage of the work requires the ability to choose the right statistical tool that will improve the quality of your dataset and the knowledge to implement it with advanced pandas and NumPy techniques. Only when you’ve completed this step can you say that your dataset is preprocessed and ready for the next part, which is data visualization.\n10. Data visualization\nData visualization is the face of data. Many people look at the data and see nothing. The reason for that is that they are not creating good visualizations. Or even worse – they are creating nice graphs but cannot interpret them accurately.\nWhy learn it?\nThis part of the course will teach you how to use your data to produce meaningful insights. At the end of the day, data charts are what conveys the most information in the shortest amount of time. And nothing speaks better than a well crafted and meaningful data visualization.\n11. Practical example\nThe course contains plenty of exercises and practical cases. In the end, we have included a comprehensive practical example that will show you how everything you have learned along the way comes nicely together. This is where you will be able to appreciate how far you have come in your journey to becoming a data analyst and starting your data career.\nWhat you get\nA program worth $1,250\nActive Q&A support\nAll the knowledge to become a data analyst\nA community of aspiring data analysts\nA certificate of completion\nAccess to frequent future updates\nReal-world training\nGet ready to become a data analyst from scratch\nWhy wait?

In the first part, students are introduced to the theory behind linear regression. The theory is explained in an intuitive way. No math is involved other than a few equations in which addition and subtraction are used. The purpose of this part of the course is for students to understand what linear regression is and when it is used. Students will learn the differences between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. They will be able to understand the output of linear regression, test model accuracy and assumptions. Students will also learn how to include different types of variables in the model, such as categorical variables and quadratic variables. All this theory is explained in the slides, which are made available to the students, as well as in the e-book that is freely available for students who enroll in the course.\nIn the second part of the course, students will learn how to apply what they learned using Stata. In this part, students will use Stata to fit multiple regression models, produce graphs that describe model fit and assumptions, and to use variable specific commands that will make the output more readable. This part assumed very basic knowledge of Stata.",

You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of getting your feet wet in Tableau and Data Science (even if you are not interested in this, you should seriously consider so since in the next 10-15 years, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence will be everywhere).\nI have learned over 14 programming languages such as JAVA, Python, C++, R, Matlab, Ruby, CSS, HTML, Angular JS, Java Script as well as other . I have also had a successful freelancing career programming software and mobile applications and well as working as a finance data analyst. Since technology is changing every day, it is adding new realms of complexity to data science than is already out there. It is getting exponentially harder for new people to learn and navigate the immense amount of data science aspects. My job in this course is to demyistify Tableau and Data Analysis so you can see a clear road to success as a Tableau Data analyst.\n\nThis course serves to help you navigate Tableau and know what this seemingly difficult concept really is. In this course, I cover what it is like to be a data analyst, what are some jobs of data analysts, what are the sorts of super powers you can possess by learning Tableau Data, and also what resources you will need on your path to development as a Tableau Data Analyst. My hope is to transform you in 4-5 lectures from being a novice to data and what is possible with Tableau to being someone who has a clear idea of whether he/she is interested in Tableau and what path they can take to further their knowledge and harness the POWER of Tableau.\n\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of Tableau I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how you can start learning how to dominate data analytics and how you can supercharge your business, marketing, or client with your superb analytics skills.",

      "description": "Updates:\nNovember 2024: All Python tutorials have been remade and are up to date.\nEconometrics has horrible fame. The complex theorems, combined with boring classes where it feels like you are learning Greek, give every student nightmares. This course stays away from that. It will focus on (1) giving you the intuition and tools to apply the techniques learned, (2) making sure everything that you learn is actionable in your career, and (3) offer you a tool kit of peer-reviewed econometric causal inference techniques that will make you stand out and give you the ability to answer the tough questions.\nWHY ECONOMETRICS AND CAUSAL INFERENCE FOR BUSINESS IN R AND Python?\nIn each section, you will learn a new technique. The learning process is split into three parts. The first is an overview of Use Cases. Drawing from business literature and my own experience, I will show examples where each Econometric technique has been applied. The goal here is to show that Econometric methods are actionable. The second part is the Intuition tutorials. The aim is for you to understand why the technique makes sense. All intuition tutorials are based on business situations. The last part is the Practice tutorials, where we will code and solve a business or economic problem. There will be at least one practice tutorial per section.\nBelow are 4 points on why this course is not only relevant but also stands out from others.\n1| THOROUGH COURSE STRUCTURE OF MOST IMPACTFUL ECONOMETRIC TECHNIQUES\nThe techniques in this course are the ones I believe will be most impactful in your career. Like HR, Marketing, Finance, or Operations, all company departments can use these causal techniques. Here is the list:\nDifference-in-differences\nGoogle's Causal Impact\nGranger Causality\nPropensity Score Matching\nCHAID\n2| BUSINESS EXAMPLES TO FOSTER INTUITION\nEach section starts with an overview of business cases and studies where each econometric technique has been used. I will use examples that come from my own professional experience and business literature. The aim is to give you the intuition where to apply them in your current job. By the end of each intuition tutorial, you will be able to easily explain the concepts to your colleagues, manager, and stakeholders.\nOne of the benefits of giving actual business problems as examples is that you will find similar or even equal issues in your current company. In turn, this enables you to apply what you have learned immediately. Here are some examples:\nImpact of M&A on companies.\nUnderstanding how weather influences sales.\nMeasuring the impact of brand campaigns.\nWhether Influencer or Social Media Marketing results in sales.\nInvestigating the drivers of customer satisfaction.\n3| CHALLENGING AND INTERESTING PROBLEMS TO APPLY WHAT YOU LEARNED\nFor each section, we will have at least one real business or economic dataset. We will apply what we learned during the intuition tutorials.\nHere are some examples of problems we will solve and code together:\nMeasuring the impact of the Cambridge Analytica Scandal on Facebook's stock price.\nAssessing the results of giving training to employees.\nChallenge the idea that increasing the minimum wage decreases employment.\nRanking the drivers on why people quit their jobs.\nSolving the thousand-year-old riddle of who came first: \"Chicken or the egg?\".\n4| HANDS-ON CODING\nWe will code together, in R and Python. In every single practice tutorial, we will start from scratch, building the code line by line. As also an online coding student, I feel this has been the easiest way to learn.\nOn top, the code will be built so that you download it and apply the causal inference techniques in your work and projects. Additionally, I will explain what you have to change to use in your dataset and solve the problem you have at hand.\nEconometrics for Business in R and Python is a course that naturally extends into your career.\n***SUMMARY\nThe course is packed with use cases, intuition tutorials, hands-on coding, and, most importantly, is actionable in your career.\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions, and I hope to see you inside!\nDiogo",

Students also have the option to apply for free, optional, extra Lean (Six Sigma) examination and certification/badge + official credits. This external, free and optional examination/certification occurs outside the Udemy platform, requires registration (name, email and a link to your relevant Udemy certificate) and is offered by SSAA (Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam) which is an independent, academic-run training and certification institute with dual accreditation: (UK CPD and Dutch higher education BKO).\n\n\nCertified Data Analytics Expert With Minitab | Accredited\nFor this course we use Minitab version 21, but other Minitab versions are perfectly acceptable.Students can download a free Minitab trial version from the software provider's website if they need access to the newest version of Minitab.\nThe Minitab software is intended for data analysis. These days, everyone, in every sector, needs data analysis skills.  Why? Look around you. Data is probably one of the most valuable commodities now, which makes data analysis a valuable skill. But not everyone has a math or statistics background. This is where Minitab comes to the rescue. Minitab is a surprisingly user friendly software that will allow the broad public to master data analysis and handle complicated statistics with surprising ease. Compared to MS Excel, Minitab allows for much faster and much deeper data analysis.\nIn this Minitab data analysis course, we will not just teach you how to press buttons in Minitab and generate statistics. We will actually make a seasoned data science professional out of you who has a good understanding of data science theory, even if you have little to no math or statistics background. This Minitab course is designed and taught by university lecturers who have decades of experience teaching data analysis to a wide audience, ranging from engineers to psychologists. This Minitab data analysis course starts at the bottom and gradually makes you an expert in data analysis with Minitab. No prior experience with statistics or general data science is needed.\n\n\nThis is what we are going to learn:\n\n\nBasic and advanced statistics with Minitab\nStandard deviation\nInterquartile range\nConfidence interval\nHypothesis testing (comparing groups) with Minitab\n1 way ANOVA\nChi square test of association\nTwo sample T test\nMann Whitney U test\nKruskal Wallis test\n1 Sample hypothesis testing with Minitab\nChi square goodness of fit\n1 sample sign test\n1 sample Wilcoxon\n1 sample T test\nGraphs with Minitab\nBox plot (box and whisker)\nLine graph\nScatter plot\nBar chart\nPareto chart\nPie chart\nCorrelation with Minitab\nSpearman rank\nPearson\nRegression with Minitab\nSingle\nMultiple\nWe have trained and certified over 150,000 students across the world and we are known for the teaching method which is effective and will make you understand the theory quickly and with minimal effort. We hope to welcome you on board. Thanks for considering us.\n\n\nSix Sigma Academy Amsterdam [SSAA]\nSSAA was set up by a number of university lecturers from Holland as an alternative to offline education at universities. When we set it up, the goal was to:\nOffer the same quality BKO/BKE accredited (globally accepted) education as in Dutch universities by basing it on Dutch higher education BKO/BKE standards. We have certified 100,000+ students in 170+ countries based on those standards.\nMake the training and certification program extremely efficient. We do not have any 'stuffing.' We do not needlessly repeat. We use effective examples so you understand data sciences concepts the first time, without the need to repeat. That is why our Minitab training is relatively short and respects your time.\nMake the training and certification affordable.\nUpon completing this course, you earn 15 official CPD credits which is equal to 15 PDUs if you are trying to maintain a PMI license.\n\n\nTeam SSAA (Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam)",

This course will help the novice SAS user bridge the gap between beginner and advanced programmer.\nMy goal is that at the end of the course, you will not only know and understand Macro Language, but also know to implement it in your programs. Therefore this course includes a lot of assignments. This will allow you to practice and to gain experience. I put a strong emphasis on practice.\nAll the code programmed during the course can be downloaded. However, i recommend and suggest you to write the code independently, so you can understand it in depth\nI divided the course into four sections. First section is Introduction. It includes lectures such as Installation & Familiarity with SAS University Edition and Introduction to SAS Macro. As you will see, SAS Macro consist of two basic elements : macro variables and macros. So in the second section, we will learn macro variables and n the third section we will learn macros. The last section is Conclusions.\nIf you have any questions about the material, suggestions or ideas how to improve the course, i would be very happy to hear them. Guys, don't hesitate to ask the questions. I will answer any of them.\nI sincerely hope you will enjoy the course, and i promise that your programming level will increase significantly!\nYour Instructor",

      "description": "Do you want to know how to handle time series in Tableau?\nDo you want to use Tableaus forecasting feature to get great visualizations?\nOr you probably want to know how to add extra forecasting features like ARIMA models to Tableau?\nTime based data has its own rules and implications. We will discuss these in Tableau. Quite often time series data is used to look into the future. Forecasting is the name of the game here. Luckily Tableau offers an exponential smoothing forecasting tool, which we will of course explore.\nSometimes you might find that Tableau's internal forecasting tools are too limited. Well, for these instances I will show you how to integrate the R forecast package into Tableau to do ARIMA modeling. This whole process is so well implemented that it can be done without prior R knowledge. In one of the last sections I will show you how it’s done, step by step.\nSo what are you going to learn in the course?\nWe start with the general knowledge you need to work with time series data. Especially data roles. We will then discuss moving averages which are widely used in time series analysis. And we will do some time based filtering. We will of course write our own functions, we will create parameters and you will also learn about the time based functions Tableau has to offer. Each of these things will be enforced with exercises.\nThat is the first section, after that we will be forecasting with Tableau, that means exponential smoothing. I will show you how to read the results you get and how to manually modify the forecast settings.\nThat is one way of forecasting in Tableau, but there is an advanced alternative. You can use R from within Tableau to perform advanced forecast modeling as we will learn in the last section of the course.\nSo how do you best prepare for this course?\nWell, I built the course for people who already know a bit about Tableau. You should be able to get data into Tableau and to orient yourself in the interface. You should know the basics already. That way we can focus on time series and forecasting and we do not waste precious time on basic things you might already know.\nYou do not need R skills, although it is an advantage. The methods outlined in the last section are explained in a way so that you can follow along easily.\nI hope you will enjoy this course - do not forget to add it to your CV, so that human resources knows that you train yourself on the latest technologies. Valuable skills are definitely a career booster.",

      "description": "In this course three goals are pursued: 1- Learning Scenario Analysis and it's technics including but limited to Monte Carlo Simulation 2- Learning Microsoft Excel's scenario Analysis tools 3- and learning business analytics formula and parameters that are applicable in all business contexts and are essential for anyone involved in business, economics, and finance.\n\n\nScenario Analysis is a powerful planning and management technic to deal with various possible futures and make sure to achieve an acceptable outcome under different scenarios. This technic is used in business, finance, economics, politics, negotiations, and even military operations. The main argument of this technic is that when outlining a plan, our assumptions can change due to unpredicted events and therefore the outcomes can change. For this reasons, we need to count in different scenarios (through changes in assumptions) and study their impact on the outcomes. Essentially, scenario analysis is a method of dealing with randomness in life.\n\n\nAn advance technic of dealing with randomness is called Monte Carlo Simulation, which uses random sampling to predict and forecast future outcomes under numerous random scenarios. In this course, students will learn this powerful technic and learn how to implement a sample Monte Carlo Simulation using Microsoft Excel creatively.  Also, Microsoft Excel Provides various powerful tools for scenario analysis including Goal Seek, Data Tables, Scenario Manager, and Solver.\n\n\nIn this course after learning the Scenario Analysis concept and applications, students first learn how to analyze and calculate profit and cost (including fixed and variable cost), how to calculate the Break Even volume, and how to form an Income Statement using Microsoft Excel. While calculating these important business metrics, students learn how to set up excel sheets to be ready for further scenario analyses. Then using excel tools such as Goal Seek, Data Table, and Solver, students implement some scenario analyses to achieve certain desired outcomes. Monte Carlo Simulation is offered at the end of the course as an advanced bonus for curious minds.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nMy name is Mohammad Habibi. I have a Ph.D. in business and have taught in various programs including undergrad and graduate (MBA) courses in different parts of the world such as US, Canada, Malaysia, and Iran. My teaching style is quick and to the point and I believe learning will occur while doing. If you have any questions please send me an email or connect with through LinkedIn.",

I recently finished a PhD at Cambridge University (Tropical Ecology and Conservation).\nI have several years of experience in analyzing real-life data from different sources using data science-related techniques and producing publications for international peer-reviewed journals.\nOver the course of my research, I realized almost all the Python data science courses and books out there do not account for the multidimensional nature of the topic and use data science interchangeably with machine learning..\nThis gives students an incomplete knowledge of the subject. My course, on the other hand, will give you a robust grounding in all aspects of data science within the Tensorflow framework.\nUnlike other Python courses, we dig deep into the statistical modelling features of Tensorflow & Keras and give you a one-of-a-kind grounding in these frameworks!\nDISCOVER 8 COMPLETE SECTIONS ADDRESSING EVERY ASPECT OF PYTHON BASED KERAS DATA SCIENCE:\n• A full introduction to Python Data Science and powerful Python driven framework for data science, Anaconda\n• Getting started with Jupyter notebooks for implementing data science techniques in Python\n• A comprehensive presentation about Keras installation and a brief introduction to the other Python data science packages\n• Brief introduction to the working of Pandas and Numpy\n• The basics of the Keras syntax\n• Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning in the Keras frameworks\n• You’ll even discover how to create artificial neural networks and deep learning structures with Keras\nBUT,  WAIT! THIS ISN'T JUST ANY OTHER DATA SCIENCE COURSE:\nYou’ll start by absorbing the most valuable Python Keras basics and techniques.\nI use easy-to-understand, hands-on methods to simplify and address even the most difficult concepts.\nMy course will help you implement the methods using real data obtained from different sources. Many courses use made-up data that does not empower students to implement Python-based data science in real -life.\nAfter taking this course, you’ll easily use packages like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to work with real data in Python along with gaining fluency in Keras. I will even introduce you to deep learning models such as Convolution Neural network (CNN) !!\nThe underlying motivation for the course is to ensure you can apply Python-based data science on real data into practice today, start analyzing data for your own projects whatever your skill level, and impress your potential employers with actual examples of your data science abilities.\nThis course will take students without a prior Python and/or statistics background from a basic level to performing some of the most common advanced data science techniques using the powerful Python-based Jupyter notebooks\nIt is a practical, hands-on course, i.e. we will spend some time dealing with some of the theoretical concepts related to data science. However, the majority of the course will focus on implementing different techniques on real data and interpret the results..\nAfter each video, you will learn a new concept or technique which you may apply to your own projects!\nJOIN THE COURSE NOW!",

The course starts with an introductory view of key concepts such as aggregation, pivot tables, calculated fields, data blending and then dives into real-world projects, including:\nProject 1: Create a User Journey Funnel with Google Analytics\nProject 2: Create a device breakdown visualization with user-level data\nNEW* Dashboard Building Challenge: Create a dashboard in 10 minutes and get feedback from the instructor and/or your fellow students! (Assignment)\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to:\nUse  and understand all chart types throughout the course (Bullets, Pie Charts, Scorecards, Scatter plot and etc.)\nConnect and blend data sources from Google Analytics and Google Sheets\nCreate custom dimensions with conditional expressions (CASE + REGEXP_MATCH + IN)\nBuild a user journey funnel with Google Analytics data based on a \"Page Title\" dimension\nCreate a device breakdown visualization and explore user-level data with scatter plot (eCommerece)\nCreate a Google BigQuery table based on a specific SQL query and visualize it in Looker Studio, formerly Google Data Studio\nCreate time series with rolling dates and interaction filters\nConfigure Gauge charts to track performance against a specific goal or KPI\nAutomate reports with advanced date selection filters\nUnderstand the access levels in Looker Studio - \"Owner\" vs \"Viewer\"\nApply conditional formatting rules to signal data anomalies\nExtract a report theme and colour scheme from an image in Looker Studio, formerly Google Data Studio\nApply IF statements within a CASE and use operators\n\n\nWhat are the students who took the course saying?\n\n\n\"The pace of the course was great and I was able to follow along with all the exercises using the provided data files and Google Analytics demo account\" - Tricia\n\n\n\"The course is fantastic. The instructor was clear and on-point when it came to the content. Lachezar took me from a complete beginner to someone who can actually build dashboards and understand how DS works.\nI was blown away by how relatively short the video content was compared to the value I received - if you go beyond what's instructed and dive deep to recreate every single step (and dashboard) presented in this course yourself, it'll take you easily 10-15 hours of work to do.\nThis is a no fluff course, updated, with great support from the instructor - I urge you to go for it.\" - Roi\n\n\n\"This course has been very very done, clear and insightful.

This team has decades of practical experience in quant trading, analytics and e-commerce.\n\nYour bodyguard for when data gets too big, this course is strong but friendly, funny yet deep, animated yet thoughtful.\nLet’s parse that.\n\nYour bodyguard for when data gets too big: Most business folks (and quite a few engineers) use Excel as a basic tool of decision making and modeling, but when you can't fit the data you'd like into an Excel spreadsheet that you can easily open, its time to move to a database.\nThe course is strong but friendly: This course will help you move to a database without being intimidated by the new environment. Don't let anyone tell you that any dataset is too large or too complicated for you to understand (and people will try, most likely)\nThe course is funny yet deep: It goes really deep into the topics that folks often find hard to understand, such as joins, aggregate operators and interfacing with databases from a programming language. But it never takes itself too seriously:-)\nThe course is very visual : most of the techniques are explained with the help of animations to help you understand better.\n\nThis course is practical as well : Queries are explained in excruciating detail, indices are demystified, and potentially career-limiting traps (Drop, Alter) are marked with bright yellow tape markers so you can steer clear.\n\nThe course is also quirky. The examples are irreverent. Lots of little touches: repetition, zooming out so we remember the big picture, active learning with plenty of quizzes. There’s also a peppy soundtrack, and art - all shown by studies to improve cognition and recall.\nWhat's Covered:\nSQL In Great Depth\n\nDatabase Fundamentals and Just Enough Theory\nPractical Examples - Queries in MySQL and SQLite, and code in Python",

      "description": "Data science and Marketing are two of the key driving forces that help companies create value and maintain an edge in today’s fast-paced economy.\nWelcome to…\nCustomer Analytics in Python – the place where marketing and data science meet!\nThis course offers a unique opportunity to acquire a rare and extremely valuable skill set.\n\n\nWhat will you learn in this course?\nThis course is packed with knowledge, covering some of the most exciting methods used by companies, all implemented in Python.Customer Analytics is a broad field, so we've divided this course into five distinct parts, each highlighting different strengths and challenges within the analytical process.\nHere are the five major parts:\n1. We will introduce you to the relevant theory that you need to start performing customer analytics\nWe have kept this part as short as possible in order to provide you with more practical experience. Nonetheless, this is the place where marketing beginners will learn about the marketing fundamentals and the reasons why we take advantage of certain models throughout the course.\n2. Then we will perform cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction to help you segment your customers\nBecause this course is based in Python, we will be working with several popular packages - NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn. In terms of clustering, we will show both hierarchical and flat clustering techniques, ultimately focusing on the K-means algorithm. Along the way, we will visualize the data appropriately to build your understanding of the methods even further. When it comes to dimensionality reduction, we will employ Principal Components Analysis (PCA) once more through the scikit-learn (sklearn) package. Finally, we’ll combine the two models to reach an even better insight about our customers. And, of course, we won’t forget about model deployment which we’ll implement through the pickle package.\n3. The third step consists in applying Descriptive statistics as the exploratory part of your analysis\nOnce segmented, customers’ behavior will require some interpretation. And there is nothing more intuitive than obtaining the descriptive statistics by brand and by segment and visualizing the findings. It is that part of the course, where you will have the ‘Aha!’ effect. Through the descriptive analysis, we will form our hypotheses about our segments, thus ultimately setting the ground for the subsequent modeling.\n4. After that, we will be ready to engage with elasticity modeling for purchase probability, brand choice, and purchase quantity\nIn most textbooks, you will find elasticities calculated as static metrics depending on price and quantity. But the concept of elasticity is in fact much broader. We will explore it in detail by calculating purchase probability elasticity, brand choice own price elasticity, brand choice cross-price elasticity, and purchase quantity elasticity. We will employ linear regressions and logistic regressions, once again implemented through the sklearn library. We implement state-of-the-art research on the topic to make sure that you have an edge over your peers. While we focus on about 20 different models, you will have the chance to practice with more than 100 different variations of them, all providing you with additional insights!\n5. Finally, we’ll leverage the power of Deep Learning to predict future behavior\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are at the forefront of the data science revolution. That’s why we could not help but include it in this course. We will take advantage of the TensorFlow 2.0 framework to create a feedforward neural network (also known as artificial neural network). This is the part where we will build a black-box model, essentially helping us reach 90%+ accuracy in our predictions about the future behavior of our customers.\n\n\nAn Extraordinary Teaching Collective\nWe at 365 Careers have 3,000,000+ students here on Udemy and believe that the best education requires two key ingredients: remarkable teachers and a practical approach.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\nWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\nYou can divide your learning process into 4 parts:\nStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\nUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\nProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\nUnderstanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\nWhy use Python for data Machine Learning?\nUnderstanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.\nThough it hasn’t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here’s a brief history:\nIn 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.\nIn 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets’s annual poll of data scientists’ most used tools.\nIn 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.\nMachine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it’s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.\nWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\nPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\nDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.",

      "description": "Do you think you need to learn new software to perform data analysis, statistics, simulations? You don't! Everything you need to get started in the world of data analytics is already on your computer in the wonderful application called Excel.\nThis course will first acquaint you with the Excel environment including how to use simple and complex functions, hot-key shortcuts and navigation tips to make sure you work efficiently and effectively. From there, I lead you in lectures and practice exercises on the fundamental topics of data analytics.\n\nData Visualizations - Visualizing data is an important part in analyzing data as well as presenting and explaining what it means. Lectures in this course Included how to craft and use bar charts, line charts, radial charts, histograms, box and whisker charts, pie charts, conditional formatting and Sparklines.\nPivot Tables - Pivot Tables are very powerful, simple to use tools built into excel. The lectures will include how to structure data to get the most out of pivot tables, and then a few use cases including root cause analysis, comparative analysis, along with other visualization tools specific to pivot tables.\nStatistics - The Statistics module is by far the most densely packed module in this course. As a statistician by training, I present a deep dive into the data behind the statistics and how to use different statistical tests based on different circumstances. The module is filled with different lectures and exercises involving ANOVA tests, T Tests, Chi-Squared Tests, Tests for Normality, Regression Analysis and more.\nForecasting - Organizations have to be able to anticipate the future. The forecasting tools presented in this course help us accomplish this feat. Forecasting is presented in two different ways - Factor forecasting and Time Series forecasting. For each approach to forecasting, many tools and techniques are introduced and reviewed including Regression analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, Simple Moving Averages, and Auto-Regressive techniques.\nExcel Tools - Excel has a lot of useful tools that don't quite fit neatly into any of the other modules. The last module of this course explores the use cases of using these tools. In particular, several archetypal problems are introduced and solved using the miscellaneous data analysis tools found in excel, including Excel Solver.",

This course covers behavioral characteristics such as personal accountability, trustworthiness, adaptability, and organization and time management. We'll also look at various areas of business knowledge that are important to business analysis. Finally, we'll talk about some of the tools and technology that business analysts use on the job.\nBusiness Analysis Perspectives (IIBA - ECBA) covers five different perspectives from which business analysis may need to view their work. Perspectives are used within business analysis to provide focus for the tasks you will carry out. They'll also come with a set of techniques that are specific to the context of the change initiative. The perspectives we'll look at include agile development, business intelligence, information technology, business architecture, and business process management.\nThis course is part of the Business Analysis Certification Program which includes 14 courses.

      "description": "Complete Python Based Image Processing and Computer Vision With Conventional Techniques, Data Science and Deep Learning\nTHIS IS A COMPLETE PYTHON-BASED IMAGE PROCESSING & COMPUTER VISION COURSE !\nIt is a full  Python-based image processing and computer vision boot camp that will help you implement basic image processing and computer vision tasks using Jupyter Notebooks.\nHERE IS WHY YOU SHOULD ENROLL IN THIS COURSE:\nThis course is your complete guide to practical image processing and computer vision tasks using Python..\nThis means, this course covers the important aspects of Keras and Tensorflow (Google's powerful Deep Learning framework) and if you take this course, you can do away with taking other courses or buying books on Python Tensorflow and Keras based data science.\nIn this age of big data, companies across the globe use Python to sift through the avalanche of information at their disposal and advent of Tensorflow and Keras is revolutionizing Deep Learning...\nBy gaining proficiency in Keras and and Tensorflow, you can give your company a competitive edge and boost your career to the next level.\nTHIS IS MY PROMISE TO YOU: COMPLETE THIS ONE COURSE & BECOME A PRO IN PRACTICAL KERAS & TENSORFLOW BASED DATA SCIENCE!\nBut first things first. My name is Minerva Singh and I am an Oxford University MPhil (Geography and Environment) graduate. I recently finished a PhD at Cambridge University (Tropical Ecology and Conservation).\nI have several years of experience in analyzing real life data from different sources  using data science related techniques and producing publications for international peer reviewed journals.\nOver the course of my research I realized almost all the Python data science courses and books out there do not account for the multidimensional nature of the topic and use data science interchangeably with machine learning..\nThis gives students an incomplete knowledge of the subject. My course, on the other hand, will give you a robust grounding in all aspects of data science within the Tensorflow framework.\nUnlike other courses, we dig deep into both the conventional and data science-centric image processing and computer vision tasks! After learning the most important image processing and computer vision tasks, you will learn to implement both machine learning and deep learning techniques in a hands-on manner. You will be exposed to real life data and learn how to implement and evaluate the performance of the different data science packages, including Keras.\nDISCOVER 8 COMPLETE SECTIONS ADDRESSING EVERY ASPECT OF PYTHON BASED IMAGE PROCESSING & COMPUTER VISION\n• Detailed introduction to using the powerful Python driven framework for data science Anaconda for image processing and computer vision tasks\n• Jargon-free introduction to the relevant theoretical concepts\n• Detailed introduction to installing and using the relevant packages including tensor flow and Keras\n• Implement Machine Learning algorithms, (both Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning ) on real life image data\n• You’ll even discover how to create artificial neural networks and deep learning structures to implement on imagery data with Tensorflow & Keras\n• Introduction to transfer learning\n\n\nBUT,  WAIT! THIS ISN'T JUST ANY OTHER DATA SCIENCE COURSE:\nYou’ll start by absorbing the most commonly used image processing and computer vision basics and techniques.\nI use easy-to-understand, hands-on methods to simplify and address even the most difficult concepts. This means you get a jargon free introduction to the much-needed theoretical concepts\nMy course will help you implement the methods using real imagery data obtained from different sources. Many courses use made-up data that does not empower students to implement Python based image processing in real -life.\nAfter taking this course, you’ll easily use image processing and computer vision packages such as OpenCV along with gaining fluency in Tensorflow and Keras. I will even introduce you to deep learning models such as Convolution Neural network (CNN) and their implementation for imagery classification !!\nThe underlying motivation for the course is to ensure you can apply Python based data science techniques on real image data into practice today, start analyzing  data for your own projects whatever your skill level, and impress your potential employers with actual examples of  abilities.\nIt is a practical, hands-on course, i.e. we will spend some time dealing with some of the theoretical concepts related to image processing and computer vision (and assocaited data science methods). However, majority of the course will focus on implementing different  techniques on real data and interpret the results..\nAfter each video you will learn a new concept or technique which you may apply to your own projects!\nJOIN THE COURSE NOW!\n#computer #vision #python #image #processing #analysis",

SQL is one of the important skill required to become data engineer, data analyst, data scientist, web developer, application developer etc. So, if you aspire to be a competent data professional, this is course is for you!\n\n\nCourse Approach:\nThis is a comprehensive hands-on course with 120+ SQL coding exercises and a Real World Project of building a database for one of the popular sporting tournaments, and writing all the SQL statements required for the tournament website.\nI have combined my experience working with SQL in the industry for 25 years with teaching on Udemy for 160,000 students to create this comprehensive curriculum. Throughout the course, I provide guidance on using best practices for writing SQL statements and also take you through real world examples.\nI value your time as much as I do mine. So, I have designed this SQL course to be fast-paced and to the point. Also, the course has been taught with simple English and no jargons. I start the course from basics and progress to complex topics, and by the end of the course you will be proficient in SQL.\n\n\nComprehensive Curriculum:\nBeginner Level Topic:\nIntroduction to Databases and SQL\nBasics of SQL statements\nQuerying Data\nFiltering Data\nIntermediate Level Topic:\nSimple SQL functions\nDate Functions\nConditional Expressions & Functions\nAggregate Functions\nGrouping Data\nSQL Joins\nSQL Constraints\nPrimary & Foreign Keys and Relationships\nAdvanced Level Topic:\nDatabase Design & Entity Relationship Diagrams\nSubqueries\nCommon Table Expressions (CTEs)\nViews\nWindow/ Analytical Functions\nProject:\nRequirements gathering & Database Design\nWriting SQL Queries for a Website\nANSI SQL:\nThis course follows the ANSI standard for SQL. So, once you complete the course, you will be able to with with SQL on all major databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server etc, and also with any big data and parallel processing engines such as Spark SQL, Hive SQL, Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Azure Synapse etc.\n\n\nCourse Outcome:\nOnce you have completed the course including all the SQL coding exercises and the project, I genuinely believe that you will be in a position to start working in a real world data project using SQL.\n\n\nStudent Feedback:\nHere are some of the reviews from existing students which may help you make the decision, but also please feel free to go through the reviews from others at the bottom of this page!\nAyantika N [5*] - This is my first-hand experience with SQL. I thoroughly enjoyed the course, especially being a student with no background in computer language. I found the course well-thought out and beneficial for me. The hands-on examples are really well explained. I look forward to coming back to your courses in future as well. Kudos to you!! :)\nMayank S [5*] -  A very comprehensive course which starts with the basics then slowly moves on to intermediate and advanced concepts. The best part is the practice exercises to solidify one's understanding. Easy to follow along.\nRitesh T [5*] -  I have purchased all his courses. The best part of him is that, he explains the concepts + the use cases where it would be used. Just like his databricks, azure df, azure synapse courses, the theories are there as well as the  scenarios where such concepts could / would / should be used. There are times when a student like me who is working on live projects could use a particular concept, and bingo, his lectures come life saving.",

      "description": "➤ Why Learn Python for Data Analysis?\nMy name is Paulius. I have been working as Business & Data Analyst for multiple years in various international organisations. The amount of data these organisations are facing increases exponentially. So, I have decided that I need to know how to analyse, process and transform large sets of data. I could no longer entirely rely on Excel. It would crash anytime the data size grows larger.\nThen, why Learn Python For Data Analysis? Well, Python is excellent for beginners because it has a simple syntax ✔. Therefore, you will be quick to write programmes ✔, make meaningful analysis ✔, get those insights ✔ you need and start having some fun. Plus, Python has an extensive collection of libraries ✔ such as pandas, NumPy or matplotlib. They include tools that allow you to pull in powerful functionality like complex data analysis ✔, machine learning ✔ and visualisations ✔ into your programs. In some cases, you will need only a single line of code.\nOne essential aspect of Python is a large community of users who are willing to help ✔. It is crazy, what obscure data analysis problems I was able to solve using their assistants ✔. Plus, the biggest companies like Google, Dropbox, Reddit and Instagram are using Python as well and with a good reason.\n\n\n➤ Course Prepared Using My Experience\nThree years ago, I started my journey in learning Python. Picking up multiple tutorials and even building a fully functional online store. However, I have found that tutors in those courses almost always assume some level of programming experience. Even when the level is identified as a beginner, they would either not explain some concepts or start with detail explanations but by the end of the course, begin skipping. I believe this is because they learned basics some time ago and forgot what it takes and what would be unclear for a beginner. Hence, I would have to watch multiple video courses to gain a suitable basis for picking up more complex libraries.\nFor example, simple question how exactly index works in lists. Some reason courses I have seen would not dive into detail explanation, and I would have to find answers in online forums.\nI have decided enough is enough, I need to help others, who want to learn data analysis with Python and want to do it smartly ✔. Thus, I have created a Python Beginners Course to expedite your learning ✔ and generate value faster by going straight to the point of learning Python for Data Analysis. Through the course, I include my tips & tricks ✔ as well as lessons learned.\nAfter you complete the course, you will be ready and equipped to handle more complicated libraries like pandas ✔ and know with confidence how Python works.\n\n\n➤ Do not need to create apps\nOk, you have decided to go with Python. But how to be smart about learning it? Various courses teach you basics that apply to the development of apps. Yet, when you analyse data ✔, you may not need all that functionality.\nSay, take my personal experience, I frequently need to create a one-off project with insights for my management. I would need to take several sets of data, transform and clean it. Then I would prepare insights’ reports or visualisations. But that does not require creating an app with complex functionality, error handling or complicated UI.\n➤ Concentrate on what you need\nTherefore, for data analysis, creating fully completed apps could become a distraction. Even though you may use some of the other complex capabilities of Python in the future, it is not a requirement to start doing data analysis.\nUltimately, you will realise that there is so much functionality available for Python that you cannot learn everything. You will need to find a balance. If your goal is to analyse data, you should go more in-depth in data specific libraries and not try to learn a bit of every single library available for Python. ◕\n\n\n➤ Future Training\nWhy should you care about pandas, I hear you ask? Pandas is a genuine workhorse for data analysis. It allows you to analyse, transform, clean data and do much more in python. It is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.\nIf you want to be great at data analysis pandas is what you need. I have tried to include all the required basics in the course for you to be ready to handle pandas.\n\n\n➤ So, let's start! ☀\nSo, brew a nice cup of coffee ☕, get some desserts ✔ and dig into “Python Beginners Guide To The Data Analysis Galaxy Volume 1”.\nEnjoy and do not forget to have some fun! ✌ ☻☻☻\n\n\n➤ Exercise Files:\n★ Downloadable content as part of Introduction.\n★ Included Final Class File in each video so you can easily follow videos.\n★ Also, the same exercises available after each training video.",

Every lesson, project, and topic comes directly from real enterprise use cases — not academic theory.\nWhether you're an absolute beginner or someone looking to level up, this course is designed to take you from zero to hero in SQL.\nIf you’ve never written a line of SQL, don’t worry - everything is explained from scratch, step by step. You’re not too old or too young — SQL is one of the easiest and most rewarding skills you can learn.\n\nWhat makes this course truly unique:\n200+ visual animations that make even complex SQL concepts easy to understand\nBuilt by a senior data expert with over 15 years in the industry — not a generic instructor\nReal-world projects based on tasks I’ve personally handled in enterprise environments\nCovers everything in SQL — from the absolute basics to advanced topics like Window Functions, CTEs, Query Optimization, SQL Warehousing, and Advanced Analytics\nPractice with real scenarios to go from beginner to job-ready with confidence\n\n\nTopics covered in this complete course :\nIntroduction: Learn what SQL is, why it matters, how databases work, and how to set up your full SQL environment.\nQuerying Data (SELECT): Master SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, TOP, and query execution order.\nData Definition (DDL): Create, modify, and remove database objects using CREATE, ALTER, and DROP commands.\nData Manipulation (DML): Add, update, and delete records using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with real-world logic.\nFiltering Data: Use comparison and logical operators like AND, OR, NOT, BETWEEN, IN, and LIKE to filter data effectively.\nCombining Data: Join and merge tables using INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS joins and SET operations like UNION, INTERSECT.\nRow-Level Functions: Use string, numeric, date, null-handling functions, and CASE expressions to transform your data.\nAggregation & Analytics: Apply aggregate functions and advanced window functions like RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, and LEAD.\nAdvanced SQL Techniques: Work with subqueries, CTEs (recursive and non-recursive), views, temp tables, procedures, and triggers.\nPerformance Optimization: Improve query speed using indexes, partitions, and practical performance tips.\nAI & SQL: Use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to generate, explain, optimize, and debug SQL — plus translate and document code.\nHands-On Projects for Real Experience:\nWatching tutorials is not enough – that’s why this course is packed with practical projects so you can immediately apply your new skills in real-world scenarios. Each project is designed to mirror actual work done by professionals:\nSQL Data Warehouse: Design and implement a full-scale SQL data warehouse from scratch, just like you would in a real enterprise environment.\nSQL for Data Analysis (EDA): Use SQL to perform exploratory data analysis on real datasets, extracting insights and creating reports as a data analyst would.\nAdvanced Query Optimization: Tackle complex query challenges and practice performance tuning on large datasets to simulate high-pressure, real-world scenarios.\n\n\nImportant Note on Databases\nThe course files include datasets for multiple database systems (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).\nThis course mainly focuses on SQL Server (which runs only on Windows).\nIf you’re on Mac, you can still follow along by using MySQL or PostgreSQL — the SQL concepts are the same.\nThe goal of this course is to help you understand SQL concepts and how to apply them in real projects, regardless of the specific database.\n\n\nBy completing these projects, you'll translate theory into practice. You’ll not only reinforce your learning, but also build a portfolio of job-ready examples to show future employers.\nDon't miss out on the chance to master SQL, the skill that will set you apart in the job market and propel your career to new heights.

In other words, if a machine (program, app, etc.) improves its prediction accuracy through training then it has “learned”.\n\nLearn How Models Work\n\nComputational graphs consist of a network of connected nodes (often called neurons). Each of these nodes typically has a weight and a bias that helps determine, given an input, which path is the most likely.\nThere are 4 main components to building a machine learning program: data gathering and formatting, model building, training, and testing and evaluating\n\nData Gathering and Formatting\nYou will learn to gather plenty of data for the model to learn from.\nAll data should be formatted pretty much the same (images same size, same color scheme, etc.) and should be labelled. Also divide data into mutually exclusive training and testing sets.\nModel Building\nYou will learn to figure out which kind of model scheme works best and what kinds of algorithms work best for the problem you’re trying to solve.\nTraining, Testing and Evaluating\nThe model can choose paths through the neural network or computational graph based upon the inputs for a particular run, as well as the weights and biases of neurons in the network.\nIn supervised learning, we show the model what the correct outputs are for a given set of inputs and the model alters the weights and biases of neurons to minimize the difference between its output and the correct answer.\nEnroll Now to Learn with Mammoth Interactive",

She holds a Master’s degree (Computer and Information Technology) from the University of Pennsylvania and has worked as a data scientist at Meta.\nDavis Balaba, PhD is a data science manager with significant experience in one of the MANGA companies.\nWhy is this course different?\nThe authors are not consultants who want to sell abstract ideas. They are a pair of data science manager and data scientist who have actually implemented the strategies discussed in the course in their own work and seen the results. If you are a manager or a small business owner, you will know that strategy is crucial, but implementation is a whole other beast. Davis and Tina are here to help you develop the growth mindset and help you start making data-driven decisions.\nThe growth mindset framework\nWhat is the growth mindset? Why was it such a revolution?\nThe growth mindset manifests itself in a culture of discontent of the current state. The underlying assumption is that there is always more value to be uncovered and data is the path to unlock that value.\nWhat if our business does not have as much data as a large tech company?\nGrowth is a mindset. Data fuels your growth thinking\nYou don’t realize how much data you have until you start focusing on it\nThe course also provides actionable advice on how to get started on your data journey. You don’t have to have big data to be data-driven.\nWhy is the growth mindset important?\nThis course is an amazing collection of videos that teach you how to approach data science work with a growth mindset. This mindset can be the key lever to grow your business.\nThe growth mindset is important for three reasons:\nEnsures that you always work on the most important problems first\nHelps clarify what outcomes you can expect\nFocused on the desired end-result and encourages an execution mindset\nHow will this course help you?\nYou want to grow your company by trying to ensure it makes disciplined data-driven decisions.\nIn the absence of prior data, the associated risk to a data science investment is assumed to be high. When the associated risk is high, decision makers’ desire to invest is lower.\nWhere does that leave you as a data scientist, a data science team, or a data science leader that is trying to accelerate your company’s data journey?\nThis course will show you how approaching your work with a growth mindset can help you reduce the associated risk to data investment.\nDavis and Tina propose low-cost ways to de-risk the decision for the budget owner. In the process, you will acquire the budget to get the talent, skills, and the tools you need to fully unlock the value hidden in your data.\nDoes the content of this course apply to all industries and verticals?\nThe answer is yes. In any vertical, in which you can have multiple challenges or multiple potential solutions (which is all businesses) coupled with limited resources, having a growth mindset will always help you prioritize better.\nHow is the course structured?\nIf this sounds a bit vague to you, no problem. Let’s be more concrete with full examples of what you can achieve at each stage of maturity.\nAssuming we can define three stages of data maturity (level 1, level 2, level 3), Tina and Davis will explain what the different stages look like (in case you are not sure which stage you are in) and discuss how to use the growth mindset in that stage and what you can accomplish using the data you have.\nThen the lessons will be hands-on and Davis would walk you through a full project, so you can see the exact steps in implementation. At the end of each section, Tina will discuss, what are the steps you need to undertake to get to the next stage of data maturity.\nSounds like one of the most valuable online courses you have come across, doesn’t it?\nWell then what are you waiting for?\nBuy the course now and get started on your data-driven journey today!",

It allows you to\nsee patterns in time series data\nmodel this data\nfinally make forecasts based on those models\nand of of this you can now do with the help of Python\nDue to modern technology the amount of available data grows substantially from day to day. Successful companies know that. They also know that decisions based on data collected in the past, and modeled for the future, can make a huge difference. Proper understanding and training in time series analysis and forecasting will give you the power to understand and create those models. This can make you an invaluable asset for your company/institution and will boost your career!\nWhat will you learn in this course and how is it structured?\nFirst of all we will discuss the general idea behind time series analysis and forecasting. It is important to know when to use these tools and what they actually do.\nAfter that you will learn about statistical methods used for time series. You will hear about autocorrelation, stationarity and unit root tests.   You will also learn how to read a time series chart. This is a crucial skill because things like mean, variance, trend or seasonality are a determining factor for model selection.\nWe will also create our own time series charts including smoothers and trend lines.\nThen you will see how different models work, how they are set up in Python and how you can use them for forecasting and predictive analytics. Models taught are: ARIMA, exponential smoothing, seasonal decomposition and simple models acting as benchmarks. Of course all of this is accompanied by homework assignments.\nWhere are those methods applied?\nIn nearly any field you will see those methods applied. Especially econometrics and finance love time series analysis. For example stock data has a time component which makes this sort of data a prime target for forecasting techniques. But of course also in academia, medicine, business or marketing  techniques taught in this course are applied.\nIs it hard to understand and learn those methods?\nUnfortunately learning material on Time Series Analysis Programming in Python is quite technical and needs tons of prior knowledge to be understood.\nWith this course it is the goal to make modeling and forecasting as intuitive and simple as possible for you.\nWhile you need some knowledge in maths and Python, the course is meant for people without a major in a quantitative field. Basically anybody dealing with time data on a regular basis can benefit from this course.\nHow do I prepare best to benefit from this course?\nIt depends on your prior knowledge. But as a rule of thumb you should know how to handle standard tasks in Python.",

This is the perfect first course to learn process mapping, and I'm sure after this I'm going to be able to learn more just reading about process mapping.” – Marcos\n\"Jeremy does what many instructors in Udemy fail: explains concepts thoroughly without being repetitive or boring. I really enjoyed this course. Some say that you know you had a great learning session when you end up with more questions. I do, and I would like to know many more concepts that the course did not explore, but now I feel confident on how to approach further into Process Flowcharts. I even used it for my job. Cannot recommend it highly enough.” - Jose\n\n\nWhy should I enroll?\nProcess flowcharting is an essential part of business at any level – since you will be seeing and working with process flowcharts no matter your role, this course will be useful to you even if you are not a Business Analyst.\nIf you’re an aspiring Business Analyst these skills will give your resume a huge boost as well as provide you with the knowledge to confidently answer any related interview questions.\nFor current Business Analysts, these skills will result in more effective problem solving.

      "description": "If you are looking to test a complex structural model then you already know the importance of AMOS. Its a powerful and one of the most popular tool for doing Structural Equation Modelling.\nIf you are a researcher then your knowledge of research will not be complete unless you mastered the SEM as vast majority of researches are increasingly using SEM. You can refer to my research papers that I have published using SEM:\nSanjay Singh & Yogita Aggarwal (2017). Happiness at Work Scale: Construction and psychometric validation of a measure using mixed method approach. Journal of Happiness Studies. doi:10.1007/s10902-017-9882-x. Springer\nSanjay Singh & Yogita Aggarwal (2017). Antecedents and consequences of work significance in Indian organizations. Journal Management, Spirituality and Religion. doi: 10.1080/14766086.2017.1320580. Taylor & Francis\nIn this course you will learn how to do SEM from scratch using AMOS. AMOS is a powerful tool for confirmatory validation and often used by researchers and psychometricians for research and high impact publishing. It enables you to specify, estimate, assess and present models to show hypothesized relationships among variables. The  AMOS software lets you build and test complex models more accurately and efficiently than standard multivariate statistics techniques.\n\nI am sure you will absolutely love this course. If not you can take your full refund within 30 days!! No questions asked!!\n\n\nI am very responsive to questions and in case you need any clarification I am just a message away.\n\n\nSome reviews from my SPSS Foundation course:\n\"Really Excellent in Explaining the topics each and every point step by step and I like his way of teaching approach.. I feel , it's very easy to understand the SPSS Tool in this way.. Thank You so much Dr. Sanjay Singh \"\n\"Very well organized and easy to understand\"\n\"its a must have course on SPSS. Excellent job by instructors! Trainer is very helpful n units are very well organized. Looking for more and more stuff from the trainer.\"\nSign up and Start learning AMOS the right way!!",

There are many learning resources specifically dedicated to learning these tools. One of the concepts however, namely process mining, will be explained in more detail, because the learning resources about that field are relatively scarce.

      ],
      "description": "The most commonly available and widely used type of data in healthcare is claims data. Claims data is sometimes also called billing data, insurance data or administrative data. The reason why claims data is the most large scale, reliable and complete type of big data in healthcare is rather straightforward. It has to do with reimbursement, that is, the payment of health care goods and services depends on claims data. Healthcare providers may not always find the time to fill in all required paperwork in healthcare, but they will always do that part of their administration on which their income depends. Thus, in many cases, analyzing healthcare claims data is a much more pragmatic alternative for extracting valuable insights.\nClaims data allows for the analysis of many non-biological elements pertaining to the organization of health care, such as patient referral patterns, patient registration, waiting times, therapy adherence, health care financing, patient pathways, fraud detection and budget monitoring. Claims data also allows for some inferences about biological facts, but these are limited when compared to medical records.\nBy following this course, students will gain a solid theoretical understanding of the purpose of healthcare claims data. Moreover, a significant portion of this course is dedicated to the application of data science and health information technology (Healthcare IT) to obtain meaningful insights from raw healthcare claims data.\nThis course is for professionals that (want to) work in health care organizations (providers and payers) that need to generate actionable insights out of the large volume of claims data generated by these organizations. In other words, people that need to apply data science and data mining techniques to healthcare claims data.\nExamples of such people are: financial controllers and planners, quality of care managers, medical coding specialists, medical billing specialists, healthcare or public health researchers, certified electronic health records specialist, health information technology or health informatics personnel, medical personnel tasked with policy, personnel at procurement departments and fraud investigators. Finally, this course will also be very useful for data scientists and consultants that lack domain knowledge about the organization of healthcare, but somehow got pulled into a healthcare claims data project.\n\n\nThe instructor of this course is Dennis Arrindell, MSc., MBA. Dennis has a bachelor’s degree in Public Health, a master’s degree in Health Economics and a Master’s degree in Business Administration.\n\n\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to contribute significantly towards making healthcare organizations (providers and payers) more data driven.\n\n\nWhat this course is NOT about:\n- Although we will be applying some important statistics and machine learning concepts, this course is NOT about statistics or machine learning as a topic on itself.\n\n\n- Although we will be using multiple software tools and programming languages for the practical parts of this course, this course is NOT about any of these tools (Excel, SQL, Python, Celonis for process mining) as topics on themselves.",

The entire discipline dealing with construction, validation and standardisation of psychological tests and such other assessment tools is known as psychometrics.\nPsychometric testing is a big business and many big brands like Pearson, Thomas International, Prometric, Aon Hewitt, Ernst and Young, etc, are deeply involved into it. For Human Resource Managers psychometric skills are must but unfortunately MBA courses do not teach about psychometric testing as it's area of hard core quantitative psychologists. Sadly as per my experiences even many universities offering major in psychology do not train their students in psychometric assessment because quantitative psychology specialisations are not given in many universities.\nUnfortunately, corporate world is flooded with poor tests without any rigour which reflects in poor hire or improper assessment of abilities.\nIn this background, the course has been built to impart students with technical skills required to built a good psychometric test from scratch so that they can add real value to the intricate issue of assessing human abilities.\nIts hands on course and my focus will be on skills part while discussing theory only as much as it is essential.\nJoin the course now and start making yourself a skilled psychometrician today.",

Customers migrated from  American airlines to the economic People Express.\nwhat happened next changed the way we think about prices from merely making a profit to a strategic weapon that boosts business profitability and enhances product availability.\nAmerican Airlines introduced segmentation and revenue management techniques on its ticket prices \"yield management\" to attract People Express Customers back and People Express eventually went out of business. oh, I forgot to mention that American airlines' profit increased by 47% that year.   And the rest was history.\nThis practice was then adopted by Ford for car rentals, Mariott hotels for room booking, NBC, and ABC for Ads placement to pretty much every business there is nowadays.\n\n\nthis course will take you on this exciting journey of understanding consumer behavior. how to set prices for your products to maximize revenue and enhance product availability. if you are running your own business, managing a product line, or even launching a new product or service, this course will come in handy to set you on the right path for success.\nNot only this, Businesses now have hundreds of products and services if not thousands and we simply cannot optimize pricing for all of them with excel for example, that's why the course introduces you also pricing and revenue management with Python. not to worry if it's the first time for you with python, I show you how to do it step by step.\nthe course is full of lectures, concepts, codes, exercises, and spreadsheets. and we don't present the code, we do the code with you, step by step, by the end of this course, you will be able to :\nWith excel :\nThe perishability of inventory\nThe different pricing strategies\nThe willingness to pay of customers\nhow to fit the demand with the right response function\nElasticity of products and how can we use them to set prices\nHow to differentiate products and pricing to different segments\nThe concept of nesting in revenue management and how to apply it\nApplying little wood’s rule and EMSR to set booking limits for different service offering\nOptimizing the prices for different product simultaneously\nMarkdowns\n\n\nWith python :\nÞ The basics of python, functions, and for loops\nÞ Fitting demand with linear and logit functions\nÞ Multi-product optimization\nÞ Customized pricing.\n\n\nCourse Design\nthe course is designed as experiential learning Modules, the first couple of modules are for understanding pricing followed by applications using optimization.Don't worry if you don't know python, there are is a python fundamental section in the course to get you up and running with python.\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward to seeing you inside and hope you enjoy the class.\nHappy Mining!\nHaytham\nRescale Analytics",

Think about all the data that is being generated each day and that is available in an organization, from transactional data in a traditional database, telemetry data from services that you use, to signals that you get from different areas like social media.\nFor example, today's retail businesses collect and store massive amounts of data that track the items you browsed and purchased, the pages you've visited on their site, the aisles you purchase products from, your spending habits, and much more.\nWith data and information as the most strategic asset of a business, the underlying challenge that organizations have today is understanding and using their data to positively effect change within the business. Businesses continue to struggle to use their data in a meaningful and productive way, which impacts their ability to act.\nThe key to unlocking this data is being able to tell a story with it. In today's highly competitive and fast-paced business world, crafting reports that tell that story is what helps business leaders take action on the data. Business decision makers depend on an accurate story to drive better business decisions. The faster a business can make precise decisions, the more competitive they will be and the better advantage they will have. Without the story, it is difficult to understand what the data is trying to tell you.\nHowever, having data alone is not enough. You need to be able to act on the data to effect change within the business. That action could involve reallocating resources within the business to accommodate a need, or it could be identifying a failing campaign and knowing when to change course. These situations are where telling a story with your data is important.\nThe underlying challenge that businesses face today is understanding and using their data in such a way that impacts their business and ultimately their bottom line. You need to be able to look at the data and facilitate trusted business decisions. Then, you need the ability to look at metrics and clearly understand the meaning behind those metrics.\nData analysis exists to help overcome these challenges and pain points, ultimately assisting businesses in finding insights and uncovering hidden value in troves of data through storytelling. As you read on, you will learn how to use and apply analytical skills to go beyond a single report and help impact and influence your organization by telling stories with data and driving that data culture.\nPower BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization, or embed them in your app or website. Connect to hundreds of data sources and bring your data to life with live dashboards and reports.\nDiscover how to quickly glean insights from your data using Power BI. This formidable set of business analytics tools—which includes the Power BI service, Power BI Desktop, and Power BI Mobile—can help you more effectively create and share impactful visualizations with others in your organization.\nThe Power Query and Power Pivot features in Microsoft Excel can make a powerful combination. Power Query enables you to discover, connect to, and import data, and Power Pivot lets you quickly model that data.  You will learn how to use the DAX formula language to provide lookup abilities.\nI will walk you through step-by-step how to use Power Query to select data, prepare a query, cleanse data, and prepare data for Power Pivot. Also i will walks you through the Power Pivot workflow, showing how to create a data model, import additional data if needed, build relationships between data, and create calculations and measures.\nYou will learn hands on real-world scenarios for working together with Power Query and Power Pivot.\n\n\nLearning objectives\nPreparing queries\nCleansing data with Power Query\nEnhancing queries\nCreating a data model in Power Pivot\nBuilding relationships\nCreating Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts\nCreating Lookups\nUsing DAX to link data\nCreating data model\nCreating relationship between data sources\nAnalyzing data with PivotTables and PivotCharts\nUsing Power Query with PowerPivot\nConnecting  to a variety of data sources with Power BI\nCreate and publish reports to Power BI Service\nRefreshing Data Source\nUpdating Queries\nUsing Conditional statements\nUsing quick and dynamic measures\nTransforming data on connected datasets",

      "description": "Note: This is not a statistics or analytics course.  This is a leadership course focusing on how to build a data-driven organizational culture in your team or organization.\n\nNEW! Building a Data-Driven Culture with AI: A Step-by-Step Manual (see downloadable resources)\n\nTechnology is easy to buy. Dashboards are easy to launch. New data systems are easy to install. But culture? Culture is built, earned, and protected through leadership. Without the right culture, even the best data initiatives will fail. We’ve seen it happen: companies invest millions in new analytics tools and no one uses them; teams track KPIs but don’t change their behavior when the numbers reveal problems; leaders say they want “data-driven decisions” but continue to reward gut calls and seniority instead. Culture is the hidden engine. Without it, data stays on the surface. With it, data becomes part of the organization's bloodstream. That’s why this course isn’t just about “using data.” It’s about leading people to trust, value, and act on data — every day.\nAs a leader, you set the tone. If you treat data like an afterthought, your team will too. If you use data to shame or punish, your team will hide problems. If you celebrate insights, learning, and transparency, your team will rise to meet those expectations. In short, leaders don’t just sponsor data initiatives. They model data-driven behaviors. Throughout this course, you’ll learn how to align data with purpose by showing your teams why the data matters and how it connects to your mission and goals. You’ll practice modeling vulnerability — being willing to question assumptions and change direction based on what the data says. You’ll learn to reward learning, not just perfect outcomes. You’ll create psychological safety where teams can surface failures early without fear. And you’ll integrate data into everyday conversations, project reviews, and performance discussions — not isolate it into once-a-quarter presentations. Leadership is the lever. Culture is the engine. Data is the fuel. Get all three working together, and transformation becomes inevitable.\nMost data-driven initiatives fail not because of bad technology, but because of bad leadership assumptions. Common pitfalls include thinking of data as a one-time project instead of a permanent cultural shift; focusing on vanity metrics instead of decision-making metrics; building beautiful dashboards without changing frontline behaviors; punishing people when the data reveals uncomfortable truths; and underestimating the emotional side of organizational change. This course will teach you how to sidestep those traps. You’ll learn how to weave data-driven thinking into your culture slowly, strategically, and sustainably — without overwhelming your teams or triggering resistance.\nArtificial Intelligence brings a massive opportunity — and a massive responsibility — to leadership. AI tools, like ChatGPT and predictive analytics engines, aren’t just faster calculators. They reshape how work gets done, how risks are spotted, and how opportunities are surfaced. But again: AI only works well when the culture around it is ready. In a healthy culture, AI amplifies insights. Teams use AI to find better solutions faster. AI becomes a co-pilot, not a crutch. In a weak culture, AI outputs are distrusted, ignored, or misused. Teams see AI as a threat, not a tool. Leaders fall into “decision by automation” instead of responsible leadership. Throughout the course, you’ll learn how to introduce AI thoughtfully — not as a silver bullet, but as a support system for human judgment and leadership excellence.\nWhen you complete this course, you’ll walk away with a leadership blueprint for embedding data-driven thinking into every layer of your team or company. You’ll have frameworks to define meaningful KPIs, not just track what’s easy to measure. You’ll master communication strategies for aligning teams around insights — and motivating them to act. You’ll develop cultural tools to reward transparency, learning, and smart decision-making. You’ll build action plans for integrating AI into workflows in ways that enhance trust, not erode it. More importantly, you’ll have the confidence and clarity to lead a shift that sticks — even in fast-moving, high-pressure environments.\nThis course is designed for leaders at all levels who want to drive real change through smarter, more evidence-based cultures. It’s perfect for business leaders, C-Suite executives, directors and department heads, operations management professionals, and anyone responsible for improving outcomes in their team, department, or organization. It’s also valuable for anyone curious about how data and AI can power better leadership. No technical background is required. This is a leadership course — focused on mindsets, systems, and cultural practices — not a statistics or data analytics course.\nOrganizations that build strong data cultures don’t just react faster to change — they outperform in innovation, profitability, employee engagement, and customer satisfaction. They spot risks before competitors do. They launch products with better market fit. They optimize operations faster. They build trust with investors and stakeholders. They retain top talent by offering clarity, fairness, and purpose. In a world where uncertainty is the only constant, organizations that learn faster, adapt quicker, and stay grounded in evidence will always lead the pack. And that kind of organizational intelligence starts with leadership. It starts with you.\nThis course is structured into thirteen modules, each building upon the last to guide you step-by-step through how to lead lasting cultural transformation. You’ll start by understanding what a data-driven culture really means and why most initiatives fail. Then you’ll learn how to define key data priorities, align teams around KPIs, embed data habits into daily work, create leadership accountability for metrics, and build psychological safety around data-driven conversations. You’ll design cultural initiatives that drive adoption of data-first thinking and track their long-term impact across departments. You’ll also learn how to introduce AI thoughtfully, using it as a catalyst for accelerating trust and insights, not as a replacement for leadership.\nEach module includes practical frameworks you can apply immediately, real-world leadership examples, and actionable steps to roll out data-driven habits at the team, department, or enterprise level. No matter where you’re starting from — whether your team is new to data thinking or you’re working to reboot a stalled data initiative — you’ll leave with a complete roadmap to create lasting change. Data-driven leadership isn’t just about getting better reports. It’s about building better organizations. It’s about creating environments where people are empowered to ask better questions, surface real problems, test smarter solutions, and drive meaningful growth — without waiting for permission.\nUltimately, building a data-driven culture is not about technology. It’s about trust. It’s about transparency. It’s about leadership. When your team sees that data is not a weapon but a tool for learning, when they feel safe surfacing hard truths, when they see leadership modeling curiosity over ego — that’s when culture shifts. And when the culture shifts, everything else — innovation, speed, resilience, and results — follows.\nYou are here because you’re ready to lead that shift. You are here because you know that the future of leadership isn’t about intuition alone. It’s about pairing great instincts with great evidence. It’s about creating workplaces where ideas win on their merits, not on politics. It’s about building teams that learn faster, adjust smarter, and deliver consistently. This course will give you the tools, the strategies, and the leadership edge to make it happen. Let’s get started.",

      "description": "The EU Taxonomy is one of the most important ESG regulations introduced in 2020 by the European commission. It is a cornerstone of the EU's sustainable finance framework and an important market transparency tool, helping direct investments to the economic activities most needed for the transition, in line with the EU European Green Deal objectives.\nEU Taxonomy is a European classification system of environmentally sustainable economic activities. It determines science-based criteria that have to be met by businesses in order to call their operations green. The regulation also requires corporations and financial institutions to disclose a portion of their revenue, expenses, investments and assets that are aligned with the EU Taxonomy.\nIn this course, we will talk about the history and purpose of green taxonomies, the global developments with the main focus on the EU taxonomy. We will briefly talk about key EU sustainability regulations which are interlinked with the taxonomy regulation, including NFRD, SFDR and CSRD, and discuss why sustainable taxonomy is important for the green transition and how it is designed and used. We will look at taxonomy-related terminology, including eligible, aligned, transitional and enabling economic activities, go through the core reporting requirements of the non-financial corporations, including Turnover, CapEx and OpeEx KPIs. We will examine the main disclosures of credit institutions, and calculate Green Asset Ratios (GAR) using Turnover and CapEx approaches. You will learn about key performance indicators that investment firms, asset managers and insurance companies have to calculate and report under the EU Taxonomy. We will also talk about the benefits of the EU Taxonomy regulation compliance and challenges of reporting implementation.\nThe course has been designed on the request of the students who wanted to see more technical details with regards to preparation of reports. So for this course we have a fantastic guest speaker and the technical expert in ESG reporting - Anastasia Kuznetsova, who will take us through the technical side of calculating EU Taxonomy KPIs and filling in reporting templates for non-financial corporations, credit institutions, asset managers, investment firms, and insurance and reinsurance companies.\nThe course will benefit a wide variety of professionals including ESG and finance professionals involved in reporting, leaders aiming to integrate green taxonomies into business strategy, reporting and analytics, policymakers and regulators developing green taxonomies, management consultants as well as anyone interested in ESG regulations and sustainable finance.\nThank you for choosing our course Guide to Green Taxonomies and EU Taxonomy Reporting Tutorial.\nKind regards,\nJulia Mariasova\n\n\nPlease check out all my other courses which you can find on my profile page.  Just search \"Julia Mariasova\" or go to the bottom of this page and click my name under \"INSTRUCTOR\" title.  My other courses cover the following important topics:\nOther courses cover:\nthe history and politics of climate change negotiations, including key climate agreements and the latest developments such as Inflation Reduction Act in the US and Green Deal Industrial Plan in Europe,\ndecarbonisation and energy transition, key technologies (renewables, nuclear power, hydrogen, carbon capture and utilisation, long duration storage, etc),\ntransport and heavy industry decarbonisation,\nbusiness case for corporate sustainability (return on investment),\nclimate and ESG reporting (including introduction to key climate reporting regulations and guidelines, including TCFD, GRI, SBTi and ISSB)\nnet zero strategies and GHG reduction,\ncircular economy,\nblockchain applications in climate change,\ndata science, AI and ML for non-technical professionals, and much more\n\n\nThis course is part of the \"CLIMATE CHANGE FOR PROFESSIONALS\" series which consist of the following courses:\n\n\n1.  Generative AI Practical Guide for Business and Sustainability\n2.

You don’t want a course that skims over the details—or leaves you with theory and no practice.\n\nYou want guidance that’s comprehensive, dives into details, and gives you real-life competence for the #1 Data skill that recruiters and companies are looking for. And for that, based on my own experience, we have you sorted…\n\n\nLearn everything in detail to apply to Tableau, Python, and beyond\n\n\n5.5 hours of easy-to-follow video content, with real-life examples\nLearn the A-Z of Data Visualization & Storytelling, applicable to all tools, in bite-sized videos that can finish in under a week. I’ll walk you through the principles, analyze plenty of graphs, and give plenty of real-life examples—keep things easily digestible but thorough.\n\n\nTurn theory into skill with guides, assignments, and quizzes\nAfter taking you through Case Studies and Data Story walkthroughs, it’ll be your turn to nail the theory with lots of practice. Because once you’ve done the assignments, knowledge checks, and quizzes, then comes the confidence.\n\n\n_______\n“Exactly what I needed and more.”\n“This course has truly been a game-changer for me. As someone looking to enhance my skills in data storytelling and visualization, this course provided exactly what I needed and more. The instructor expertly guided us through the principles of good data visualization, providing a solid foundation for crafting compelling narratives with data.!”\n\n\n\"Excellent use of practical examples”\n“Excellent use of practical examples and visual tools to bring across the learning points”\n\n\n\"Very Knowledgeable…easy to follow”\n“The presenter is very knowledgeable and the content is easy to follow”\n\n\n“I love how Josh creates more interest using the same data”\n“I loved how Josh creates more interest using the same data and his approach to storytelling with different story arcs”\n\n\n\"The only course you’ll need\"\n\"to use data to drive insights\"\n\n\n_______\nHow will your course help me?\nIn a field like Data, it’s easy to think that “if only” you had another technical skill or mastered another tool, you’d get ahead of others. But being in the field for years, I saw how the highest-paid people were those who knew how to use data to drive action.\nThis course will help you see data differently—so that you know how exactly to organize it to communicate insights and inspire decisions that move a business forward. The short of it: you’ll learn how to bring immense value to companies, with Data Visualization through Storytelling.\n\n\nHow is it compared to others?\nIn the wide world of Data Science courses, there’s only a tiny subset that actually teaches Data Visualization. But even with that: they’re often reviewed as being “too fast”, “not detailed enough”, and almost never feature both Data Visualization and Storytelling.\nThis course is different because it’s all about teaching you both those skills comprehensively—with all the details, practical examples, and walkthroughs so you gain the competency yourself.\n\n\nWill I get value back from it?\nMost certainly. As a specialized course on a highly in-demand skill, you’ll learn the exact things that recruiters are actively looking for—and the companies reward handsomely for.\nIn other words: the value you’ll get is a huge leg up in job application, distinction as a Data Scientist, and the reputation of driving positive decisions for businesses (and eventually, the position that comes with that).",

      "description": "The comprehensive introduction to Microsoft Power BI, fully updated for 2021 and covering many of the topics required for the exam DA-100.\nMaster  Power BI Desktop, the Power BI service & Power BI mobile. This user-friendly course is designed to familiarize you with Microsoft Power BI’s  business intelligence capabilities in the most logical order.\nThe course consists of 30 sections, arranged into seven groups that reflect the way in which Microsoft Power BI works and the order in which operations are carried out: Getting Started, Connecting to Data, Data Wrangling, Data Modelling, DAX formulas, Visualization, and Publishing & Sharing.\nEach of the 30 sections in this course starts with an overview and ends with a section summary which recaps the key topics covered and reminds you where these techniques fit into the overall Microsoft Power BI cycle.\nSo, take your time and work your way slowly but surely through the course material; and when you’re done, you should find that you know Micrososft Power BI pretty well.\nINTERACTIVE  PDF\nThe course also includes a fully interactive PDF file containing hundreds of backlinks to the exact point in the video where that topic was discussed.\nEXAM DA-100 COVERAGE AND MAPPING\nAlthough this course is aimed at beginners, it covers a lot of the topics required for the Microsoft DA-100 exam. At the end of each section, we'll highlight which topics have been covered, so you can start checking them off your list.\nCUSTOMIZABLE COURSE DURATION\nIf you are too busy to complete the whole course straightaway, no problem. We have shortened versions of the course created for people just like you.\nThere are three of these shortened courses.\nThe Executive Overview course (6 hours) is designed for users who want to get up to speed on Power BI as quickly as possible, without going into too much detail.\nThe Report Developer course (6 hours) will suit anyone who will be focusing on creating Power BI reports based on datasets created by their IT department or by other colleagues.\nAnd the Dataset Developer course (9 hours) is for people in the opposite camp, those who will be responsible for developing datasets from which their colleagues can build reports.\nGETTING STARTED\nThe first group of sections is, naturally enough, Getting Started. This is where you’ll get up and running and download all of the resources you’ll need; and where you’ll get an overview of the Power BI product, Microsoft Power BI tenants and Power BI licenses.\nCONNECTING TO DATA\nThen we dive straight into using Power BI and the first business intelligence skill you need to master: connecting to data sources.\nIn these five sections, you’ll learn how to bring data into Power BI from Text Files, CSVs and Excel Files; as well as how to connect to a Folder of Data, either on your own file system or in a SharePoint library, and automatically combine all the files inside the folder into a single table.\nYou’ll also learn how to Connect to data on websites and how to scrape data from the web page itself.\nAnd, naturally, you’ll get plenty of practice in connecting to Power BI’s most frequent data partner: SQL Server. You’ll learn how to work in import, DirectQuery and composite modes and how to retrieve data from both views and database tables, as well as by executing SQL statements.\nDATA WRANGLING\nOnce you’re comfortable with getting data into Power BI, we’ll move on to the next stage in the Power BI cycle: Data Wrangling.\nIt’s very rare that the data you connect to is already optimized for reporting; so our four sections on data cleansing and transformation will fully familiarize you with using Power Query, the utility built into Power BI whose user-friendly interface allows you to carry out powerful and sophisticated transformation with just a few mouse clicks, as well as how to edit the underlying M language code generated by the interface.\nDATA MODELLING\nAfter mastering the first two steps in your Power BI journey, connecting to data and data cleansing, you’ll be ready to move on to the next stage: data modelling.\nIn this group of sections, you’ll learn how to combine the various tables that you need into a single entity called a data model.\nDAX FORMULAS\nHaving created a data model, our next group of sections focuses on using the DAX language to add insights and enhancements.\nWe’ll look at the three types of calculation which you can create using the DAX language:\nCalculated columns\nCalculated tables\nAnd measures\nAnd we’ll get to grips with the most important function in the DAX language: the CALCULATE function.\nAnd we’ll end the section by looking at DAX time intelligence functions which enable you to compare calculations based on different time periods, to provide such insights as year-on-year growth and year to date sales.\nVISUALIZATION\nOnce we have built our data model, we’ll move on to the next phase in the Power BI development cycle: visualization and report creation.\nWe’ll start with what I like to call the big-picture visuals, those which give your audience with key metrics at a glance. As you’ll see in this section Power BI has three big picture visuals: the card, the KPI visual and the gauge.\nAnd, of course, we’ll talk about many other visuals and visualization techniques as we work through these sections.\nWe’ll even look at using DAX measures to enhance the user experience by making titles change dynamically as users interact with them.\nPUBLISHING AND SHARING\nOK, so now we have a report, in our last group of sections, we will look at how we can make our content available to our intended audience.\nFirst, we’ll look at publishing from Power BI Desktop into the Power BI service.\nThen, you’ll learn how to create dashboards in the Power BI service and the different ways of adding content to them.\nYou’ll learn how to create app workspaces and how to grant access to fellow report developers, so that your team can collaborate on the creation of content; and how the different strategies for sharing that content throughout the entire organisation.\nAnd, in our section on Power BI mobile, you’ll learn how to create reports and dashboards which are optimised for mobile viewing.\n\n\n************************************************************************************\n\n\nAS A BONUS FOR COMPLETING THIS COURSE, YOU'LL ALSO GET ACCESS TO THE ULTIMATE POWER BI EXAM DA-100 PREP COURSE.\n\n\nThe Ultimate Power BI Exam DA-100 Prep Course is the course that's tailor-made for your DA-100 exam preparation. And there has never been a better time to prepare!\nMicrosoft is currently providing a discounted certification exam to anyone whose livelihood has disrupted due to the COVID-19 crisis. If this includes you, then you can take the exam online for just $15, until 31st December 2021.\nPassing the DA-100 exam could be just the ticket for landing your next job in BI or analytics. It helps you stand out from the crowd and this course is all you need to be confident of passing.\nHere's how!\nIf you download the exam skills outline , you'll see that the exam consists of about 110 topics arranged into 14 sections which fall into 5 different categories.\nThis course is mapped precisely to those 110 topics, so you always know exactly what you're, learning, why you're learning it and which topic it relates to.\nThis means that don't have to follow the course sequentially.\nYou can jump straight to those topics which are of particular interest, or which you have difficulty grasping.\nThere are three components to the course.\nFirst, we have the videos. There's an individual video for each of the 110 topics and you will constantly be aware which topic each video relates to.\nSecondly, at the end of each section, we have an in-depth online, text-based revision, over a thousand pages in total.\nYou'll find this feature particularly useful if you find that reading helps you to remember or if English is not your first language.\nAnd, thirdly, we have exam questions, over 100 questions in total.\nThese questions have been carefully designed to be similar to exam questions and when you get a question right or wrong, you'll be given tips as to why this could not be the right answer, as well as a link to the video in which the subject matter in that question was covered.\nSo, as you can see the course includes a lot of reinforcement learning.\nAnd this means this course doesn't just qualify you to pass the exam DA-100 exam. If anything, it over-qualifies you!\nSo, sign up for the course now and sail through the DA-100 exam with no problems.",

      "description": "What is DAX in Power BI?\nDAX stands for Data Analysis Expressions i.e. such expressions or formulas that are used for data analysis and calculations. These expressions are a collection and combination of functions, operators, and constants that are evaluated as one formula to produce results (value or values). DAX formulas are very useful in BI tools like Power BI as they help data analysts to use the data sets they have to the fullest potential.\n\n\nWhy learn DAX is important?\nLearning DAX is essential to build dynamic dashboards.  It uses in Power BI desktop, SQL Server Analysis Services (Tabular mode), and Microsoft Excel. It is a formula language that needs tables to perform calculations.\n\n\nSoul of Power BI\nThe core of learning Power BI DAX is its context. There are two types of contexts, the first one is the filter context, and the second one is the row context. These context works together whenever you write any dax expression. I will explain these contexts with the help of simple examples. If you have solid concepts regarding filter context, row context, and context transition, then you can solve any complexity quickly.\n\n\nWith the help of the DAX language, analysts can discover new ways to calculate data values they have and come up with fresh insights.\nIn this course, you will learn the core concepts of dax language. For the simple dashboards, you can get your results without writing single dax formula but for the advanced calculations, you really need to learn dax with its core concepts.\nDAX is a really easy language to write but a bit hard to grasp in the beginning. Once you learn DAX underlying theory then it is easy to write any formula and you can play with multiple nested contexts.\nWith every topic, first, we will discuss hidden concepts and then we will do its implementation.\nAbout me\nI am your instructor Muhammad Asif Microsoft certified solutions expert in data management & Analytics. I have more than 10 years of experience in Microsoft BI stack with world-leading financial Firm. You will learn what exactly is used in the industry.\n\nlet's proceed to learn the secrets of DAX",

On the basis of what you will find in this course I have trained over 100 business analysts who now are Investment Directors, Senior Analyst, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on Udemy were already taken by more than 224 000 students including people working in EY, McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Alvarez & Marsal, PwC, Deloitte, Dell, Adidas, Naspers, Walgreens, and many others.\nI teach through cases so most of the lectures will be case studies showing some business problems that you have to solve during the interview. Those cases are based on real-life examples. For every case study that I described in this course, you will find extensive answers showing you how you should approach the problem. For every lecture, you will also find attached additional resources. Thanks to this, as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made materials that will help you not only during the recruitment process but also in your first year as a business analyst / junior consultant.\nWhy did I decide to create this course?\nDuring the interviews that I have taken part in, I have noticed that even smart students don’t know how to approach some things in a structured and coherent manner. Sometimes they overcomplicate things. On other occasions, they give up on answering without even trying. I have tested on my people that most of the things that you have to do during interviews organized by consulting companies can be mastered and they will benefit you not only during the recruitment process but also in your work life no matter what you do. Learn from this course and apply it also in real life.\nIn what way will you benefit from this course?\nThe course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of cases, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you go through the cases during the interview. You will learn also how to give better, more structured, well-thought-out answers. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. My intention is that thanks to the course you will know:\nHow to approach any type of cases that you may come across in the job interview?\nHow to apply the most useful concepts and methods used later by consultants in their work?\nHow to be efficient during the interview?\nHow do the consultant minds work?\nYou can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.\nHow the course is organized?\nThe course is divided currently into the following sections:\nIntroduction. We begin with a little intro into the course as well as some general info on the role of a consultant, or business analyst – what skills, education, and knowledge are required from you and what are the available career paths for you\nRecruitment. In the second section, we briefly go through what the recruitment process looks like, what are your chances of success and what you should pay attention to. I will also show you alternative ways to get into consulting (apart from the regular recruitment process)\nUseful techniques. In the next section, I will introduce you to techniques you should master to have a higher chance of being successful during the interviews. You will learn what are: bottom-up approach, top-down approach, backward reasoning, cost drivers, compound effect, opportunity tree, lean manufacturing, bottlenecks, OEE\nMarket size estimation.  In section 4, we will start with cases. Here you will learn everything about estimating the market. I will use cases from the TV set market, the ceramic tiles market, and the kids’ ware market\nSales and marketing cases. In section 5, I will show you want kinds of cases relating to marketing and sales you may get during the interview. There will be examples from FMCG, retailers, and service companies.\nStrategy cases. In the next section, I will discuss strategy-related cases that you may be asked to solve. I will show you how to determine the driving factors in the performance of cinemas as well as marketplaces. You will also have to guess the business model of IKEA and come up with a business model for self-driving, autonomous cars.\nMath/Logical quizzes. The next types of cases that you will be getting during interviews are logical, math quizzes requiring some basic math knowledge and logical thinking. I will show you in this section some examples of such cases\nOperations cases. During the interview, you may come across consultants who specialize in operations. In this section, I will show you some examples of such cases.\nYou will be able also to download many additional resources\nExcels with some of the analyses shown in the course\nPresentation of slides shown in the course\nLinks to additional presentations and movies\nLinks to books worth reading\nAt the end of my course, students will be able to…\nUnderstand the main challenges in analyzing different aspects of sales, marketing, and operations that you may come across during your job interviews\nSolve most of the cases that you will come across during the interview\nPerform the simplified analyses in a very effective manner\nWho should take this course? Who should not?\nPeople trying to get a job in consulting\nStudents of Business Schools\nResearchers\nBusiness Analysts\nWhat will students need to know or do before starting this course?\nBasic knowledge of economics or finance",

Ever wonder how Google manages to analyze the entire Internet on a continual basis? You'll learn those same techniques, using your own Windows system right at home.\nLearn and master the art of framing data analysis problems as MapReduce problems through over 10 hands-on examples, and then scale them up to run on cloud computing services in this course. You'll be learning from an ex-engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb.\nLearn the concepts of MapReduce\nRun MapReduce jobs quickly using Python and MRJob\nTranslate complex analysis problems into multi-stage MapReduce jobs\nScale up to larger data sets using Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service\nUnderstand how Hadoop distributes MapReduce across computing clusters\nLearn about other Hadoop technologies, like Hive, Pig, and Spark\nBy the end of this course, you'll be running code that analyzes gigabytes worth of information – in the cloud – in a matter of minutes.\nWe'll have some fun along the way. You'll get warmed up with some simple examples of using MapReduce to analyze movie ratings data and text in a book. Once you've got the basics under your belt, we'll move to some more complex and interesting tasks. We'll use a million movie ratings to find movies that are similar to each other, and you might even discover some new movies you might like in the process! We'll analyze a social graph of superheroes, and learn who the most “popular\" superhero is – and develop a system to find “degrees of separation\" between superheroes. Are all Marvel superheroes within a few degrees of being connected to The Incredible Hulk? You'll find the answer.\nThis course is very hands-on; you'll spend most of your time following along with the instructor as we write, analyze, and run real code together – both on your own system, and in the cloud using Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service. Over 5 hours of video content is included, with over 10 real examples of increasing complexity you can build, run and study yourself. Move through them at your own pace, on your own schedule. The course wraps up with an overview of other Hadoop-based technologies, including Hive, Pig, and the very hot Spark framework – complete with a working example in Spark.\nDon't take my word for it - check out some of our unsolicited reviews from real students:\n\"I have gone through many courses on map reduce; this is undoubtedly the best, way at the top.\"\n\"This is one of the best courses I have ever seen since 4 years passed I am using Udemy for courses.\"\n\"The best hands on course on MapReduce and Python. I really like the run it yourself approach in this course. Everything is well organized, and the lecturer is top notch.\"",

The focus is on framing data analysis problems as MapReduce problems and running them either locally or on a Hadoop cluster. If you don't know Python, you'll need to be able to pick it up based on the examples we give. If you're new to programming, you'll want to learn a programming or scripting language before taking this course."
