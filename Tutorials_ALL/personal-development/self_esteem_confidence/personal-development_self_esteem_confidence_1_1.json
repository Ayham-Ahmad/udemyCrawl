      "description": "What is self confidence ?\nSelf-confidence is an attitude about your skills and abilities. It means you accept and trust yourself and have a sense of control in your life. You know your strengths and weakness well, and have a positive view of yourself. You set realistic expectations and goals, communicate assertively, and can handle criticism.\n\n\nOn the other hand, low self-confidence might make you feel full of self-doubt, be passive or submissive, or have difficulty trusting others. You may feel inferior, unloved, or be sensitive to criticism.\nWhat is a confident person?\nNot everyone is born with an inbuilt sense of self-confidence. Sometimes it can be hard to develop confidence, either because personal experiences have caused you to lose confidence or because you suffer from low self-esteem.\nA confident person:\ndoes what they believe is right, even if it’s unpopular\nis willing to take risks\nadmits their mistakes and learns from them\nis able to accept a compliment\nis optimistic.\nHow To Increase Your Self-Confidence\n· Recognize and emphasize your strengths. Reward and praise yourself for your efforts and progress.\n· When you stumble on an obstacle, treat yourself with kindness and compassion. Don't dwell on failure.\n· Set realistic and achievable goals. Do not expect perfection; it is impossible to be perfect in every aspect of life.\n· Slow down when you are feeling intense emotions and think logically about the situation.\n· Challenge making assumptions about yourself, people and situations.\n· Recognize that past negative life experiences do not dictate your future.\n· Express your feelings, beliefs and needs directly and respectfully\n· Learn to say no to unreasonable requests.",

And we'll break down words in creative ways to dispel hidden truths we didn't consider before seeing them laid out plainly as in this course.\nThe spells of the legal fiction will be challenged for their spelling in order to see what 'they' are really selling and 'they' are. And then we're going to spellcast something better instead of what we were willing to accept before we realized the true value of our creative nature.\nThis is not only a game changing program, it's the league changer, so let's shift together!\nWith love, Laura jeH\nPS.

      "description": "Thank you for your interest. By the end of this course, you will have learned how to love yourself more and achieved a measurable improvement in self-love, despite any past traumas. In your course, you will learn a special adaptation of Energy EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) Tapping, Classical EFT Tapping, and ideas from Reiki healing, in easy lessons and coursework that you can enjoy.\nThe biggest block to self-love, as given by genuine members of my Self-Confidence, Self-Love, and Self-Esteem Facebook group, is the effect of past trauma or negative life events. EFT Tapping has been proven to release the effect of past trauma. Moreover, the effect has been proven to last, such as in 6-month follow-ups, against other techniques commonly used in therapy and self-development.\nEFT Tapping is a very versatile tool that every modern coach and self-developer is finding to be just right for moving forward.\nEFT Tapping Practitioners can use this course to get ideas on how to help their clients grow their self-love. Self-helpers will find every step of their journey much easier after this course. This is because self-love is stronger than self-sabotage, and the more you love yourself, the more self-sabotage becomes a thing of the past for you. Self-love helps to release both self-sabotage and negative thinking.\nThis is not a theoretical or pen-and-paper course. This is where you get real actual results in your 5 easy lessons! Your course consists of:\nAn introductory section to lay down the foundation to your learning;\nEasy lessons designed specifically to increase your self-love in a measurable way;\nYour introduction section and your first main lesson purely concentrate on the positive of self-love, easing you into self-love in a way that can give you confidence in your learning and self-development.\nThree further lessons do two things at once; releasing negative past traumas and limiting beliefs whilst at the same time increasing positive self-love. This combination helps you to increase self love easily and safely.\nYour last lesson is a gentle Tapping Meditation, helping you cement all the positives that you have learned in a very pleasant and relaxing way.\nPractical exercises - you learn and develop by doing;\nUnlimited message support whenever you need it - I am there for you all the way.\nSelf-love is important in every aspect of your life - relationships, job, studies, self-confidence, self-worth, self-esteem, health, and happiness. Trauma and limiting beliefs stop anyone in their tracks, increasing negative thinking and self-sabotage. Give yourself a chance today. You will be glad you did!",

      "description": "\"The Lifetime Confidence Formula\" is a transformative course meticulously crafted to guide individuals on a journey towards profound self-assurance. Over two decades of dedicated research and personal experience, including challenging environments like military service and high-stakes entrepreneurial ventures, have culminated in the development of this comprehensive program. At its core, the course seeks to unravel two fundamental mysteries: the vast disparities in wealth creation among individuals and the divergent reactions of people to identical situations.\n\n\nThis program is not just about theoretical insights; it offers a practical, step-by-step approach to cultivating unshakeable confidence. Participants will start by crafting their own Strength Statement, a powerful affirmation that lays the foundation for the journey ahead. The course then introduces participants to advanced relaxation techniques, enabling them to achieve a state of deep mental and physical calm. This prepares the ground for the pivotal phase of subconscious reprogramming, where through repetition of their Strength Statement, participants work to embed a lasting belief in their own capabilities and worth.\n\n\n\"Empowered Self: Unlocking Total Confidence\" is designed for anyone looking to enhance their self-confidence, whether for personal growth, professional advancement, or entrepreneurial success. By the end of this course, learners will not only have mastered techniques for building and sustaining confidence but also gained the ability to apply these techniques across various aspects of their lives. Ryan Smith, an entrepreneur with a passion for empowering others, shares his unique methodology for transforming self-doubt into self-dominance, inviting you to change your world with the profound power of true self-confidence.",

Personally I feel like most of us are actually smart enough to know what we have to do to achieve things we want in our life, but the reason that we didn't do it, because somehow, deep down in ourselves, we feel like we are not good enough, we lack the confidence to do it. Two key takeaways I have from this course is\n[a] \"Do you want to run away from your pain forever?\" Instead of focusing only on the pain of doing something, Jimmy suggested we focus on the pain of NOT doing something and the reward of having done something.\n[b] be more aware of our emotions. When we feel like we are not worthy of anything, or when we feel jealous about someone, ask ourselves Why am I feeling this, why am I feeling I am not good enough. Keep asking why until you found out the true answer. Once you find out the answer, that's the moment you can really work on that and improve yourself. It will then be a matter of time that you get your core confidence back.\" - Isaac Lau",

There is no magical upper echelon of comedian that can only perform Improv effectively, it's not as hard as you think and you're better than you think you are!\nWe feel more confident about concepts when we understand exactly how it works, so in this course learn about concepts such as:\n\"Yes, And\" - The two most coveted words in Improv, I'm surprised I don't have it tattooed on me yet. Find out what it means to implement yes, and in your scenes, and what agreement looks like.\n\"No, But\" - Not only can you say yes in an improv scene, but you can also say no. Some performers and instructors shy away from this phrase, but in this Improv course, we're burning away not only the illusion that Improv is difficult, but also the illusion that you can't make no or disagreement work.\n\"Game\" Of A Scene - Every improv scene has a game, but what is that exactly? Understand the game of a scene will help you upgrade the quality your scenes and help you create stories that your scene partners and the audience will find memorable.\nAnd more!\nThis course is highly recommended for beginners and those new to Improv Comedy, but it is also just as effective for those who already have some Improv experience under their belt.",

Have you tried a lot of things to handle your depression, and you're ready to try something different? Using the practical and spiritual methods of this course, you will discover how to experience daily moments of peace.\n\n\nThe methods in this course are proven to help people shift out of dark thoughts that can keep them stuck in inertia. The practical and simple ways of developing a spiritual practice can open up a new vista of possibilities for you.\n\n\nMoonwater SilverClaw has studied with therapists, psychiatrists, and spiritual elders to learn practical methods and spiritual practices so that she could quiet down her own depression symptoms. Moonwater has endured decades in which depression symptoms have been very unfair to her. So, she went on a quest to relieve so much of her own suffering. She was given the intuitive thought: Your fight may be someone's light. Finally, through this course, she's able to share practical and spiritual methods that have empowered her to leave an abusive marriage and move on to a life in which she has served college students in a comparative religion course for over 10 years.\n\n\nMoonwater's methods have inspired people to express the value they have received.\n\n\n“Moonwater shares a fresh perspective on spiritual growth.”\n- Stephanie J.\n\n\n“Using Moonwater’s methods, I now feel more in balance, and I experience more times of gratitude.”\n- Nancy C.\n\n\n“Moonwater communicates in a way that's like sharing a nice cup of coffee with a new friend, while you two are taking a walk in the woods.

This course teaches performance tools that can be applied throughout students' lives and careers. Designed for teens and young adults, this curriculum is widely accessible and intended for anyone looking to develop and strengthen their public speaking and communication skills, self-confidence and self-expression. We have taken great care to craft a course that upholds the highest standards, and we are excited to share our expertise with you!\nAt the heart of this course is the combined experience and training of our work as professional actors and media spokespersons. It includes many of the tools and techniques we use to prepare for live & filmed speaking engagements and performance at the highest level of the industry. This course dives into the following areas: getting present, working from a personal and authentic place, self-awareness, story comprehension, releasing physical and vocal tension and the rehearsal process. All of these areas of performance are directly translatable not only to public speaking but to communication more broadly.\nBy the end of this course, students will know what to do when called upon to speak in public. They will have what we like to call a \"tool box\" of skills to draw from. And perhaps most importantly, they will have a better understanding of who they are and what they have to say!\n\n\nWhy Public Speaking & Storytelling?\nThe ability to communicate clearly and confidently is essential for scholastic, professional and personal fulfillment. Studies have shown that students who engage in public speaking training experience an increase of self-confidence. This is no surprise, as we know that the impulse to communicate and tell a story successfully to a group of peers is an essential part of our humanity. In an increasingly digitized and virtual world, our capacities for communication are being strained. Our need for communication skills has never been more important.\n\n\nCourse Learning Objectives\n\n\nEngage practices to achieve a state of Presence.\nUtilize techniques to Personalize and Connect with text.\nDiscover and explore students’ own Stories.\nCompose a story/speech based on fundamental Composition and Structure Concepts.\nPractice techniques that promote optimal use of Body and Voice.\nActively Warm Up the body and voice.\nEngage techniques to promote Relaxation and Communication Clarity.\nImplement Modes of Communication for speech delivery.\nEngage in Rehearsal and Preparation",

The course will teach you to think defensively and practice in the same fashion. Because violent situations are handled differently depending on the individuals involved. Like attacks due to emotions or done while involved in a crime, one may be out of control and the other is not. The laws, rules, and regulations that govern the use of force for police officers do not apply to the average citizen, especially those who become a victim of violence. A citizen may defend themselves by attacking their attackers' eyes, neck, or groin, strike the spine or the back of the head, or bite their attacker, but should an officer use any of these techniques, they may lose their job and even be arrested for excessive force. For this reason, all officers should be mentally prepared and situationally aware to survive a violent attack, it is important hthat you also are situationally aware.\nThe study and practice of martial arts are usually done to learn how to develop a disciplined mindset and enhance your physical fitness. But you must choose the right fighting sport for your lifestyle. You should have some self-defense training if you are a security guard, bodyguard, and even a schoolteacher.\nIt is hard to develop your self-defense style, which makes taking lessons important. Experts will tell you their system is the best, with the easiest learning techniques. The fact is it takes time and effort to master all self-defense systems. The best self-defense system is where you learn to make one move or technique to survive many attacks without thought. Regardless of the martial art or fighting system you practice; you should be able to defend against any weapon.",

      "description": "“Of all the judgments we pass in life, none is more important than the judgment we pass on ourselves.” ~ Nathaniel Branden\nEach of us has a sense of identity that we establish for ourselves over the years. It is the sum-total of our beliefs about us.\nThis sense of identity gives us our anchor in life and enables us to make all our decisions on what we like, what we do not like, who do we want to associate with and who do we want to avoid. As we mature, this sense of identity keeps becoming more rigid, as over the years, it gets verified again and again.\nAnd the simple reason it gets verified is because we always act in ways that are consistent with that identity.\nOur lives revolve around this concept of our ‘Self-image’, and note here, that I call it a concept as it can be changed! The core of all personal development and transformation begins from the self-image inside out. If we can make even smallest of changes at that level, we can experience big gains on the outside.\nIt is well-established that to live a life that is reasonably happy and satisfying, an adequate self-image is a key requirement. It is also well-established now that in case of a person with inadequate self-image, the world can seem to be a frightening place.\nLet me list a few characteristics of people with inadequate self-image:\nThey get jealous quite easily\nThey get quite critical and angry when offered feedback\nThey tend to take everything personally\nThey lack social skills and self-confidence\nThey are often uncomfortable when they are alone\nThey dress poorly and do not take good care of their health\nThey blame something or someone else most of the time\nThey spread fear on how uncertain and unfair the world is\nThey don’t expect much out of life in general\nA certain amount of discomfort is a necessity for growth. We cannot grow to new levels of perception or capability from our comfort zone. Do you have any people around you in whose company you feel uncomfortable say because they have something that you so badly wish to have or they know more than you do about something? I am sure you do! Think about those people and this time pose yourself a different question, which is this – Are these not the same people who push me to become bigger and better than what I am currently settling for? The answer to the above question mostly is a Yes!\nThere is a direct relationship between the words ‘self-image’, ‘self-esteem’ and ‘self-confidence’. In simplest terms, ‘self-esteem’ can be defined as the health of our mind. Dr. Nathaniel Branden, a leading authority on the subject of self-image, calls self-esteem to be ‘your reputation with yourself’. Self-confidence is typically defined as a feeling of trust in one's abilities, qualities, and judgement. These are all related to each other, and you can broadly say that someone with a healthy self-image will typically have a high self-esteem and also a higher level of self-confidence in general.\nPeople with high self-esteem are usually strong and secure and can admit that they are wrong when they make mistakes, and high self-esteem does not certainly mean that these people will always win. It means that they will certainly give their best in everything they do.\nImagine how much more you would achieve for yourself and your loved ones, if you could enhance your self-image and see yourself as worth of much more. In fact, having a healthy self-image is one of the key abilities that has been observed among people who become extraordinarily successful.\nThe objective of designing this course is to enable you to get quick yet lasting results. In this course, you will learn the most key principles relating to self-image/ self-esteem/ self-confidence that I have gathered from my extensive reading and experience (300+ self-help/ personal development books over ~20 years).\nOnce you master these basic principles, you won’t really need to read up any more detailed literature on self-image/ self-esteem/ self-confidence. A number of custom-designed exercises have also been included, which have proven effective for myself and many others around me. Ensure that you complete the exercises even if they feel uncomfortable/ tedious at first. Real lasting impact will come from doing the exercises.

These people need to achieve an accomplished level of mastery to be able to fulfill their duties and perform at a standard they and their managers, colleagues and clients are satisfied with. Of course, there may be others for whom this course would be appropriate.\nThis course will not be teaching you grammar rules and basic pronunciation. We assume that at an intermediate to advanced level, which you will need to be at to enroll in this course, you have already achieved a certain level of competence in these areas. Of course you may still have gaps in your understanding as well as your skills. These will be addressed as holes that need repair, not teaching you from scratch. Though of course if that is needed, that can also be done.\nMore typically at these levels you may well be struggling to express what you have already learned in a way that is at an acceptable level and that sounds confident and relaxed. The reason for this is typically to do with the practices you use. Use ones that aren't fit for purpose, then guess what? So, what you will learn here are effective, tested practices that can positively help you get the results you are after.\n\nTry it out and you will be surprised at what you can achieve.",

Self efficacy.\n2. Self respect.\n\nwe will explore what both of these mean and how to build both of these components up.\n\nIn section one of the course we will cover:\n• Why self esteem is important\n• What Self Esteem is.\n• What Self esteem is made up of and the 6 different components that make it up.\n\n•  You will learn which behaviours raise your self esteem and confidence and which behaviours lower it.\n•  We will identify your specific  blind spots through the worksheets on where you can make small adjustments to transform this area of your life.\n\nIn section 2 you will learn how to manage your mind and you will be given some challenges to complete to fuel you into the person you desire to become.",

      "description": "Making friends as an introvert can be a pickle. We are not naturally wired to be good with people but there is definitely a way how to improve that.\nSocial skills are extremely important not only in personal life but also the business. This course will help you to improve your communication skill and will show you how to make friends.\nKnowing how to make friends is a skill that can be learned by everybody. We will work under the assumption that you can work on every bit of the conversation separately so in the course, I speak about 5 main areas that we must master if we want to know how to make friends in a new city, how to make friends in a school or generally how to make friends as an introvert.\n\n\nThe first area, we will discuss is our mindset. Every bit of communication comes from within and that is usually the biggest pain point. So I will talk about some mindsets that you can adapt as well so it is easier for you to start a conversation with people.\n\n\nThe second part we need to master is how to talk to people. That is probably the hardest problem. So in this section, I will teach you a technique that will allow you to be quiet most of the time, and yet the people you are talking to will totally love you. It works surprisingly well for me, so it will for you as well. We will talk about the proper art of asking the right questions and active listening skills.\n\n\nIn the following part, we will build upon talking. We will discuss reading body language. You will know what the other person feels like. Do they enjoy the talk? Don’t they enjoy that? You will know how to find this out. Also, I will tell you how to practice reading body language.\n\n\nIn the fourth lesson, we will speak about time and proactivity. We, introverts, tend to be more reactive than proactive meaning that we usually let other drag us around, ask us out, etc. That is nice but if you want to actively build friendships, you can change the strategy a bit and get a much higher return on that.\n\n\nAnd in the last section, we will speak about where to find friends and how to widen your friends' circles. There are places where you can generally find and get more friends than others. So let’s explore that together.\n\n\nTo sum this up, we will talk about how to make friends.\nHow to make friends as an adult.\nHow to make friends as an introvert.\nHow to make friends as an introvert with social anxiety.\nHow to make friends in a new city.\nHow to make friends in a new job.\nHow to make friends in a new country.\nHow to make new friends in an old country.\nHow to make new friends easy.",

      "description": "I've spent the last decade practicing this secret (by secret I simply mean relatively unknown method), of releasing or letting go of repressed emotion. But not only emotion, but all thoughts, beliefs, limits, and identities. It is a way to go free of the world, to face all fears, and also, to find tranquility and success. This practice can be done anywhere in setting: during a speech, before a performance, in the middle of a life crisis, or simply when someone cuts you traffic. I hold a degree in Psychology and am nearly finished with my masters in Neuroscience - I anticipate my thesis being in part on looking at emotion, and to see what neuroscience has to say about repressed emotion. I am also interested in consciousness (which comes up in this program). We also explore the nature of emotions - going through the negative emotions in depth, and how emotions often arise in the mind as layers. Lastly, we delve deeper into the topic with interviews, FAQs, and what releasing can do for your spiritual practice.\n\n\nI plan to donate all profits from this program to charitable organizations and you can find out more about me feel free to ask.",

There are mental, emotional, and physical reasons why it is difficult to release this pain.\nOne area that can make it difficult to release the past is the misunderstanding of what forgiveness is. People often think forgiveness absolves the other person of anything that happened.

      "description": "In this course, I'll explain to you the Internal Family Systems Therapy created by Richard Schwartz. It's a psychotherapeutic modality that assumes that we all have \"Parts\". Parts are explained as emotions and behavioral mechanisms that we use on a regular basis. They are usually causing dysfunctional patterns of behaviors that we want to change. With the help of this modality, you can help your clients, patients, and yourself to recognize where those patterns came from and what you need to do to change them to healthy mechanisms. It's a type of a inner child work that can be compared to Schema Therapy in some ways. You use structured questions that you ask your Parts to be able to get to know them, appreciate them for their good intentions and ultimately take over for them and create new functional behavioral patterns. It's an amazing therapy that you can practice on yourself and use in daily life to create good habits, and appropriate boundaries,  promote healthy self-esteem, and practice self-compassion. Your Parts think they need to keep working for you, but with Internal Family Systems Therapy you can make them realize that they don't have to be active anymore because you are the \"Functional Adult\" now taking over for them. I'll provide you with my personal take on this therapy and with some advice when it comes to the use of this modality. It's my main modality that I use with clients, even though I have studied multiple common therapies like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Schema Therapy, Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, and Art Therapy. Internal Family Systems Therapy is by far the most successful for treating my clients and to use on myself to deal with emotions and difficult situations.",

      "description": "\"This course is absolutely fantastic and has really helped me to boost my personal self esteem\" Jules Labrecque (Udemy, student)\nMany courses aimed at building self esteem and self confidence use quick-fix exercises, such as NLP visualisations or affirmations - these might boost self confidence temporarily but they provide no long-term change that builds self esteem.\nSo, this self confidence course - How to Build Unbreakable Self Confidence & Self Esteem - seeks to unearth your unconscious and deep-rooted causes of low self esteem, and provide you with the knowledge and skills to become more self-directing and self-accepting - key to lasting change and building greater self confidence.

And in their place, you'll learn how to build new attitudes and beliefs to gain a more empowering mindset and build self confidence.\nIncrease your emotional intelligence and personality development leading to new social skills\nBecome more self accepting and self compassionate by better understanding yourself\n\n\nLow self-esteem can create anger, despair and hopelessness. So tackling the root cause of your low self esteem is important and this personality development and self confidence course will look at this. And from here you can start to increase your inner confidence and unlock your true potential. When you have a good level of self confidence and in particular, self esteem, then you will see progress in every area of your life.\nWith practical tips and exercise, you’ll learn how to develop a positive mindset, to overcome self doubt and reframe negative thoughts. This self development course will help you in your career, your workplace, your personal life - to build richer, more fulfilling relationships and to start believing in yourself more.\nThis self confidence and self esteem online course uses personal case studies, research and exercises from the fields of positive psychology, cognitive therapy, person-centred therapy, and neuroscience.

As to why I'm the first to give it 5 stars will always be a mystery!\" Jules Labrecque (Udemy, student)\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nAnybody who looking build a high level of self confidence and self esteem.\nPeople who struggle with anxiety, low self-esteem, feeling of low self worth and not being good enough.\nPeople who want to improve their career prospects by being more confident in the workplace.\nA note about the trainer, Peter Willis\nI've trained, coached and been a psychotherapist to individuals in a career spanning 30 years. And I specialise in helping people overcome crippling self doubt to become more self aware and self compassionate, and to build their self worth, their self esteem, so they can go into any situation with greater self confidence.\nIn addition to my coaching qualifications, I'm also a trained integrative psychotherapist. In my work, I draw on person-centred therapy, positive psychology, gestalt coaching, existential coaching, psychodynamic therapy, CBT, and Jungian therapy.\nMy philosophy is that to have a healthy level of self-esteem and emotional health, we need to find and be our real self – it’s from here that we can start to bring direction, clarity of thought, effective leadership and passion into our work and lives.\nI am also the MD of both Lequin Leadership Development, which has worked with over 60 blue chip organizations since 2003, and the online course provider, Unchainyourbrain .org\nMy philosophy is that to be the best we can in our careers, then we need to have high levels of emotional and political intelligence - we need high levels of self awareness and awareness of others, together with the ability to manage our and others' emotions. On top of this we should have a healthy level of self-esteem and to do this we need to find and be our real self – it’s from here that we can start to bring direction, clarity of thought, effective leadership and passion into our work and lives.\n\"Loved this instructor. He presents the information in a clear way with engaging examples. I will be taking more of his courses.\" Jennifer Ripley, course student\n\"Good speaker. Relevant information\" Betty Huntington, course student\n\"Trainer has a lot of knowledge, you can tell, and his approach is very professional, you can easily absorb what is talking about.\" Katarina Miklec, course student",

It's a devastating feeling to look up at your life and feel like you aren't where you want to be yet.\n\n\nThe research shows that the most critical thing we can do to ensure success --personally and professionally--is to grow our confidence levels, build a positive mindset, and be more forgiving to ourselves.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn all about how our thoughts, self-talk and beliefs contribute to us sabotaging ourselves. You will learn about how our minds work, and how our mindsets are critical to our success or failure. You will learn different external things and internal things that get in the way of our success.\n\n\nMost importantly, this revolutionary course you will help you break the shame you feel around not meeting certain goals, not staying consistent, and where you are in life, so you can move forward.

      "description": "Hello Beautiful Goddess!\n\n\nDo you feel like you’ve missed proper feminine education in your life? We all have!! Which is why I created an introductory program for women. This course offers feminine-based education you never received at school that gives you the tools you need to reclaim your womb health and body sovereignty.\n\n\nEver wonder how you can feel more connected and aligned on your spiritual path?! Well, sisters, it is in womb work where we return to the ways of the Wise Woman and bow down in humility to our own humanness.\n\n\nAll wise women (that's you!) work with their wombs and with the wisdom of their bodies. It's within the relationship with our body where we can be SO real, so authentic! Our cycle teaches us how to hold ourselves with more kindness along our way.\n\n\n\"We don't receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us\" -Marcel Proust\n\n\nAs women, we are naturally cyclical beings and our rhythm is connected to the rhythm of our beautiful Mother Earth. Just like the moon, our womb goes through cycles .. this is the essence of the feminine.\n\n\nOur monthly cycle impacts so much of our everyday actions, many you don't even consider. Research shows there are times of the month when you can get more done, be a more effective communicator, be better with high detail tasks, a better caretaker or lover, even times when learning a new skill is easier.\n\n\nImagine if you really understood when these times were in your life. You could plan your month to suit your strengths. You could get the results you were looking for, but with so much ease, USING your body to HELP you instead of HINDER you.\n\n\nThis may seem foreign to you because we have never been taught anything about this amazing occurrence within our cycle. Perhaps we learned about a few of the negative things that go on, but we're not given any information about the GOOD STUFF! The truth is our menstrual cycle brings enormous power and insight to our world and how we move through it.\n\n\nThe circle that is life is within our sacred bodies and the earth.\n\n\nJust as the earth goes through seasons our inner world also goes through seasons. It is crucial to our wellbeing that we understand what is happening within our bodies during these inner seasons. Once we have gathered this wisdom and start to embody it, we realize how sacred our lives are and we can live from a more powerful and authentic place!\n\n\nWe are apart of nature and our menstrual cycle teaches us this! Our menstrual cycle is a grounding place of deep wisdom.\n\n\nI adore my cycle in every way possible. For me, using my cycle as a guide, a compass, to navigate my days, weeks, months and overall life has been one of my biggest breakthroughs as a woman. To have the ability to understand what I am heading into each day all because I understand my body so deeply has given me such power. I would LOVE for you to feel the way I do about my cycle. And you can! Which is why I was called to create this program!\n\n\nI'm so excited to share this online course with you. This course is the easiest way for women to learn about their cycle in their own time as this course never expires and you will always have access to it. \"The Wisdom of Your 4 Inner Seasons\" course takes you through EVERYTHING you need to know and understand about the most powerful tool you have ... Your menstrual cycle!\n\n\nIt is an honor to offer some incredibly powerful information to you. The information you will find here is not new information. In fact, this is ancient wisdom and once you begin this course I know you will remember the magic that is within your cycle!\n\n\nWhat does this program offer:\nAn overview of your cycle as a whole.\nThe science and spiritual nature behind your cycle.\nThe meaning of your inner seasons.\nWhat each phase represents.\nHow to navigate through each phase.\nUnderstanding the cycle of death and rebirth you move through every month.\nHow to use your cycle to live a more authentic and balanced life.\nHow to use your cycle to create, work, and express yourself.\nA guide to help you live a life in harmonious balance.\nYou womb and her relationship to the moon.\nNatural remedies for menstruation.\nThe archetypes within your seasons.\nPractices to help you embody the archetype within each phase.\nUnderstand your own unique cyclical nature.\nA deeper understanding of yourself as a woman.",

      "description": "SELF CONFIDENCE New BSC Model to gain superior confidence\nHi my name is Mert Burian. I am specialized in helping people build their self confidence and self esteem\nHaving self confidence means feeling positive about what you can do, and not worrying about what you can’t do, but having the will to learn. When you feel confident there is no doubt, no comparison with others, no fear of failure, no worry about what others are thinking.\nGood news is you can learn the skills to become more confident in life so that you could have more chances of achieving your dreams.\nWorking on your self confidence and self esteem with my course will enable you to take on new challenges, to trust yourself in difficult situations, to go beyond your perceived limits, to tackle things you have never done before and to make full use of your natural talent and capability. Self confidence and self esteem will give you the courage not to worry about the consequences of failure. You will learn to focus on what you can do, and about positive outcomes you will achieve, rather than worrying about what you can’t do and what might go wrong. This is exactly the level of self confidence and self esteem that I would like you to achieve\nIn this course I am going to take you through a self confidence development model that I have created – the BSC model - which will help you focus on turning your unconscious bad behaviors into good skills so that you can boost your level of self confidence and self esteem.\nAlso, you will find easy to follow and short lessons produced with high production quality and supported with many exercises, self-assessment tests, quizzes and visual content.\nI designed this training for people who wish to develop a more positive inner talk, to become a success magnet, to realize their real worth and to advance their social skills such as starting a conversation and small talk.\nI am looking forward to seeing you as part of my student community. Come on in and join my course now and break free of what is holding you back!\nHere are some testimonials from the self confidence course takers:\n- Very good overview of possibilities to improve self-confidence - Irene G.\n- Very good and insightful, though it is a short course it can take years to properly assimilate and practice the information contained. Thank you very much - Ettienne H.\n- I find this training quite practical and to the point. I felt a lot of empathy as I was progressing, and I had very quick wins - BaharA.\n- Reviewed this course before recommending it to someone else but found some helpful information for myself - Klaus M",

I once believed that I was destined to spend the rest of my life either caught up in an anxiety attack or living in fear of the next one, but after several years I hit a point where I refused to accept that as my reality.\nI sought out anything and everything that I could. From books to seminars to counselling to energetic healing and so much more, I stopped at nothing to put at end to the anxiety that was controlling my life. It took me a long time -and the sifting through of a lot of very ineffective resources -but I figured it out, and now I'm incredibly passionate about sharing what I found to hopefully set you free from anxiety as well!\nI've built this course to share with you all of the tools that have not only proven to be the needed antidote to conquering my own anxiety, but even the anxiety of dozens of others I've counselled over the years.\nHOW TO KNOW IF THIS COURSE IS A GOOD FIT FOR YOU\nIf you consistently live in fear of your next big anxiety attack\nIf you regularly let your anxiety hold you back from doing the things you normally would love to do\nIf you're ready to put the work in to conquer anxiety for good rather than always seek temporary fixes\nHere's what some of the students who have used the course on other platforms have had to say:\nI love how the course teaches you about creating an environment where anxiety can’t thrive. It isn’t a quick fix, it actually gets to the root of things and gives brilliant tools and techniques that take away the fuel that allows anxiety to exist. If you want to stop letting anxiety take control of your life, you’ve got to know about these tools! - Elina S.\nImmediately during and after watching The Anxiety Toolbox, I felt more positive and connected in not only being able to control my own anxiety; but my entire well-being and life as a whole. - Valerie B.\nSo if you're ready to reclaim the driver seat of your decision making from anxiety then I'll see you in The Anxiety Toolbox!\nCourse Disclaimer: The Anxiety Toolbox is solely for informational and educational purposes.

      "description": "Advantages of Question and Answer Studies in Teaching\n\n\nQuestion and answer sessions have long been considered as an effective teaching method because they actively engage students in the learning process. This technique promotes critical thinking and stimulating discussions, which not only helps students absorb essential concepts more efficiently but also encourages them to build stronger communication skills. Furthermore, question and answer sessions give educators with vital information into their students' comprehension levels, allowing for targeted interventions and support as needed.\n\n\nTesting in Teaching: Striking a Balance\n\n\nWhile testing is an important part of the learning process, it is critical to strike a balance to prevent causing unnecessary stress and worry among students. Formative assessments, such as quizzes and practice exams, can provide useful feedback to both students and teachers, directing instructional preparation and assisting students in their learning journey. However, it is also crucial to develop a low-stakes testing environment that prioritizes growth and improvement above grades. Finally, strategic integration of testing into the teaching framework can foster a culture of continual learning and improvement among both students and educators.\nThe Impact of Technology on Question and Answer Studies and Testing\n\n\nIn today's digital age, technology plays a critical role in improving question and answer sessions and testing in the classroom. Online platforms and interactive tools provide novel ways to engage students in active learning, such as virtual Q&A sessions and real-time feedback mechanisms. These digital tools not only give instructors with data-driven insights into student performance, but they also allow for personalized learning experiences based on individual requirements.\n\n\nFurthermore, technology-enabled testing platforms can simplify the assessment process, allowing for more efficient grading and immediate feedback delivery. This quick feedback loop can be quite useful in guiding teaching strategies and identifying areas for additional support or enrichment. As educators continue to reap the benefits of technology, it is critical to strike a balance between traditional teaching methods and tech-integrated approaches in order to provide a well-rounded and productive educational experience for all students.",

Overcoming rejection is one of the hardest things to do, but the rewards are worth it. I designed this course to simple, practical, and results driven. As an entrepreneur and mindset coach I understand the many different emotions, challenges, and sacrifices it takes to run a business. My goal in creating this course is to help you overcome rejection long enough to get results.\nOver 6.5 hours of content\nPractical guide for OVERCOMING REJECTION\nProven Strategies that I personally use\nResults Driven\nHere is a Fact\nMost people want to succeed but are afraid of rejection. Don’t believe me, I bet one of these situations apply to you.\n\n\nWanted to negotiate higher pay, but didn’t.\nWant to start something new but nervous about family or friends opinion’s.\nGet defensive when you receive criticism.\nYou know what you need to do but haven’t done it.\n\n\nSo maybe none of these examples apply to you. The point that I am making is that rejection is a necessary part of growth and most people don’t know how to deal with it. Ask yourself this question: How would my life be different if I could overcome rejection long enough to get the results I want?\n\n\nMy course will teach you what rejection really is, how to combat it and create long term change. Let’s be real, I know you want to know what authority I have to speak on this subject. The truth is my ability to overcome rejection long enough to get results allowed me to escape a negative environment that sent many of my family and peers to prison or a graveyard. I was able to focus on the long term and overcome the immediate obstacles that others couldn't. I am an entrepreneur who started at the bottom and was told no at every step of the way. I know the struggle of having $3 in your bank account but still waking up and giving 100%. I have tried wholesaling real estate when I wanted to make money fast. I worked temp jobs to make enough money to cover bills. I spent $1000 on getting licensed in real estate with my student loan money and didn't sell any properties until I moved to another state a year later. These are just a few of my struggles and in each one I had to overcome a high level of rejection.\n\n\nIf you are willing to change and challenge yourself, buy my course.",

      "description": "Toxic shame is a source of most of the mental health conditions that we now understand. It is also a source of violence to self and others. For example, if you were never allowed to express anger in your family, your unexpressed anger is shamed and dissociated from your sense of self. As a result, your toxic shame is triggered whenever you feel angry. Such unexpressed survival energy is often converted into psychosomatic conditions such as anxiety, depression, pro-inflammatory conditions, etc.\nHealthy shame is an essential part of the ego ideal necessary for healthy brain development in childhood. Healthy shame is developed from aged 6 months once a baby is able to differentiate the face of their primary care giver from others. However, developmental trauma or trauma in adolescent-hood or adulthood can transmute healthy shame into toxic shame.\nToxic shame is a soul tormentor that is experienced in the entire being as the all perversive sense that 'I am fundamentally broken, defective and flawed as a human being.\" Once toxic shame becomes a state of being, one's core identity, it overwhelms us with a sense of worthlessness and helplessness. Since a shame-based identity makes us feel abjectly exposed, we then look for how to cover it up using defences and other control behaviours.\nIf toxic shame is not dealt with, it forces us to develop a false self as a cover-up or defence for our shame-based identity. Toxic shame is unwanted exposure that will always require a cover-up or defence. Toxic shame cover up/defences may include addictions, co-dependency, borderline personality, narcissistic personality, paranoid personality, offender behaviours, etc. Toxic shame defences also include other dysfunctional family system roles such as; scapegoat, family hero/star, lost child, surrogate spouse, caretaker, rescuer, etc.\nToxic shame binds all other emotions, needs and drives within us, in the sense that, by feeling any of these emotions, needs or dives, your toxic shame spiral is triggered. Since the fundamental core of humanity is grounded in our feelings, needs and drives, if they are bound in shame, we become dissociated from the reality and incapable of fully living.\nThe purpose of this recovery session is to give us a safe space to fully understand and heal our toxic shame, uncover hidden defences and free the inner child, so that we can start to live to the full and enjoy all the good things life has provided.",

Learning from him is like having a heart to heart talk with a true friend who cares. My only regret to taking this course is that I didn't find it sooner.\" - Gidget Harris, Udemy student, 5 stars.\n\"TJ Guttormsen has made another course that is life-changing for most people. Love all his work!\" - Don Nguyen, Udemy student, 5 stars.\n\n\nWhat is self-esteem and why is it important?\nSelf-esteem is all about how we value, appreciate, and love ourselves.\nIt influences almost every single part of our life, and it is in many ways the filter we experience the world through.\nIt is also a highly misunderstood concept.\nSelf-esteem is often confused with confidence. But while they might overlap in some areas of our life, these are two very different things.\nConfidence is about what we know or believe that we can do. While self-esteem is about how we value ourselves as a person and how much we appreciate ourselves.\nSelf-esteem also doesn’t come from where most people think.\nMany believe that their self-esteem is dependent on external factors such as approval from others, their past, their perceived success, or similar. And those influenced by this belief also tend to be the ones who struggle the most with their self-esteem.\nSo in this course, TJ is not just going to disprove that belief, but also show you how to create genuine, healthy self-esteem from the only place it truly comes from: Within yourself.\n\n\n\"I signed up for this course because I've had a long-term issue with self-esteem, which has negatively impacted many areas of my life. I'm so glad I did! TJ's thorough, confident and clear teachings are spot on - I had some \"AHA\" insights that have truly made a difference already. You are valuable, worth taking care of, and it's time to believe in your wonderful, authentic self. This course and exercises will show you how.\" - Despina Malas, Udemy student, 5 stars.\n\n\nWhat will you learn?\nWhile the course has over 30 chapters filled with knowledge and exercises, the course has two primary goals.\n1: To help you take the power away from anything and everything that is currently holding your self-esteem back. Whether that is your past, other people, external pressure or expectations, or anything else.\nAnd 2: To show you lots of ways to start generating healthy self-esteem from within yourself.\nTo achieve this, TJ has structured the course content in three distinct parts.\n\n\nIn the first section, you’ll learn all about how to take back the power over your self-esteem.\nSome of the topics included are:\nHow to change your future.\nHow to let go of the past.\nHow to create a new self-image.\nHow to overcome learned helplessness.\nHow to get your unconscious mind to help build self-esteem.\nAnd more...\n\n\nIn the second section, you’ll learn lots of ways to generate healthy self-esteem from within yourself.\nSome of the topics in this section include:\nHow to live in integrity (and why that’s crucial for our self-esteem).\nExpectation and ambition management.\nHow failure and mistakes can help build self-esteem.\nHow to know that you deserve everything you want.\nSeveral incredibly helpful self-esteem exercises.\nAnd lots more...\n\n\nAnd in the third section of the course, you'll learn behaviors that can help you reach your self-esteem goals faster.\nTopics include:\nHow to handle criticism.\nHow to stop having anything to prove to anyone.\nHow new experiences will build self-esteem.\nHow to teach others how to treat you.\nAnd so on...\n\n\nAnd in addition to all of this content, TJ offers free personal support to everyone who takes his courses. He’s just as invested in you succeeding as he is with his personal coaching clients who pay him thousands of dollars to work with him.\nSo if you’re ready to take your self-esteem to the next level, sign up now.\n\n\n\"The course is an amazing guide to build your self-esteem. TJ makes all the points very easy to understand and with examples from real life. Also, it is very helpful to have some exercises to practice and is not limited only to an explanation. If someone is in need to increase their self-esteem, this course is the right one.\" - Moises Lorenzo León, Udemy student, 5 stars.\n\n\n\"I really appreciate his teaching technique. It clearly shows that he not only understands the subject he's teaching, but also how this information typically affects his students. By this I mean, there hasn't been a moment where I've had a momentary pause of confusion and he didn't immediately anticipate and address it in his presentation. My impression is that he's just a very good teacher. And of course, I'm really appreciating the material.\" - Don Gilbert, Udemy student, 5 stars.",

Confidence that everything will be OK\n4. Confidence that you can handle anything that comes your way.\n5. Confidence that change can be a good thing.\n6. Confidence in your ability to be completely self-supportive.\n7. Confidence that within every struggle, challenge, obstacle, and failure, there are important lessons to be learned.\n8.

I created this guided meditation to become SUPER CONFIDENT.\nIt worked and I have loads of confidence to produce this and other courses.\nI therefore know hand on heart that it will work for you.\" marc\nThis course and GUIDED MEDITATION :\nit is based on Marc Wynn's personal experience and therefore works\nworks at a feeling/soul level to make you SUPER confident again\nincludes three TRIGGER words that keep you feeling confident in the real world all of the time\nAll you have to do is listen to this guided meditation (ideally) before getting out of bed and then use the three trigger words during the day to be SUPER Confident.\nIt works because you are able to regain all the confidence you used to have and regain control over your life.\nThe lectures clearly explain how the guided meditation works in three stages :\nStage 1 : TAKING BACK CONTROL OVER YOUR LIFE\nMost people lose their confidence because of bad experiences or from bad decisions. This lack of confidence comes from having lost or given away control of parts of your life - this could money, relationships, health etc. The first part of the guided meditation includes a powerful technique that changes all of that by putting you back in control of your life.\nStage 2 : YOUR PERSONA OF CONFIDENCE\nIn the meditation on the biggest TV in the world you will be able to see yourself with super confidence, doing all the things that you would love to do if you were super confident. You will see how you walk, talk, stand and act in front of others.\nThis is you creating your new persona and the person you want to be.\nStage 3 : THREE TRIGGER Words\nWe humans are good at listening to a mediation, but as soon as we get back in the real world we fall back into the same old patterns and end up feeling unconfident again.\nThis why I provide you with THREE TRIGGER WORDS that you can use in the real world, that immediately reminds you of the SUPER confident person YOU ARE. When you use theses words, you immediately return to being super confident again.\nFinally, my students love my courses and that is why I have such a high instructor rating and have great reviews.\nEnjoy and watch out because here comes the NEW YOU :) :) :)",

      "description": "Have you ever totally \"lost it\" and basically made a fool of yourself? Most people would think that this would be a conversation about how you felt afterwards. No such conversation here because we all know what it feels like to \"loose it\": if feels demeaning, humiliating and frankly, quite embarrassing. Instead I would like to ask you a different question: what was it that you lost when you say that you \"lost it\". A common answer to that question is: my temper, or my patience. if you feel that all you lost was your temper or your patience when you \"lost it\", no doubt you have also noticed that that you keep on \"loosing it\", and each time it gets a little worse. Part of the problem is that we don't know what it is that we have lost and we certainly do not know how to recover it, until now. I will explain this most common problem that afflicts all people in a way that you never heard before. You will learn what exercises to do, how to do them, and how to proceed the next time the going gets tough for you. You will feel elated to discover what few have discovered before you, and you will feel that you transcended the most visceral aspect of human nature.\nThe presentation and delivery of this course evolved over 20 years of therapy and teaching. Frequent repetition of key concepts and alternative explanations for the same ideas have proven to make our classes more enjoyable and productive for students. When students understand a topic and later hear an alternative explanation of the same idea they feel confident in their learning and expand their awareness of themselves. Additionally, students often comment that it is almost as if they can hear the instructor \"talking to them\", as the concepts covered seem to stay with students forever.\nYou will get a number of video lectures where I look directly into your eyes. I suggest you allow yourself the opportunity to watch the lectures at least once looking into the screen and focusing on the concepts. Later you can download the audio lectures and listen to them again if you wish.\nI answer all questions students ask. Not only I enjoy very much receiving and addressing your questions, but actually I thank you for them, since all courses after the first one we did evolved from questions from students.\nThank you, and welcome to the journey!\nFlavio Souza-Campos",

      "description": "Positive Self Talk  is really all about your internal dialogue and how positive it is or can get when you boost it as we will be exploring in this Course.\nA lot of people have a problem with doing Positive Self Talk and saying affirmations because it feels 'too cheesy' or inauthentic to them and so they feel like they are lying to themselves. We get to the root of why that may be the case. Could it be a low self esteem issue that they are not aware exists? Come find out inside the course as we dive deep down into it.\nEmbracing the hard truth as you become more self aware of what is actually going on with you in this regard will allow you fall in love with the act of learning to say affirmations the way that it can begin to feel more authentic and true for you by improving your Self Esteem and Boosting your Positive Self Talk, so that it becomes like second nature.\nNo gimmicks, just pure good intentions, from you, to you.\nWe also unravel how not to get into 'toxic positivity' while using Positive Self Talk.\nAgain, we will explore what I have called The Most Effective Self Talk practice which is one of the Highlights of this Course for Addressing Negative Self Talk , hence leading to a Positive Self Talk Boost . I can confidently say that it is Life Changing and hence very effective.\nThe first step towards changing the way you treat yourself is to begin to notice when you are being very critical of you. It may be that, like many of us, your 'self critical or inner critic' voice is so common now for you that you hardly notice when it comes around to pay a 'mind visit', so to say.\nWhenever you're feeling bad about something, think about what you've just said to yourself. Really, try to be as accurate as you possibly can . What words does your inner critic voice say to you? Are there any specific words that come up over and over again? What is the tone of your voice. Is it condescending, angry or judgmental? Does the voice remind you of anyone from your past who was critical of you? Well, we get into really practical examples inside the Course.\nThis Course contains Worksheets Assignments that are geared towards helping you get into that great space of a Positive Self Talk Boost while improving your Self Esteem in the process. Yes indeed. We unpack the goodness of a Healthy Self Esteem and how it is connected with our Self Concepts, Ideals, Values and of course, our Self Talk.\nThe Worksheet Assignments are All Downloadable at Your Convenience. You will also be able to download resources and mp3 versions of all the lectures so that you can further reconnect on the go.\nAt the end of this Course, you will get a Certificate of Completion from Udemy and another MPCC Self Validation Certificate to serve as a Beautiful Reminder that You have Completed this course and also to Demonstrate that You are Someone Committed to their Personal Development and Self Improvement. Employers love those who make the effort to learn and usually look out for that in Your CV.\nAlso, if you are Self Employed or a Young Entrepreneur or a Business Owner, this aids to keep you always Inspired. To receive the MPCC Certificate, and to Join the private group, follow the easy going instructions at the end of the Course.\nGreat To Have You Here.

Having a true friend is always something that is underestimated in our current society.

Along the way, you'll learn perspective shifts that clients have called \"life changing\".\nMost importantly, the final phase of the course involves real world application of the concepts discussed. Change begins in the mind, but it doesn't end there! You'll be given tangible action steps to implement that are guaranteed to improve your confidence, social skills, and overall comfort showing up as YOURSELF!\n\n\nEach lesson includes a worksheet with a description of exercises for students to complete. Each lecture also includes additional video resources to support the learning process.\n\n\nThis course is taught by Tricia Veldman, MS CCC-SLP.\nHaving been described by others in a former life as “timid” and “soft-spoken,” Tricia is no stranger to the fear of \"showing up sure\". After embarking on her personal development quest, Tricia learned to trust and celebrate her own voice. Amazed by its impact on her daily life, she now combines experiential and scholastic knowledge to empower others to do the same.\nTricia has worked for a decade as a speech coach, empowering individuals to shatter limiting beliefs and become the person they most yearn to be. She walks her talk by performing original Spoken Word Poetry with the intention of both entertaining and inspiring her listeners.\nTricia gave a TEDx talk in 2023 called Tenets of Time: the short, the long, the messy. During her talk, she touches on a personal event that's completely transformed the way she views and lives life - for the better!\nFounder of the platform PowerfulandPoised, Tricia makes it her mission to encourage, uplift, and inspire through her poetry, writing, and motivational speaking.\nPerhaps most importantly, Tricia aims to incorporate a little bit of fun into everything she does - including this course! You'll see ;)",

        "This course is ideal for anyone who dreams about showing up in a certain way, but can't seem to put it in action. You'll shatter personal limitations and embody the fullest, most magnificent version of you. Why? Because the world needs it."

      "description": "Virtually everyone has dreams, desires, and a sense of inner greatness they wish to achieve. Yet, for many, self-doubt reigns supreme, clouding their confidence and casting doubt on their abilities. They look at their aspirations as unreachable fantasies, convinced they lack the capability to turn them into reality. This mindset creates a barrier that often prevents people from even taking the first step toward their goals.\nSuccess begins with self-awareness—the realization that you already possess the greatness needed to achieve your dreams. It’s about recognizing your inherent potential and understanding that your belief in yourself can either propel you forward or hold you back. Without self-confidence, even the most ambitious goals can seem impossible. Self-doubt acts as a paralytic, freezing you in place. It whispers fears—What if I fail? What if I’m not good enough?—which slowly erodes your motivation, diminishes your momentum, and drains your courage.\nThis course is designed to expose the behaviors and thought patterns that destroy self-esteem and confidence. You’ll learn effective, practical strategies to shift your mindset, build your self-worth, and develop unwavering confidence. We’ll explore the importance of cultivating a positive self-image and the critical role self-esteem plays in every aspect of life—including your career, relationships, and personal happiness.\nLow self-esteem is often the hidden obstacle behind feelings of disappointment and frustration. It can manifest as jealousy, indecision, dependence, or excessive anger. It clouds your ability to enjoy life’s moments and to recognize and seize opportunities. Without a healthy sense of self-worth, success feels out of reach, and happiness remains elusive—even if your external circumstances are ideal.\nBy engaging with this course, you'll gain insight into the destructive patterns that undermine your confidence, and most importantly, learn how to replace them with empowering habits. You’ll discover the tools to build genuine self-esteem, develop resilience against setbacks, and unlock your full potential. This is about more than just dreaming; it’s about transforming those dreams into attainable realities.\nIf you find yourself relating to any of these struggles or know someone who does, I invite you to join us. We’ll take a no-nonsense approach to cultivating self-esteem and embracing the greatness that lies within you. Together, we will forge a path toward a more confident, fulfilled, and successful life.",

It divides your sense of self into 10 different layers, working from the surface down to the core of what makes you \"you.\"\nThis course is much more than merely descriptive (who you have been up to this point in your life), because you are literally filled with unrealized potential to explore and discover, and because a large potion of who you think you are has merely been a reaction to outside forces.\nParents, teachers, friends, and marketers have all sought to shape your thoughts, feelings and behaviors - even when they had no idea they were doing so.

      "description": "Before we can overcome shyness, we have to figure out why we are shy. There is no easy answer to this question. Some people appear to be born shy and have a hard time coming out of their shell. Other people seem to be more outgoing. In my research into what makes someone shy I found that two things often figure into shyness - birth order as well as a lower self-esteem. It is also important to realize that shyness is not always so apparent. Some people, in an effort to not seem so shy will go off in the opposite direction and appear to be very outgoing when they are struggling, on the inside, to overcome this affliction. I can relate to this as I am one of those types of individuals. Others often find me to be outgoing, but in reality, I get a sick feeling in my stomach when I have to meet new people or exert myself in social situations.\n\n\nBeing shy does not mean that someone has a low self-esteem, but it can be an indication that their self-esteem is a bit more fragile than someone who is not shy and is not, as a result, self-conscious. Through my research, I have found that those who are shy tend to be very sensitive individuals who often make the mistake of thinking that everyone’s attention is focused on them. They are afraid to make a mistake, say something silly or do something that will cause others to notice them. They would rather fade into the background than call attention to themselves.\nMany people are aware of the fact that they are shy and avoid being in the limelight as much as possible. Some people who are shy may over compensate for the fact that they feel shy and go overboard in trying to draw attention to themselves. For the most part, shyness is based upon a fear of rejection, most often due to a low self-esteem. It manifests itself differently with every individual. Some people need only have their idea rejected once before they develop a low sense of self-worth and an inferiority complex. Others can take a lot of rejection before it starts to affect them negatively.\nHere are some basic questions that you can ask yourself to see if you are shy:\n\n\n1. When I go to a party where I do not know anyone, I….\n\n\nA. Cancel. I would rather die than attend a party where I didn’t know anyone else.\nB. Try to find a place where I can sit inconspicuously so I do not draw attention to myself.\nC. Try to mingle a bit and then call it an early night.\nD. Find the life the party and do my best to integrate myself with the guests.\n\n\n2. In school, if I knew the answer to a question, I would….\n\n\nA. Not do anything. What if I wasn’t sure?\nB. Wait to be called on by the teacher.\nC. Raise my hand to answer the question.\nD. Make sure the teacher saw that I knew the answer by waving my hand.\n\n\n3. My ideal job would be…\n\n\nA. A job where I could be alone in my own cubicle\nB. A job where I didn’t have to interact with others on a regular basis.\nC. A job where I worked in a team setting.\nD. A managerial job where I was in charge of others.\n\n\n4. If I like someone and want to form a relationship with them, I….\n\n\nA. Follow them around and wait for them to make the first move\nB. Try to put myself in their way so that they notice me\nC. Arrange to be at parties and other gatherings where they may be\nD. Tell them and let the chips fall where they may\n\n\n5. During a job interview, I…\n\n\nA. Answer questions that are asked of me only and feel nervous\nB. Try to stick to saying as little as possible about myself\nC. Ask questions and answer those questions presented to me\nD. Assume that they are the ones I am interviewing, instead of the other way around\nHow you interpret this data is found in the course.\nThis course will teach you how to recognize shyness in yourself and how to beat this personality trait with tips and exercises that will help you emerge from your shell to become the real you.  The person you know you can be.",

      "description": "In our world today, some of the most accomplished leaders I know secretly admit to feeling like an imposter.\nThis feeling can show up like a nagging sense of insecurity, or a sneaking suspicion that you’re in the wrong place or role. It can show up like a lack of confidence in your professional life, or an inability to rid yourself of patterns of negative self-talk. Or it can show up just as you stretch into new territory, a vicious inner critic there to keep you from truly owning your power, taking up space and showing up with confidence.\nSound familiar? The good news is this feeling is pervasive and normal – and also ultimately surmountable.

Section 3 will help you rewire your brain to move to inner confidence, helping you lean into tools like your inner board of directors, reframing negative thought patterns, visualizations and self-celebration\nAnd then, Section 4, is all about action, like how to get unstuck through taking microsteps, move before you’re ready and communicate with confidence.

These sabotaging beliefs and character not only hold us back, but also weaken our image in the eyes of others, hurting our hopes for success.\n\n\nMental health and emotional well-being are necessary at every stage in our personal and professional life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.\n\n\nIf you have had confused or unpredictable childhoods, it is the norm to pick up unhelpful models of dealing with emotions.\n\n\nHowever, the healthy message is, emotions are honestly easy to study and once you know how they work, you can learn how to manage them more effectively!!\n\n\nAnalysis has shown ACT to be highly effective in many areas: such as performance management, job satisfaction, innovation and motivation to increase resilience to foster transformational control behaviours.\n\n\nI have used ACT and DBT in my practice to help young entrepreneurs, fresh graduates, job seekers, homemakers, employees and many other professionals to uncover their thoughts, healing them completely from chronic illness. Also, it helped their clients to become more flexible, resourceful and responsive, even under the most challenging of circumstances.\n\n\nI’ve studied and practised mindfulness from the perspective of ACT and DBT to explore human minds deeply. Further, conclude that you can’t be selective in your thoughts by diffusing a few and accepting a few. Also, to change habits, you need to believe in the process and have consistency. You need to be a vigilant observer of all the thoughts that arise in your mind and maintain a distance from them. It’s not easy but it requires consistent practice of many days/ months ultimately it is the way that helps you penetrate the nature of reality.\n\n\nWhen you master practising ACT and DBT skills, you start measuring your success, understanding how well your actions line up with your values, vision and mission in life. Besides, it gives a bigger perspective to your goals and let you achieve things on your terms.\n\n\nHence, check the previews and enrol for this course to grow your character that will deliver your genius to work productively and presently living.",

You will learn what a narcissistic person looks like – not the diagnosis but what traits you might see in either a parent or a partner. You will gain skills for rebuilding your sense of self and what might get in the way of moving forward. We will talk about setting boundaries and asking for what you want. We will also talk about triggers that keep you stuck. There is a guided meditation we will do with a writing exercise along with a homework video to explain everything I am offering you.\nIt is helpful if you have already left the relationship and are ready to move forward. With a parent, you are going to have them in your life no matter what and these skills will help you to be able to be with them without being the scapegoat. It is not easy but with practice and patience you will find you are able to be in the room with this person in a more peaceful and diplomatic way.\nWhile this is a mini-course, these skills will help you to get started and begin practicing the tools being offered here in your life. I hope to offer more courses here in the future.\nBonus Material: Added 12/25/22 How to have a Healthy Relationship After a Narcissist.",

Even if the books and courses you have taken have resonated with you at the time, you are still not moving forward with your ambitions and dreams.  Well, this course was created with you in mind.\nYou see, over the years, I too have read countless new age and personal development books, but it wasn't until I became certified as a Clinical Hypnotherapist using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) techniques and qualifying as a Stress Management, & Resilience Mindset Coach that the lightbulbs finally went on.\nThe secret to success in both your personal and professional life is mindset.....mindset.......mindset.\nWhat exactly does \"self-sabotage\" mean? Well....... its repeated thoughts, behaviours and attitudes that prevent us from achieving our goals, aspirations, and wishes.\nIt is a totally normal human trait that we all periodically exhibit self-sabotage without fully being aware of it.\nSelf-sabotage originates from the restrictive thoughts that we hold inside our minds, those limiting negative beliefs prevent us from growing. It's a significant problem that often goes undetected until we experience a vicious cycle of negative thinking that leads to stress and anxiety.\nSelf-sabotage can be motivated by emotions of fear or worthlessness and has a detrimental effect on our development, interpersonal connections, and overall health and wellbeing.\n\nA person may engage in self-destructive actions for a variety of reasons. It may be challenging for you to pinpoint the precise reason why you struggle with self-destructive behaviours, but a good place to start is by looking at the thoughts and actions  that prevent you from achieving your goals in life.\n\n\nThe inner critic or troublemaker; the name I give to the incessant mind talk is mostly responsible for self-sabotage, however, replacing habitual, self-critical thoughts with more nurturing and supportive ones is one of the key steps in eliminating self-sabotage.\n\n\nIn order to assist you to move closer to your goals, this course guides you through a number of action steps to help you stop self-sabotaging and to break free from the constraints of your self-berating beliefs and behaviours.\n\n\nOnce you master the tools and techniques your mind is free to focus on your hopes, dreams and desires.",

Learn to spot and replace disempowering phrases like “I am a failure” with empowering self-talk that rewires their inner dialogue for success.\nTurning Negative Labels into Growth Opportunities: When kids say “I am not good enough” or “I always mess up,” they’re locking themselves into limiting beliefs. Learn how to break this cycle by shifting their focus from fixed identities to growth-oriented thinking, empowering them to see challenges as opportunities for growth.\nTransforming 'Always' and 'Never' Statements: “Nobody likes me.” “I always fail.” Kids often use these sweeping statements, and they can crush their confidence. Learn simple, effective techniques to challenge these beliefs, and help your child replace negativity with a more balanced, empowering perspective.\nSmall Wins, Big Confidence: Confidence doesn’t come from leaps—it’s built step by step. Discover how to guide your child in taking manageable actions toward their goals, from making new friends to trying new skills. Learn how to turn each small success into a confidence-building moment that they’ll carry with them.\nSuperpower Confidence Game: Tap into your child’s imagination with the “What Would Your Hero Say?” game. Use their favorite superheroes or role models to inspire self-belief and resilience during tough moments. Watch as they transform into their own version of a confident, fearless leader.\nMastering Internal Strength: Help your child shift their focus from seeking approval to embracing their true self. Equip them with tools to cultivate inner strength and self-assurance, so they can thrive regardless of external pressures or setbacks.\nBody Language of a Winner: Confidence isn’t just what you say—it’s how you carry yourself. Teach your child the body language of confidence, from power poses to maintaining eye contact, and watch how these simple changes transform their interactions and self-perception.\nPositive Mindset Training: Cultivate a habit of looking for the good, even in challenging situations. Through engaging games and daily reflections, help your child see the world through a lens of possibilities instead of limitations, turning every setback into a stepping stone.\nWhy This Course is a Game-Changer:\nYou’ll walk away with actionable techniques that fit into your daily routines, making confidence-building a natural part of your family life. These are strategies that work in the real world—whether your child is dealing with shyness, negative self-talk, or struggles with making friends. By the end of this course, you’ll be able to help your child face their fears, embrace challenges, and believe deeply in their own potential.\nThis is more than a course—it’s a life-changing toolkit to raise a confident, resilient, and empowered child. Let’s start building a foundation of self-belief that will carry your child through every stage of life!",

      "description": "The Native Strength path is a centuries-old philosophy that uses medicine wheels to make sense of our world. Native American religion and culture were illegal in the United States until 1978. These teachings were part of that culture. You'll be introduced to the inner personas and the fear-feeders along with ways to help differentiate between the two.  When we learn how to listen to our inner elders and children more, the fear-feeders can't be heard. Our apprehension often holds us back from fulfilling our dreams. It's easy to imagine all of the things that can go wrong and talk ourselves out of just about anything. Once we recognize these voices of fear, they begin to develop sly ways of sneaking their toxic messages into our inner dialogue. It takes some practice to weed them out at this point and that's what this course can do for you.  We will examine the medicine wheel of fear-feeder voices that shows us the manipulative and creative ways they try to stop us from finding success and happiness. This course will help you to hear the voices of your inner elders clearer, filling you full of self-esteem and the inspiration you need to find success.\nLearn how to help yourself and others with these traditional techniques.",

      "description": "Exploring Multiple Perspectives Through Immersive Experiences\n\n\nIncorporating immersive learning experiences into question and answer studies and testing not only gives students with a thorough understanding of historical and cultural backgrounds, but also allows them to explore multiple views. Virtual reality environments can immerse students in complicated scenarios and narratives, prompting them to examine different points of view and sympathize with various experiences and obstacles.\n\n\nStudents can build critical thinking abilities and a sophisticated awareness of societal issues by engaging with immersive content that exposes opposing viewpoints or ethical concerns. Educators can help students analyze and evaluate multiple points of view in immersive environments, developing empathy and informed decision-making skills for real-world situations.\n\n\nFurthermore, the dynamic nature of immersive experiences enables the investigation of multiple narratives as well as the interconnection of global events, helping students to recognize the interconnectedness of history, culture, and social dynamics. This holistic approach allows pupils to have a more broad and inclusive understanding of their surroundings.\n\n\nFostering Empathetic Engagement with Virtual Experiential Learning\n\n\nImmersive learning experiences allow students to engage empathetically with varied experiences and historical situations. Simulated environments can transport students to critical events in history or new cultural situations, allowing them to experience these surroundings on a personal and emotional level.\n\n\nEducators can create immersive learning scenarios that encourage empathetic involvement by asking students to take on the viewpoints of people from various cultural backgrounds or historical eras. This experiential technique allows students to sympathize with others' living experiences, developing a strong sense of empathy and understanding across cultural and temporal barriers.\n\n\nEmpathetic interaction in virtual settings can help students gain a heightened understanding of social injustices, historical conflicts, and the richness of different cultural heritage, so contributing to their overall growth as empathetic and socially conscious individuals.\n\n\nTo summarize, incorporating immersive learning experiences into question and answer studies and testing provides a transforming chance to foster multiple perspectives and compassionate participation among students. By immersing children in multiple narratives and historical contexts, educators can build empathic, critically engaged citizens while also cultivating a profound awareness of global issues.\n\n\nPromoting Ethical Decision-Making with Immersive Experiences.\n\n\nImmersive learning, in addition to examining many views, can be an effective technique for developing ethical decision-making abilities. By immersing students in virtual simulations of ethical quandaries, instructors may guide them through complicated decision-making processes and encourage careful contemplation on the repercussions of their choices.\n\n\nThese immersive scenarios can encourage students to think about the influence of their decisions on diverse stakeholders, resulting in a better knowledge of the ethical consequences of their actions. This technique not only improves students' critical thinking skills, but it also fosters a sense of responsibility and ethical awareness, which are important in both personal and professional settings.\n\n\nFurthermore, by working on ethical decision-making issues in virtual environments, students gain the ability to traverse real-world ethical complications with better empathy, integrity, and moral reasoning. This comprehensive approach to ethical education provides students with the skills and ethical competence required to positively contribute to their communities and society as a whole.\n\n\nPromoting Mindful Reflection and Well-Being\n\n\nIt is critical that educators incorporate mindful reflection and well-being considerations into the design of immersive learning experiences. While immersive technologies provide intense and engaging educational experiences, it is critical that students' mental and emotional well-being be prioritized.\n\n\nEducators can implement activities that encourage pupils to participate in mindful contemplation and self-awareness, thereby improving mental health and emotional balance. Furthermore, fostering a supportive environment in which students may openly discuss their experiences with immersive technology and its impact on their well-being is critical.\n\n\nBy encouraging thoughtful reflection and well-being, educators can assist students in developing a healthy relationship with technology and navigating the digital realm with a sense of balance, self-awareness, and mindfulness.\n\n\nAs educators continue to capitalize on the power of immersive learning experiences, incorporating ethical decision-making, mindful reflection, and well-being considerations ensures that students not only gain a deeper understanding of diverse cultures and perspectives, but also develop the skills and awareness required to navigate the complexities of the modern world with empathy, integrity, and balance.",

      "description": "What You Can Expect To Learn\nThis is the seventh course (there are totally 7) from the \"6 Keys to ULTIMATE Confidence, Body, and Self-Esteem\" program, which will be a blueprint to boosting:\nEmotional Confidence-learn how to master your emotions, and successfully manage your emotions, so that you will master your negative emotions, and manage anger and fear successfully; become more in control, and enjoy peaceful confidence within you, but also become successful in managing emotions within your relationships, too.\nControlling our emotions is an essential feature of being human, and doing so while processing stress is an ability that can benefit our relationships with others and with ourselves. Take your first step on the road to enhanced emotional health by taking this course. We explore the impact of emotional health on your mental and physical well-being. We then show you how to identify your feelings and their origin to handle them in a constructive way to improve your emotional management by staying optimistic, kind and friendly. We then go through psychologist Paul Ekman’s ‘six basic emotions’ and establish the difference between ‘emotions’ and ‘moods’.\nThe course then delves into the concepts of ‘self-hatred’ and ‘self-love’. We illustrate how feelings of self-hatred and unworthiness may stem from early childhood trauma and show you how to silence your inner critic when it’s being unhelpful. We then investigate self-care strategies like erecting sensible boundaries, acting in character and moving past mental hindrances from the past.

      "description": "Have you ever walked away from a conversation thinking you should have asked for more, spoken with more confidence, or handled the situation differently? Whether you're negotiating a salary, discussing terms with a client, closing a sale, managing a team, or navigating everyday decisions, strong negotiation skills can dramatically improve your outcomes and your confidence.\nThis course is designed to transform the way you communicate and help you become a more effective, strategic, and persuasive negotiator. You’ll learn a wide range of professional techniques used by top negotiators in business, law, politics, and high-stakes dealmaking. Each concept is broken down into simple, practical lessons, making it easy for you to apply what you learn in real-life situations.\nYou will start by understanding the psychology of negotiation—what drives people to say yes, how decisions are influenced, and why preparation is the most powerful part of any negotiation. From there, we’ll dive into specific tactics such as anchoring, framing, mirroring, and using silence effectively. You’ll also learn how to establish your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA), which is a cornerstone of confident negotiation.\nThroughout the course, we will explore how to stay calm under pressure, how to respond when someone is being aggressive or unreasonable, and how to find common ground even in difficult conversations. You will also discover how to build rapport quickly, how to ask the right questions, and how to persuade without sounding pushy.\nIn addition to strategy and technique, this course will help you become more aware of body language, tone, and other nonverbal cues. You’ll learn how to read the room, pick up on hidden signals, and recognize when someone is bluffing or being dishonest.\nThis course is not just theory. It’s packed with real-world examples, practice exercises, and scenarios that you can relate to—whether you're negotiating a raise, closing a deal, buying a car, or simply trying to reach an agreement with a partner or colleague.\nBy the end of the course, you will be equipped with the tools, confidence, and mindset needed to approach any negotiation with a clear plan, a calm presence, and a high chance of success.\nThis course is ideal for professionals, entrepreneurs, freelancers, salespeople, managers, job seekers, and anyone who wants to become more persuasive and effective in their personal or professional life.\nNo prior experience is required—just a willingness to learn, reflect, and practice.

      "description": "How to establish personal boundaries at work while strengthening relationships with colleagues and boss?\n\n\nYou might say, “That’s not possible?”\n\n\nAs a business and career coach, I often encounter the same problem with my clients. In 8 out of 10 cases when it comes to personal boundaries, people choose the strategy: “Raise the shields and defend!” They act sharply, directly, and sometimes even aggressively, ignoring the feelings of those around them. The result? Instead of established boundaries, there are conflicts and damaged relationships.\nSound familiar?\nAt one time, I also struggled to set boundaries. I didn’t know how to say no to work, friends, and family. When I finally became exhausted and was on the verge of burnout from taking on too much, I started saying no too harshly, hurting and angering others. Then I also suffered from feelings of guilt.\n\n\nBack then, I didn’t know there was another way. But nearly 7 years have passed since then. My education in coaching, 6+ years of coaching practice, the creation of my educational programs, and studying tons of information on this topic have helped me understand why many people approach boundary setting ineffectively.\n\n\nBut there is another way.\nMy methodology: a simple principle\nGentleness + Clarity and Persistence + Empathy + Communication = Strengthening Relationships . This formula is the foundation of my course.\n\n\nPersonal boundaries are not just about knowing how to say “no.”\nThey are about:\n- Self-esteem and self-acceptance,\n- Understanding and managing your emotions,\n- Working with anxiety that destroys us from within,\n- Seeing and respecting others' personal boundaries.\nAnd most importantly, boundaries are about self-care.\n\n\nWhat awaits you in the course?\nThe course consists of three modules that will help you establish healthy personal boundaries at work (and beyond).\n\n\nModule 1: The Basics of Personal Boundaries\nIn this module, you will explore the fundamentals of personal boundaries, their importance, and how they impact your daily life. You will learn to recognize signs of boundary violations and develop strategies to address them.\nLessons:\nWhat are Personal Boundaries and Why Are They So Important?\nEmotions and Personal Boundaries: What's the Connection\nHow to Understand Your Emotions and Manage Them\nWhy Do I Try to Please Others: How to Break the Cycle\nThe Dangers of Tolerance\nRescuer Syndrome: What Is It and How to Stop It\nHow to Really Take Care of Yourself\nThe Whole Truth About Self-Love\nResult:\nBy the end of this module, you will understand the reasons behind your struggles with boundaries, learn to recognize discomfort as a sign of boundary violation, and be able to change the situation.\n\n\nModule 2: Personal Boundaries - Your Own and Others'\nThis module delves into the complexities of personal boundaries in various contexts, including work and personal relationships. You will learn how to navigate challenging situations and respect others' boundaries.\nLessons:\nBoundaries: Why Are They Such a Problem?\nSelf-Evaluation from a Scientific Perspective\nSelf-Acceptance\nHow to Deal with Anxiety That Makes You Take On Too Much\nNo, You're Not Wrong. Or What Is Gaslighting at Work?\nHow to Survive in a Toxic Company\nAbout Bad People, Interests, and Steve's Story\nThe Power of Healthy Aggression\nDefining and Building Personal Boundaries at Work: Techniques and Exercises\nHow to Learn to See and Respect Others' Boundaries\nWhat to Do If a Colleague Annoys You — Practical Tips\nOutcome:\nBy completing this module, you will understand your desires and limitations in communication with colleagues and loved ones, learn to express them correctly, and respect others' boundaries.\n\n\nModule 3: The Art of Saying \"No\"\nMaster the skill of saying \"no\" without feeling guilty or ruining relationships. Explore effective methods of declining requests in various contexts.\nLessons:\nHow to Say \"No\" Without Feeling Guilty: Refusal Techniques That Strengthen Relationships\nHow to Say \"No\" to Your Boss (When Simply Saying \"No\" Isn't Possible)\nHow to Correctly Decline Clients\nOutcome:\nAfter this module, you will be able to decline things that make you unhappy or exhausted without damaging your relationships with others — on the contrary, you will strengthen them.\n\n\nAfter the Course, You Will Be Able To:\nUnderstand your desires and limitations;\nSay \"no\" without feeling guilty;\nRespect others' boundaries;\nManage your emotions;\nEstablish healthy boundaries at work (and in life);\nSeparate work from personal life;\nPrevent burnout.\n\n\nCourse Format\nThe course includes:\nEngaging video lectures;\nA workbook.\nThe workbook will be your guide to the world of healthy boundaries — part of it you will write yourself! We have included the best techniques from psychology and coaching on setting personal boundaries.\n\n\nDoes this look like what you need right now?\nJoin us!

And if that’s what they’re doing, then it’s because they want to, not because they think they must.\nThey succeed because they feel worthy.\nThey know they deserve it.\nThere is not the slightest doubt in their mind that what they do will succeed.\nBecause they desire it to be so.\nWhat would it be like to have that kind of self-belief?\nWhat would it be like to make money out of something you find fascinating, and exciting, and (dare I say) easy?\nLike for example making a living by helping people become the most Magnificent versions of themselves by teaching them how to balance their chakras, access Ancient Egyptian energy and employ Spiritual Alchemy?\nThat’s madness, surely?\n(Let’s face it, what I do is next-level weird.)\nBecause if it’s not madness to believe that’s possible, (and it’s not, because I do make my living that way) then it means that whatever you want to do is possible too.\nJust so long as you believed that you’re worthy of success.\nOr worthy of anything.\nThis, my friend is a lesson I learned the hard way. 15 years of slog doing something I didn’t like, and then I replaced that income and surpassed it during one summer of self-exploration and energy clearing.\nI simply accepted that I deserve what I want.\n\nI went through the process that made that acceptance not only easy, but logical.\nThe next step is very much up to you.\nIf you think that you’re ready to accept that you were BORN worthy, then this journey will help you access that reality.\nAnd then it’ll show you how starting to believe that you can have what you want, when you want, how you want… will change your life for the better.",

      "description": "In this course, I'll explain to you the Internal Family Systems Therapy created by Richard Schwartz. It's a psychotherapeutic modality that assumes that we all have \"Parts\". Parts are explained as emotions and behavioral mechanisms that we use on a regular basis. They are usually causing dysfunctional patterns of behaviors that we want to change. With the help of this modality, you can help your clients, patients, and yourself to recognize where those patterns came from and what you need to do to change them to healthy mechanisms. It's a type of inner child work that can be compared to Schema Therapy in some ways. You use structured questions that you ask your Parts to be able to get to know them, appreciate them for their good intentions and ultimately take over for them and create new functional behavioral patterns. It's an amazing therapy that you can practice on yourself and use in daily life to create good habits, and appropriate boundaries,  promote healthy self-esteem, and practice self-compassion. Your Parts think they need to keep working for you, but with Internal Family Systems Therapy you can make them realize that they don't have to be active anymore because you are the \"Functional Adult\" now taking over for them. I'll provide you with my personal take on this therapy and with some advice when it comes to the use of this modality. It's the main modality that I use with clients, even though I have studied multiple common therapies like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Schema Therapy, Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, and Art Therapy. Internal Family Systems Therapy is by far the most successful for treating my clients and to use on myself to deal with emotions and difficult situations. In this expanded version of my previous course, I also talk about spirituality and working with transgenerational Parts and Past Life Parts. This approach is already very spiritual but I wanted to expand on it to give you more avenues to explore by yourself or with your clients.",

      "description": "Welcome to the multimedia course “The Hero’s Journey.”\nThis course is part of a trilogy that represents a true inner journey of deep transformation, profound change, and expanded awareness.\n\n\nThe Hero’s Journey is our story; every time we decide to change, to grow, to heal, we are walking the same path once taken by ancient heroes in myths, and by characters in fairy tales and legends.\nThis course represents the third and final stage — the return home. It is the moment when the hero, who symbolically represents each of us, has completed their journey and now possesses the qualities necessary to govern their own life.\n\n\nWhy choose my course?\nI have been accredited by the prestigious IAOTH, the International Association of Therapists, ensuring you a globally recognized certificate.\n\n\nThroughout this journey, you will encounter the 12 fundamental archetypes theorized by Carl Jung — true inner forces that live in our unconscious and influence our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\nThey are universal, ancient symbols that speak a deep language older than words; they are powerful energies that live within us.\nBut archetypes are not just psychological concepts — they are soul maps. Understanding them is like finding an inner compass that guides us through moments of uncertainty.\n\n\nThrough the symbolic journey we will take together, you will be able to:\n\n\nUnderstand yourself, others, and the world around you\nRecognize your inner blocks and understand why they exist\nMake peace with your past\nManage your emotional state\nRebalance and access these inner energies\n…and much more.\n\n\nIn this final stage of the journey, we enter the territory of inner maturity. The archetypes you will now meet will help you express your true power, your wisdom, and your most authentic freedom.\n\n\nYou will discover how to:\n\n\nTake control of your life and lead it with responsibility, by awakening the strong and stable presence of the Ruler\nTransform your inner world to positively influence the outer one, by tapping into the deep vision of the Magician\nObserve reality with clarity and compassion, through the inner calm of the Sage\nLive with authenticity and lightness, freeing yourself from masks and embracing the spontaneity of the Jester\n\n\nThe guided meditations and practical exercises you’ll find in the course will help you awaken and rebalance these inner forces, so you can connect with them in times of need and develop those archetypal qualities you may feel are distant or blocked in your life.\n\n\nEach archetype you encounter will be like a key, opening doors within you that are just waiting to be unlocked.\nThis course will provide you with all the insights and tools you’d receive in a live course — and even more.\n\n\nAre you ready to discover the archetypes within you and understand how they’ve shaped your life so far?\nAre you ready to achieve extraordinary results through them?\nAre you ready to begin your journey?",

      "description": "Most people don't realise, that when our main goal in life is to be approved of or accepted by others, we can unknowingly end up sacrificing our dignity, integrity and self-esteem in the process. When people behave like this, it's not uncommon to lose the trust, respect and admiration of others.\nOne of the main concerns that we have as human beings, is whether other people will like us, accept us, respect us and fundamentally appreciate us. So, the BIG question is, how might your life improve once you are no longer plagued by these insecurity issues?\nDeveloping strong social confidence in life requires that we stop trying to be someone that we're not, and start being true to who we actually are - which is something that not everyone is taught about from family or at school. The good news, is that worrying about what other people think of you doesn’t ever have to be a problem again.\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to;\nTransform the effectiveness of your communications with other people.\nSay 'No' to What you Want to Say 'No' to - With Genuine Confidence.\nSay 'Yes' to What you Want to Say 'Yes' to - With Genuine Confidence.\nManage your thoughts, emotions and develop far greater self-control.\nBuild authentic social confidence that also increases your self esteem.\nLive free from worrying about what other people might think of you.\nCommunicate with more openness, honesty, sincerity and authenticity.\nBuild healthier relationships that are free from dependancy or co-dependancy.\nJust be yourself with genuine confidence in ALL social situations.\nAnd much, much more...\n\n\nA wise man once said, 'When people won't accept themselves, how can they be accepted by anyone else?' So throughout this eye-opening course, we'll explore a range of crucial core truths, that if you build into your life and apply, will set you free from ever worrying about what other people think of you again.\nWhile you can’t control what other people think of you, you can control what you think of yourself and how you respond towards those who judge you unfairly. One of the main regrets that people have, is that they spend more time 'trying' to keep people happy, than what they do just being themselves.\n'Self Esteem Secrets: Why It's OK Not to be Liked By Everyone' will take you on an eye-opening, step-by-step journey towards better understanding yourself from the inside-out and accepting yourself from the outside-in. Upon completion, you'll understand with absolute certainty, why it's totally OK not to be liked by everyone.\nThis course comes with a Full 30 Day Money Back Guarantee, and if you're less than 100% satisfied, you can get a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase.",

      "description": "Unshakable Confidence: The Power of the Psychopathic Mindset\nWhen most people hear the word \"psychopath,\" they think of criminals and manipulators.\nBut that’s only half the story.\nWhat about the highly successful individuals who share psychopathic traits—yet never break the law, rarely harm others, and thrive in leadership, business, medicine, and politics?\nThese individuals operate with a level of confidence, decisiveness, and resilience that most people can only dream of.\nWhat if you could harness their strengths—without losing your empathy, integrity, or humanity?\nWhat You’ll Learn in This Course:\nHow high-functioning psychopaths think and behave differently from the average person\nHow to eliminate self-doubt and make decisions with absolute confidence\nThe secrets to charm, charisma, and unshakable social presence\nHow to stay cool under pressure, no matter the stakes\nThe power of ruthlessness in a healthy way—ensuring no one takes advantage of you\nHow to stop caring about others’ opinions and break free from people-pleasing\nHow to adopt these traits without becoming harmful, selfish, or narcissistic\nWho Is This Course For?\nNeurodivergent individuals who want to navigate the social world more effectively\nPeople pleasers and \"Nice Guys\" who want to develop confidence and assertiveness\nManagers and leaders who need to command respect and influence their teams\nShy and anxious individuals who want to experience what it feels like to be bold and decisive\nParents who want to role-model unshakable confidence for their children\nWhy This Course is Different\nMost confidence-building courses teach surface-level tactics. This course goes deeper, tapping into the psychology of the most naturally confident people on the planet.\nI’ve spent years working with psychopathic personalities—individuals who move through life without fear, self-doubt, or hesitation. Through this experience, I’ve identified the core mindsets and behaviors that make them so effective—and I’ll show you how to apply them ethically in your own life.\nI personally score highly in psychopathic traits (as part of my neurodivergence). Once I stopped suppressing these strengths and started using them, I built a thriving business, created a strong relationship and family, and completely freed myself from caring about what others think.\n\n\nYour Confidence Breakthrough Starts Now—At No Risk\nThis course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you have nothing to lose—except your self-doubt.\nAre you ready to develop the confidence of the world’s most successful people?\nEnroll now and start mastering psychopathic self-confidence—without losing your soul.\n\n\nMeet Your Instructor: Dan Munro\nDan Munro is a bestselling author, coach, and confidence expert. For nearly a decade, he has helped thousands of people-pleasers break free from self-doubt and develop unshakable confidence.\nBefore becoming a coach, Dan worked in rehabilitation for serious criminal offenders, helping them shift their mindsets and behaviors. This unique experience gave him rare insights into the psychology of power, resilience, and self-mastery.\nThis course brings together everything he has learned and applied in his own life as a coach, father, husband, and mentor.",

But, if you can change the way someone views the world, there is a chance those changes will be more impactful and last a lifetime.\n\n\nThis course touches on human-behaviours to change the way you think about others and yourself.\n\n\nRather than listing ways to be more confident, as a lot of confidence courses do, this course uses a way of learning which can result in a change in your views so that you no longer hold yourself back. This is achieved by sharing with you my own thoughts and research, to allow you to recall upon those when you feel your confidence and self-belief dipping.\n\n\nBy changing the way we think, we have the ability to achieve great things and remove the thoughts that usually hold us back.\n\n\nThe only way you can expect to see change and improvement in your life, is by having the ability to put yourself forward and do what it takes to progress.\n\n\nIf we don’t apply for the job, turn up at the interview, take the course or stand up in front of others and be seen, life will remain stagnant. How can it move if we don’t take the steps required to grow and progress.\n\n\nRather than learning lists such as:\n-stop criticising yourself\n-stand tall\n-be assertive,\nwe need to change the way we think. Learning what makes someone confident is great, but it lacks the ability to truly get into the core of our thoughts to facilitate a lifelong change.\n\n\nChanging our thoughts can massively change how we view ourselves and the world in which we live; and this course aims to give you some ideas to do that.\n\n\nIt is, without a doubt, a very different kind of confidence building course.",

      "description": "The Switch On to Life Method™\nA Coaching Framework for Identity, Insight & Intentional Living\nToday’s world doesn’t just require us to show up—it asks us to show up whole.\nThat’s why the Switch On to Life Method™ isn’t just coaching. It’s a transformative journey back to you.\nBlending psychological insight, emotional intelligence, and purpose-led action, this method helps you uncover your true identity, reframe what’s holding you back, and realign your life for sustainable, inside-out growth.\nWe don’t just coach the doing — we guide the becoming.\n\n\nPhase 1: RECONNECT\nAwaken awareness. Reclaim your identity.\nThis phase is about turning inward—gently, curiously, and courageously—to rediscover the parts of you that may have gone quiet. We lay the emotional and psychological groundwork here.\nLayers of this phase:\nIdentity Reconnection\nExplore your life story, values, and patterns to reclaim a grounded sense of self.\n→ Benefit: Know who you are, not just what you do.\nEmotional Awareness & Language\nLearn how to identify, name, and respond to emotions with clarity and compassion.\n→ Benefit: Navigate life with emotional fluency and strength.\nContextual Clarity\nUnderstand how your inner world influences your outer leadership, relationships, and presence.\n→ Benefit: See the ripple effect of internal shifts in every part of your life.\nInner Child & Wounds Insight\nWork with the emotional roots of recurring triggers or patterns that no longer serve you.\n→ Benefit: Reduce emotional reactivity and increase self-trust.\n\n\nPhase 2: REFRAME\nShift beliefs. Rewire the mind. Reclaim your truth.\nThis is the transformation engine—where old scripts are rewritten, and truth begins to take root. We challenge the narratives that have shaped your choices, often without your permission.\nLayers of this phase:\nLimiting Belief Transformation\nIdentify core beliefs that keep you stuck, and reframe them into truths that empower.\n→ Benefit: Break free from inner blocks and move forward with confidence.\nCognitive Rewiring & Mindset Tools\nUse evidence-based psychological tools to shift thought patterns and create new mental pathways.\n→ Benefit: Think differently, respond wisely, and build internal resilience.\nSelf-Talk & Narrative Reinvention\nLearn to recognise inner dialogue and replace it with language that reflects your worth.\n→ Benefit: Become your own inner ally—not your harshest critic.\nEmotional Agility & Regulation\nDevelop the ability to pause, reflect, and respond—especially in high-stress or uncertain moments.\n→ Benefit: Lead and live with composure, clarity, and conscious choice.\n\n\nPhase 3: REALIGN\nLive with clarity. Lead with congruence. Sustain the shift.\nThis phase brings it all together: insight becomes action. Growth becomes embodiment. And your life, leadership, or parenting aligns with your truth.\nLayers of this phase:\nStrengths Activation\nHarness your natural gifts and integrate them into daily life and leadership.\n→ Benefit: Build confidence, energy, and flow in what you do.\nValues-Based Goal Setting\nDesign goals rooted in who you are—not who others expect you to be.\n→ Benefit: Achieve what truly matters, not just what looks good.\nHabits & Boundaries for Energy Stewardship\nCraft sustainable rhythms and protective boundaries that honour your capacity.\n→ Benefit: Maintain your progress without burning out.\nPurpose-Driven Living & Leadership\nStep into a lifestyle and leadership approach that feels aligned, authentic, and alive.\n→ Benefit: Create impact that’s not just productive—but personally meaningful.\n\n\nWhy It Works\nUnlike quick-fix coaching or surface-level performance tools, the Switch On to Life Method™ honours your full humanity—mind, heart, body, and purpose.\nIt helps you go beyond surviving or performing, and into a space of thriving with intention.\n\n\nReady to Begin?\nThis is your invitation to return to yourself.\nTo uncover, unlearn, and rewire.\nTo lead your life from the inside out.\n\n\nLet’s Switch You Back On.",

      "description": "Do you feel nervous in situations where you will be meeting new people? Do you find yourself wishing you had more friends? How much does your shyness bother you or interfere with your life? Do people misinterpret your shyness as a sign of aloofness or a snobby attitude?\nNearly everyone sometimes feels shy:\nBefore making an important announcement\nWhen you want to make a good impression on someone\nWhen raising a delicate issue with someone in a position of authority\nWhen you have to make a complaint, etc.\nMany people across the world describe themselves as shy. They are concerned that people will look at them, evaluate them, and judge them poorly. They fear rejection.\nIn many cases, people are unhappy with this trait. Shyness prevents them from doing things they would like to be able to do, such as getting out and making new friends, assuming greater positions of responsibility at work. They would like to change things so that they wouldn’t have to feel like this.\nShyness refers to feeling awkward or uncertain in social situations. It is associated with self-consciousness, excessive monitoring of behavior and over-rehearsal of potential statements. For many people, making small talk, asking other people for directions, saying hello to a neighbor – is very difficult. They want desperately to participate in conversation, but feel ill-equipped to do so. They feel frustrated, alienated and excluded. They hesitate, can’t be spontaneous in speech, and don’t express opinions.

I wasn't challenging myself to tap into those scenarios with the intention of gaining more confidence and self-esteem and to grow.\nThank you very much for this course Joe.  -Estaban\n__________\n\"Excellent Material\nI'm only a quarter of the way through and have no hesitation in telling you that this is an excellent course. Joe is so full of enthusiasm for his subject, and covers some pretty deep stuff in a very engaging manner. There are plenty of udemy instructors who cobble together a short course, charge way too much, and hardly engage with students at all. Joe is totally engaged with his students and it's clear that he really wants to help. (Let me tell you, when you get to my age, you develop a very finely tuned BS detector. It never comes close to twitching when I watch Joe's stuff.) The best compliment I can pay this course is to tell you that I like to start my working day, at my desk, with a video or two from this course. Sets me up nicely for the day ahead. Will update this review when I've watched more of the course.\"   -Sam Pollard\nThis is by far my favorite Udemy course of all time! The videos are spectacular and like you said I was never bored! Incredible things I have learned about my own confidence and self-esteem just by enrolling in this course. You have great content. Please continue to make more courses like this!\"\n-Rachel Laveno\n\"It feels as though you were working with him on a 1 to 1 basis.\nThe goal of most self-development courses is very simple: to inspire others to take determined action in order to make changes in their lives. Yet many people fail to do so because sometimes the lessons are taught in a way that seem to make things more complicated than they need to be. I'm happy to say that this course is different. Joe Pary makes learning how to transform your confidence and self-esteem into a fun, easy and enjoyable experience. Filmed in high definition in multiple locations, Joe brings his audience into each lesson with him, making it feel as though you were working with him on a 1 to 1 basis. Joe's infectious, positive attitude coupled with a direct and to the point delivery makes increases the student's motivations, stimulates their desires and keeps them focused.

      "description": "Do you ever feel out of place socially—a little awkward and off-balance, and unsure of what to say or do while socializing, or during professional events or even romantic dates?\nDo you find it hard to get noticed or make a strong impression in your private and professional life?\nThen you need to learn the secrets of confidence and communication, the ability to stay calm and focused and to shine brightly in social situations—while remaining authentic to who you are.\nIt boils down to understanding two crucial skills—confidence and communication. And in this course, you’ll learn how to channel those two forces to achieve a sparkling presence that everyone will notice.\n\n\n\"I wish I can give more than 5. Life-changing course, it gives you a totally new mindset and helps you to build better relationships! Loosens you up and gives you hope that better understanding and practice will eventually lead to better social skills for everyone!\" - Alida Varju, Udemy student\n\"This is the 2nd course of TJ’s I’m doing, and I couldn’t praise him enough! Brilliant teacher, explains everything excellently and I couldn’t recommend this course enough! For me personally, best course on here!\" -- Ben Yates, Udemy student\n\n\nThe coach’s coach\nWelcome to “The secrets of Confidence and Communication\" —the unsurpassed personal-transformation program created by Norway’s most high-profile social coach, TJ Guttormsen. For over a decade, TJ has helped thousands of people suffering from a sometimes crippling lack of confidence to reinvent themselves as socially savvy individuals with endless opportunities.\nWith more than 100 national media appearances to date, TJ’s expertise on the subject of social confidence is widely sought after by television, radio, newspaper, and magazine reporters. He has shared the stage with countless celebrated self-help experts and change-work practitioners and published books, produced courses, taught workshops, and performed 1-to-1 coaching with results that have impressed the industry.\nTJ’s work is backed up by three university degrees in psychology and pedagogy, as well as a Mensa qualification. His grateful clients include billionaires, CEOs, award-winning musicians, and even an Olympic gold medalist.\n\n\n\"If you are serious at improving your socials skills, stop reading reviews of this course and smash that add-to-cart then checkout button. Seriously though TJ is one of the best instructors I've had here in Udemy. [...] 6 videos in, and I'm speechless how high of quality this is, so many \"aha\" moments for the concepts discussed, his manner of delivery puts me in a relaxed mood, and it is never boring!\" - Admor Aloysious Aguilar, Udemy student\n\"Massively Eye-Opening, Excellent Information. Wow!!!\" - Simon Aston, Udemy student\n\n\nCentered Confidence\nThe concept of centered confidence is rooted in something known as subtractive psychology, the understanding that the less you have on your mind, the more you can get in touch with your naturally confident self and begin to emit a magnetic presence.\nInstead of giving you more to do - more techniques, more affirmations, more stuff that doesn’t work - here, you will discover how letting go of harmful mental conditioning and how activating your psychological immune system will help your mind clear itself of negative thinking that dims your natural state of radiance.\nCentered confidence is about returning to your primordial state of calm and contentedness that many of you may have experienced as children but somehow lost as you grew through adolescence to adulthood.\n\n\n\"I have learned here more than I actually learned anywhere else. Life skills that one truly needs to know.\" - Sarah, Udemy student\n\"This video course is packed full of useful information. The course is very concise. (To the point, without any unnecessary words or \"hype\" in between.) Which is refreshing. So it is easy to repeat the separate videos for later, without feeling you're wasting time. Best of all - you can contact him directly with any questions you might have. He answers fast. My impression is that he truly loves doing this, and genuinely wants to help people.\" - Håkon M, Udemy student\n\n\nIn this groundbreaking program, you will discover why the “get-out-of-your-comfort-zone” model most self-help gurus tout rarely works. TJ shows that only by understanding two more zones—the growth zone and the panic zone—can you safely and constructively exit your comfort zone at will and begin seeing a massive difference in your progress.\n“The secrets of Confidence and Communication\" is a deep dive into the negative psychological programming we all experience growing up, but few know how to completely rid themselves of. You’ll also learn how to reprogram automatic and subconscious thought processes so that they go from being your biggest saboteurs to your greatest supporters.\nAmong many other advanced mental strategies, you will learn:\n· How to stop the self-critical voices in your head that keep you from taking action\n· How to substitute them for new voices that serve you better\n· Why you should immediately stop comparing yourself to others\n· How to turn your need for approval from an obstacle to social freedom into a helpful tool for growth\n· How and when to confidently say “no”\n· How never to be disappointed with yourself\n· How to stop feeling frustrated with others\n· How to quickly understand other people’s thoughts and intentions\n· How to accurately predict others’ behavior\n· How to identify the untested assumptions holding you back\n· How to break free from the “social hierarchy”, the idea that somehow some people have more social value than others\n\n\nCentered Communication\nCentered communication relies on three ingredients known to people who excel at sales, negotiation, teaching and influence. Those qualities are also what naturally good communicators, knowingly or not, apply to cultivate deep platonic and romantic relationships.\nThe three ingredients are rapport, tension, and escalation, and once you understand how they fit together and how to create each of them your social confidence and results will skyrocket immediately.\n\n\"I was looking for a course that helped me to improve my confidence, and moreover, to help me to communicate better with others, which is one of my weakness in all fields. This course has not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations, and it is surely a perfect start point to learn and improve on those things.\" - Moises Lorenzo León\n\n\nYou too will discover:\n· How to give clear information that gets you what you want\n· How to master your sub-communication to create a whole new impact from your words\n· The two rules for social success the masters all follow\n· Three simple ways to start conversations with anyone, anywhere\n· How to have a magnetic presence in social situations\n· How to create deep connections faster than ever\n· What makes people want more of you, and how to create it\n· How to boost your ability to make decisions and take initiatives\n· How to create relationships that somehow just work\nTJ has helped many hundreds of clients leverage these skills to achieve outstanding results - such as negotiating $20,000 pay rises, getting new jobs and promotions, healing broken family bonds, building amazing social circles from nothing, and creating their dream relationships.\n\n\n\"TJ Guttormsen is an authority in his field. He is very knowledgeable and bases his teachings on documented and effective strategies, which sets him apart from most coaches out there.\nTJ has a unique ability to teach in an engaging way and his courses are structured so that the content becomes easy to understand and learn… Anyone taking his course will be in great hands.\" - Lillian Rydning, Psychologist and Author.\n\n\nConsistent and reliable results\nWith a sharp focus on mind mastery, social awareness, and artful communication, the program takes students on a journey of self-discovery rooted in the most advanced and sophisticated modern approaches to human psychology.\nBy unmasking the dark psychological programming holding many people back, the program is designed to quickly and dramatically upgrade your self-confidence, revolutionize your relationships, and enhance how others perceive you.\nThe program’s focus, like all of TJ’s courses, is on consistent and reliable results—not the boom-and-bust approach of too many fly-by-night personal-change gurus.\nSo come aboard and learn many more priceless skills like:\n—How to bypass small talk and create conversations you actually enjoy with people you naturally click with\n—How to create and maintain friendly networks of people who’ll support rather than pressure, discourage or limit you\n—How to go outside of your comfort zone at an easy, manageable pace\n—How to live in your “growth zone,” where true confidence is built.\n—How to help others understand you better.\n—How to manage and understand your own emotions better than ever before\n—How to boost your emotional intelligence for smoother interactions\n—The secret to understanding other people’s insecurities and self-talk\n—How to understand a person at a deep level the moment you meet them\n—How to stop worrying about making a good impression, and what to do instead.\n—How to create an attractive personality and sparkling presence that makes people want to spend more time with you\n—How to go straight into conversations you find interesting and enjoyable with almost anyone you meet\n—How to become comfortable making the first move with someone you don’t know\n\n\nHow often have you missed out on connections that might have been perfect because you held yourself back or didn’t know what to do?\nHow many more professional opportunities do you think you might have had if you knew how to confidently communicate with others?\nHow many times have you felt like you wasted your time and energy on people or situations that went nowhere?\nAfter this course, you may never need to deal with such disappointments again. Enroll now and make this the day that everything starts to change for you.\n\n\n\"WOW!!!! Everyone, young and old alike will enjoy and learn from TJ's special style of teaching. I look forward to attending additional courses and am glad I invested in myself by taking this class. I wish this had been available to me when I was in middle school - I believe I would have benefitted a great deal and may have been able to deal with some of those \"awkward\" teenage / adult situations with greater ease and confidence. Everyone - YES EVERYONE - needs to take this class. THANK YOU, TJ!!!\" - Sara J. Kegley, Udemy student\n\"This course helped me understand the thoughts and ideas that were behind my inhibitions and lack of confidence. With each new lesson, I began to grow in knowledge and skills on how to present myself to others better and communicate with more confidence! Take this course if you want to be guided by someone who truly understands and identifies with people who struggle with social confidence. T.J. addresses the issues holding you back and offers many solutions, skills tricks, and tips to help you increase your confidence!\" - Flo Bell, Udemy student",

      "description": "EVER BEEN ASKED TO STEP UP TO A LEADERSHIP POSITION OR BEEN ASKED TO PITCHED YOUR BUSINESS AND WONDERED…\n“How am I going to lead others so they believe in me?”\nOr\n\" How am I going to pitch my business idea to strangers; how do I handle the rejection?\"\n\n\nIf any of those thoughts ever crossed your mind, then this course is for you.\n\n\nWe are not all born confident, daring and courageous. Actually, very few people are. I sure wasn't. But if you look at my track record: being an international corporate lawyer for over 15 years, working with business leaders from around the world, stepping on stage as a public speaker and building my own multi-million dollar businesses you'd wonder how I did all that.\n\n\nMy strategy: I learned the skill of confidence. Confidence opens more doors and offers more opportunities than any other skill.\n\n\nIt has been said that \"success correlates more closely with confidence than it does with competence. Yes, there is evidence that confidence is more important than ability when it comes to getting ahead\" Katy Kay and Claire Shipman\n\n\nI want you to open all the doors and grab all the opportunities that are available to you. And that’s exactly the goal of this course: to teach you the skills you need so you never again feel like you are waiting on the sideline of your life.\n\n\n\"The problem is not your capacity to dream or execute. The problem is that you don’t believe, yet, that you have it in you to achieve all those dreams, to create that life for yourself and to build that hugely profitable business. And the reason you have a hard time believing it is because you don’t have the confidence yet, to believe.” Eloïse Gagnon\n\n\nI set out to create this online training course to give you actionable tools and techniques to build a strong foundation of confidence so you can lead anyone with authority and respect, introduce yourself to anyone, make a lasting impact, get over the fear of rejection, put your ambitions into actions and close more business deals.\n\n\nWhether you’re just a few years into a new business or an established executive looking to expand, this course will challenge you to execute at your highest level and become a more confident version of yourself.\n\nI've taken everything I've learned over the past 20 years as both an international corporate lawyer for over 15 years and as a leadership coach, and I've combined it into a 4-step transformational process available to you in this online video training program.\n\nIn all those years, I’ve been able to observe, implement and coach on what makes a great leader, how entrepreneurs close deals, how public speakers ignite crowds and how executives command respect, influence and presence.\n\nI’ve seen students and clients go from fearful and uncertain to assertive, bold and increasingly profitable in a matter of months.\n\nThis course is different from any other course out there because it goes to the root of your confidence; it gives you solid strategies you can implement right away so you see results and are motivated to keep improving.\n\n\n“There are two kinds of courses, one which are useful in short run, and the select few which can change your life, this is one of the latter. This course deals with innovative and motivating concepts. Join this course if you want to challenge your way of thinking. A must for anyone looking to go beyond what they think they can achieve. Thank you so much Eloïse for making such a course available” Erin Stein - Student on Udemy\n\n\n“Outstanding course. Eloïse is a brilliant instructor and clearly an expert in her field. By implementing her teachings, I can already see a huge difference in how I hold myself and present myself to others. Highly recommended” Victoria Peladeau - Student on Udemy\n\n\n“ This course was really inspiring and the workbooks really help put everything in practice. Highly recommend” Amanda Lucas - Student on Udemy\n\n\n“The best confidence course I have ever seen! I have struggled to build my confidence since college, and I ended up always underperforming in life. This course explains concepts to me in the most innovative and easy to understand way possible. Thank you for being so inspirational Eloïse!” Samantha Pearson - Student on Udemy\n\n\nThis course will help you:\n\n\nLead others with conviction and influence\nDevelop the habits that make confidence second nature\nBuild the discipline to follow through on your commitments so you build trust in yourself and in others\nDouble your success at reaching seemingly impossible goals\nEstablish a strong foundation of self worth\nDeliver on what you promise\nChannel your focus and prioritize your time\n\n\nEach module comes with a detailed Workbook so you can dive deeper into what’s been holding you back and unlock what will propel you forward.\n\n\nThat's over 90 PAGES of worksheets to help you deepen your knowledge and really implement the tools and skills I teach in this course.\n\n\nI’m thrilled to hand you the step-by-step system I used to build my confidence to travel the world, work alongside successful business leaders, build 7 and 8-figure businesses, graduate law school and run triathlons, all before the age of 30.\n\n\nBuilding confidence, growing a profitable business and stepping up as a leader is not rocket science but you do need to implement the right knowledge that will allow you to get there.\n\n\nIf you are ready to take the next step in your life and in your business, then join Confidence Skills for Entrepreneurs and Executives.\n\n\nOur ideal students are driven, ambitious and willing to learn a new way to create an impact and build a profitable business.\n\n\nSee you in class!\nTo your success,\nEloïse\n\n\n“Such a powerful course on confidence. Eloïse, you are a great instructor. The concepts you teach and your style of teaching are life changing. I didn't realize how much my lack of discipline and my \"victim's mentality\" were actually holding me back in my life and in my business. You ask hard questions but for once, I have a plan of action to build myself and my business up. Highly recommend this course!” Veronica Marri - Student on Udemy\n“Great course even greater instructor. This is a clear path to build your self while building a profitable business. No fluffy stuff you find in other courses. The workbooks are intense but they push you to figure out what it means to be confident and to level up. Eloïse is passionate and very knowledgeable. Her enthusiasm is so contagious. Highly recommend” Calvin Morris -Student on Udemy",

Making mistakes is a natural part of being human. We can't avoid them, but we can learn from them. Mistakes, setbacks and obstacles are crucial to our growth process. Sometimes, a mere shift in perspective can reveal the value that a mistake can offer.\n\n\nFailure plays an essential role in our journey of growth and improvement.\n\n\nFar too often, driven by the fear of not making it, we end up abandoning our dreams in a corner. However, the biggest mistake we can make is to give up before even starting. The more we postpone, the feeling that the perfect moment will never come becomes stronger and stronger.\n\n\nThe right moment to take action is now!\n\n\nIn this course, you will be guided step by step through powerful strategies and proven techniques to transform the fear of failure into confidence. You will learn how to identify and overcome your fears, eliminate self-sabotage, and develop a mindset that will propel you towards your goals.\n\n\nThe first step will involve exploring your comfort zone, learning to push yourself beyond your usual boundaries, and seizing growth opportunities that arise along your path.\n\n\nThe second step will be understanding your fears. The fear of failure represents one of the most common forms of fear, an emotion that can manifest in various ways. It can lead you to procrastinate or even avoid taking action, play it safe, or even self-sabotage. You will also understand the effects that fear can have on your body and discover the underlying causes behind the fear of failure, as well as the behaviors you adopt to protect yourself from it, behaviors that actually hold you back.\n\n\nThe third step will be to transform your fears into courage by renewing your mindset. You will learn how to tap into the courage that lies within you, gaining greater self-confidence and self-esteem.\n\n\nAs the fourth step, you will learn a series of practical techniques that you can apply immediately to overcome your fears, stop procrastinating, and develop a positive mindset that will drive you to take resolute action.\n\n\nFinally, we will provide you with an extra resource: a step-by-step guide consisting of nine phases to help you define your action plan.\n\n\nThrough engaging lessons and practical exercises, you will discover how to turn failure into a springboard for success. This course will provide you with powerful tools to maintain motivation and develop resilience that will enable you to face any obstacle with confidence and determination.\nWhether you are an entrepreneur, a freelance, or simply someone who wants to fully realize themselves, this course is suitable for you. The fear of failure will no longer stand as an insurmountable barrier, but rather an opportunity for growth and personal development.\nDon't allow fear to hold you prisoner and prevent you from achieving everything you desire. Take control of your life and unleash your full potential.\n\n\nDon't wait any longer.\nEmbrace your courage!\n\n\nEnroll now and embark on your journey towards a life filled with success, fulfillment, and confidence!",

And it’s keeping them from unlocking their full potential – in their career, in relationships, and in life.\n\n\nPeople with just average abilities but strong self-confidence often end up getting more out of life than incredibly talented people who doubt themselves.\n\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\n\nThat’s why I created this course. I want you to finally see what you’re truly capable of – and go after it. Whether it’s finding a fulfilling relationship, excelling in your career, or finally getting the respect you deserve. It all starts with one thing: A rock-solid self-esteem.\n\n\nIn this course, you’ll discover a powerful, time-tested technique to transform your self-esteem in just 15 minutes.\n\n\nAnd here’s the kicker – once you learn it, you’ll be able to boost your confidence in just 2 seconds, whenever you need it.\n\n\nYou deserve more. Let’s make sure you get it.",

I am not a big fan of the final section as this is a bit too \"pseudo-psychologic\" for my preferences, but this is even a bonus section so it doesn't really count as a negative argument :)\nYou are looking for a course with many easy to implement techniques.\n\"Double your confidence\" by Jimmy Naraine is a great choice for you. For me it was lacking structure and was too short-term oriented, but there surely were many great short-techniques to quickly boost your confidence. My two favourite ones are part of this course.\nYou are looking for a course to increase your charisma and do not care about the price.\n\"Charisma University\" by Charisma on Command is the right choice for you. It is hosted on their own website and was with 600$ far too expensive in my opinion. However, when you have the luxury of not having to worry about money, there surely is a lot of value in this course.\nYou are looking for a course to build long-lasting confidence and care about structure.\nThen this course right here is the right choice for you. You have to be willing to take action, but if you are ready to take ownership of your self-confidence this is by far the most complete course currently out there (At least from what I have stumbled upon on so far).\nImagine the main insights from 50 books  and 8 courses, squeezed into an easy to understand framework to give structure to this information.\n\n\nAnd if you are wondering why I recommend other courses here, this is because it is not about the competition but about helping you overcome the tough situation of not feeling good enough. Plus, as I know that every person has different preferences.",

So it's a self-perpetuating cycle.\nI want us to stop this cycle. I want to use shadow work to get into the nitty-gritty of why we procrastinate.\nI believe most of us paint the brown leaves green when we look at why we procrastinate by treating the symptoms, but we don't get into the roots of it. Why do we procrastinate? It isn't because we are lazy, or stupid, or whatever else we might tell ourselves. It is because there is something we should be dealing with, but we aren't.\nWhat is it exactly?\nThis course will help you figure that out. I am hoping through the mix of video lectures, worksheets, and quizzes, you will be able to get ahead of the curve with procrastination. So that the next time it comes at you, you will be able to use that opportunity to collect data on yourself, and kill procrastination in its tracks.\nWe all have so many gifts that we aren't utilizing because we spend so much of our time procrastinating. Let's stop doing that to ourselves. Our gifts are way too precious for us to do that. The world needs our gifts.",

      "description": "Welcome to my course \"BPD Healing and Superpowers\". I'm Bex Renee, a Reiki Master and Shamanic/Nordic healer, course designer, and content creator. I specialize in designing subliminals and meditations, as well as neuroscience, witchcraft, and frequencies (I also dabble in tarot and astrology in my spare time).\n\n\nI was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and ADHD three to four years ago and felt it was time to create this course. I've compiled my knowledge and techniques from my professional expertise and my personal BPD healing journey.\n\n\nIn this course, we're going to approach things differently. We'll start by discussing the three therapies: DBT, Schema therapy, and MBT. Then, we'll delve into the nine BPD criteria and how to work on them individually for healing. We'll also explore the neuroscience of BPD and learn about the brain, gaining awareness of our behaviors.\n\n\nMoving forward, we'll learn to embrace the shadow part of ourselves through ancestral healing, brain reiki, inner child healing, core wounds, and other shadow work tips. Finally, we'll conclude with the \"self-love\" section, where we'll explore loving ourselves, having compassion for ourselves and others, healing with reiki, writing a love letter to ourselves, and transforming BPD into a superpower.\n\n\nThis course provides ample resources and activities for you to work on in your own time. The lectures are designed to be colorful, versatile, and easy to follow and understand. All you need for this course is a pen and paper to take notes.\n\n\nRemember, there's no right or wrong way to heal BPD. I've included a wealth of information so you can find the healing methods that work best for you. Despite being a single mother with three children, managing a four-bedroom house, and running a business, I've been able to manage my ADHD and BPD, and I believe you can too.\n\n\nLet's not pay attention to negative claims about BPD on the internet. With consistency and time, BPD can be healed, managed, and even used for good. You just have to take those steps. I believe in you and hope to see you in my course.\n\n\nBe sure to check out my profile for links to my other services. Have a blessed day!\n\n\nBex Renee",

      "description": "Hello and welcome to this course on gaining greater self-esteem.\nI am David Barton, and I have created this course to help people like you develop your self-esteem and shape a better opinion of yourself.\nMy basic goal here is to help you learn to love and appreciate yourself more. Essentially that is what self-esteem is; it’s a type of self-love and appreciation. A measure of worthiness; how worthwhile you feel as a human being. This translates into the way you appreciate and love others too.\nThere are many components that come together to create a healthy self-esteem, and we will cover several of those in this course.\nI believe that no one is born with an unhealthy self-esteem. That unfortunate state arrives as we grow and develop in the world. In this course we will explore some of those negative influencers and challenge the values and beliefs we have internalized from them which hinder our growth and enjoyment of life.\nActually, that is my goal for you; to help you reverse some of these negative effects which have been imparted to you.\nIf you decide to take this course, then please download and use the companion workbook I have created. The workbook is designed to give you the best value from the material.\nI hope that you will join me on this journey as we delve into the world of building better and healthier self-esteem.",

      "description": "Do you suffer from self-harming thoughts? Do you have a habit of comparing yourself to others’ success? Do you want to stop being pessimistic in everything that you do? Would you rather take your life and career to a higher level or rather just land that dream job you have always desired? Have you ever felt stuck or limited in your abilities? If so, you might benefit from adopting a growth mindset. A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, hard work, and perseverance. This concept, popularized by psychologist Carol Dweck, can significantly transform the way you approach challenges in both your personal and professional life. Embracing a growth mindset encourages resilience. When you face obstacles, you begin to view them as opportunities to learn rather than setbacks.

Howard guides you through the complete course including your controls, settings, techniques, basic skills, and then on to emergencies and other helicopters. We start out in the trainer helicopter, the Cabri G2 through most of the course.  This is the default helicopter in MSFS or FS2020/2024. IIt is made for training and it has a native helicopter flight model.  You learn to handle this in every phase of flight.\nThen you graduate to bigger and more powerful helicopters. Howard will demonstrate a variety of helicopters available in Microsoft's Flight Simulator that you can fly, both free and payware.\nThe skills you learn here can be used in any flight simulator, but demonstrations and pictures are taken of the Cabri G2.\nWhen you are done, you will confidently handle any helicopter you wish to fly in a flight simulator.",

When we mature it, we can implement our original Spiritual Contract so we can play our part in helping humanity.\nNow the question is: Are you ready to take on the natural cosmic energy currents, freely offered to us, in order to take your life to the next level? Or are you going to deny, to yourself and the world, the spark of the amazing brightness of your soul?”\nFrom “Shamanic Journey – Crossing the Portal 2020 - 2021”\nBy Dr Ana Garcia PhD, DTM.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n“All through our lives we are conditioned by the people and institutions around us to fit the Status Quo. In order to be accepted by others, we develop masks which conceal the person Who We Really Are and somehow manage to lose ourselves in the busy and frantic process of living! The resulting loss of centre brings the feeling of being pulled in all directions by external circumstances, which limits our chances to achieve our true potential. But I believe that every individual has a Hidden Gift, a special talent which makes us unique and which needs to be shared with the world. Finding helps us realize that we really count and that we can really make a difference”\n\n\nTHE EXERCISES\nThe exercises in this course are designed to be done at home as you take time to reflect, consider, meditate and investigate them. You will align yourself with a more holistic vision of yourself, and will trigger your own advice, guidance, direction and healed perspective of your life.\nWhen we are ready to move onto the next level in our journey of development, we leave our conditioning or limiting thoughts and beliefs behind, and work on replacing them with newer, freer and more expansive ones.\nIt can be painful. Think of a snake shedding the skin: it first has to stuff itself in order to gain a larger size, then starve itself in order to loosen it – that is the vulnerable time of the process: when the snakes’ eyes are blurred as the skin is loose.\nIt is the transition time but it has to be done.\nWhether the transition is hard or not, whether the period of time that it takes for the change to take place is long or short, whether we are in pain or we hardly notice the process… it is always the person that persists who completes the lesson and shifts to the next level.\nWe learn to deal with the process of transmutation the more we pay attention to it.\nDifferent people have different rhythms and speeds. We need to be patient: our turn will come, generally when we least expect it. We also need to recognise that every step, no matter how painful may be, is another step towards freedom.\nI hope you will enjoy the program as much as I did when I wrote it, and I wish for you to find and develop your Hidden Gift!\n\n\nCHAPTER 1: UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR THE SELF\nEXERCISE 1: MEDITATION\nEXERCISE 2: LIST OF GIFTS\nEXERCISE 3: POSITIVE Vs NEGATIVE\nEXERCISE 4: MY DIARY ENTRY\nEXERCISE 5: “PATH TOTEM ANIMAL” MEDITATION\nEXERCISE 6: UNFINISHED BUSINESS\nEXERCISE 7: COMPASSION AND EMPATHY\nEXERCISE 8: ACCEPTANCE\nEXERCISE 9: SELF-RESPECT\n\n\nCHAPTER 2: FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS\nEXERCISE 10: ATTRACTING YOUR DREAMS\nEXERCISE 11: PLAYFULNESS\n\n\nCHAPTER 3: SELF-CONFIDENCE Vs SELF-ACCEPTANCE\nEXERCISE 12: BREAKING CO-DEPENDENCE\nEXERCISE 13: LOYALTY\nEXERCISE 14: CLEANSING\nEXERCISE 15: PROTECTION\n\n\nCHAPTER 4: FACING YOUR FEARS\nEXERCISE 16: MEDITATION “NAMING YOUR FEAR”\nEXERCISE 17: MEDITATION “CIRCLE OF FEAR\"\n\n\nCHAPTER 5: MAKING CHANGES\nEXERCISE 18: MEDITATION “DARE TO DREAM IT”\nEXERCISE 19: GATHERING\nEXERCISE 20: SURRENDER\n\n\nCHAPTER 6: CARRYING OUT THE ACTION\nEXERCISE 21: COMMITMENT\n\n\nCONCLUSION AND SUMMARY\n\n\nNote:\nI have included the EBook \"The Hidden Gift - Developing Your Full Potential\" in the resources tab of the last module.\n\n\n* BONUS VIDEO 1: Short Reiki Healing Session\n* BONUS VIDEO 2: Who is Dr Ana?

      "description": "Welcome to Mastering Your Mind: A Guide to Schema Therapy.\nThis course is an invitation to embark on a powerful journey of self-discovery and emotional healing through the lens of Schema Therapy. Designed to help you uncover and transform the deeply rooted patterns that shape your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, this experience offers a comprehensive and practical approach to personal growth.\nSchema Therapy centers around the concept of early maladaptive schemas - core emotional themes and beliefs that are formed in childhood and reinforced throughout life. These schemas often influence how we see ourselves, relate to others, and respond to challenges. In this course, you’ll learn how to recognize these patterns and understand the ways they impact your daily experiences.\nGuided by experienced Schema Therapy practitioners, you'll begin with a clear, accessible introduction to the foundational concepts: the formation of schemas, the coping mechanisms that maintain them, and the schema modes that drive your emotional responses. From there, we’ll delve deeper, using a blend of expert instruction, interactive exercises, and real-world examples to bring the material to life.\nYou’ll develop practical tools for identifying and challenging your own schemas, with strategies for shifting out of limiting behaviors and into more adaptive, empowered ways of living. Whether you grapple with abandonment, mistrust, unrelenting standards, or self-sacrifice, this course will equip you with actionable techniques for healing and growth.\nBeyond personal insight, we’ll also explore how Schema Therapy enhances your relationships, supports boundary-setting, and improves communication. You'll learn how to foster healthier dynamics with others while building a stronger, more compassionate relationship with yourself.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll not only understand the inner workings of your mind more deeply, you’ll also be prepared to make meaningful changes that lead to greater fulfillment, clarity, and emotional resilience.",

With the assistance of this insightful training, you can become your own greatest detective by finding what destructive beliefs are stopping you from true happiness and contentment in your working and private life.\n\n\nThis Self-Development tutorial focuses on breaking the “invisible barriers” that we impose upon ourselves, becoming more confident and prosperous as a result.\nYou will be shown how the human mind constructs strong opinions, creates subconscious traps, and implants fears that can adversely affect a person’s actions and feelings.\n\n\nAcknowledging the presence of these mental obstructions will be a significant step towards having clarity and a fulfilling and sustainable life that is bursting with positivity.\n\n\nMaster your mind now and find the secrets to achieving well-being and wealth by embracing your strengths.\n\n\nRead the book all the way through. Even if there are parts which you do not understand, keep reading. The book is written in a way that you will get the breakthroughs regardless, since it is talking to the unconscious part of your mind.\n\n\nThe course is delivered through our online learning platform, accessible through any internet-connected device. There are no formal deadlines or teaching schedules, meaning you are free to study the course at your own pace and come back to it time and time again.\n\n\nYou are taught through a combination of:\n\nVideo lessons\nOnline study materials\nYou have access to me via questions you may have. Take advantage of this opportunity. I charge $500 per hour if that gives you an idea. This is not a Mickey Mouse course. :-)\n\n\nWarning!\n\nThe EGO will give you pain when you want to go deep and really take care of things properly.\nThe EGO is a double agent and it does not want you to heal and truly transform and reach your purpose! The EGO promotes fear and superficial approaches, which most people fall for.\nAlso, when the fear shows up, most people turn around and go back to the safe zone, which is deadly. That's why so many people are not doing well today.\n\n\nSolution:\n\nUse conscious effort to keep pushing yourself. Without that, there is not a chance to make it!\n\n\nI wish you great success!\n\n\nRemember that the level of success will depend on your inner mind's discipline, your ability to catch yourself in negative situation and continuously remove your opposing beliefs, your unruly shadows, your inner conflicts and go for the goals you want.\n\n\nCheers and good luck!",

The air forces around the world are already doing this in their pilot training as is saves a fortune. So whatever type of flying you want to do this is an inexpensive way to go.\nToday the flight sim on your own computer with a VR headset is almost like the real thing. (Yes it is!) I am a real pilot and done plenty of both. I love flying in VR because it is FREE. Loads of cool aircraft to fly too as FREE downloads. You can easily build hundreds of flying hours experience for FREE.\nIf you want to be a commercial pilot there is no option but to spend heaps of cash, join the military or land yourself a scholarship with a big airline. But in the meantime you can learn with me on your own PC almost for free. My courses are an excellent introduction to being a pilot.\nYou will need a joystick and controllers too and a flight sim programme. I use X Plane 11 and microsoft flight sim. VR headset is highly recommended but not essential.\nDon't waste cash at the local flying school just yet. I am a Multi engine pilot and skydiver, I qualified as a pilot in 1996. I ran my own flying school \"The Baron Flying Club\" at Shoreham airport in East Sussex, where students were trained to PPL and multi engine PPL standard CAA UK.\nToday I teach private students only.\nI love doing low flying and aerobatics but I want to bring my online training to everyone, students, people who simply cannot afford it, or do not have the medical requirements because lots of people do fly just for fun and are not actually interested in going commercial. Sim flying is actually better than the real thing in many respects mainly the cost.\nUsing pc and mac based flight simulators we can go through every aspect of flight school without the crippling cost in easy stages and make it fun. Flight sims are not held up by the weather either as real aircraft often are, the realism levels are awesome. I enjoy flying the flight sim every day, We really can go anywhere in the world to fly.\nDo it in your own time as much or as little at a time as you like, At the end of my courses you will know if you have the ability, desire or need to actually lash out thousands and thousands of your own cash to fly the real thing.\nThe drones are the future certainly for combat aviation. They will be controlled by someone on a computer sitting in a room on the other side of the world.\nVR headsets are really very good for flying and I highly recommend them. In my opinion it really is worth investing in a good joystick, throttles and rudder pedals, even second hand ones from ebay can be found at a good price.\n\n\n\n\nBlue skies!",

      "description": "Encouraging Lifelong Learning with Technology\n\n\nBeyond the immediate academic benefits, using technology into question and answer studies and testing instills in pupils a desire to learn for the rest of their lives. Students develop adaptability, ingenuity, and curiosity by using digital tools and creative learning platforms, all of which are necessary for ongoing personal and professional development. This proactive approach to learning prepares students to be nimble problem solvers and lifelong learners, ready to flourish in an ever-changing world.\n\n\nFinally, the intentional use of technology in question and answer research and testing has far-reaching consequences for student engagement, skill development, ethical considerations, and the promotion of a lifelong learning attitude. As educators negotiate the changing educational landscape, the deliberate and intentional use of technology will continue to construct a dynamic, inclusive, and future-ready learning environment for all students.\n\n\nExtending the Boundaries of Learning with Immersive Experiences\n\n\nImmersive experiences have enormous potential in technology-integrated question and answer research and testing. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality provide revolutionary potential for students to interact with complex information in a fully experiential way. Students can immerse themselves in virtual settings and simulations to investigate theoretical topics and real-world problems with unparalleled depth and detail.\n\n\nThese immersive experiences not only pique students' interest and curiosity, but also promote a visceral grasp of the subject. Whether conducting virtual experiments in science or navigating historical events through interactive simulations, these immersive experiences push the boundaries of traditional learning, allowing students to gain insights and knowledge that traditional teaching methodologies cannot provide.\n\n\nUsing such immersive technologies in question and answer studies and testing not only improves students' learning, but also instills a sense of wonder and interest, kindling their inherent urge to learn more about the subject matter.\n\n\nFostering Creativity and Innovation with Technology-Integrated Learning.\n\n\nIn addition to obtaining academic knowledge, technology-integrated question and answer sessions and testing platforms promote creativity and innovation. Students can use digital tools and collaborative platforms to engage in open-ended problem-solving, brainstorming, and ideation processes that are similar to real-world innovation techniques.\n\n\nFurthermore, the interactive and dynamic character of technology-integrated learning encourages students to take chances, experiment with ideas, and adopt an attitude of continual development. This not only fosters their creativity but also instills an inventive mentality, which is critical for meeting the problems of the twenty-first century.\n\n\nBy seamlessly incorporating technology into the learning process, educators can nurture a generation of forward-thinking problem solvers capable of tackling complicated situations with inventiveness and originality.\n\n\nEnabling Personalized Learning Journeys with Data-Driven Insights\n\n\nThe use of technology in question and answer studies and testing offers a wealth of data that may be used to tailor and maximize each student's learning experience. Educators can learn a lot about students' learning styles and preferences by evaluating trends in their responses, engagement levels, and areas of difficulties.\n\n\nThese data-driven insights enable instructors to personalize instructional materials, interventions, and support mechanisms to each student's individual requirements. Personalized learning journeys can be designed to provide additional resources for further research or focused support in difficult areas, ensuring that every student has relevant and impactful learning experiences.\n\n\nFurthermore, the use of data-driven insights enables educators to uncover systemic trends and areas for curriculum refinement, resulting in ongoing improvement of the overall educational experience.\n\n\nFinally, incorporating technology into question and answer studies and testing not only improves academic performance but also acts as a catalyst for nurturing creativity, enabling personalized learning journeys, and pushing the boundaries of traditional learning through immersive experiences. As educators embrace the possibilities of emerging technologies, the educational environment is set for substantial transformation, helping students to succeed in an ever-changing and interconnected world.",

I enjoy doing it; otherwise, I would have stopped it by now. I love writing, and it will help others when they read it.\nIn this course, I have written about self-confidence and self-esteem, how it affects you, and how you can develop it. Many entrepreneurs out there quickly lose confidence when they face failures in their industry; an entrepreneur needs to maintain trust and prepare to face challenges in their entrepreneurial journey. So, they will learn to overcome the downfalls and stay in the industry when they read this course.\nWhat you will learn in this course is as follows.\nWhat helps you to develop lasting confidence?\nWhat are the confidence-boosting habits?\nAs a Woman, I Know My Self-worth\nEffects of Low Self-confidence\nHow to boost self-esteem and confidence?\nThen, the symptoms of low self-esteem and how you can help someone who suffers from it. A person with low self-confidence must know their problem. They might refuse to accept, but you must explain to get it. Giving assurance about regaining self-esteem is crucial. Then, they need to know the long-term effects if the problem is left unattended.\nFurther, I have written about the impact of low esteem and how it affects relationships. You have to self-love yourself to boost your self-confidence.\nSometimes, the kid also suffers from low self-esteem; I have mentioned how to increase their self-confidence. We all know confidence will give you a happy and prosperous life. One of the easiest ways to improve your self-esteem is to self-develop yourself by reading self-help books. Another vital thing is to maintain your self-image to gain more self-confidence.\nTherefore, to keep your confidence with you, you need to keep yourself occupied in a proper way that helps you and others. Not all of us can work even in our old age. Therefore, you could help people maintain their health, so when people get help from you, they start to admire you, so your confidence level goes up, and you will begin to believe in yourself.\nIf you love yourself, you will learn to overcome all your problems and have a happy and prosperous life.\nThank you very much for picking up to read my course.

They impact on most of one's inner experience and observed behaviors on a frequent basis. They are notable by others because of the deviation from a given cultural pattern. An untreated PD can lead to significant distress and impairment.\nThey consist of the Odd ones: paranoid, schizoid, and the schizotypal. The Dramatic ones: antisocial, borderline, histrionic and narcissistic. And the Anxious ones: avoidant, dependent and obsessive compulsive patterns. Each of these Personality Disorders is distinct but one person can struggle with a few of them simultaneously.\nIn addition, gain insights into the four areas of functioning that are impacted by the Personality Disorders. Most clients with a PD can be affected in two or more of the following areas. The areas involve the way someone thinks (cognitive), the way they experience emotions (feelings), their interpersonal relationships at work, home or with social networks (friendships, productivity and significant others), and finally their capacity to control impulsive thoughts or actions.\nLearn proven strategies for changing these very rigid personality patterns. The typical therapies involve using specific Cognitive-Behavioral, Biological and Psychodynamic or related techniques. Apply what you've learned to actual case studies toward the end of the course.

No changes in personal or professional life? There could be many reasons for these feelings and results, however, there is a prominent one that we will take care of in this course. Neophobia. Also known as fear of novelty. Often people who have a mild level of Neophobia also have other weak sides like feeling uncomfortable in public or getting rejected by someone. By practicing Neophobia from different perspectives: Solo Constellation (being alone with yourself), Public Constellation (being in public but without interaction), Inner Circle (inner boost), and Fear of Rejection we step by step, starting with very easy and doable exercises will steadily, bit by bit obtain:  1. confidence  2. self-esteem  3. decrease our fears  4. we will get interesting to ourselves and our surrounding.  5. we will get into many adventures and collect many many stories from these various experiences. Lastly, the whole course is built in a clear, simple, and fun way. Enjoy! : )",

      "description": "Developing Ethical Reflection and Cultural Competence via Immersive Experiences\n\n\nImmersive learning experiences not only allow students to explore diverse views, but they also provide a unique chance to improve ethical thought and cultural competence. Educators can encourage students to critically assess and manage complicated moral concerns within various cultural frameworks by immersing them in virtual settings that present ethical quandaries rooted in multiple cultural contexts.\n\n\nThis method promotes a better awareness of cultural diversity and the ethical issues that underpin distinct society norms and values. Students are forced to address and comprehend the nexus of ethics and cultural perspectives, developing a greater understanding of the intricacies and complexity inherent in ethical decision-making across diverse cultural landscapes.\n\n\nFurthermore, by engaging with immersive content that depicts multiple cultural settings, students can gain a better understanding of the complexities of cultural heritage and the importance of ethical values within different cultural paradigms. As they navigate these virtual worlds, students are encouraged to think about the connection of culture and ethical reasoning, resulting in a more thorough and culturally sensitive approach to ethical decision-making.\n\n\nFostering Empathetic Engagement with Holistic Virtual Experiential Learning\n\n\nIn addition to encouraging empathy for historical and cultural settings, educators can use immersive learning experiences to create a comprehensive grasp of interconnected global challenges and the intricate web of human experiences. Educators can foster a profound and empathic examination of the interconnection of global events and societal processes by allowing students to take on the viewpoints of people from various cultural and historical backgrounds.\n\n\nThese virtual experiential learning options encourage students to realize similar human experiences that transcend individual cultural borders, building empathy across cultural divides. This technique not only broadens pupils' understanding of different cultures, but also fosters a strong sense of connectivity and empathy in an increasingly globalized society.\n\n\nEngaging with immersive information that reveals complex human experiences and interconnected global events enables students to get a comprehensive perspective of the human experience, cultivating empathy and connection that transcends cultural, geographical, and temporal boundaries.\n\n\nTo summarize, incorporating ethical reflection, cultural competence, and empathetic involvement into immersive learning experiences creates a transformative framework for developing students' comprehensive awareness of varied views and interconnected global dynamics. As educators continue to explore the potential of immersive technology, a conscious emphasis on ethical and cultural considerations guarantees that students have a nuanced grasp of their surroundings and emerge as empathic, culturally aware global citizens.\n\n\nPromoting Ethical Decision-Making with Immersive Experiences.\n\n\nIn addition to the benefits listed above, immersive learning experiences help students develop ethical decision-making abilities by allowing them to interact with simulated scenarios that reveal difficult ethical issues in historical and cultural settings. These scenarios allow students to wrestle with complex ethical issues, developing a thorough awareness of the interdependence between ethical decision-making and historical events.\n\n\nImmersive experiences allow students to confront moral quandaries and ethical grey zones within unique cultural and historical contexts, prompting them to evaluate ethical consequences from a variety of angles. Educators can assist students through the complexities of ethical decision-making by immersing them in virtual worlds, enabling them to critically assess the impact of their decisions on individuals and communities within historical and cultural contexts.\n\n\nFurthermore, this approach helps students develop the ability to handle real-world ethical issues with empathy and cultural sensitivity. Students develop a heightened awareness of the cultural nuances that underpin ethical considerations by engaging with ethical decision-making challenges that are rooted in diverse cultural and historical contexts. This allows them to approach ethical dilemmas with a comprehensive understanding of cultural diversity and historical perspectives.",

What can be helpful on one level can be destructive on another level like TVs, smartphones, Internet.\n\nResearch shows there is declining health and wellbeing in children, increasing numbers of who are succumbing to depression, emotional instability, mental illnesses, obesity, and low educational and social competence\n\nCONFIDENCE and RESILIENCE should be understood as vital ingredients in our life.\nThese two will help us face life’s challenges and pressures with confidence.\nConfidence is a crucial aspect of our lives that influences how we perceive ourselves and approach various situations. Understanding confidence requires exploring the factors that contribute to its development. One significant factor is self-belief. When individuals have a strong belief in their abilities and worth, they are more likely to display confidence in their actions and decisions. This belief is nurtured through experiences of success and recognition, which serve as evidence of their capabilities. Additionally, having a positive mindset and self-talk can enhance confidence by replacing self-doubt and negative thoughts with optimism and self-assurance.\nHowever, self-doubt and fear often hinder our confidence and prevent us from reaching our full potential. Overcoming self-doubt and fear is a subtopic of understanding confidence, and it involves recognizing and addressing the internal barriers that hold us back. Self-doubt is a common obstacle that many individuals face when it comes to confidence. It is the inner voice that questions our abilities, accomplishments, and worthiness. Overcoming self-doubt requires self-reflection and challenging negative thoughts and beliefs. By recognizing our strengths, focusing on past successes, and reframing negative self-talk, we can gradually build our confidence and diminish self-doubt. Additionally, seeking external validation and support from trusted individuals can also provide reassurance and help us overcome self-doubt.\nThis online course includes Exercises and Tools that will HELP you learn:\n-Personal development skills and mindset skills – skills that will help you now and for the rest of your life\n-How to let go of limiting beliefs and build your self-esteem and self-confidence so that you can move through fear and anxiety, step outside your comfort zone and do all the things you want\n-How to be in control of your life and reach your fullest potential\n-Critical Life Skills That Will Help You Create Happiness, Confidence And Success In Your Life\n-Increased Emotional Intelligence: Resilience, Self-Worth, Mind Management, Reduced Anxiety\n-How to be in control of your life and reach your fullest potential\n-To Be In Control Of Your Thoughts And Emotions",

However, enduring a complicated upbringing that battered your self-regard doesn't mean you have to struggle with it forever. This online course helps you find a new direction to restore your relationship with yourself. We begin by illustrating the results of low self-esteem and how it can ruin your life by instilling terrible feelings of despair, humiliation, anger, guilt and isolation. We explore several contributing factors to low self-regard, including overly judgmental parents, financial issues and job loss. The course then lays out some practical ways to control your emotions and manage anxiety.\nWe then examine the dimensions of self-esteem, including its relevance to your mental wellbeing and its effect on your ability to pursue your goals. Self-esteem reflects your outlook on life, and maintaining a healthy one allows you to pursue your dreams in the face of opposition. The course makes a clear distinction between ‘self-esteem’ and ‘self-worth’ and provides self-assessments to help you locate where you need to work on both. We also lay out the lifelong pathways to developing healthy self-perception.\nIn the final part of the course, we establish the many advantages of boosting your self-esteem and explain how to do so by cultivating constructive personal, lifestyle and mental habits.

I was in my early 30’s and I had only been facilitating professional programs for a short time. It was an excruciating event and potentially could have been disastrous.\n\nFortunately, using my training in human behaviour I was able to diffuse the situation within minutes, gain respect from the entire audience...all without one word of disrespect or attack from myself.\n\nIf you have ever been hurt or wounded or felt the sharp sting of cruel words you’ll understand that words can hurt. They can cut deep, and indeed, shape the course of your life and limit what you can do.\n\nWhether the criticism is from within yourself or from someone else, you give yourself an immense advantage when you know how to effectively deal with it.\n\n\nWhat makes Bill qualified to lead this program?\nThe instructor of the course, Bill Lee-Emery, has a passion for helping people to learn about themselves. Through his work spanning nearly 40 years, he has taught countless thousands of people how to improve various aspects of their lives.\nBesides working in the corporate world, Bill facilitated personal growth programs at one of Australia’s best-known health resorts on the Gold Coast, Queensland delivering acclaimed workshops on stress and modern living.\nHe has also worked with many elite sportspeople including the Australian National Skydiving Team and other high performance individuals including world-class cyclists, triathletes and golfers.\nHe is the author of four books, appeared on several TV programs and various radio programs throughout Australia and overseas.\n\nHow the Course Works\nWe’ll start by laying a foundation of ideas and perspectives that can shift how you think and feel about yourself. Sometimes just one idea can prove significant so you’ll likely pick up some precious gems along our journey together.\nYou’ll then discover a system that is simple and easy to duplicate so that you can deal with both internal and external criticism, with dignity and poise.\nPLUS – an easy to follow 10-page Workbook with exercises from each training video. This means you have all your notes, reflections, insights and exercises in one easy-to-find place.\n\nFinally, you’ll get access to a bonus video that shows you a pathway building bulletproof, healthy and robust self-esteem.\n\n\nNo Risk Guarantee\nIf you find that this course is not for you or does not deliver the results you wish, you have a 30-day no questions asked money back guarantee.\nSo, enroll in the course with confidence now and I look forward to seeing you inside!\nBill",

You see them start to struggle, but they never want to let you down and continually find themselves in situations they don't like\nPeople-pleasers may:\nApologize for things that need no apology\nChronically second-guess themselves in the decision-making process\nGo along with plans they disagree with\nRefuse to hold their ground when the other person is persuasively argumentative\nMake unnecessary concessions when the other is pushy\nPretend to agree even when they don’t\n\n\nPeople-pleasers squander energy by fretting about what other people are thinking. They often don’t know what they want or like because they have always been focused on the other person. They fear confrontation and would rather bite their tongue than say anything to rock the boat, ultimately building a life of resentment and unexpressed emotions.\nWe are taught that being nice and thinking about other people’s feelings are important. It is important, and wanting to please people is a lovely characteristic to have, but when you start to bend over backwards to such an extent that it impacts your own emotions, then it becomes a harmful problem.\n\n\nPeople pleasers:\nare addicted to approval\nput the needs of others before their own\nare nice to everyone\nhave a difficult time standing up for themselves\nnever say how they feel\nexperience chronic guilt and fear of hurting others\nprefer to conform with others, even if they internally disagree\n\n\nAs a people pleaser, you have a compulsive need to be liked by everyone. You feel icky when people don't like you, and you'll go to any length to get someone to praise or approve of you. You are scared of offending people, worry if they like you, and not completely comfortable with yourself. You can’t say no to others, voice out your opinions and emotions, and assert what you want. You're leading a life of servitude and emotional suffering.\n\n\nIf you have been struggling with the disease to please syndrome, this is the course for you. It will give you the tools and necessary information that can help you overcome your addiction to approval. When you understand why you behave the way you do, you are in a better position to know how to free yourself of people-pleasing. You will know the mindsets you need to catch in yourself and change. You can be a nice person without being a people pleaser.\n\n\nThe course includes:\nWhy it’s important to overcome people pleasing?\nWhat being a people-pleaser is really costing you?\nWhat’s wrong with being a nice person?\nThe origins of people-pleasing behavior\nHow to stop pleasing your parents\nOvercoming fear of confrontation\nOvercoming fear of hurting other people\nHow do we get hooked on approval?\nHow to prioritize yourself?\nWhy is authenticity important?\nHow to be yourself during communication?\nOvercoming fear of rejection\nHow to stop seeking approval?\nGetting rid of toxic people-pleasing\nIdentifying what you want and expressing it",

      "description": "TALKIVITY: Harnessing the Dynamic Power of Words\nUnleashing Healing, Creativity, and Transformation - Jeanne Pope - 2025 ©\nWhat is Talkivity?\nTalkivity is a concept I created to describe the powerful impact that language has on our lives. It’s not just about what we say, but how we say it and the intention behind it. Our words shape our reality, influence emotions, and connect us to others, whether they heal or harm, inspire or discourage. By using language creatively and intentionally, we can change our mindset and, ultimately, how we feel.\nThis course is for anyone interested in personal growth, whether you’re looking to improve your mindset, overcome challenges, or create meaningful change. It provides simple tools and insights to guide you on your journey.\nMy Course\nThis isn’t a typical step-by-step guide nor is it didactic. Instead, I share seven deeply personal stories where I used Talkivity to achieve remarkable results, transforming my life:\n1. How Dynamic Action Supported Me Before, During, and After My Successful Brain Surgery.\n2. I chose self-respect over humiliation, expelled from school at 15, reborn in France.\n3. How Stanley Lewis, the Montreal sculptor, changed my life with one word: “Yes.”\n4. Conquering the Struggles of Three Herniated Discs and Embracing the Healing Journey.\n5. Discovering My Biological Family Long Before the Era of Easy Internet Searches.\n6. Landing My Dream Job at the Beijing Film Academy Through Intentional Daydreaming and Preparation.\n7. Receiving Spiritual Guidance from My Mother After Her Passing.\nThrough these stories, I’ll show you how dynamic words and intentional planning opened doors, shifted perspectives, and brought much peace in challenging situations. I believe some of these experiences will resonate with you too.\nHow Do You Access Talkivity?\nAll it takes is patience, practice, and belief. Once you begin, things will start falling into place. You’ll instinctively know where to go, who to connect with, and how to make the right moves. Talkivity is free, it starts within, requiring only curiosity, time, and faith.\nWhy I Created This Course\nIn 2019, I underwent a successful ten-hour brain tumour removal in China. When I returned to Qilu Hospital in Qingdao last summer (2024), my exceptional surgeon doctor Wang, confirmed there was no change or regrowth, my brain was perfectly healthy. He now uses my case as an example of effective tumour removal. He knows about my months of preparation: affirming the best possible result with dynamic intention and faith, carefully choosing the surgery date, and visualising his hands as those of a skilled sculptor. I even showed him an image I’d drawn of my face, envisioning the perfect outcome. He didn’t laugh. His support was pivotal. It was then I knew I had to share my story and the practices that contributed to this remarkable outcome.\nThe Course Structure\nEach module includes:\nStorytime: Personal video stories where I share key insights and experiences.\nSlide Lectures: Actionable steps on how Dynamic Words can shift your mindset and transform your life.\nAudio Versions: MP3 recordings of lectures and stories for on-the-go listening.\nTranscripts taken from the VideoStory\nResources: Insights from thought leaders like Dr. John Sarno and Catherine Ponder, along with fact-based, academic and holistic articles.\nDownloadable PDFs: Journals for tracking progress and ideas.\nA loving quote giving the theme for each lesson\n\n\nWhat This Course Offers\nTalkivity invites you to embark on an inner journey that will gradually transform your life. Through consistent practice and deep desire, you will discover how words, Powerful Dynamic Tools, can help you radiate healing, growth, and personal development.\nA Note of Guidance\nTalkivity is not a substitute for medical advice or counselling, but it works beautifully alongside professional care. Many doctors and healthcare practitioners recognise the mind-body connection, demonstrating the mind’s role in healing. Talkivity complements this by reinforcing confidence and often speeding up recovery.\n\n\nThank You\nThank you for joining this course. I am confident that, at the very least, you’ll discover something new, and at best, you’ll experience profound change.\nSpecial thanks to my parents, Patricia and Marius, Stanley Lewis, Dr. John Sarno, Catherine Ponder, and the incredible team at Qilu Hospital, Shandong, China.\n\n\nJeanne Pope - 2025 ©",

People who have mastered this skill can handle anything life throws at them, both in work and at home, and seem to be able to make new friends easily and seem to be comfortable in their own skin.\nSo what actually IS confidence? This is something that broadcaster, writer and voice artist Peter Baker has been researching over the years and now presents this excellent self-help training course to take you on an amazing journey of self-discovery.\nPeople are not born with varying levels of confidence, although it’s true that confidence levels can be knocked out of you as a child; but no matter how confident you believe you are, everyone can learn new techniques and skills to help them progress in their careers, and family life and to get the most from their relationships with others.\nYou will learn a whole host of confidence tips for all sorts of different situations as well as learn how to get out of a rut in life, dealing with guilt, tips for timid people, how to stand up for yourself, 7 ways to delete a painful past, proven calming strategies, 5 steps to a better self-image, the curse of overwhelm in life, discovering your inner creativity, and how to be fully self-aware. You’ll also learn how to overcome poor confidence levels and how to stop perfectionism controlling you.\nThen there are sections which contain powerful affirmations; this is where you see an affirmative phrase on the screen, you repeat it after you hear the voiceover speak and you physically affirm it, using a clap or by hitting the desk in front of you to mentally “fix” it. This is an excellent and proven way to really help change your mind-set when it comes with coping and dealing with life and giving you the energy to succeed.\nThis course has two hours of packed video instruction and affirmation videos that you can go back to again and again to help improve your confidence levels and to get your life on track and on the upward curve to your optimum happiness and success.",

Not only that you will know how to start a conversation, but you will also know how to fight the fear of approaching strangers, you will be able to come up with many small talk questions, so you never run out of things to say, you will have basics in reading people so nothing will surprise you.\n\n\nYou may be an introvert but this course will give a guide on how to start a conversation even if you don’t want to have a conversation with them.\n\n\nThe course starts with a proper mindset. You need to get your mindset straight first and then all the attempts you make to start a conversation with a guy will be destined for success. Then we will be talking about the first impression, how to present yourself so you feel and look confident. The way people perceive us is incredibly important and can determine the way the whole conversation will go.\n\n\nWe will definitely touch on active listening skills because it incredibly benefits our relationships. And not only in established ones but also the ones that are brand new. It helps us to quickly get to know the person we are talking to and we can build up that in the next phases of the process of making new friends.\n\n\nAn important part of all communication is reading body language. We look at the person standing in front of us and we process their body language to see how they are feeling at the moment, what topics they like to talk about, and whether they like or dislike you. We need this information so can make the conversation more effective. It’s almost like reading minds of people we are talking to.\n\n\nAfter that, we have to establish the relationship and take care of it. And that’s a piece of cake - I will show you how to do it.\n\n\nIt doesn’t really matter whether you are trying to find out how to start a conversation with a girl, how to start a conversation with crush or you are seeking tips on how to do small talk in business. The course is a nice way for introverts to improve their small talk skills - I know it is frightening but it can be done well so you benefit from that. The course can improve as well as their personal communication as their business communication.\n\n\nAlso what has really helped me was the knowledge of the power I possess - I know I can talk to anybody, I know I can make them talk to me, and even like me but I don’t always need to deploy those skills - incredibly strong and nice feeling. I wish you could experience that too.\n\n\nYour communication skills are about to get so much more efficient, you cannot imagine. xx",

      "description": "Do you get nervous around other people and don’t know why?\nAre you tired of worrying what other people are thinking of you all the time?\nDo you feel uncomfortable in group settings, so you ‘fade into the background’?\nWish you could 'mute' the critical voice inside that’s always putting you down?\n\n\nI know how it feels because I just explained myself a few years ago. All the above issues are what I was going through.\nSocial situations were extremely awkward for me. I would feel uncomfortable around EVERYONE, and that would cause them to feel uncomfortable around me, which made me want to withdraw even more. I found myself stuck in a low paying jobs I hated but I didn't believe I could do any better or get the jobs I really wanted.\nI was too shy to ask anyone on a date so I spent most of my life alone. I was afraid of being judged, afraid of confrontation, and constantly worried what everyone was thinking of me. Having low confidence and social anxiety held me back in just about every way you can imagine.\nThe worst thing of all though was the feeling of being uncomfortable in my own skin.\nIf you're like me, you are probably tired of people telling you the answer to all your problems is to \"Just be more confident.\"\nIf only it were that simple…\nPerhaps you have tried a few times to be more confident and for whatever reason it didn't work, now you have given up and believe you were 'born shy'.\nI'm here show you social confidence is possible for you. But this time, instead of doing it all by yourself, we are going to do it together.\nThe good news is, anyone can learn social confidence, and it doesn't matter where you're starting from. Social confidence is not some exclusive club you are born into, anyone can join. Whether you want just a little more confidence and to like yourself better, or if you are suffering from a full on social anxiety disorder as I was for many years, you will greatly benefit from the lessons and action steps provide in this course.\n------ How I Overcame Social Anxiety, Grew Confidence & Self-Esteem ------------\n\nAs best selling author and famous psychologist Nathaniel Branden says, \"Confidence and self-esteem is the key to a happy and fulfilling life\" and I am going to show you what I did to improve mine, and how you can too!\nI am always weary of taking advice from people who haven't been in the situation they are trying to help me with. If you haven't been there and lived through it, you can't really understand what it feels like to have social anxiety and low self-esteem. I found people who hadn't been through it couldn't really relate to my struggles.\nThey would tell me things like \"Just be yourself\" and \"face your fears,\" if only it were that simple....\nI got the most help on my journey from people who have been through the same situation as me and made it out.\nI've been there. I know first hand the problems you face as someone with social anxiety because I have faced them too.\nI am going to show you the exact steps I took to grow my self-esteem, and how you can do the same.\nWhy is this Course Different?\nI will guide you through all the common causes of social anxiety and explain EXACTLY how to overcome them. After taking the course, you will never again see yourself as, 'weak,' 'inferior,' or 'less than' others.\nYou will learn to..\nStop doubting yourself and putting yourself down.\nStop worrying so much what others are thinking of you.\nFeel comfortable talking to people.\nSpeak up and share your opinions with the world.\nStop fearing judgment and criticism.\nFinally feel comfortable being yourself.\nStop worrying what others are thinking of you.\nSilence that critical voice in your head.\nStop overthinking and analysing everything you say.\nStand up for yourself.\nSpeak up in a meeting.\nLike yourself and accept yourself for who you are.\nBe comfortable being the center of attention.\nINCLUDES FREE 2 HOUR EFT (EMOTIONAL FREEDOM TECHNIQUE) FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY COURSE\nPlus so much more ...\nDon't just take my word for it, here's what others are saying about the course..\n\"Tobias really helped me in this course to reshape my beliefs and my whole thinking towards a more positive outlook on things. I know I still have a long way to go to reach my goal, but thanks to this course I now have the right tools to do so. I can only recommend this course to anyone who wants to brush up his/hers self-esteem muscle.\"\nby Julian J\n\n\nIf you don't do anything differently to become more socially confident, where will you be 12 months from now? And how about 5 or 10, 20 years from now?",

This course isn’t just theory – it’s your toolkit to dismantle those patterns and reclaim your life’s steering wheel.\nWe all carry invisible wounds from childhood – unmet needs for safety, validation, or autonomy that morph into lifelong 'lifetraps' . These schemas whisper: 'You’re unlovable,' 'Trust no one,' or 'Success is dangerous'…\nThis course hands you the scalpel to dissect these patterns, understand their origin story, and replace self-sabotage with radical self-compassion. No jargon. No quick fixes. Just neuroscience-backed tools used by top therapists.\n︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾\n\"Schemas shrink your world to what once kept you safe…”\n— Enroll Now and expand into what makes you ALIVE!\n︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾◆◆◆ Core Benefits ◆◆◆ ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ\n◆ Map Your Emotional DNA\nDiscover your unique “lifetraps” (like Abandonment, Mistrust, or Defectiveness) and trace their roots to childhood dynamics.\n◆ Upgrade Harmful Coping Modes\nReplace self-sabotaging behaviors (anger, avoidance, overcompensation) with empowered responses using 7 proven schema interventions.\n◆ Become Your Own Nurturing Parent\nMaster “reparenting” techniques to heal childhood wounds without needing external validation.\n◆ Break Toxic Relationship Cycles\nRecognize why you attract unavailable partners/critical friends – and rewrite the script.\n◆ Tools That Work in Real Life\nGet downloadable worksheets, guided audio exercises, and crisis scripts for emotional flashbacks.\n︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾\n“Every day you tolerate old schemas is a day your inner child waits to heal…” (•_•)\n— ‘Enroll Now’ and Thank Yourself Later!\n︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾\n◆ Build Your Nurturing Inner Voice\n\"Reparenting\" exercises to heal childhood wounds without relying on others\nDaily rituals to exit \"Vulnerable Child\" mode in under 90 seconds\n◆ Exit Survival Modes\nTransform people-pleasing (excessive self-sacrifice), perfectionism (overcompensation), and emotional numbing (avoidance)\"\n︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾\n\"Traditional therapy often fails to address deep schema patterns – that’s why leading psychologists call Schema Therapy ‘the missing piece’ for lasting change.”\n︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾\n◆◆◆ Who Needs This ◆◆◆\nThis isn’t just for therapists.

Includes downloadable Schema Inventory PDF + video demos of \"Schema Dialogues\" – tools even most therapists don’t teach.\n- \"I’ve tried everything – why will this work?\"\nThis isn’t another \"therapy\" program. This is a real “game-changer therapy” for everybody! Inside you’ll get:\nThe Schema Diary Method (proven in 2023 Rutgers study to reduce emotional avoidance by 41%)\n\"Mode Mapping\" Videos to visually track progress\n92% of students report “aha moments” in Week 1 alone.\n- \"What if I don’t have ‘big trauma’?\"\nSchemas form from unmet needs, not just trauma. The Childhood Needs Audit tool helps you pinpoint subtle patterns (e.g., parents who were \"loving but critical\"). Over 60% of students discover hidden schemas they’d normalized.\n︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾\n◆◆◆ \"Stop asking ‘Why me?’ Start asking ‘What’s next?’” ¯\\( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/¯◆◆◆\n— Claim Your Spot – Your Comeback Story Starts Now!\n︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾︾",

The capacity to adjust teaching and testing procedures to individual students' needs and learning styles promotes higher levels of engagement and motivation. Adaptive learning platforms allow students to take charge of their learning journey by giving individualized recommendations for study materials and interventions, resulting in increased information retention and application.\n\n\nFurthermore, the data-driven insights created by adaptive learning algorithms provide educators with a complete picture of each student's learning progress and opportunities for development. This in-depth research provides targeted interventions and assistance, ultimately improving students' academic performance and sense of accomplishment.\n\n\nDeveloping 21st Century Skills through Technology-Integrated Learning.\n\n\nIn addition to reinforcing academic knowledge, technology-integrated question and answer sessions and testing foster 21st century abilities that are critical for students' future success. Collaborative tools and virtual Q&A platforms allow students to practice teamwork, communication, and digital literacy. The engaging and dynamic nature of virtual talks and real-time feedback mechanisms encourages students to hone their critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills, preparing them to meet the demands of a fast changing global scene.\n\n\nFurthermore, technology-enabled testing environments encourage students' resilience and adaptation as they navigate various assessment forms. Educators prepare students to flourish in a technology-driven culture and workforce by familiarizing them with digital tools and remote cooperation.\n\n\nThe Ethical and Equitable Use of Technology in Education.\n\n\nAs educators embrace the use of technology in question-and-answer research and assessment, it is critical to address ethical concerns and ensure equitable access and use. To preserve all learners' rights and anonymity, the ethical use of student data as well as privacy safeguards must be prioritized. Educators and educational institutions must stress ethical principles and openness while implementing technology, cultivating a culture of trust and integrity in all technical initiatives.\n\n\nFurthermore, equitable access to technology and digital resources is necessary to avoid exacerbating educational disparities. Educators should work to build inclusive learning environments in which all students, regardless of socioeconomic status, have access to the technology and support systems required to fully participate in tech-integrated learning experiences.",

We begin with the role of self-awareness and acceptance as you learn how to get in touch with your ‘true’ self. This lets you harness your self-awareness to understand and tweak your behavioural patterns to enhance your life. We then examine ways to become more driven and happy while you learn to bring out your best. The course then explores the significant role of your peers and surroundings in defining your sense of self-worth.\nWe discuss self-reliance and how it can be attained by being assertive, self-motivated and capable of overcoming challenges. We then take you through the process of abandoning self-criticism and substituting it with ‘self-compassion’. The course analyzes gratitude, considering religious, spiritual and psychological interpretations. We show you the many positive effects of thankfulness: increased happiness, stronger self-control and improved physical and mental health. Importantly, we demonstrate how to implement it in your life as a skill like any other. This includes study of forgiveness and the benefits of removing old mental scars.\nThis online course concludes with several definitions of ‘meaningful’ living. We help you to formulate beliefs that can make your existence more significant. We show you how to respect your feelings and determine what is important to you. We also explain why the verbs we use matter and how some of them, like 'find' and 'search', may set us up for failure while others can breed success.

Our courses have been taken by over 800,000+ happy students from 200 countries.\nWe have a thriving community in the course and we are actively involved and answer questions within 24h.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are or want to be a LIFE COACH, we have a Confidence Life Coach Certification version of this course available, which you can enroll in instead.\n\n\nNo more superficial self confidence and self-esteem!\nMost courses on developing self confidence encourage you to boost your self-esteem, feel confident in your abilities, and feel certain you’ll be viewed favorably by others. Unfortunately, this is a HUGE mistake because this is not true self confidence! You see, having to feel good about yourself discourages you from stepping out of your comfort zone which creates true confidence. Needing to feel confident in your abilities makes you avoid trying anything you might be bad at. And needing to be accepted by others holds you back from your dreams and from having the confidence you desire.\nThe truth is, keeping your ego happy and getting approval from others will NEVER make you have self confidence because deep down you’ll feel like a fraud.\n\n\nThink about it… what do you REALLY want confidence FOR?\nYou want confidence and self esteem so you can stop holding yourself back from your dreams.\nYou want confidence and self esteem so you can actually achieve the goals you set.\nYou want confidence and self esteem so you can be brave enough to take the risk and go for it.\nYou want confidence and self esteem so you can stop playing small and actually reach for the potential you know that is trapped within you.\n\n\nYou owe it to yourself to develop a mindset of true confidence. If you do you’ll find that:\nInstead of feeling socially anxious and dependent on the positive judgment of others in order to feel good about yourself, you’ll learn how to feel confidence even in the face of rejection and criticism.\nInstead of sugar coating your flaws and failures, you’ll develop healthy self-esteem built upon true unshakable self confidence. You’ll feel good about yourself in a way that doesn’t get knocked down by failure or judgment.\nInstead of shrinking back from risk or being crushed by failure, you’ll learn how to turn challenges and setbacks into the self confidence and fuel you need to ignite your life.\nInstead of wasting energy trying to avoid revealing your weaknesses, you’ll know once and for all that your TRUE strength lies in your ability to improve and move forward no matter where you are now or what stands in your way.\nInstead of arguing for your limitations and holding back your true gifts for fear of failure or ridicule, you’ll develop such a strong belief in your own potential and the self confidence that nothing, NOTHING, has the power to hold you back anymore. You’ll be unstoppable!\nIn this course we’re not going to offer you a quick fix or an ego boost.  We’re going to dive deep into the most up-to-date leading edge research into the psychology of success and what creates genuine, long-term, unshakable confidence.\n\n\nIn this course, you’ll learn:\nTrue confidence and self-esteem through the #1 core underlying belief that unlocks genuine confidence—the growth mindset\nTrue confidence and self-esteem through understanding the 4 traps of self-doubt and how overcome them\nTrue confidence and self-esteem through powerful tools for taking action even when you feel paralyzed\nTrue confidence and self-esteem by learning how to take your power back\nTrue confidence and self-esteem by learning how to overcome fear of failure, risk, and change\nSo if you are ready to develop true self confidence and self-esteem, register today! We look forward to seen you in the course!\n\n\nGuarantee: We know you will love this course. However, we offer a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if the course does not meet your needs for any reason.\n\n\nSo, who are we?\nWe are Joeel & Natalie Rivera, serial entrepreneurs, authors, speakers, and educators. We’ve learned how to develop the self confidence to cliff dive into a life as entrepreneurs, including the uncertainty that comes with it. We’ve learned to use failure as a catalyst and no longer fear risk. We’ve learned how to stop doubting ourselves and holding ourselves back because we know that we’re meant to make a difference and that hiding from our greatness harms the people we are meant to help. And, we’ve learned that everyone has latent potential, including you, that will transform their lives if they develop the self confidence to be their authentic selves.\nPlus, we have over a decade in the field of psychology and life coaching to back it up! Plus we have over 800,000+ students from 200 countries.\nAnd we know that the insights we share just in the introduction to this course have the power to completely change the way you look at yourself and your true potential.\n\n\nCopyright Transformation Services, Inc.

      "description": "Early trauma and conditioning start crafting a limited version of ourselves, with both parts of ourselves that we cherish and admire, as well as other parts that we often hide and keep to ourselves. This fragmentation can cause us to live a completely different external life compared to how we are feeling on the inside. In order to survive, we adopt coping mechanisms that we feel protect us from harm but that will block opportunities of growth in the future. In this course you will begin to unpack the damages of childhood trauma and start retrieving lost aspects of yourself. Bonus: It includes 3 powerful downloadable guided mediations to help release blocks related to self-acceptance, procrastination and emotional healing.\nIt is simple dive into topics that can often times be complex to understand (without a background in psychology or related fields), consisting of 8 full lectures with some assignments to complete for self-reflection and using the framework in your daily life. You can complete your assignments on a separate notebook to gain awareness about your own situation and begin using this framework.  Additionally, you will get a downloadable guided meditation to use as needed, anytime you experience a moment of dissonance in your life.\nThis is an easy to digest course, to begin your journey back to wholeness, the fullness of you and your authentic self. Sort out your childhood wounds and understand how they fragment the full expression of who you are. Learn how our mind makes up reality and the different filters it goes through. Learn about projection, triggers and how conflicts arise in relationships, while harnessing the skills of self-awareness and self-acceptance for a wholesome life.\nWe will debunk topics that keep us stuck in thinking patterns and gain a greater insight about ourselves, others, and what our wounds can teach us. Perfect for anyone who has begun questioning their life, is contemplating change or wanting to go deeper into the path of knowing themselves. It's also beneficial for those who have gone through grief, abusive situations and transitions that they haven't been able to properly process, or for parents that wish to give their children a more balanced view on life from working on themselves and their programming.",

Whether delivering a presentation in a boardroom, addressing a crowd at a conference, or speaking in a classroom, effective public speaking involves clear articulation, engaging delivery, and confident demeanor.\n\n\nIt's about connecting with an audience on both intellectual and emotional levels, conveying information persuasively, and leaving a lasting impression. While it often requires overcoming nerves and mastering techniques like body language and vocal modulation, the ability to speak publicly with poise and conviction is invaluable in both personal and professional realms.\n\n\nUltimately, public speaking is not just about conveying information—it's about captivating, inspiring, and motivating others to take action or embrace new perspectives. Mastering public speaking requires continuous learning and self-improvement. It can be a journey of personal growth, helping you refine your thoughts, organize information effectively, and develop empathy for your audience.\n\n\nAs you become more proficient in public speaking, you'll likely experience a boost in confidence. Overcoming the fear of public speaking can translate into greater self-assurance in other areas of your life as well. Overall, public speaking is important because it facilitates effective communication, fosters leadership skills, promotes career advancement, and empowers individuals to make a positive impact in their personal and professional lives.",

      "description": "We all get lost in life sometimes. The world is ever changing. Adversity strikes on a daily basis, throws us out of alignment and gets us stuck in minor or major life crises. Extreme awareness leads us to wonder if there is more to life than what we experience, yet all the busyness makes us lose touch with ourselves and what really matters. Social demands put pressure and expectations on us trying to force us into a way of existence which makes us feel overwhelmed and other directed. Lack of meaning makes us feel restless, uninspired and unmotivated. We feel like we work against life. Against universal powers. Life feels restricted, hard and like we force things. Yet, we as human beings are designed to resist change on all levels, which is why we feel overwhelmed and disconnected from ourselves and life.\nOn the quest for deeper connection and alignment we want to understand life, make changes, look deeper within and get to know ourselves better. We want to find the contentment and inner harmony that helps us create a life in alignment. This workshop has two aims 1) it is all about managing disconnection and mastering life crises, crises of meaning and identity, finding new direction and alignment and creating clarity within yourself and your life so you can finally get out of this rabbit hole of a life crisis that causes you so much negativity. 2) it is about finding yourself, getting to know yourself better, reconnecting with who you really are, improving self-awareness, highlighting emotional intelligence and understanding yourself and others so you can gain new confidence while at the same time learning to deal with change.\nMoreover (RE)CONNECT is about making self-discovery a daily practice, and developing strategies that help you to come back to yourself and your path if you get lost again. In more than 6 hours of content, you will learn not only to master your emotional and mental states but also how to go deeper within and learn to connect with your intuition and use that connection to make better life choices, find meaning and create an authentic life. You will also get everyday practices that help you find new meaning and direction whenever necessary as well as a few strategies to kick start your DreamLife Journey.",

The power of positivity is immense, and it can help you convert that energy into reality. By expectation, we don't mean it to be a sense of entitlement.\nMuch has been made of having a positive mental attitude. Dale Carnegie started it with his classic book: \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\".

We’ll begin with the inner work—helping you clarify your vision and motives for wanting to become more confident. By understanding your “why,” you’ll gain direction and motivation that will sustain you even when challenges arise. From there, we’ll dive into powerful mindset shifts such as stacking small wins, cultivating positive assumptions, and strengthening your locus of control—all proven methods to create positive momentum and reshape how you see yourself.\nOnce your inner foundation is solid, we’ll move outward to the practical techniques of confident expression. You’ll learn how to master body language and posture so that your presence communicates authority and self-assurance without a single word. You’ll also discover how to use your voice—through tonality, pitch, cadence, and speed—to project confidence and influence how others perceive you.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have both the mindset and the practical tools to carry yourself with confidence in any situation.

      "description": "I grew up as a slightly socially awkward introvert.  For years I wondered how others could navigate meeting new people and make connections so easily while I felt completely ill-equipped. It made social events stressful, dating a challenge, and even limited my professional development.\nIt was not until I started working with a life coach myself did I understand the neuroscience behind rapport, and how my own approach to social events was working against me. Especially since I had now developed anxiety around meeting anyone new.\nThat early work & study changed my life, and today I work as a professional certified coach helping others.  One of my coaching passions is breaking down complex things, like rapport building, into basic working concepts.  I stay away from advanced concepts that sound cool but have little success for someone just learning. There will be time to learn advanced concepts later.\nThis class covers all the basic working skills to build rapport.\nNo matter your skill level or where you are starting from, these are the fundamental techniques needed to master basic rapport building.\n\n\nIn this class, you will learn\nWhat exactly is Rapport\nThe basic building blocks of creating Rapport\nEye Contact and Human Interaction\nPresence and Why it Matters in Rapport Building\nThe one conversation killer we all do, and should stop\nThe Power of Curiosity in Conversations\nThree easy conversation extenders that actually build rapport\nThe physical elements of Rapport Building and Body Language\nWhat are modalities, simplified, and how can you use them to build rapport faster",

      "description": "Master Assertive Communication to Gain Respect and Build Stronger Connections\n\n\nLearn assertive communication that benefits both you and the person you’re speaking with. Once you develop this skill, you’ll be able to use it confidently in any professional setting, including high-stakes negotiations.\nWe communicate every day—so why not make it effective, open, and transparent?\nAssertiveness allows you to set clear boundaries without being rude or overbearing. Instead, you communicate honestly, gaining understanding and respect.\nWhen you’re transparent, people are more likely to empathize with your situation and work with you, rather than pushing past your limits. Assertive communication means creating understanding and building stronger connections.\n\n\nCOURSE STRUCTURE\n\n\nThis course is packed with real-world examples to make assertiveness simple and practical. You’ll learn how to apply assertive communication in different scenarios—friendly conversations, work situations, and at home—and recognize situations where it’s better not to use it.\nThe second part focuses on using assertiveness in negotiations. Negotiations happen daily, from small agreements to major decisions. You’ll gain practical strategies to handle them confidently and get the results you need. These are skills that will benefit you in both personal and professional life.\n\n\nHANDLE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH EASE\n\nLearn how to stay calm and assertive during high-pressure discussions. It’s going to be incredibly useful at work or in personal life, as you’ll gain tools to handle conflicts and tough conversations confidently.\n\n\nBUILD CONFIDENCE THROUGH ASSERTIVENESS\n\nAssertiveness boosts self-esteem by helping you express yourself clearly. Feel more in control, tackle challenges, and earn respect in every area of your life.\n\n\nSPEAK UP WITHOUT FEAR\n\nBreak free from the fear of speaking up. Learn simple techniques to express yourself confidently and be heard without anxiety. Learn how to express yourself clearly without anxiety, handle tough moments with ease, and finally feel heard in both your professional and personal life. It feels good to be able to speak your mind without fear.\n\n\nBECOME A BETTER NEGOTIATOR WITH ASSERTIVENESS\n\nTurn assertive communication into your negotiation superpower. You’ll learn to stay calm, present your needs clearly, and find solutions that work for everyone. Get better deals, close agreements faster, and approach every negotiation with confidence.\n\n\nASSERTIVENESS - THE SKILL THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING\n\n\nAssertiveness transforms how you approach work, relationships, and life.\nIt helped me land better opportunities, negotiate confidently, and set boundaries that earned respect.\n\n\nMANY STUDENTS ARE BENEFITING FROM GAINING ASSERTIVENESS SKILLS\n\n\nLearning assertiveness has also helped students in this course. One of my students shared with me that he finally spoke up and got the promotion he's been denied for years. Another turned a hostile workplace into a productive one by communicating clearly and standing firm.\nAssertiveness puts you in control—no more second-guessing, no more feeling unheard. This skill helps you say what you need, get what you want, and build the respect you deserve.\n\n\nASSERTIVE COMMUNICATION THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE—NO MATTER YOUR ROLE\n\n\nYou don’t need to be in a leadership position for assertive communication to transform your life—it’s a skill that benefits everyone.\nYes, you already know how to communicate, but there’s always room to refine and improve. And no, you don’t have to be naturally assertive—this is a skill anyone can learn with the right guidance.\nI’ve designed this course to be simple, accessible, and easy to follow, even for the busiest professionals. While it’s perfect for boosting your career and professional relationships, it’s just as powerful for improving personal interactions.\nThis course doesn’t focus solely on handling conflict, and it won’t make you come across as rude or overbearing. Instead, you’ll learn how to express yourself clearly, set boundaries respectfully, and build stronger, more positive relationships in every area of your life.\nYou can be a good and pleasant person and still be assertive, I promise!\n\n\nGAIN MORE CONFIDENCE\n\n\nWe are often not assertive because we don't want to cause a conflict or make a big deal.\nBut if this continues, other people can begin to push us, tell us who we are, step over our boundaries, and more.\nThis can have the effect of ruining our confidence and even our feeling of self-worth.\nIt's time to learn how to handle difficult situations with grace, so you and your communication partners can move forward in an ideal way.\n\n\nInvest in yourself.

I already want to do it over and over again. There were some moments really deep and moving. The anchor will stay with me, help me, and provide me with self-confidence in my life. I'm infinitely thankful.\" - Nicoletta\n\"Lovely practice. I really resonated with each and every one of these affirmations. I let them wash over me and flow through me, rather than repeating them all, but I felt them take hold of my imagination and settle comfortably into my mind as the way things now are, just as they should be.\" - Rebecca\n\"I have no words to explain the joy I felt in this meditation. Thank you. Namaste.\" - Margaret\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE WITH ME\nInternationally Certified Therapist helping clients all over the world achieve the life they want to live\nMeditation Teacher - 44,000+ Plays on Insight Timer (#1 Free Meditation App for Sleep, Relax & More)\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL ACHIEVE WITH THIS COURSE\nWelcome to the course that will help you believe in yourself and boost your self-confidence by using practices of Neuro-Linguistic Programming and meditation. I’m Fabio, an internationally certified therapist and meditation teacher with tens of thousands of students all around the world. I’ve been practicing NLP for more than 10 years, and I’ve designed this course for people who have decided to make a change in their life and are looking for the right motivation or tools to really make it happen. By the end of this course, you’ll already see the first improvements and you’ll have learned tricks and secrets to trust and believe in yourself in every aspect of your life.\n\n\nDuring the course, you will learn how the mind works and how to leverage its natural mechanisms to your advantage. You will discover your true strengths and I will prepare you to judge yourself fairly to feel your worth and realize your full potential, avoiding the common pitfalls of those who end up feeling they are a failure. After that, you will learn how to stop comparing yourself to others and manage the voice in your mind, so it sustains your positive mindset in everything you do in your life. Every step and technique is explained with examples from real clients, and a practical application so that it will be easy for you to understand how you can apply them specifically to the things you’d like to improve. We will experience a new technique together in every lesson.\n\n\nI have prepared this course for people motivated to look at themself differently to boost their confidence and self-esteem but don’t know exactly how and where to start. You will soon see how it will reflect positively on your performance in sports, work, relationships, and most importantly on how you feel about yourself every day. Maybe you tried to change it in the past but without complete success. No pre-requirements are necessary other than keeping an open mind.\n\n\nI will see you in the first session to start your new life.",

It leaves victims unable to speak out and they therefore suffer in silence.\nMany people are familiar with overt abuse because it is much more vocal and easier to detect.\nUntil now, there has never been a course detailing and exposing the many ways that an abuser might cause covert pain for their targets.\nCovert abuse has been a powerful weapon that has been unchallenged for far too long. Allowing abusers to get away with mistreating others without any repercussions. Instead the victims usually suffer further when they try to speak up as they are often made to seem too emotional. Paranoid or mentally unstable.\nEach and every day, people worldwide suffer shame and live a less than fulfilling life because of the different ways in which they experience covert abuse.

It’s about living with integrity, conviction and confidence.\nIf you're seeking to cultivate authentic confidence that lasts, this enlightening journey into the heart of your true identity will lead you to make peace with who you truly are, accept who you're not, making peace with your shortcomings and shed the limiting self-beliefs that breed self-doubt. If there is one subject that deserves a place in every school curriculum, it's this!\nMany outlets offer quick-fix techniques and anecdotal solutions, suggesting that confidence can be gained instantly.

Is it a surprise that we may be living in accordance with other people’s rules, adopting other people’s goals, and measuring our worth by other people’s metrics? It's time to advocate for ourselves differently, compassionately, and fiercely.\nIn this course we will work together to understand how we have internalized so many beliefs about our bodies and food, and how those beliefs affect us on a daily basis.\nIf you are used to avoiding certain people or activities in your life, thinking \"once I lose the weight, I'll...,\" and want a more flexible, free, functional relationship with yourself, your body, and food, you've come to the right place.\nThe course is divided into four sections, each focusing on an important skill that will move the needle as you aim for better body image and a more intuitive relationship with food.\nIn each section, you will learn specific practices and strategies for developing a relationship with your body and food that is respectful, gentle, compassionate, and gritty so you can start living in alignment with YOUR values versus those that so many of us have unconsciously adopted.\nYou don't have to LOVE your body to heal your relationship with food actually!

When we don't understand our human biological responses, we blame ourselves for certain behaviors we cannot help. This type of self-shaming becomes dangerous because we begin down a slippery slope of believing we are not capable of things, when in reality, simply understanding our reaction to things allows us to see the process and then change them. What you will learn in this course is not just how the brain works, but how to accept what you can learn about it and build it into how you respond when it happens with the same level of commitment you have to the process of giving up or believing you are less than.\nOur psychology is complicated and my goal in this course is to assist highly qualified people to achieve all sort of goals, to understand their psychology and biology in how they respond and react to things and begin concrete steps to redirect their energy and thought processes to overcome the natural reactions that come up for everyone. If each student can understand this process so that they spend minimal time caught up in the blaming and shaming in their experiences on the journey to success, they can spend more time in the pursuit of their own happiness.\nThis mini advanced Master class is a scholar level of learning focused in on one major topic and unpacking it thoroughly.\nIn this course:\n1. How to Understand Self-Doubt & Self-Love\n2. How Do We Become Confident?\n3. How Can We Enjoy a Measure of Success?\n4. We Should Be Confident! So Why Aren't We?\n5. 6-Steps to Confidence\n6.

You’ll be able to recognize when you are being manipulated by others and put a stop to it gracefully.\nTake Control Of Your Life In The Traditional Native American Way\n· Understand the Circle of Foxes\n· Begin the Dance of the Coyotes\n· Rewrite the Story of Your Life\n· Discover your choices with the wheel of Attitudes & Approaches\n· Gain a deeper understanding of all medicine wheels with the Wheel of Life\nLive the life you planned before you were born without shame.\nNative American tradition says we planned our life before we were born. This is our Sacred Dream or our Children’s Fire. Denying this dream goes against The Creator. Armed with the tools in this course, you’ll be able to confidently walk your path undeterred by toxic people and make yourself a priority.\nThe Circle of Foxes medicine wheel shows us what it looks like to live our life for the approval of others in all eight directions. The Dance of the Coyote shows us the opposite. The Story of Your Life shows you exactly how you are in control. The Wheel of Attitudes and Approaches introduces us to solutions we may never have considered. The Wheel of Life is the key to all medicine wheels and shows us exactly what each direction stands for to gain a deeper understanding.\nYou’ll learn to recognize people who are highly influenced by the opinions of others and why this can be problematic. Many of us don’t even realize how others have impacted our behavior until we see on the medicine wheel. Living our life for others can be disguised as independence.\nHaving control over our inner dialog is the first step and you’ll learn how to recognize words that simply feed on your fears and silence them.\nWhen we know what we truly want out of life, our Sacred Dream, our spirit is re-energized and our life has purpose.",

      "description": "In this course you will learn how to transform the relationship you have with yourself and the way you connect with others, thereby creating a far more confident and happier life for yourself.\nI have over 10 years’ experience as a practicing Life Coach, specializing in the field of confidence and the effect this has on our everyday lives. I spent more than 20 years in the corporate field and what I observed during this time led me on this journey. It became clear that those with confidence seemed to rise above challenges not only in their careers, but in other areas of their lives too.\nOver the last 10 years I have observed the powerful impact this work has had on my clients. This has inspired me to design this course in a digital format, to make it more available to a much wider audience.\nOur life is a product of how we think and feel, especially about ourselves. In order to bring about change, we need to change our behaviors. The most likely way for this to happen is to change how we think and feel about ourselves. My experience with my clients is that this work often brings about an entire paradigm shift not only in the way they see themselves, but also the way they see others.\nBy the end of this course you will have learnt how to have a more loving and respectful relationship with yourself, which will positively affect how you interact with others. This will cause you to then respond differently to everyday situations and challenges, thereby resulting in a happier and more meaningful life.\nChange and growth takes place when we have awareness and understanding of the dynamics playing out in our life, and when we have the tools to change these dynamics, in order to bring about a different and more effective result.\nThis course will focus firstly on helping you to gain a greater understanding of these dynamics, and then on a day by day basis teaching you the skills you require in order to interact differently with not only yourself, but also with others, thereby bringing about significant change.\nThe ideal student for this course is anyone that is looking at their life and is thinking “this is not quite working out” in terms of what I had in mind, or what I had planned. Anyone that has identified that there may be another way of doing things that may be more effective and may bring about better results will be a suitable candidate for this course. This type of thinking is essential because without it you are less likely to be willing to do the work required to bring about the desired growth and changes in your life.\nI am so confident about this course, it is backed up with a 30 day, 100% money-back guarantee.",

      "description": "The intersection of ethics, equity, and immersive learning.\n\n\nAs educators realize the transformative power of immersive technology, it is critical to evaluate the ethical and egalitarian implications of incorporating these experiences into question-and-answer sessions and tests. While immersive experiences provide unmatched depth and engagement, it is critical to ensure equal access to these technologies for all student populations.\n\n\nEducators must wrestle with the ethical implications of using immersive experiences, particularly in terms of protecting students' privacy and data security within virtual settings. Furthermore, equity needs deliberate initiatives to bridge the digital gap, ensuring that all students, regardless of background, have equitable access to these immersive learning experiences.\n\n\nPromoting Inclusive and Diverse Perspectives through Immersive Learning\n\n\nThe incorporation of immersive experiences into question-and-answer sessions and testing presents an opportunity to promote inclusion by providing varied perspectives. Virtual reality simulations, for example, can transfer students to other historical eras, cultural contexts, and geographic locations, allowing them to study and comprehend multiple perspectives in a fully immersive environment.\n\n\nEducators may use these tools to help children develop empathy, global awareness, and cultural competence, preparing them to navigate an increasingly interconnected and diverse world. Educators may foster a more inclusive and empathic generation capable of comprehending and responding to complex societal concerns by exposing pupils to a diverse variety of opinions through immersive experiences.\n\n\nTo summarize, the responsible use of immersive experiences into question and answer studies and testing has the potential to not only increase learning but also promote inclusivity, ethical considerations, and different perspectives. As educators continue to use technology as a tool for transformative learning, the ethical and equitable deployment of immersive experiences is critical to creating a truly meaningful educational environment.\n\n\nEngaging Ethical Considerations in Immersive Learning.\n\n\nThe use of immersive experiences into question-and-answer sessions and tests necessitates a thorough ethical review. As students immerse themselves in virtual environments, educators must ensure that these technologies are used responsibly, taking into account considerations such as the portrayal of critical historical events, cultural authenticity, and the possible impact on students' mental and emotional health.\n\n\nFurthermore, ethical considerations apply to the creation and sharing of material for immersive experiences, emphasizing the importance of accurately and respectfully portraying other cultures and perspectives. Educators and content developers must handle the issues of representation and historical accuracy while maintaining ethical standards and maximizing the instructional potential of immersive learning.\n\n\nImproving Equity in Access to Immersive Technologies\n\n\nEquity is a significant consideration when integrating immersive experiences into question-and-answer sessions and tests. While new technologies provide unparalleled educational opportunities, access gaps must be addressed so that all students have equal access to these immersive learning tools. This includes not just supplying the appropriate technology and software, but also taking into account elements like internet connectivity and technological support, especially for students from impoverished places.\n\n\nEducators and politicians are tasked with breaking down access barriers and bridging the digital divide, with the goal of creating an inclusive educational landscape in which every student may benefit from the enriching potential of immersion experiences.",

      "description": "What You Can Expect To Learn\nThis is the third course (after the Intro and First Key), and the Second Key from the \"6 Keys to ULTIMATE Confidence, Body, and Self-Esteem\" program, which will be a blueprint to boosting:\nBody Confidence, so that you will feel good about your body, you will respect your body, you will build body acceptance, become body-positive, and develop body mindfulness, which will boost your personal power to achieve your goals, and fulfill your dreams.\nWhat do you think about your body? Do you dislike some parts of your body or have days when you feel self-doubt? Such feelings are natural from time to time but being obsessive with ourselves in the long term can result in serious concerns such as depression and eating disorders. Take your first step toward feeling happy with your body every day with this unique course. It begins by defining positive body image and its various aspects, including perceptual, affective, cognitive and behavioural body image. You will research the effects of the media on positive body image and uncover tips for being more body positive. These include focusing on your positive qualities and abilities, saying pleasant things to yourself every day and stopping harsh or unhealthy self-talk. Then we will look into ways to improve your body respect, including practising gratitude, self-care and letting go of body comparison.\nNext, the course emphasises the significance of body acceptance and introduces methods and activities to assist you in developing your body acceptance. Following that, you will explore the distinction between helpful and unhelpful assumptions. It includes the ways of identifying and altering the underlying appearance assumptions that triggered your body dissatisfaction. Subsequently, the course emphasises the significance of body acceptance and brings methods and activities to assist you in developing your body acceptance. You will examine the distinction between helpful and unhelpful assumptions and gain more reasonable and adaptable guidelines to use daily by identifying and then altering the underlying appearance assumptions that triggered your body dissatisfaction.\nThe course also explains intuitive exercise, which offers an exploratory process that may help you become more in touch with your drive for physical activity. You will learn to design your own ‘Recipe for True Rest’ to reap huge benefits on all levels: body, mind and spirit. The course then will teach you to strengthen your relationship with your body through the body-aware approach. You will discover how to challenge, rewire and rewrite rooted perspectives and beliefs to become body-conscious. Finally, you will learn about comparison thinking, which may feed ‘I am not good enough’ ideas and contribute to low self-esteem and poor body image. Transform yourself by making body mindful statements like ‘I am valuable’, ‘I respect myself and my life’, ‘I accept who I am’ and ‘I value my body functions’ to enhance your body confidence.

      "description": "If you ask someone, “What does it mean to be courageous?” they might reference a superhero movie, thinking it’s about saving someone from a burning building, jumping in front of a car, or disarming a shooter. While these are acts of courage, we also need courage for everyday challenges—like walking away from conflict, pursuing our dreams, or talking to a stranger. Courage helps us choose the right emotion in tough situations and do what’s right. It’s a tool we all have, but not everyone knows how to use it. This course will help students unlock their superpower: courage. Cornelius offers practical tools to help them become more courageous in their lives.\n\n\nCornelius is one of today’s most dynamic youth motivational speakers. Growing up on Chicago’s South Side, he faced violence and crime from a young age. Many of his friends ended up incarcerated or lost their lives, leaving him to wonder how things might have been different if they had learned to manage their emotions and become leaders. Despite these challenges, Cornelius earned both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees. He founded Super-Self Institute, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that helps youth become super leaders, authored nine youth development books, and has been a youth counselor for the past 10 years. Through his transparent motivational speaking, Cornelius shares his journey of overcoming adversity to achieve his goals, helping students believe that anything is possible if they are willing to work for it. His ability to connect with any audience is exceptional, inspiring students to unleash their true power and become today’s super leaders.",

You can always takes few extra moments and rethink the decision you are about to act on, and reconsider whether your behaviors will aid or damage your overall effort.\nThe act of being mindful and imagining two possible outcomes is often enough to gain the willpower and self discipline you need to do the right thing.\nDON'T LET SHORT-TERM, COMPULSIVE DECISIONS DERAIL YOUR EFFORTS\nCompulsive behaviors and rash decisions tend to be quite damaging. They can range from food choices to exercise choices to business decisions to even choices of whether to get angry or not, and how to best handle potentially threatening situations.\nMANAGE STRESS IN ORDER TO GAIN MORE WILLPOWER AND DISCIPLINE\nShort-term stress isn't considered bad. It can even be helpful to give us energy and focus to take on immediate challenges. But when stress reaches the point of overwhelm, we tend to fall into coping mechanisms that tend to be undesired behaviors that we aren't as mindful about. In fact, mindfulness itself becomes harder to do because our minds are so consumed with that feeling of overwhelm.\nTIME MANAGEMENT AND TASK ELIMINATION TO DECREASE OVERWHELM\nWhen we decrease the intensity of our immediate stressors, they aren't as likely to cause the feeling of being overwhelmed, and that can make it easier to be more mindful about our discipline, and immediately give us more willpower.\nBALANCE WHEN TO USE WILLPOWER AND SELF DISCIPLINE\nDon't confuse discipline with willpower. Willpower is the process of forcing yourself to do something in the moment. Self discipline refers to your overall handling of a situation from your mindset to your planning to your execution of certain tasks.\nFor greatest success, combine when you use willpower and when you use self discipline. Sometimes forcing yourself is possible, but often it's not. When forcing yourself to do something out of sheer will isn't possible, you'll be able to employ many tactics to work smarter and not work harder by being intelligent and sophisticated about your self discipline.\nDON'T MAKE DECISIONS WHEN TIRED\nThe problem with making decisions when tired is similar to the problem of making decisions while feeling overwhelmed. It's just harder to think everything through. It's also harder to find the willpower for self discipline when tired. If you are tired, it's often smarter to just rest instead of forcing yourself to do some next task because you will gain diminishing returns if you are working while being tired.\nTHE MARSHMELLOW TEST FOR DISCIPLINE AND WILLPOWER\nWe'll also discuss the famous Marshmellow test, which tests the discipline and willpower in children. The Marshmellow test has been a strong predictor of later-life and school success.\n\n\nInvest in your future! Enroll today!",

      "description": "Your values are the things that are most important to you, they are the Foundation of your Confidence, guide your Behavior, influence your Decisions and Keep you Motivated. Knowing your values is important because they help you achieve your goals. First of all, being unsure about your values leads to stress and anxiety. Even worse, being unsure about your values can lead you to behave contrary to your values, which can lead you to even more stress and anxiety, regret and even guilt.\nValues Reflect Who You Are: Your values are your personal guideposts—they represent what matters most to you. When your actions don’t align with your values, it can create an inner conflict. This disconnection may lead to feelings of unhappiness or dissatisfaction because you’re acting against what you believe is right or important.\nEmotional Discomfort: Unhappiness often arises when you feel you’ve let yourself down. For example, if you value honesty but find yourself withholding the truth, the gap between your values and behavior can trigger a sense of unease or regret.\nAchieving Success and Staying Aligned: When you reconnect with your values, it’s easier to create meaningful goals and see achievable outcomes. Success feels more authentic because it reflects who you are and what truly matters. For example, if you value perseverance, sticking to a challenging project can bring a deep sense of accomplishment, not just a temporary win. Aligning your actions with your values helps you build a life that feels both successful and fulfilling.\nSelf-Reflection and Growth: Feeling unhappy about straying from your values isn’t always negative—it can be a sign of self-awareness. It helps you recognize where you’ve veered off course and gives you the chance to realign your actions. For instance, if you value kindness but snap at someone, that discomfort can motivate you to apologize and act more compassionately in the future.",

They let fear, self-doubt, and limiting beliefs dictate their experience. But what if you could reframe any situation to empower yourself instead?\nThis course will teach you Advanced Frame Control—the ability to reshape your perspective, control your mindset, and create your own reality.\nWhy Frame Control is a Game-Changer\nEvery experience in life is just raw data. It has no built-in meaning—it’s your frame that determines whether something feels like a setback or an opportunity, a disaster or a lesson, a threat or a challenge.\nFor example:\nBeing stuck in traffic can be \"a frustrating waste of time\" or \"a chance to listen to a great podcast.\"\nA heated argument with your partner can be \"an exhausting conflict\" or \"a chance to deepen your connection and understanding.\"\nLosing a job can be \"a devastating blow\" or \"the push you needed to start your dream business.\"\nYour frame determines your life. If you don’t control it, it will control you.\nWhat You’ll Learn in This Course:\nHow to identify and break free from limiting frames that keep you stuck\nThe psychology behind how frames shape confidence, success, and relationships\nAdvanced NLP techniques to reprogram your subconscious responses\nHow to turn failure, rejection, and criticism into fuel for growth\nThe secrets of persuasive people and leaders who shape reality with their words\nPractical exercises to train your mind to default to empowering frames\nWho Is This Course For?\nPeople who struggle with self-doubt and negative thinking\nEntrepreneurs, leaders, and influencers who need to control narratives in business and life\nAnyone interested in NLP and mindset mastery\nIndividuals looking to stop being reactive and start shaping their own reality\nAnyone who wants to be mentally unshakable, no matter what life throws at them\nChoose Your Reality—Choose Your Life\nIf you’re ready to stop being controlled by your fears, doubts, and old thought patterns, this course will give you the tools to take charge of your mindset, emotions, and personal success.\nLet’s get started.\n\n\nYour Mindset Breakthrough Starts Now—At No Risk\nThis course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you have nothing to lose—except the limiting beliefs that have been controlling your life.\nAre you ready to take charge of your reality and master your mindset?\nEnroll now and start developing Advanced Frame Control—the key to unshakable confidence, success, and mental resilience.\n\n\nMeet Your Instructor: Dan Munro\nDan Munro is a bestselling author, coach, and expert in mindset mastery. For nearly a decade, he has helped thousands of people-pleasers break free from self-doubt and develop mental resilience and unshakable confidence.\nBefore becoming a coach, Dan worked in rehabilitation for serious criminal offenders, helping them rewire their thinking and behaviors.

Drawing from personal experience with IBS, leaky gut, and candida linked to trauma, this mini-course empowers you to heal emotionally and physically.\n\n\nPersonal Note from Tracey\nHello, I'm Tracey, and I'd like to share something personal. I, too, once had unimaginable digestive issues (IBS, leaky gut, candida). I couldn't eat anything, and my quality of life was awful—this is 100% linked to stress and trauma. If I can heal my body and even create a business out of my healing, the sky is also the limit for you, beyond health.\nGrowing up in an abusive environment was normal in the culture and household I was raised in, and I felt very unsafe feeling and expressing my emotions. I was oppressed by a controlling and strict parent who influenced me to believe I did not have my natural right to feel, express, and be myself without getting punished. I was expected to be perfect and do things perfectly. I was never good enough, and I spent my life trying to gain approval. All of this made me constantly anxious, chasing and performing. Fast forward, years later, after painful and expensive trial and error, I concluded that ultimate healing was within me as it is within you. Feeling, validating, and expressing the stuck and trapped emotional stress from the past and healing codependency was the way and IS THE TRUE WAY to personal power and transformation.\nThis mini-course includes what is most important to do so you can start focusing on the core things to heal.

We are dependent on our parents and/or other caregivers to take care of us, mold us and guidance us. In most cases, they try to do the best they can. However what we do not realize until we become adults, is that our parents, our caregivers, other adults in our lives did the best they could to provide for and guide us within the lens of surviving or living through their own personal traumas. Is this an excuse? No, it just fact!\n\n\nOur parents, caregivers and other adults in our lives came into this world just as we did, through the lens of someone else's traumas and life experiences. Depending upon how those traumas or experiences were managed, determined how they shaped our mama, daddy, caregivers and other adults. Because the negative intergenerational cycle or what we sometimes refer to as \"curse\" may not have been broken, these unhealthy narratives were passed down to us. Well My Beloved...here's the good news! As adults, we have control over our lives! We have the control to change the narrative and to create a new story! We have the power to discard those things, experiences, people, etc. that are no longer serving us. We have the power to release ourSelves. But how do we do this, you ask? We do it breaking the cycle...by healing our womb wounds.",

It was something that was right there in front of us all, every day, trying it’s hardest to slow us down. It was self-doubt and self-sabotage!\nDo you ever notice that no matter how hard you try to show the world that you are “doing great” and “feeling fine”, there are a bunch of negative, self-limiting thoughts bouncing around in your head? Well... this is normal. We all feel this way. But we don’t have to.\nIf you are reading this right now, my guess is that you are at the point where you want to do something about this, right?\nWell, I experienced this very thing throughout my 20’s and 30’s. It seemed like everything I tried to do; no matter how hard I worked on something; I didn’t achieve the success that I thought I deserved. It seemed like some (un)expected bad thing would happen and take away my earlier wins.\nIt wasn’t until I was at my lowest in my career and my life, that I realized (through the help of a few smart mentors of mine) that I needed to CHANGE MY MIND!\nI was the cause of all my failures and struggles. It was my negative beliefs and thoughts that were holding me back.\nIn this course, I will help you, just like I was helped years ago:\nI will show you how you were taught to be careful, doubtful, and afraid to fail.\nThen, I will help you dig into your self-limiting beliefs – lifting up the rug, turning on the lights, and exposing what’s been holding you back.\nAnd finally, together, we will rewrite your operating instructions with new, empowering, positive thoughts which will propel you to success in any and every-thing you take on.\nIf you are ready to change your mind and create a new, successful world for yourself, then LET'S GET STARTED!",

As I guide them through each step, they are going to think differently, overcome obstacles, and take steps to stop the fear and repossess their lives. It‘s true that there are lot of things that we can spend our time worrying about, but there are also many wonderful miracles that happen everyday and we should focus on these things. Fear is our enemy. All of us have fear but it can be defeated. We are concerned about our future and the future of our loved ones. We do not seem to have good solutions that will bring changes in our life, therefore, we let fear grab us and control us. We have many unanswered questions about our finances, our career, our relationship, etc. We feel vulnerable and defenseless and we do not know how we will face tomorrow. Focusing too much on our fear will hold us back and prevent us from making the right decision for our lives. We feel very uncomfortable and we project ourselves as nervous and disgruntled people to the world. There are ways to stop fear and to experience breakthroughs in our life. Take action today, you will be able to reach your goals, dream big and fulfill your destiny on the earth.",

      "description": "Promoting Mindful Reflection and Well-Being\n\n\nIntegrating mindful reflection and well-being considerations into immersive learning experiences is critical for supporting students' overall development. Educators can encourage students to engage in reflective activities that allow them to evaluate the emotional and psychological implications of their immersive learning experiences. Educators may help students build a healthy connection with immersive technologies by creating a supportive environment for open discourse regarding the nexus of technology, well-being, and thoughtful observation.\n\n\nFurthermore, prioritizing students' mental and emotional well-being while implementing immersive learning experiences encourages self-awareness and emotional balance, providing students with the tools they need to navigate the digital realm with mindfulness and resilience.\n\n\nAs educators continue to harness the power of immersive learning experiences, incorporating ethical reflection, cultural competence, empathetic engagement, and mindful well-being considerations ensures that students not only gain a deeper understanding of diverse perspectives and historical contexts, but also emerge as empathetic, culturally aware, and ethical decision-makers capable of navigating the complexities of the modern world with integrity and empathy.\n\n\nExploring Diverse Perspectives Through Immersive Storytelling\n\n\nImmersive storytelling in virtual environments is an effective tool for exploring diverse views and storylines. Students can build a nuanced awareness of the intricacies inherent in human experiences by connecting meaningfully with the perspectives and challenges of people from various cultural origins.\n\n\nStudents can immerse themselves in the lived experiences of people from various historical periods, geographical locales, and cultural settings by using immersive storytelling. This in-depth exploration of varied perspectives builds empathy and appreciation for the complexities of human existence, resulting in a more thorough knowledge of the interconnection of world events and societal processes.\n\n\nFurthermore, the immersive nature of storytelling in virtual settings encourages students to overcome their own prejudices and preconceptions, allowing them to approach challenging challenges with a fresh perspective. This not only teaches critical thinking, but it also fosters a greater sense of empathy and compassion for individuals and communities whose experiences might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\n\nPromoting Global Citizenship and Cross-Cultural Competency\n\n\nIncorporating immersive learning experiences into educational frameworks not only helps students gain in-depth cultural awareness, but it also promotes global citizenship and cross-cultural competency. Students can broaden their vision and transcend ethnocentric perspectives by immersing themselves in virtual worlds that capture the richness of many cultural heritages.\n\n\nImmersive learning allows students to understand the interconnectedness of global challenges, as well as the shared responsibility that comes with addressing them. This comprehensive approach to learning creates a feeling of global citizenship by teaching students that their actions and decisions intersect with and affect a broader, interconnected world.\n\n\nFurthermore, the immersive character of these encounters enables students to develop cross-cultural competence through active engagement with and reflection on cultural variety. This allows students to approach intercultural encounters with compassion, respect, and a thorough awareness of the complex forces that shape different societies.\n\n\nTo summarize, incorporating immersive learning experiences into educational paradigms has enormous potential not just for extending students' comprehension of various perspectives and historical settings, but also for cultivating empathy, global citizenship, and cross-cultural competency. By interacting with these immersive technologies, students can develop into conscious, culturally aware individuals capable of navigating the complexity of our globalized world with a profound feeling of interconnectivity and respect for diverse cultural narratives.",

      "description": "This Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) training serves to equip you with a cognitive framework for understanding your psychological make-up. The course is structured in a way that'll lead to towards completely understanding how NLP principles can be embodied and applied to strengthen your mindset and develop robust emotional intelligence.\nNLP is a psychology-based approach to communication and personal development that focuses on the direct connection between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic), and behavior patterns learned by experience (programming). For over 50 years, it has been embraced in fields such as business, entrepreneurship, high-level sports, and coaching.\nThis training addresses critical questions such as: How can NLP impact mental health and emotional resilience? What role does language play in shaping our inner dialogue? How can we transform self-limiting narratives and contribute to personal and professional growth? How do we harness emotional intelligence to navigate complex social and work environments?\nThis course offers an insightful journey into how your thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors shape your emotions and affect your mental health. Through principled teaching and real-world examples, you'll learn how to apply NLP to rewire unproductive thought patterns, effectively manage stress, and establish a personal culture of emotional resilience from deep within.\n\n\nSome of the key concepts covered in this course include:\n-  The influence of language on our thoughts, worldviews, beliefs, and behaviors\n-  How to adopt new positive thought patterns and discard unproductive habits\n-  The relationship between our mental judgement and relationship experiences\n-  A framework for understanding emotions and creating positive states of mind\n-  Understanding the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) on social relationships\n-  Communication skills for earning trust, managing conflict & influencing people\n-  The role of self-awareness and personal insight in fostering personal growth\n-  Timeless disciplines for managing stress, anxiety and other negative emotions\n-  The role of maturation and responsibility in becoming an attractive character\n-  The principles and life wisdom that leads to self-awareness and self-reflection\n\n\nStudents will delve into a spectrum of timeless life principles, drawing on the works of influential figures such as Virginia Satir, Milton Erickson, Abraham Maslow, and others who influenced the early development of NLP. This study aims to equip students with a nuanced understanding of 'change dynamics', and create a pathway towards self-actualisation and growth.\nThrough enlightening lessons, reflective exercises, and real-world examples, participants will gain the knowledge, wisdom and NLP skills necessary to even guide others towards self-discovery and personal growth. They can learn how to move beyond agreeing or disagreeing with principles, and instead reflect upon them to evaluate their relevance in the context of their life.\nThe wisdom, skills and knowledge you'll gain through this training are not just theoretical – they are practical and applicable to the real-life situations you'll encounter day-to-day. Throughout this training you will naturally develop a deeper knowledge of yourself, and consequentially increase your ability to build strong relationships, overcome career life and daily struggles.\nOur training materials are captured in HD video, accompanied by an MP3 version of the course, and supplemented with PDF resources to enhance your learning experience. The course is available on-demand, providing a comprehensive framework to contextualize your studies and establish a strong foundation for sharing your newfound life-knowledge with others.\nⓘ This training is part of a broader 28-course Achology curriculum. It comes with a full 30-day money back guarantee, so if you're not satisfied, you can get a refund with no questions asked.",

People who manipulate others attack their mental and emotional sides to get what they want. The person manipulating — called the manipulator — seeks to create an imbalance of power, and take advantage of a victim to get power, control, benefits, and/or privileges at the expense of the victim.\nManipulation can happen in close or casual relationships, but they are more common in closely formed relationships. In a way, everyone can manipulate others to get what they want. But manipulation is defined as any attempt to sway someone’s emotions to get them to act or feel a certain way.\nManipulators have common tricks they’ll use to make you feel irrational and more likely to give in to their requests.\nThis course will alert you to these tricks.\nSigns of Manipulation\nYou will learn that Manipulation can happen in many forms but quite basically Manipulation is an attempt to undermine your rational thinking.\nBeing able to identify manipulation is a large part of putting an end to it. Manipulation can take a toll on your own emotional well-being.\nOn this course you will do practical exercises to identify the signs of manipulation in your own life.\nPersonality Vulnerabilities.\nYou will also learn how you are vulnerable to manipulation and develop an action plan to set boundaries and take back control of your life.",

      "description": "Whatever you are working on—whether it’s your physical health, mental health, relationships, or career—a healthy sense of self-love is an essential tool for your journey. Without it, everything is more difficult. Instead of blaming yourself or blaming circumstances, you can access the peace and happiness you deserve.\n\n\nWhat Is Self-Love?\nLove is misunderstood to be an emotion; actually, it is a state of awareness, a way of being in the world, a way of seeing oneself and others. ~DAVID R. HAWKINS\nThe idea of self-love is often misunderstood. People believe that self-love is the same as narcissism or that self-love only comes to those who are “lovable.” Let’s take a moment to clear this up.\nSelf-love, like love for any other person, is the natural outcome of taking the time to understand, accept, heal, appreciate, and nourish the person you are (as opposed to the person you think should be).\nSelf-love is self-understanding. Self-love is self-awareness. Self-love is self-care.\nBuilding self-love is not a matter of becoming lovable, nor is it a matter of becoming better than others. It’s about connecting to yourself in an authentic, sustainable way and doing everything you can to nourish that connection.\n\n\nHow Will Self-Love Help You?\nWhen I loved myself enough, I began leaving whatever wasn’t healthy. This meant people, jobs, my own beliefs and habits—anything that kept me small. My judgement called it disloyal. Now I see it as self-loving. ~KIM MCMILLEN\nSelf-love changes lives—for better when it’s there and for worse when it’s absent. Here are some of the ways that having self-love can impact your life:\nConfidence. Self-love helps break your addiction to the approval of others because your own approval becomes the most important thing.\nAccomplishment. Loving yourself means developing an awareness of your skills and talents and cultivating the courage to pursue them.\nPhysical health. Taking time to understand your body’s needs and capabilities is essential to developing long-term habits of caring for your physical health.\nMental health. Loving the person you see in the mirror is the only way to help that person through any kind of distress. When you take the time to understand yourself, you can actually help instead of just trying to shut yourself up.\nSelf-forgiveness. Seeing yourself with eyes of love is the only way to forgive yourself for the mistakes you’ve made in the past so that you can stop being held back by the person you were and start appreciating the person you are.\nHealthy relationships. Cultivating love for yourself will give you the essential practice you need to build relationships based on love rather than need.\nLeadership. If self-love is difficult for you, then persevering on this journey will help you develop the ability to love when it’s difficult, which is your one-way ticket to compassionate leadership and helping others.\nPatience. Self-judgment tries to convince you that if you just fix that one last thing, you can earn your own approval. Self-love will teach you to accept self-discovery as a lifetime journey. Like this, you will not only overcome chronic perfectionism, you will also develop deep, resilient patience for the process of change and the way of life.\nJust imagine how different your life could be if you took the time to cultivate a better relationship with yourself. Why not begin today?\n\n\nJoin the 30-Day Self-Love Challenge\nYou have been criticizing yourself for years, and it hasn’t worked. Try approving of yourself and see what happens. ~LOUISE L. HAY\nThis challenge was designed to help revolutionize your relationship with yourself through daily tasks that dig deep into the mental, emotional, and behavioural patterns that govern how you feel and think about the person in the mirror.\nThe 30 days of the challenge are divided into three sections:\nCleansing. For the first 10 days, you will develop an awareness of what has been holding you back in the past and begin to remove those limitations.\nAppreciating. For the next 10 days, you will cultivate gratitude, understanding, and appreciation for who you are in the present.\nGrowing. For the last 10 days, you will develop skills and insights that will help you become who you’re meant to be in the future.\nI’m also inviting all participants of the 30-Day Self-Love Challenge to a private Facebook group that we lovingly call the “tribe.” This space is incredible. All the participants have come together in the name of self-love, compassion, and self-awareness to create a safe, supportive haven for self-discovery. This group is the perfect place for you to make new friends, receive the support you need, and share your story with the people who will be most inspired by it.\nAs for the program, all the videos will arrive into your email inbox daily after you sign up. Each video is filmed in a different spot in beautiful Costa Rica, so you can enjoy the beauty of nature while learning to enjoy the beauty within you!\nThis is going to be a fun and powerful process, and I’ll be with you every step along the way.\nIn a nutshell, you’ll receive:\n30 video tasks of deep, intensive, life-changing tasks that will transform your relationship with every part of you—your body, your inner guidance, your inner gremlin, your emotions, your thoughts, your dreams, your fears, your past, your passion, and your purpose.\nLifetime access to a community of like-minded people on the same journey—people who will understand why you’re doing this, what you want, and where you want to go.\nLifetime access to all the videos, so you can go at your own pace and repeat the challenge whenever you want!\n\n\nWhat Participants Are Saying\nAll though I’m not on social media of any description, tendencies to be a loner who is an introvert. Vironika’s self-love challenge was awesome. Helped me heal on a number of levels. I’m definitely more comfortable in my own skin. Social situations don’t freak me out as much. Gave me more confidence in myself. It’s not age specific. I’m 55 and found the experience priceless. Can’t give this course descriptions that do it justice. Totally awesome. Find out for you, your worth it!\nBRIAN KRETSCHMANN\nVironika’s 30 Day Self Love Challenge was filled with heart, wisdom, and challenges that were both fun and deep. Her authenticity gathered a group of strangers who became a loving, supportive community. The challenges are timeless. I will be doing them again and again.\nLYNNET MCKENZIE\nEveryone at some point needs a bit of a handhold to make that first climb out of the pit of self doubt. For me this challenge as constructed by Vironika handed me a great vantage point to not only start my climb back up but to also create perspective to set a safe route back to the top.\nERIK H.\nThanks Vironika! Love it. Love you. Love our tribe. Thanks for all the gifts I’ve received due to the challenge. I’ve received: wonderful new friends, community, a safe place to share my accomplishments not just hard times. A community free from judgements or criticism. I’ve received applause and encouragement of my dreams. I’ve got friends who’ll chat with me at 3 am! I feel better about myself and more comfortable in my own skin. I have a bit more courage. I now fit in somewhere. The more I connect, the more risks I take, the more happy to be alive I’m feeling. Never had this experience before! It’s mind blowing! I’m filled with gratitude!!!!!!\nBETTE C.\nVironika appeared at the perfect moment in my life when I was lost within myself. Her daily challenges has allowed me to reach depths I’ve never discovered, face my deepest fears and gain clarity. I could feel a huge shift in my perception of everything. Now I am not afraid to just be myself and shower myself with love. I’ve never felt more genuine and authentic in my life!\nKENNETH L.\nVironika’s 30 Day Self Love Challenge needs a new name : how about Vironika Knows What’s Up! …I have to admit – I was a bit nervous in the beginning of this, mostly because I am not a ‘by video learner.’ I generally prefer the whole PDF thing. I am now SOLD on YouTube challenges/courses… Whether she was speaking of authentic desires or acceptance and change, she had my attention with every single video. And she is amazing and a natural on camera. The content was incredible and nothing short of brilliance. And the varying scenic outdoor places she had us on tour with were all incredible and made me a better person… Vironika has helped me see that I am worth something. Blessings to her, and anyone that comes across her. If you are in her life, then count your stars, because this woman is a rare gem. And we are all better people because of knowing her.\nRENEE AVARD-FURLOW\nThe cost of this Challenge is worth your weight in gold. You won’t regret registering for this Challenge or register for someone else as a gift or just because! I’d like to also include that this has been the most loving, enriching, and therapeutic group I’ve ever belonged to and I have new friends here that will last a lifetime … It’s so liberating to be able to be so open, honest and authentic without judgement. Now that is liberating & priceless!\nSHARON L.\nThe 30 Day Self-Love Challenge is a unique and beautiful experience. There is so much about self-love on the Internet these days and to be honest, I couldn’t quite grasp the whole idea. But Vironika makes it so simple to understand and put into practice. Her videos are priceless because she has a warmth and honesty about her that makes you feel calm and centered and more able to accomplish what you want to. It has also brought me many new friends that I treasure…people really care about each other in this tribe. It truly is like a family and Vironika is our loving mother.\nSHEILA BERGQUIST",

      "description": "Welcome. I consider you important, and if you disagree, that's fine, we can agree to differ. You may be pleasantly surprised with your course, as it is very practical and hands-on.\nThis is a course full of practical skills that are easy enough to try during the actual video lecture. You learn as you do. This is not a theory that you can later apply. You learn exactly how whilst you watch your video lesson. After the introductory training to ease you into it, we start with simple, practical skills that can \"rewire your brain\" (a common descriptive metaphor) and help you do whatever you like without fear stopping you. That party you missed, that interview you didn't attend, that relationship that broke your heart, and more - imagine not having that fear of \"not good enough\" keeping you in a rut! To bravely go where you want, do what you want, with whom you want, the way you want. Everything is easier when you believe in yourself. And this course teaches you how.\nThis course uses a unique adaptation of EFT Tapping with a bit of Reiki healing and some common but invaluable wisdom from my hypnosis knowledge. Every lecture consists of an explanatory easy-to-follow video, and a download reminder and easy-to-follow short PDF. Your lectures are as follows:\nFind how your course is applied efficiently in real life, get an overview of the course, and download your easy, illustrated How-to guide that you can easily put into practice within minutes.\nLearn the role of the subconscious mind, and how EFT Tapping can dislodge limiting beliefs from it.\nFind a neat new way to quieten that inner critical voice, literally at your fingertips.\nDiscover the biggest blocks to feeling good enough. And learn how to release them. You can expect to feel the progress as you apply the new skills along with the easy lecture video.\nImagine your mind as a garden. In this lesson, we weed out the roots underneath the \"Not Good Enough\" weeds. In their place, immediately will start to grow the most amazing strong flowers and trees, of \"I Am Good Enough\". Your self-esteem and confidence can then be free to grow.\nLearn the one trick you can use to make saying positive affirmations work. Even if you have tried them before and they didn't.\nEnjoy your learning and your journey!",

      "description": "Welcome to How To Transform Fears Of Rejection And Self Expression. I am happy this course found its way to you.\nAs someone who grew up terrified to speak up, speak out, and express myself in front of others out of fear that I would be rejected and not be loved, I am extremely grateful that I can share my perspectives with you on rejection and what I have learned that helped me to not only understand rejection more specifically, but to also to transform the fear.\nIn this course, you will learn:\nHow the fear of rejection is no bigger or different from any other fear we may have.\nWhat is fear exactly? How do we create fear?\nThe importance of self-expression. How it can benefit others too. How it relates to unconditional self-love.\nThe origin of the fear of rejection. What we are actually afraid of.\nTypes of self rejection we do and what that means for the experience of our reality.\nThe true definition of rejection. What choices we have in it.\nWhat it means for others to be a part of your moment and you a part of theirs.\nWhat it means if we experience others rejecting our gifts.\nHow we don't need to resist what we do not prefer.\nHow a world of natural expression looks like and functions.\nWhat it means to resist the moment.\nWhat it means if the moment actually benefits us no matter what it is.\nHow the moment leads us to even more of ourselves.\nWhat it means to use up the moment.\nWhat if we saw life as a process made up of moments that can elevate you?\nHow our lives, relationships, and endeavors are never static, but always changing and expanding us.\nHow everything matters.\nAnd more...\nLet's breakdown the fear, expose it for what it actually is and in bringing this knowledge to light, it will allow us to free ourselves from patterns (and choices) of self-rejection. I have had a lifetime of experience with this subject and this understanding has helped to free me to express myself without hesitation and to do my part in the world, which is to be me as fully as possible, as is your part for you as well.\nIf you have any questions or need support as you are taking this course or after, please reach out to me and I'll be very happy to speak with you.\nMuch love, Adam",

It’s just become a popularized way of describing the discounting of any achievements and the experiences of major doubt some people have, which can get in the way of going after major goals. Some people, who experience imposter syndrome, often feel like a fraud, and they worry that they’ll be exposed as a fake. Also, some people are terrified of failing and worry about being discovered and seen as incompetent. So when the term imposter syndrome is used in this course, that’s the context.\nThe course is designed to do several things: 1. Help you identify and address the limiting beliefs that stops you from taking action; 2. Help you to understand how the inner critic became so powerful in your life; 3. Help you learn how to stop it from sabotaging your life; and 4. Help you replace negative beliefs with positive ones and discover ways to build the badass confidence you need to go after any goal you may have. You’re also welcomed to send in your specific challenges and get tailored responses to increase your confidence.",

Now is the time to keep achieving your goals without judgments and without looking back to see if anyone approved of them.\nYou can enjoy successful relationships, gain personal wealth, and achieve your goals through self-love. Self-esteem and self-love are the foundations upon which we build our lives. The ability to achieve our goals and create our own happiness depends on having a healthy sense of self-esteem. Stop feeling needy and don't allow others to make you feel bad about who you are.\nI made some of the same mistakes, and they helped me identify some patterns we tend to repeat, which I will share with you later. In my experience, most people neglect to love themselves because they are so preoccupied with the false sense of loving everyone else.\nThe objective of this course is to help you understand what healthy self-esteem is and how it can be achieved. When it comes to being happy, you already have what you need, but you're the one holding you back from embracing happiness and enjoying the gift of inner peace that can only come from self-love.",

When children experience criticism, they learn to believe themselves to be inadequate or defective. When they experience neglect or abandonment, they learn to see themselves as unimportant or unlovable. When they are abused, they see themselves as broken or bad and feel shame. Without intervention, these perceptions last their entire lives. This course gives participants a new perception of their negative experiences and of themselves, helping them reclaim their positive self-esteem. The course includes video lecture, therapeutic stories, lecture summaries and written exercises. The video is of a six-hour live workshop given by Dr. Ledford, but broken down into thirteen lectures.",

Shame is the main reason we feel lonely and inferior, and strive for perfection. Sexual disorders, depression, addiction and many eating disorders are largely disorders of shame. Both physical abuse and sexual abuse also significantly involve shame.\nThe meaning of “shame” in this course is a sense of worthlessness and inadequacy many people feel. We feel unlovable, not good enough, defective and flawed. Feeling of shame is when you feel like a mistake, rather than a worthy human being. You feel inner chaos and undeserving of respect, love and caring.\n\n\nWhen you experience shame, you wish a hole would open up and swallow you. We feel that all of our vulnerabilities become exposed and magnified. We believe that others view us with disdain or disgust. We think that perhaps we can be accepted if we can only become more lovable or perfect. We direct all of our actions towards accomplishing certain goals.\nWe feel exposed when we make mistakes, when we do or say something unintended in a public setting, or when we compare ourselves unfavorably with people around us. When we are doing well, we think it’s only a matter of time before we are discovered as useless. When we make mistakes, we expect a terrifying degree of anger from the people we disappoint.\nShame is related to self-contempt, a sense of inferiority, and low self-esteem. Paradoxically, people who are judgmental, arrogant and contemptuous toward others, are also driven by shame.\n\n\nThe problem is, people don’t like talking about shame. There is shame about shame. We will readily admit guilt, hurt or fear before we will admit shame.\nThat’s why we use other words to describe our experience of shame: embarrassed, shy, guilty, self-conscious, rejected or inferior.\n\n\nIf you feel:\nbad about yourself\nlike a loser\ninsecure about your appearance\nfoolish and embarrassed\nself-conscious\nalways guilty for something\nhurt and left out\nvulnerable and exposed\nunworthy and unlovable -\nthen you have shame problems.\n\n\nTopics covered in this course:\nWhy do we feel ashamed of ourselves?\nWhen do we feel shame?\nHow to handle shame-eliciting situations?\nIs it necessary to shame people?\nGrowing up in shaming families\nDealing with childhood traumas\nWhy do we become addicts?\nAddictions (to food, sex, hobbies, etc.)\nHow do we act when other people shame us?\nHow to defend yourself against shaming?\nShame in romantic relationships\nShame in relationships with parents\nSexual and physical abuse\nCharacteristics of adults shamed in childhood\nFeelings of embarrassment, humiliation, self-consciousness, shyness\nIs shame good or bad?\nShould we use shame to discipline children?\nWho are chronically shamed people?\nEating disorders and shame\nContemptuous people\nPerfectionists are shamed people\nWhy are we attracted to wrong people?\nIs criminal behavior related to shame?\nShame is different in different cultures\nHow is procrastination related to shame?\nHow do we avoid shame?\nDo you envy often?\nAre you indifferent person?\nPeople who strive for power and control\nNarcissists and their shame\nHow to build a healthy adult relationship?\nDependency, Co-dependency and Counter-dependency\nShould you share your shameful experience?\nHow to grow up and mature?\nHow to deal with Criticism?\nHow to raise a healthy child?\nHow to be empathetic?\nHow to be resilient to shame?\nStrategies to cope with shame\n\n\nShame is a major destructive force in our life. It is at the root of all dysfunctions in families. In this course, you’ll learn how to deal with shame and how to develop resilience to shame.\nThe less we understand shame and how it influences us, the more power it has over our lives. You can overcome the feeling of shame by understanding why it occurs and how to deal with the experience.\nThis course will give you solutions and tools to address the shame you are feeling. After you implement the ideas, I hope you’ll be more confident to move forward, take chances, and create a better future.",

Of holding yourself back with procrastination, self doubt and lack of confidence? Why wait? Make this investment in yourself now!\nSelf-Compassion is more helpful than self-esteem. It is a quality of your relationship with yourself best understood in contrast to the internal negativity that is the Inner Critic. Life is going to include successes and failure, easy and hard times. How you treat yourself in these situations determines your resilience. The reality is that we always do the best that we can at every given moment. However, we still can’t predict the future and what seems wise one second can backfire the next.\nMost people cause themselves pain by using internally directed negativity to try to improve their lives. This is understandable as these habits were developed very young. However, it is possible to update these habits to reflect your best understanding of yourself and the world. Self-compassion and self-coaching not only feel much better, but they are also more effective motivators.\nThis course will help you understand the roots of your internally directed negativity and see your Inner-Critic as a misguided habitual strategy for improving your life. Bringing compassion to this well-intentioned but primitive habit eases the whole system. Then you’ll learn a couple tools to release some of the distress it has caused you over the years, making change easier. Next you’ll be guided through creating a personalized program to systematically change these patterns for the better.\nGreater Self-Compassion makes the whole internal world more peaceful and kind which helps with motivation, self-worth, efficacy and resilience while reducing anxiety, depression and stress.\nJust watch the videos to learn this life-changing perspective. Use the included exercises to apply this to your life and understand your own unique situation more clearly. Learn several techniques to reduce the emotional distress that has been holding you back around this issue. Develop realistic plans, including self-talk and behavior, to manage your inner-critic when it arises. Then do the practice and enjoy the results!",

On the other hand, if you can give yourself more confidence, that confidence will carry you through the challenging parts of your business and give you the boldness to attempt things you otherwise wouldn't. Also, many external forces constantly damage our confidence and we need to know how to keep out confidence and self-esteem up.\n\n\nBONUSES INCLUDED\n\n\n* Personal invitation to my Facebook community after you complete the course\n* My list of 50 business-success skills after you complete the course (hint, boosting confidence is one of them)\n\n\nRESPONSIVE AND CARING INSTRUCTOR: WORLD-CLASS STUDENT SUPPORT\n\n\nIf you have questions, know that I am here to help! I answer 99% of student questions within 24 hours.

      "description": "If you could change anything about your life, what would it be?\nMany of us today live with insecurities, self-doubts, and difficult experiences that have chipped away at our sense of who we really are. These can interrupt our progress towards our goals, affect our relationships negatively, and leave us with feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness. But what if you could find a way to rid yourself of those insecurities and self-doubts?\nFeeling deeply confident requires an accurate sense of self-worth and a solid understanding of who you are as an individual. This course provides key lessons on how to restore that sense of self-worth. Throughout the lessons in this course, you will learn what self-worth is and where it comes from; how worth affects various aspects of your life, such as your relationships, education, career, confidence, fitness, nutrition; and how understanding yourself better can lead to an increased sense of confidence and worth.\nAdditionally, this course will provide you with numerous ways that you can re-discover your own worth. These lessons include topics such as replacing judgment with compassion, searching your family history, recognizing your influence on the world around you, and taking care of yourself as someone valuable. This course is geared towards those with a Christian background, but can be just as applicable to those of other backgrounds as well.\nMany of the problems we face in our world today, including mental health challenges, difficult relationships, poor physical health, and chronic stress/anxiety, have their roots in a low sense of self-worth. This course is designed specifically to help you develop your sense of worth, so that you can have the resiliency and the capacity to resolve problems you may be facing in your life. At the end of the day, the stronger your sense of self-worth and self-confidence, the more consistently you will feel joy and satisfaction on a day-to-day basis.",

      "description": "Dear friend,\n\n\nIf you'd like to boost your confidence and build amazing relationships, this will probably be the best course you'll ever watch. But don't take my word for it, right?\n\n\nSimply look at the level of impact I've managed to produce in my student's life.\n\n\nOne student said that what we teach is worth every penny because she was able to stop worrying and finally start living. She was constantly worrying if her boyfriend is cheating on her even there wasn't any evidence. She was stuck into her mind believe all the bad scenarios that her mind was telling her. After working with me she could finally start behaving in a way that made her boyfriend love her even more.\nShe said she couldn't believe that I'm putting such valuable information into such a low price course.\n\n\nAnother student said that he was always afraid to speak with people because they think he's a weirdo. He was afraid to buy the groceries, drive the car or simply start a conversation with someone. After working with me, he's now feeling secure around other people. He's feeling so good that he even started his own business where he's talking with people on the phone, making sales and feeling happier than ever.\n\n\nThat's the results I was able to provide for me clients.\n\n\nHere's another one.\n\n\nSimon was feeling always inferior compared to other men. He was really shooting himself in the foot by believe this stupid idea that kept him back from getting the girl that he wanted. After working with me, he started dating a lot of girls and he's on his way of finding his perfect match.\n\n\nBut that's not all. This course is much more than JUST confidence and self-esteem.\n\n\nHere's a fraction of what you're getting.\n- Get the courage to stand up and be yourself\n- Follow your dreams-\n- Make your own decisions even if it opposes the opinion of others\n- Stop the critical voice inside your head\n- Remove negativity from your life\n- Build great relationships and make nice friends\n- Go out into the world and enjoy this life\n- Love who you see in the mirror, and think positive loving thoughts about yourself\n- Stop caring about what others think of you and comparing yourself with others\n- Stop worrying about something bad that might happen in the future and start hoping for something good (it takes the same amount of mental energy)\n- Start saying \"I'm good enough\" and I deserve love, respect and appreciation\n- Define your sense of self-worth by your own terms\n- Feel worthy of being seen, accepted and loved\n- Feel comfortable being yourself In front of others\n- Become 100% secure in who you are\n\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg, because you're also getting\n\n\n- Advanced strategies to understand your own mind and hack your subconscious mind so you naturally feel comfortable in your own skin and around other people.\n- A proven method to generate massive results in your life by using the \"action-reaction technique\", the most powerful insight, hands down\n- A counterintuitive approach to boost confidence by simply trying to be \"less confident\". Here you'll discover the hidden patterns that keep you back\n- A case study that shows how to get out of your own head by simply writing out all the nonsense that your mind is telling you. This exercise is amazing and it just works better than anything I've ever tried.\n- How to behave with people so they like, respect and trust you. Shocking results after you implement this.\n\n\nAs you can see, this course is filled with valuable information every single second.\n\n\nSome people said that this is so valuable that I could easily charge thousands of dollars for it. But you don't have to pay that amount of money. You can get this course paying a fraction of that.\n\n\nGet enrolled now before it's too late.\n\n\nSincerely,\nAndrei",

      "description": "Confidence comes from within. It is not about certain behaviors, tricks, or hacks. It’s not about just appearing more confident or acting more confidently. It's not a certain mindset. It’s about knowing who you are. When you possess confidence, you don’t have to try to appear confident. Your confidence simply shines through, whether you know it or not!\nThat is what this course is about. Every single person on this planet could use at least a little more confidence. Every single one.\nTrue confidence, the kind we are talking about in this course and want to teach you, comes from within. It comes from a deeper knowledge of who you are as a human being. When you know who you are and are comfortable with that person, you naturally exude true confidence. You don’t have to think about it.\nYou become a better person when your confidence improves. As your confidence builds, you will find yourself kinder and more accepting of others. You will be less jealous and envious. You will naturally be more assertive, ensuring your needs are met through appropriate communication behaviors that support your own needs without harming others. Your relationships will automatically improve because you are a better, healthier, and stronger person. The little things won’t bother you so much. You will spend a lot less time in frustration, irritation, and anger, and a lot more time in peace and acceptance. When your inner core is stronger, your entire life improves.\nAt the same time, most of us suffer from at least some degree of low self-esteem. Our lives have brought difficulties that we have not had the strength or the tools to manage in a healthy way, so we have fallen victim to them. Our self-esteem has suffered. We have developed shortcomings and hang-ups. We have become insecure in some or many ways. Most of us go through our entire lives with the same low level of self-esteem we came out of childhood with—which is simply tragic. Some of us sink even further because of adult failures. We know we have low self-esteem, but we don’t know what to do about it! And it seems like strengthening our self-esteem is so much work and so difficult. We don’t want to trudge through our painful experiences to try to sort them out in order to build our self-esteem, so we just continue through life with low self-esteem. The problem with that is that low self-esteem actually harms us in so many ways. We choose the company of others with low self-esteem, both personal and professional, perpetuating our own low level and preventing us from improving. We try to climb out of the low self-esteem hole by seeking the company of those we admire, but they don’t want to be around us so they leave us behind. We are left to ourselves, in our own stinky pile of goo, aware that we have low self-esteem but helpless to improve it. We become comfortable in our low level of self-esteem, refusing to take real steps to build it because we don’t want to go through the pain that’s buried deep in our psyches, and we believe this is the only way out.\nThe good news that we present to you today is that you don’t have to endure the pain of reliving your most damaging experiences in order to strengthen your self-esteem! Just take this course! Listen to the lectures and if you really want to make the most of the course, do the exercises. Even if you do just a few exercises, your self-esteem and self-confidence will improve dramatically. The more exercises you do—and they are not difficult exercises—the stronger and healthier you will become! It really is that simple! Achieve your wildest dreams! Don’t let anything hold you back! These are the benefits of strong self-esteem and self-confidence.\nThis course comes directly from science. It is the result of many years of research and clinical psychology practice and findings. None of this information is just some random person’s ideas about what builds confidence. Instead, these techniques, tips, and strategies come from the very best scientific sources. This separates this course from every other course out there that claims to boost your confidence. These are tested strategies that have improved the lives of many many people by strengthening them from within. These strategies will help you too!\nImprove your life starting right now.

And you don't need to flee from people or situations because you feel powerless. You won’t become a selfish egoist who is difficult to be with. Quite the opposite! You won't let others take advantage of you and you can have rewarding relationships with people.\nYou have the ability to act and react with self-assurance.\nThis course accompanies you on your way. Various effective exercises from hypnotherapy and NLP will help you to get more in touch with your own power. This allows you to show more of who you really are and how you really feel - without hiding and pretending any longer.\nThere are thoughts which weaken or strengthen you. You become aware of them. Then you will develop thoughts which support you in the future. There is more beyond thinking that you will explore. Family background also often influences the self-assurance\n40 years ago my first seminars were about self-confidence. In the meantime I have learned a lot more. In this course you can benefit from my insights and experiences.\nGo for it!",
