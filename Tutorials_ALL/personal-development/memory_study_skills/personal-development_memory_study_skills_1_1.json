The title sounded interesting, so here we are.\nIt’s safe to say that Joshua Foer has lots of memory credentials – he won the 2006 USA Memory Championship and set a new record for memorizing a deck of 52 cards: 1 minute and 40 seconds.\nIf you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember - Joshua Foer\nWhen he’s not memorizing stuff, he works as a freelance writer, writing for The New York Times or The Washington Post, for example. He also has a TED talk.\nOverview: An average person squanders 40 days annually compensating for things they've forgotten. The author of “Moonwalking with Einstein” Joshua Foer was once like that. After months of training his memory, however, he was able to reach the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. Even more important, Foer discovered a simple, yet vital truth: In every way that matters, we are the sum of our memories. “Moonwalking with Einstein” draws on cutting-edge research, a surprising cultural history of remembering, and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to change our understanding of human memory. In this summary, you will learn the time-proven techniques of memory improvement, and understand that having a great memory is all about perseverance and creativity.",

      "description": "Photographic Memory: Train Your Brain to Remember Anything\nPhotographic Memory: Step-By-Step Memory Techniques To Remember What You See, Hear, & Read - Faster & Longer Than Ever\nWelcome to Photographic Memory Mastery: Train Your Brain to Recall Anything — a comprehensive, science-based memory training course designed to help you develop remarkable recall using proven techniques. This course combines neuroscience, mental imagery, and step-by-step strategies to help you unlock the full potential of your mind.\nWhat You Will Learn in This Photographic Memory Course\nHow to dramatically improve your memory using visualization and association\nStep-by-step strategies to build your own photographic memory system\nThe Memory Palace technique (Method of Loci) used by world memory champions\nHow to memorize names, numbers, facts, vocabulary, and long lists with ease\nHow to use images, emotions, and links to retain complex information\nPractical drills to strengthen recall speed, mental clarity, and focus\nDaily routines to reinforce memory performance in just 15 minutes a day\nThe neuroscience behind how memory works and how to optimize it\nHave you ever had a brilliant idea vanish from your mind moments after you thought of it?\nHave you ever walked into a room full of new colleagues or clients, and felt that familiar, sinking feeling of panic as the names you just heard evaporate into thin air?\nHave you ever spent hours, or even days, reading a fascinating book, only to find that a week later, you can barely recall its most powerful lessons?\nIf you’re nodding your head, know this: This is not a personal failing. It is not a sign of low intelligence, and it is not an irreversible trait you were born with.\nThe frustration, the embarrassment, and the missed opportunities that come from an untrained memory are not your fault. They are the result of never being taught how your brain actually learns and remembers. We are given a supercomputer at birth—the human brain—but we are never handed the user’s manual.\nThis course is that manual.\nWelcome to Photographic Memory: Train Your Brain to Remember Anything.\nThis is not a collection of parlor tricks or recycled “study hacks.” This is a masterclass in cognitive performance. It is a systematic, step-by-step journey into the architecture of your own mind, designed to fundamentally upgrade the way you learn, retain, and recall information.\nImagine walking into any room, any meeting, any exam, not with anxiety, but with the calm, unshakeable confidence that the information you need is right there, ready to be accessed at will. Imagine being able to learn a new language, master a new skill, or absorb a complex subject faster and more deeply than you ever thought possible.\nThis is not a distant dream. This is a trainable skill. And by the end of this course, it will be your new reality. You will not just learn about memory; you will become the conscious architect of your own knowledge, capable of building a mental empire of information that will serve you for a lifetime.\nThe decision you make today is about more than just improving your memory. It's about deciding to unlock a more intelligent, more confident, and more capable version of yourself. Are you ready to stop forgetting and start mastering?\n\n\nThe Great Myth of the \"Bad Memory\"\nLet’s be honest. How many times have you said it, or thought it?\n\"I'm just terrible with names.\" \"I have a memory like a sieve.\" \"I wish I had a photographic memory, but I was born with a bad one.\"\nThis single belief is the most destructive barrier to unlocking your mind's true potential. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you believe your memory is a fixed, unchangeable piece of hardware—like a cheap camera with a blurry lens—you never bother to learn how to use it properly. You accept its limitations as your own.\nBut what if this entire premise is wrong?\nWorld-class memory champions—the individuals who can memorize the order of ten shuffled decks of cards or recite thousands of digits of Pi—are not born with anatomically different brains. Neuroscientists have scanned their brains and found them to be, for all intents and purposes, identical to the average person's.\nSo, what is their secret? It’s not their hardware; it's their software.\nThey have learned to run a different operating system on their brain. They have installed a set of powerful, efficient, and scientifically-backed systems for encoding and retrieving information. While the untrained mind tries to remember a phone number by brute force—repeating it over and over—the trained mind translates those abstract digits into a vivid, unforgettable story. While the untrained mind passively reads a textbook, the trained mind actively deconstructs it, turning its key ideas into a mental map it can navigate with ease.\nThis is the central promise of this course: to give you that advanced operating system.\nWe will systematically dismantle the myth of the \"bad memory\" by showing you that your brain is not a static organ, but a dynamic, living network of connections that is constantly changing and adapting. This is the power of neuroplasticity. Every time you learn a new skill, practice a new technique, or think a new thought, you are physically rewiring your brain, creating new pathways and strengthening existing ones.\nThe feeling of effort you experience when learning something new is not a sign of weakness; it is the feeling of construction. It is the feeling of your brain building a better version of itself.\nThis course is designed to direct that construction process with precision and purpose. We will move beyond the idea of memory as a passive storage unit and embrace it as an active, creative verb. You will learn to attack information, wrestle with it, and transform it from something boring and abstract into something visual, emotional, and unforgettable.\nYou already have the hardware. It is the most powerful learning machine in the known universe. It’s time to install the software that finally does it justice. Stop letting a single limiting belief hold you back from the cognitive power you rightfully possess. The only thing standing between you and a world-class memory is a set of techniques, and we are going to give you the entire toolkit.\nA Look Inside the Photographic Memory Course: Your Transformation, Step-by-Step\nThis course is strategically structured to take you from absolute beginner to confident master. Each section builds upon the last, creating a powerful synergy of skills that culminates in total memory control. Here is a glimpse of the journey you are about to embark on:\n\n\nPhotographic Memory Course Part 1: The Foundational Principles (Your New Mindset)\nBefore you can build a skyscraper, you need to lay an unshakeable foundation. In this first section, we rewire your entire approach to memory and learning.\nMastering the Attention Filter: You will discover that most \"memory failures\" are actually attention failures. We'll give you a framework to become a master of the \"moment of first contact,\" the critical window where information is either successfully encoded or lost forever. You'll learn to cut through the noise of a distracted world and focus your mind like a laser beam, ensuring that what you choose to learn actually enters your memory.\nThe Science of a Permanent Memory: You’ll learn to defeat the single greatest enemy of learning: the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve. We will arm you with the scientifically-proven strategy of Spaced Repetition, a simple, elegant system that turns the act of forgetting into a trigger for making memories even stronger. This isn't about studying harder; it's about studying smarter, transforming hours of wasted effort into permanent, long-term knowledge with just minutes of targeted review.\nEngineering Your Peak Mental State: Why can you sometimes recall information effortlessly, while other times your mind feels like a blank slate? The answer often lies in State-Dependent Memory. You will learn how to intentionally engineer your physical and psychological state for optimal learning and recall. This is your secret weapon for high-pressure situations, giving you on-demand access to your mental library during exams, presentations, and important meetings.\n\n\nPhotographic Memory Course Part 2: The Mnemonic Engine (Your Core Toolkit)\nOnce the foundation is set, we build your core engine. These are the fundamental techniques that form the heart of every advanced memory system.\nThe Art of Association: Your brain does not store information in a list; it stores it in a web. You will learn to instantly link any new, abstract piece of information to something you already know, weaving it into your existing network of knowledge. This is the fastest way to make new facts feel familiar and intuitive.\nUnleashing Your Visual Power: Did you know that a massive portion of your brain's cortex is dedicated to visual processing? Your brain thinks in pictures, not in abstract text. We will teach you how to flip the \"Visualization Switch,\" turning the most boring, abstract data—numbers, concepts, names—into vivid, bizarre, and unforgettable mental movies. You’ll understand the Dual-Coding Theory and the famous Baker/baker Paradox, the scientific proof that visualization is the key to a super-memory.\nThe Story Method: For thousands of years, humanity has passed down knowledge through stories. Your brain is hardwired for narrative. You will learn to hijack this innate ability, weaving random lists of items, key presentation points, or study notes into short, logical, and memorable stories. Information that was once disconnected and hard to recall will become a smooth, flowing narrative that your brain can't help but remember.\n\n\nPhotographic Memory Course Part 3: Cracking the Code (Mastering Numbers, Dates & Formulas)\nThis is where you gain a true superpower. Numbers are the language of logic, finance, and science, but they are notoriously difficult for our brains to handle. In this section, you will become a \"number whisperer.\"\nThe Major System: The Rosetta Stone for Numbers: You will learn the legendary Major System, the phonetic code used by every memory champion to memorize thousands of digits. This elegant system allows you to translate any number, no matter how long, into concrete words and images. A 10-digit phone number will no longer be a struggle; it will become a simple two or three-part story. A 16-digit credit card number will transform from an impossible string of digits into an easy-to-remember journey of just eight images.\nThe Date-A-Base: You will build a mental timeline of history, converting any date into a concrete keyword that you link to the event. History will cease to be a dry collection of facts and will become a vivid, organized narrative in your mind.\nUnlocking Formulas: You will learn how to deconstruct the most complex mathematical and scientific formulas into simple visual stories, ensuring you can recall them with perfect accuracy during an exam or in a practical application.\n\n\nPhotographic Memory Course Part 4: The Reader's Edge (Absorbing Books, Speeches & Languages)\nThe world’s most valuable knowledge is locked away in books and texts. In this section, you will gain the keys to that kingdom.\nActive Reading, Not Speed Reading: We’ll debunk the myth of speed reading and give you a powerful framework for Active Reading. You will learn how to deconstruct, engage with, and extract the most critical ideas from any text. You will stop being a passive consumer of words and become an active architect of knowledge, ensuring that the lessons from the books you read stay with you for life.\nMind Mapping: You will learn to use Mind Maps to capture the entire structure of a book or subject on a single page. This radiant, brain-friendly method mirrors how your mind actually works, allowing you to see the big picture and the connections between ideas in a way that linear notes never can.\nMemorizing Speeches & Languages: You will learn how to anchor an entire speech or script to a mental journey, allowing you to deliver it from memory with confidence and charisma. We will also give you the Keyword Method, a powerful shortcut that accelerates language learning by helping you absorb hundreds of new vocabulary words with shocking speed and ease.\n\n\nThe Pinnacle of Memory Mastery: Constructing Your Mind Palace\nEverything you learn in this course culminates in this: the mastery of the most powerful memory system ever devised, the Method of Loci, more famously known as the Memory Palace.\nThis is the secret weapon of the ancients, used by Roman orators to deliver epic speeches and by medieval scholars to memorize entire libraries of books. It is the single technique that allows memory athletes to perform their superhuman feats. And you are going to master it.\nYou will learn how to use familiar locations from your own life—your home, your office, your daily commute—as a vast and perfectly organized mental storage system. We will teach you, step-by-step, how to:\nChoose, design, and map out your first high-quality palace: You will learn the rules for creating a reliable mental journey with distinct, memorable locations (loci) that will serve as your mental filing cabinet.\nPlace and retrieve information effortlessly: You'll learn the art of transforming data into vivid images and \"placing\" them at specific locations within your palace. The recall process becomes as simple and natural as taking a mental stroll through a familiar place.\nStore complex, layered information: We’ll go beyond simple lists and teach you the \"File and Folder\" system, an advanced technique for storing multiple, related details (like key facts about a historical figure or scientific concept) at a single location in your palace.\nBuild an infinite mental empire: You will discover that your storage capacity is literally limitless. We will show you how to build virtual palaces from your favorite video games, movies, and even from pure imagination. You will become the architect of a sprawling mental universe designed to house a lifetime of knowledge.\nMastering the Memory Palace is a profound experience. It is the moment you realize that your mind is not a container, but a world. A world that you can explore, shape, and build. It is the ultimate tool for organizing your knowledge and your life.\n\n\nThis Photographic Memory Course Is For You If... (Your Real-World Transformation)\nThis is not just an academic exercise. This is about practical, real-world transformation. We designed this course for specific people with specific challenges and aspirations. Do any of these sound like you?\nFor the University or College Student: Imagine walking into your next final exam feeling calm, prepared, and in control. Instead of desperately cramming and hoping for the best, you have an entire semester's worth of information neatly organized in a memory palace. When you see an essay question, you simply take a mental walk to the relevant \"room\" in your palace and retrieve the key arguments, dates, and definitions with perfect clarity. Your grades will transform not because you studied harder, but because you studied smarter than ever before.\nFor the Ambitious Professional: Picture yourself in a high-stakes client meeting. Someone unexpectedly asks for a specific figure from last quarter's report. While others fumble through their notes, you pause, access the \"Financials\" room in your mental palace, and state the number with quiet confidence. You remember the names and a key personal detail about every person at the table. This is the power that gets you noticed, builds trust, and accelerates your career.\nFor the Entrepreneur and Business Owner: Your mind is your greatest asset, but it’s being pulled in a hundred directions at once. Imagine having a system to keep it all straight. You can deliver an entire investor pitch from memory, perfectly recalling your market projections. You can meet a new potential partner and remember not just their name, but the names of their children and the project they were passionate about. You can learn a new software or marketing strategy over the weekend and have it fully integrated by Monday. This is the mental agility needed to win.\nFor the Lifelong Learner & Avid Reader: Think of the dozens of books you’ve read. How many of their core lessons can you recall and apply right now? Imagine finishing a book and, in just 30 minutes, creating a permanent Mind Map of its core structure in your memory. You are no longer just a consumer of information; you are a curator of wisdom. Your knowledge becomes cumulative, a growing library of insights that you can draw upon for the rest of your life.\nFor the Language Learner: You know that vocabulary is the key, but rote memorization with flashcards is a slow, painful grind. Imagine being able to learn 30, 50, or even 100 new words in a single day, and actually have them stick. Using the Keyword Method, you will create powerful visual hooks that make vocabulary acquisition feel less like a chore and more like a creative game, dramatically shortening your path to fluency.\nFor Anyone Who Wants to Keep Their Mind Sharp: Perhaps you’ve noticed little moments of forgetfulness creeping in, and it worries you. This course is the ultimate cognitive fitness program. The daily practice of these techniques is like taking your brain to the gym. It strengthens neural connections, improves focus, and enhances mental agility. This is not about clinging to the past; it's about investing in a sharper, clearer, and more vibrant mind for your future.\n\n\nThis is Your Moment of Decision\nYou are standing at a crossroads.\nOne path is the one you’ve been on. It’s a path of frustration, of accepting the limits of an untrained memory. It’s a path of sticky notes, forgotten names, re-read pages, and missed opportunities. It’s the path of letting your brain's incredible potential lie dormant.\nThe other path is different. It is a path of control, confidence, and cognitive power. It is a path where learning is a joy, not a struggle. It is a path where your mind becomes your greatest ally, a well-organized and powerful tool that you can rely on in any situation.\nThe difference between these two paths is not genetics or natural talent. It is having the right system. This course is that system.\nWe have poured everything into making this the most comprehensive, practical, and transformative memory masterclass available anywhere. This is not a summary of tricks you can find online. It is a fully integrated curriculum that takes you from the foundational psychology of memory all the way to the construction of vast mental empires.\nEvery minute you wait is another moment you allow your potential to go untapped. Every forgotten idea, every missed connection, every hour wasted on inefficient study is a cost. The ability to learn faster, remember more, and think with greater clarity is not a luxury; it is the critical superpower for success in the 21st century.\nYou have the capacity for an extraordinary memory locked within you right now. You just need the keys. We are handing them to you.\nEnroll now, and begin the most rewarding journey you will ever take: the journey into the true potential of your own mind.",

Ho deciso di creare questo corso da zero per permettere a tutti gli studenti universitari di non fare gli sbagli che io stesso ho fatto i primi due anni di università: non avere un metodo di studio adeguato e dedicare tutto il tempo allo studio senza viversi nulla (con risultati non soddisfacenti). Nessuno purtroppo ci insegna a studiare e molto spesso finiamo per mettere in pratica quello che andava bene durante il periodo del liceo, non considerando però, la mole di lavoro che aumenta enormemente.\nIl metodo di studio che ho messo a punto e che vi propongo ad un prezzo molto basso vi farà vivere l'università in maniera più tranquilla, ottenendo risultati migliori in modo da poter vivere in maniera adeguata il periodo più bello della vostra vita.\nSo che la qualità multimediale non è ai livelli del 2022 (purtroppo non ho un budget e un'esperienza tale da registrare video cinematici o da influencer. Vi assicuro però che vi darò delle indicazioni pratiche).\nSe avete voglia di migliorarvi siete finiti nel posto giusto! Basta solo seguire e mettere in pratica quello che vi dico.

Vediamo in dettaglio cosa significa.\nGli errori sistematici possono essere visti come delle scorciatoie poco efficaci che il nostro cervello utilizza per risparmiare risorse. Si possono trattare i bias cognitivi come una forma di adattamento del nostro cervello, i quali hanno effetti sul ragionamento e sul comportamento.\nQuanti bias cognitivi esistono?\nPiù di 100. In psicologia ed economia comportamentale si individuano sempre bias cognitivi nuovi grazie allo studio del comportamento delle persone. Wikipedia fornisce una mappa dei bias cognitivi più diffusi molto comoda da consulare, che puoi anche stampare.\nCOSA SONO LE EURISTICHE?\nEuristica, in generale, è definita da Treccani come:\nAspetto del metodo scientifico che comprende un insieme di strategie, tecniche e procedimenti inventivi per ricercare un argomento, un concetto o una teoria adeguati a risolvere un problema dato.\nIn psicologia le euristiche si possono definire come delle strade rapide che seguiamo per affrontare determinati problemi. Quando un’euristica compie un’imprecisione, un errore, ci troviamo di fronte a un bias cognitivo. Gli studi più celebri sulle euristiche sono stati condotti il secolo scorso dagli psicologi Tversky e Kahneman, quest’ultimo premio nobel per l’economia nel 2002.\nIn questo corso parleremo dei più comuni bias cognitivi e delle euristiche più note, per cercare di capire quali errori la nostra mente tende a compiere quotidianamente.",

In diesem Film gehe ich besonders auf Lernstrategien zum Thema Sprachenlernen ein.\nEs ist günstig, wenn du dir auch die anderen NLP Lerncoach Filme ansiehst.\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach Teil 1 werden grundsätzliche Vorgehensweisen beim Lerncoaching gezeigt.\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach 3: Dyskalkulie / Rechnen /  Mathematikverständnis / Umgang mit Textaufgaben / Formeln speichern und abrufen lernst du, wie du dich erfolgreich mit dem Thema Mathematik anfreunden kannst.\nim Videokurs NLP Lerncoach 4 findest du Themen rund um das Thema Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration / Schaffen eines motivierenden Arbeitsplatzes / ein optimales Zeitmanagement / Verbesserung des Schriftbildes.\nIm NLP Lerncoach 5 geht es darum, Prüfungen effektiv vorzubereiten, große Wissensmengen schnell und leicht zu lernen, Wissen zu vernetzen und Wissen im inneren Raum gut erreichbar abzuspeichern.\nDu erhältst ein ausführliches Händout mit Erklärungen und Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitungen sowie Trancen, die du für dich selbst und andere nutzen kannst.\nIm Kurs findest du Demonstrationen mit unterschiedlichen echten Coachees die echte Themen vor der Kamera lösen!\nIn den Demos gefilmte Themen:\nDemo mit Meryem: Meryem war Legasthenikerin, d. h., dass sie starke Probleme mit der Rechschreibung hatte. In der Demo siehst du, dass sie zunächst nach Gehör schreibt, wie sie lernet, Wortbilder zu visualisieren und Fehler auszusortieren, sodass nur noch eindeutig korrektes Wissen im Gedächnis zum Abruf bereitsteht.\nDemo mit Lara: Lara hat Legasthenie. Sie lernt im Lerncoaching, korrekte Wortbilder visuell abzuspeichern und Fehler auszusortieren.\nDemo mit Janes (Marius ist Coach): Janes hat Rechtschreibeprobleme/ Legasthenie. Er schreibt Wörter in unterschiedlicher Schreibweise. Das spricht dafür, dass er Mehrfachspeicherungen im Kopf hat und dadurch unsicher wird. Es geht also darum, Fehler auszusortieren.  Janes fällt es sehr schwer, die Augen oben zu behalten, da diese Blickrichtung durch unangenehme Erfahrungen aus der Schulzeit blockiert ist.  Diese Blockaden werden mithilfe des integrierten Augenbewegungsprozesses aufgelöst. Zusätzlich erhält Janos noch innere Helfer und optimiert seine Visualisierungsfähigkeit mithilfe von nützlichen Ressourcen, bis die stabile Visualisierung von Wörtern leicht gelingt.\nDemo mit Steffi: Steffi kommt eigentlich wegen einer Dyskalkulie. Da sie mit Rechtschreibung besser zurechtkommt, als mit Mathematik, erlernt sie das visuelle Abspeichern zunächst über die Rechtschreibestrategie. So wird es leichter für sie, auch Ihre Dyskalkulie loszuwerden. Bei Steffi treten immer wieder Blockaden beim Fehleraussortieren aufgrund belastendeer Ereignisse in der Schulzeit auf, die zunächst bereinigt werden müssen.\nDemo mit Sophia: Sie lernt, wie sie Französisch-Vokabeln, die bisher \"ihre Feinde\" waren, schnell und sicher speichern und abrufen kann.\nDemo mit Lara: Lara lernt Vokabeln zu visualisieren, bearbeitet belastende Erfahrungen zum Thema Schreiben, ankert Spaß und freundet sich so mit dem Thema Schreiben an. Dach macht Lara noch eoine Zeitreise, um die Zuversicht zu erhöhen.\nDie Kursen zum Thema Lerncoaching sind einerseits für Menschen jeden Alters geeignet, die sich selbst mit dem Thema Lernen beschäftigen, ihre eigenen Lernstrategien hinterfragen und optimieren möchten. Andererseits für Menschen, die andere als Coach beim Lernen unterstützen möchten. Coachees können Kinder oder Erwachsene jeder Altersstufe sein.\nNLP bietet eine Reihe nützlicher Strategien zu den klassischen Themen Rechtschreibung, Lesen, Textverständnis, Vokabellernen, Lernen von Regeln, Rechnen, Textaufgaben, Mathematikverständnis, Organisieren komplexer Lernaufgaben, innere Ordnung schaffen, Konzentration, große Wissensmengen schnell und sicher lernen, etc..\nDas einzige, was in einem Videokurs nicht leistbar ist, sind Antworten auf Verständnisfragen, Übungsgruppen und das Feedback zu deinen Erfahrungen in den Übungsgruppen... das solltest du dir entweder selbst organisieren, damit du alles Gezeigte trainieren kannst oder an unseren Online-Übungsabenden teilnehmen. Die Termine dafür teilen wir dir mit. Fragen kannst du natürlich auch stellen, wenn du Kontakt zu mir aufnimmst.\nWenn du einen Lerncoach-Kurs besuchst, kannst du das Videomaterial als wertvolle Ergänzung nutzen, denn du weißt ja, dass NLP eine Methode ist, die durch Modelllernen vermittelt wird. Je mehr Demonstrationen du zu einem Thema kennst, umso leichter wird es für dich, das Wesentliche herauszufiltern. Du lernst, an den individuellen Coaching-Bedarf angepasste Variationen des Vorgehens kennen und kannst dadurch souveräner mit eigenen Blockaden und Themen von Coachees umgehen.\nDer Kurs ist sowohl für Anfänger / Einsteiger ins NLP geeignet, als auch zur Vertiefung der Kenntnisse für fortgeschrittene NLP-Anwender.\nDie Trancen sind bestens für die Selbstanwendung geeignet - du kannst dich durch das jeweilige Format führen lassen oder die Trancen auch zur Anleitung deiner Coachees nutzen\nNLP (Neuro Linguistisches Programmieren) ist in allen beruflichen Bereichen, in denen Lernen, Kommunikation, Beratungskompetenz sowie gelungene Selbststeuerung einen wesentlichen Anteil hat, von großem Nutzen.\nNLP ist eine Methode, die zunächst durch Modeling von Höchstleistungen entstand. Ursprünglich ging es dabei um effektive Psychotherapie. Die Methode hat sich inzwischen in vielen weiteren Bereichen etabliert, wie: Personalwesen, Führung, Werbung, Vertrieb, Kundenzufriedenheit, Gesundheit, Physiotherapie, Coaching, Seminargestaltung und Training, Sport und natürlich in allen sozialen Berufen wie Psychologie, Pädagogik, Sozial-Pädagogik, Coaching, Beratung, Schule und Erziehung...\n... Und natürlich ist NLP eine hervorragende Methode der Persönlichkeitsentwicklung.\nDu kannst...\nschnell große Mengen Wissensstoff sowie praktische Vorgehensweisen lernen\ndeine Ziele erreichen\nvergangene Ereignisse bereinigen und gestärkt aus ihnen hervorgehen\ndein Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstvertrauen verbessern\ndein Lebensglück und deine Zufriedenheit steigern\ndeine Überzeugungen und Glaubenssätze optimieren\nNLP als Methoden der Achtsamkeit und Meditation nutzen\ndeine innere Verfassung positiv beeinflussen\ndeine Gesundheit verbessern...\n...denn gute Stimmung und schnelles Überwinden von Stress-Zuständen unterstützt die Funktion deines Immunsystems.\ndeine Spiritualität fördern\n...",

I feel so relieved to have a SIMPLE, yet virtually unbreakable password that will work on every website I will ever visit. >>> The instructor is easy to understand and lays out the instructions in a step-by-step sequence. The voice delivery was slow; ideal if English is a second language; I listened at 1.8 speed. >>> I LOVED the course, and now have a skill that I will use FOREVER... which is a VERY long time! Kathryn K\n\n5 stars Excellent! I've been trying find a consistent way of creating passwords for years, but couldn't quite figure it out. This course will set you on the correct path. Highly recommended! James S\n5 stars This course offers something I can actually use in my life and make a significant change. Ashwin\n5 Stars Excellent Syed B\n5 stars Instructor is doing a great job Chris P\n5 stars Comprehensive tutorial Walter L\n5 stars It's good information Ganesh S\n5 stars Good content Oran K\n5 stars Password course was great! Bob S\nNEVER FORGET A PASSWORD EVER AGAIN\n\nThere are three significant benefits to this course:\nCONFIDENCE  It boosts self-confidence because you can now do something that you would have thought absolutely impossible. You will be able to memorise hundreds of website passwords with ease.\nWe tend to think that to create big changes in our live that we must do something radical. The opposite is the case. Tiny little one per cent changes can have a huge impact.  Every time you enter a wrong password your mind probably tells you that you are stupid. So right now you tell yourself that you are stupid five, six, seven times a day, every day, week after week, month after month, year after year. How do you think that is affecting every aspect of your life? It's like the constant sound of a dripping tap. Drip. Drip. Drip. \"I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot.\" In one hour or less you can learn a technique that will stop the drip. Silence.\nPRODUCTIVITY\nYou waste so much time and energy. In fact if you spend just five minutes a day in trying to recall passwords that is the equivalent of nearly five weeks of your working life over 10 years!\nImagine that. You get up every day and from 9-5 all you do is enter incorrect passwords. This goes on for five weeks or more, with no let up. No weekend break. It would drive you insane. But because you lose a few minutes here and a few minutes there, you put up with it. The most precious thing you have is time. So this course is designed to help you on your way to becoming a time millionaire.\nSECURITY\nIf you use easy passwords or write them down them down, then you are operating on luck. One day your luck will run out. Then you could lose you data, your identity or your bank balance. The hackers are not targeting you specifically. They are like fishermen on an industrial trawler. They have huge nets designed to scoop up every fish in the sea.  You will just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nThe most secure place to store your passwords is in your head. Nobody can hack that. So take an hour of your precious time now. The technique is really simple and anyone can use it.",

Um dos preceitos dos sonhos é que todos os aspectos dos sonhos são um aspecto de nós mesmos. Aprenda a ver para além do que sua mente consegue enxergar e a confiar numa força infinita de harmonia, paz e alegria.\n\n\nAprender a interpretar sonhos\nQuando aprendemos a interpretar sonhos uma nova realidade se apresenta e um profundo reconhecimento do no inconsciente aflora e nos dá clareza, visão e confiança. Esta confiança nos permite a sermos mais assertivos, determinados e corajosos. Esta confiança nos leva também a ter uma capacidade consciente de realizar nossos sonhos acordados! Aquela metas e objetivos que queremos realizar em nossas vidas.\n\n\nFonte de inspiração\nOs sonhos que temos quando dormimos sempre foram uma fonte de inspiração para muitos médicos, neuro-cientistas, professores e investigadores. Desde Freud a Jung, os sonhos sempre causaram debates e profundos estudos a serem executados para uma maior compreensão da razão pela qual passamos cerca de 1/3 das nossas vidas a dormir e, por consequência, a sonhar.\n\n\nQue tipos de sonhos existem?\nNo fundo, o que é um sonho e que tipos de sonhos existem? Porque sonhamos? Como relacionar os nossos sonhos com a realidade (ou a nossa percepção dela)? Saber os tipos de sonhos e como eles podem nos ajudar no autoconhecimento e crescimento pessoal, para que tenhamos uma aproximação ao nosso inconsciente, é uma ferramenta que poucas pessoas estão a explorar neste momento.\n\n\nUm dos preceitos dos sonhos é que todos os aspectos dos sonhos são um aspecto de nós mesmos.\n\n\nAprenda a ver para além do que sua mente consegue enxergar e a confiar numa força infinita de harmonia, paz e alegria.",

This is an opportunity to become a better, smarter, more critical thinker!\n\n\nDid you know that some conspiracy theories turned out to be TRUE, and others turned out to be FALSE? And yet, there are still some out there that are so controversial that intelligent people engage in fiery debates, because they simply cannot figure them out.\n\n\nThis video course is your aid in your search for truth.\n\n\nAnd I'm not here to tell you exactly what to believe. My personal opinion will occasionally become somewhat evident, but that's not the point. The entire POINT of this video course is to give you the tools to THINK FOR YOURSELF.\n\n\nThose tools are called critical thinking skills.\n\n\nCritical thinking means that you know WHY you believe something, and that you even become more understanding of why others believe the opposite.\n\n\nI touched on every topic I could possibly think of that relates to analyzing, logic, and reasoning skills. In this course, you will learn about biases - and let me assure you, there are so many of them! You'll learn about fallacies (mistakes in thinking patterns that lead to false conclusions). And there may be times that you will start questioning everything you've been taught. But... that's the beauty of it! We aren't meant to believe things simply because others tell us what they think is true. There are many mysteries and controversial matters out there, and it is up to YOU to determine what evidence or narrative YOU find the most plausible and what is probably an intentional or unintentional erroneous assumption in other people's minds.\n\n\nThis is no small course. It contains 340 lectures and downloadable materials, a number of quizzes to test if you've been paying attention, and DOZENS of hours of reading, reasoning, storytelling, relatable experiences, etc. The presentations contain both beautiful images and intricate text that can help you question your assumptions, become better at spotting half-truths, or understand that what you already suspected, is actually explicable.\n\n\nI invite you to join me on the side of society that cares; the side that doesn't follow the crowd for no reason; the critical thinkers, analysts, and open-minded individuals that could make this society better because they understand arguments with empathy, logic, and intelligence.\n\n\nPlease, be that person. I hope to see you on the other side, so we can both learn from each other.",

      "description": "Is there a more frustrating moment in modern life than staring at a login screen, utterly convinced you know your password, only to watch the \"incorrect password\" message flash a second time, a third, a fourth?\nThat moment of panic, of a tiny, hot knot of frustration tightening in your stomach as your mind goes completely blank. You know the one. The moment where your entire digital life—your banking, your email, your social media, your cloud storage—feels held hostage by a string of characters you should know by heart.\nYou've tried everything. The endless sticky notes. The \"password\" that is just a slight variation of the last one. The hope that your browser will magically remember for you. The crushing defeat of the \"Forgot Password\" link, which feels less like a solution and more like an admission of failure. You've had the same three or four passwords for every single website, a silent, nagging fear in the back of your mind that a single breach could unravel your entire digital existence. You've experimented with complex password patterns, only to find yourself locked out of your own accounts. The sense of digital amnesia is a subtle, yet profound, source of stress in your daily life. It’s an unspoken pain point, a universal struggle that most people just accept as an unavoidable reality of modern life. They tell themselves, “This is just how it is. My memory isn't what it used to be. There’s no way to keep all this straight.”\nBut what if I told you that wasn't true? What if I told you that your memory isn't broken, and that this problem is not your fault?\nThis is not a course about writing down your passwords. This is not a course about relying on a fragile external tool that holds the key to your entire digital kingdom. This is a masterclass in reclaiming your cognitive power.\nThis is How to Remember Passwords: Lock It In, Keep It Safe.\nThis is your personal invitation to transform your brain into an impenetrable digital fortress—an internal, unhackable vault where every single one of your digital keys is secured by a system so elegant, so intuitive, and so powerful, that you will never again feel the sting of \"incorrect password.\" You are about to embark on a journey that will fundamentally change your relationship with your own mind, revealing a hidden potential you've likely never tapped into before. We are going to expose the myths you've been sold about memory and replace them with a powerful, science-backed reality.\nFor years, you've been told a lie. You’ve been told that your memory is a finite resource, a leaky bucket that can only hold so much information before new details push old ones out. You’ve been told that remembering countless unique, complex passwords is an impossible chore. You’ve been told that you have a \"bad memory,\" and that you are doomed to a life of digital amnesia.\nThis is a myth, and it is holding you back.\nYour brain is not a dusty filing cabinet. It is a vast, limitless network of connections, a biological supercomputer designed for one thing above all else: pattern recognition. The reason you’ve been struggling is not a flaw in your hardware, but a flaw in your software. The methods you’ve been taught—rote repetition, simple memorization—actively fight against the way your brain is wired to learn and recall. They are the equivalent of trying to drive a car with no gas. You have the vehicle, but no fuel. We are going to change that. We will teach you the fundamental principles that power all effective memory, showing you how to bypass the frustrating struggle of \"trying to remember\" and instead, engage with the natural genius of your own mind.\nWe are going to dismantle these myths, one by one. We will show you that the problem is not your memory's capacity, but the flawed strategies most people use. We are going to teach you to speak your brain's native language—the language of stories, images, and spatial journeys.\nIn this course, we are going to teach you to become fluent in the language of effortless recall.\nThe modern world has created a password paradox. We are required to create passwords of astonishing complexity, filled with a chaotic jumble of letters, numbers, and symbols. They are designed to be impossible for a hacker to guess. And in doing so, they are also designed to be impossible for the human brain to remember. You are the only person on earth who can solve this paradox for yourself. The average person has over 100 online accounts, each a potential vulnerability if not secured with a unique, strong password. The anxiety of this reality is palpable. The feeling of being constantly on the back foot, always a step behind the latest security threats, is a source of quiet, constant worry. This is not how it should be. Your digital life should feel secure, empowering, and effortless.\nWe will show you how to turn this liability into your greatest asset. We will not just give you tips; we will give you a complete, end-to-end system that turns abstract, meaningless strings into vivid, unforgettable mental models.\nImagine never again having to hit \"Forgot Password.\" Imagine the confidence of generating a new, unique, 16-character password and committing it to memory in under two minutes. Imagine the profound liberation of knowing that your digital kingdom is secured by the most powerful, unhackable force in the universe: your own brilliant mind. This isn't a pipe dream. It's a skill, and it's a skill you are about to master.\nThis is the transformation you’ve been waiting for. This is the end of digital amnesia. Your journey from frustration to freedom begins now.\nWhat makes this course different?\nThis isn't your average \"how-to\" guide. We will not give you recycled advice you’ve already heard a hundred times. This is a comprehensive, meticulously crafted masterclass that leverages the cutting-edge of cognitive science and the timeless wisdom of memory champions. We have distilled centuries of memory research into a practical, actionable system that anyone—regardless of their background or current memory capacity—can learn and master. We don't just tell you what to do; we show you why it works and guide you, step by step, through the process of making it your own.\nThis course is built on a simple yet profound principle: the most secure password is the one you can remember without effort. And the way to achieve that is to transform abstract data into a powerful, multi-sensory experience that your brain can't ignore.\nWe start at the very foundation: a complete overhaul of your mindset. Before we even touch a single mnemonic technique, we will dismantle your limiting beliefs about your own memory, proving to you that you are capable of far more than you currently believe. This mindset shift is the invisible engine that will power your entire journey. You will learn to see a forgotten password not as a personal failure, but as a fascinating puzzle to solve, an opportunity to apply a brilliant new strategy. This is the crucial first step from frustration to a feeling of total control.\nThen, we dive into the core principles of The Cognitive Kitchen, where every lecture is a hands-on workshop in a powerful new skill.\nYou see, your brain has a genius for remembering things that are vivid, emotional, and connected to your own experience. Passwords, as we know them, are none of these things. So, we'll teach you to force them to become so.\nThe Loci Method: Imagine building an intricate, detailed map of your own mind. This is your Mind Palace, a mental blueprint of a familiar place—your home, your office, your daily commute route. You will learn to use your brain's innate spatial memory to store passwords in a vivid, organized, and unshakeable way. We'll show you how to take a complex password and literally \"place\" its pieces on a journey through your house, so that retrieving it is as effortless as walking from your front door to your bedroom. This is not some esoteric magic; it is a profound scientific principle that will change how you think about all information, turning abstract data into tangible, physical objects in your mind.\nThe Visual Vault: Your brain thinks in pictures, not letters. You will master the art of transforming abstract passwords into single, powerful, and utterly absurd visual images that your brain can recall in an instant. We’ll show you how to turn a string of characters into a mental movie that is so vivid and ridiculous, it is impossible to forget. We're talking about a giant, fire-breathing squirrel juggling flaming teacups. The more outlandish and sensory-rich the image, the more deeply it embeds itself in your memory. This is the ultimate hack for bypassing your brain's resistance to boring, meaningless data.\nThe Narrative Navigator: Your brain is hardwired for stories. You remember the plot of a movie or a book far better than a list of facts. We will show you how to turn every password into its own epic saga, with characters, a setting, and a dramatic plot twist that makes the password’s sequence unforgettable. You will learn to become a master storyteller, with your passwords as the protagonists. This emotional and sequential engagement adds a whole new layer of recall, making your passwords profoundly and effortlessly memorable.\nThis is a complete, no-fluff experience. Every single lesson is packed with high-value, actionable insights and practical exercises that force you to apply what you’ve learned immediately. We will not waste your time with theory for theory’s sake. We will get straight to the heart of the matter, providing you with the tools and the motivation to create a tangible transformation in your life, right now.\nYour journey from frustration to freedom begins with these powerful, foundational skills. But this is just the beginning. The next sections will build upon this foundation, introducing you to even more advanced techniques and strategies that will make your password mastery truly unstoppable.\nYou now have the foundational skills to build your mental fortress, but we're just getting started. The true power of this course lies in learning how to combine, adapt, and refine your techniques for maximum impact. We'll show you how to take your mastery to the next level, transforming impossible passwords into ingenious, personal codes that no one but you could ever decipher.\nAcronym Alchemy: Forget everything you think you know about acronyms. The simple \"ROY G. BIV\" method won't work for a password like P@ssW0rd!. We’ll teach you to go far beyond the basics with Acronym Alchemy, a system for designing a multi-layered mnemonic phrase that encodes not just the first letter of each word, but also the position of numbers, the presence of symbols, and even the case of letters. You'll learn how to craft a simple, personal phrase like \"Purple Pandas Always Sing With Oranges Rather Delicately!\" that, to you, instantly translates into a complex password. This is a personal, unhackable code that no brute-force attack could ever crack, because the key to its logic is stored only in your brain.\nThe Pattern Whisperer: In a world screaming \"random passwords,\" a quiet truth persists: our brains crave patterns. We will show you how to become a Pattern Whisperer, someone who can strategically inject subtle, memorable patterns into your passwords that are invisible to outsiders but crystal clear to your own mind. You’ll learn to leverage keyboard patterns (creating a password by tracing a specific shape on your keyboard), or alternating rhythms (consistently alternating between uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). This is the art of creating passwords that are both highly secure and inherently easy to remember, transforming a liability into your greatest asset.\nBut we're not just about individual techniques. The true mastery lies in learning how to combine them into a single, cohesive system. Imagine this: you take a new password and first, you design a multi-layered acronym for it. Then, you place that acronym's key concepts within a Memory Palace, using vivid visuals to represent each part. This layering of techniques—a \"Cognitive Symphony\"—creates a memory trace so robust and interconnected that it becomes virtually impossible to forget. It’s like creating a password that’s not only a clever phrase, but also a vivid movie playing in a familiar location in your mind. This is where the magic truly happens.\nThis course is designed to empower you with an arsenal of tools, not just a single hammer. You will learn to assess a password's complexity and instantly know which combination of techniques is the most efficient and powerful. This is the difference between a one-trick pony and a true master. You will learn to adapt and evolve your approach, ensuring that no matter what the digital world throws at you, you are always one step ahead.\nWe will show you how to build a system that is not only effective, but also a source of creative joy. This process is fun. It's an engaging mental puzzle that activates your imagination and your innate cognitive abilities. You will start to see the world differently, recognizing patterns and connections everywhere, because you have fundamentally sharpened the tools of your mind.\nThe frustration and anxiety you once felt about passwords will be replaced with a profound sense of control and confidence. You will walk away from this section of the course not just with new skills, but with a new understanding of your own incredible mental potential.\nThis is your journey to becoming your own personal code-maker, an artist of memory. And the best part is, you've only just begun. The final sections will show you how to make this mastery a seamless, effortless part of your daily life, creating a resilient system that will last a lifetime.\nNow that you've mastered the art of mnemonic encoding, it's time to build your ultimate security system. The truth is, relying on a single approach—even a brilliant one—isn't enough in our interconnected world. We will show you how to build a Hybrid Fortress, a powerful synergy of your newfound mental mastery and the best of modern technology.\nDigital Fort Knox: We won't just tell you to abandon your password manager. That would be irresponsible. Instead, we’ll show you how to use it as an indispensable digital assistant, a secure repository for the dozens of less-critical passwords you use every day. Your mental mastery comes into play for the absolute essentials: your master password, your primary email, and the handful of accounts you simply cannot afford to lose. This intelligent division of labor optimizes both security and recall, ensuring you’re never overwhelmed and always in control. We will teach you how to create an Emergency Blueprint, an unhackable, analog backup of your essential mnemonic cues, so that even if the internet goes down, your devices are lost, or your digital tools fail, you are still the ultimate guardian of your digital life.\nThe Behavioral Shield: All the techniques in the world are useless if you don't use them consistently. This is where we shift from skill acquisition to habit formation. We will teach you the science of building lasting habits, so that using your mnemonic strategies becomes an automatic, effortless part of your daily routine. We'll show you how to hack the \"Cue-Routine-Reward\" loop to make powerful recall a subconscious act, as natural as tying your shoes. You will learn to implement Micro-Practice Bursts, tiny 30-second exercises that reinforce your mental locks every single day without feeling like a chore. This isn't about willpower; it's about systematically designing your life for effortless, automatic security.\nCognitive Resiliency: Our final goal is to make you an unstoppable learner, someone who is ready for anything. Your memory is a dynamic, living thing, and it must adapt as your digital life changes. We will teach you the art of Cognitive Resiliency, the ability to evolve your mnemonic toolkit for lifelong recall. You will learn how to proactively refine your mental locks, how to use Spaced Repetition to cement critical passwords into long-term memory, and how to use every instance of forgetting not as a failure, but as a valuable data point for continuous improvement. This is a mindset that will serve you in every area of your life, from learning a new language to mastering a complex new skill.\nThis comprehensive approach is what truly separates this course from anything else on the market. We don't just solve your password problem; we empower you with the tools to become a master of your own mind. You will walk away from this course with a feeling of total control, confident that you possess the ultimate, unhackable key to your digital kingdom.\nThe frustration and anxiety you once felt about passwords will be replaced with a profound sense of control and confidence. You will start to see challenges not as roadblocks, but as opportunities to apply your brilliance. This is the transformation you came for. The final section is a celebration of your mastery and a powerful call to action.\nYou have now forged your Master Key. You are no longer a passive participant in your digital life, subjected to the whims of algorithms and the frustration of forgotten passwords. You are the architect of your own memory, the guardian of your digital kingdom, and the master of your own mind.\nThis is the ultimate transformation. It’s a profound shift from a position of anxiety and reactivity to one of proactive power. What was once a source of constant stress has become a testament to your newfound cognitive prowess. You’ve proven to yourself that your brain’s potential is not limited, but boundless. You’ve learned that the problem was never you; it was the strategy. And now you have a superior one.\nThe principles and techniques you've mastered extend far beyond passwords. You've cultivated enhanced abilities for remembering names, dates, facts, speeches, concepts, and even entire books. This course has been a masterclass in memory itself, providing you with a universal framework for superior recall across all domains of your life. The act of training your brain to remember passwords has unlocked a powerful neuroplasticity that will benefit you for decades to come.\nThis course is designed to be a complete, no-fluff experience. Every single lesson is packed with high-value, actionable insights and practical exercises that force you to apply what you’ve learned immediately. We will not waste your time. We will get straight to the heart of the matter, providing you with the tools and the motivation to create a tangible transformation in your life.\nYour journey from frustration to freedom begins now.\nDon't let another day go by feeling enslaved by your digital life. Don’t wait for another embarrassing login fumble. Don’t risk a security breach that could compromise everything. The time you will save, the frustration you will avoid, and the confidence you will gain are immeasurable.\nThis is the end of the \"Forgot Password\" era for you. This is your chance to stop managing a problem and start mastering a skill. The cost of a single data breach—in time, money, and stress—far outweighs the investment in yourself and your peace of mind.\nYou have the power within you. It’s time to unlock it.\nEnroll right now and start building your unshakeable Digital Fort Knox. Your future self—the one who effortlessly logs in to any account, anytime—is waiting.\nDon't wait.

But it’s not just marketing spin. There are so many myths out there about how to learn that drive me crazy as an educator, that I wanted to create this course based on the very latest research about what actually works.\nEvery lecture contains at least one actionable step that will help you immediately.\nThe other problem with the information currently out there about learning is that much of it is theoretical and often fairly dense. That’s why this course focuses on practical steps that you can take to improve your performance.\nIt’s all taught by a professional educator with over ten years’ experience of teaching and refining these methods ‘in the field’, with tangible and proven results for thousands of students.\nI’ve used these methods myself to go from high school fool to winner of the top academic prize in my discipline from the University of Durham, to memorise more pointless information than I can now remember (ironically), and to somehow go from a middling IQ to becoming a member of Mensa (even my own family thinks that must have been a mistake).\nThese methods are tried and tested – by myself, my students, and by numerous studies. They work.\nNot another boring lecture, sir!\nAll are presented in the engaging and memorable style that you’d expect from a teacher.\nAt least I like to think so. Please start learning and judge for yourself. Enjoy!",

      "description": "“Learning is not compulsory… neither is survival.” — W. Edwards Deming\n\n\nLearning is the greatest power of the human mind. Everything we’ve built, everything we’ve created, everything we’ve become has been the result of our ability to learn. And this great power is inherent in all of us. We are made to learn.\n\n\nThe better we get at getting better, the faster we will get better.\nThe smartest people invest heavily in their education and skill development, recognizing that their human capital is their most marketable resource.\nSkills are the most valuable thing you can acquire in this lifetime because they keep compounding until the day you die.\nThe future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.\n\n\n\"Human history is a race between education and catastrophe.\"\nHG Wells\n\n\nAnyone not busy learning is busy dying.\n\n\nFor as long as you foster a willingness to learn, you will ward off sclerosis of the brain and hardening of the mental arteries.\n\n\nCuriosity has led many a man and woman into the valley of serious wealth.\n\n\n“If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive.”\n\n\nLearning, at its core, is a broadening of horizons, of seeing things that were previously invisible and of recognizing capabilities within yourself that you didn’t know existed.\n\n\nYou have to experiment and find the kinds of discipline and standards that work for you, personally. The root of the word discipline is discipulus, “learner”.\n\nOnline education is an investment, not an expense.\n\n\nFor the first time, those who can educate and motivate themselves will be almost entirely free to invent their own work and realize the full benefits of their own productivity.\n\nLearn to learn. Meta-learn. Learning itself is the most important skill.\n\nWe must be learning if we are to feel fully alive, and when life, or love, becomes too predictable and it seems like there is little left to learn, we become restless — a protest, perhaps, of the plastic brain when it can no longer perform its essential task.\nYou're not going to get very far in life on the basis of what you already know. You're going to advance in life by what you're going to learn.\n\nIt’s the blind leading the blind here. The only way is to teach yourself to see.\nThe only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.\nIf you're a never-ending learner, you'll always have ways to generate money. You can constantly keep up with what's happening in society, what things are worth, and where there is demand.  And you can learn to come up to speed fast.\nHow can challenging skills be mastered quickly? Pass examinations with ease? Study and  more read books (and remember what you've read)?\nLearning how to learn is the ultimate key to improving your confidence, your career prospects, and your personal life.\nEmbrace challenges, learn from failures, and foster a passion for lifelong learning.\nHow to Learn Effectively\nLearn faster. Retain knowledge better. Stop procrastination. Make instant progress in developing your skills.\nDecide today to become a life-long student and take control of your own self-education.\nCommit to investing at least one hour per day studying subjects that will help you move closer toward your ultimate vision.\nWho this course is for:\nIf you feel you’re capable of more and need to start functioning at your full capacity\nIf your learning is ineffective and you need to start to acquire knowledge better\nIf you want to become better at anything and need a firm framework to guide you\nThis course teaches everything I know about how to learn better. In the course, we'll cover the following:\n• How to develop a learning strategy that works and that you'll follow. You can increase your chances of success by making a few simple adjustments.\n• How to stay motivated when studying. Create routines that will allow you to do your work without stress or delay calmly and effectively.\n• A thorough exploration of effective learning.  Every trick and resource to maximize your limited time for studying.\n• How to comprehend things more effectively, supported by the science behind how they function.\n• Improve your Memory: Remember anything better.\n• How to go from a single project's accomplishment to a lifetime of learning. The road to becoming a polymath, if you so desire.\n\n\nWhat You will learn:\nMEMORIZE AND RETAIN MORE KNOWLEDGE\nGet more knowledge in your head with practical tips\n\n\nSTART ENJOYING YOUR STUDYING\nFind the education style that fits you perfectly.\n\n\nFIGHT YOUR PROCRASTINATION\nStrike a balance between perfectionism and procrastination\nStart this course on effective learning and get smarter!\nLearn how to grasp new information and build a growth mindset. Discover hacks to fight procrastination, stay focused, and use your mind effectively.\nThe course syllabus is based on concepts and ideas from the latest research, top university courses, specialized books, and expert articles.The path to success is the continuous pursuit of knowledge.\n\n\nLearning how to learn is the ultimate key to improving your confidence, your career prospects, and your personal life.\n\n\n“Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.” — Jim Rohn\nThe highest form of self-confidence is believing in your ability to learn.\nLearning new skills can be a great way to improve your life and career.\nLearning isn’t a way of reaching one’s potential but rather a way of developing it.\nWant to move up? Then, you have to be a perpetual learner.\n\n\nIt’s one thing to know how to learn new things, but it’s another thing entirely to be good at it. Learning how to learn will help you pick up new skills more quickly and effectively.\nLearning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere. — Chinese proverb\n\n\nLearning to learn is the ability to pursue and persist in learning, to organize one's own learning, including through effective management of time and information, both individually and in groups.\n\n\nI have found that learning is the most critical aspect of owning and running a business. Outworking the competition comes down to learning as much as possible, taking ideas from various sources, and taking note of crucial failures and successes.\n\n\nMost people won’t put in the time to get a knowledge advantage, leaving the door open for the willing.\nLearn how to learn, and how to unlearn. As we learn to be specific, we tend to lose much of our imaginative power. Think different. Look for more than one right answer.\n\n\nBenefits of Learning How to Learn:\n\n\nYou'll learn better\nYou'll remember more\nYou'll find ways to apply your knowledge\nYou'll find new ways to improve your career and your life with new knowledge\nYou'll be able to share your knowledge with others\nYou'll be a better person\nYou'll have more self-respect\nYou'll be respected by others\nYou'll influence others to be better\nYou'll be more confident\nYou'll discover hidden talents\nYou'll find a use for your skills when you least expect it\nYou'll have fun while learning skills\nYou'll become more interesting\nYou'll learn faster\nYou'll become more open-minded\nYou'll build a habit of failure (yes, that's a good thing)\nYou'll raise your energy\nYou'll boost your confidence\nYou'll have more ways to earn money\n\n\nThe first half of my life I went to school, the second half of my life I got an education.\n\n\nHow To Accelerate Your Learning Capabilities\nEffective learning techniques to stay miles ahead of your competition\n\n\nWhat you’ll learn:\n● How the Brain Works in Learning.\n● Effective Learning Strategies to Ultra Boost Learning Speeds.\n● Tips to Improve Memorization and Retainability.\n● Breaking The Curse of Procrastination.\n● How to Take Powerful Notes.\n● How to do Research.\n● Problem Solving Methods to Tackle Any Problem.\n● Lifetime Techniques for Mastering Any Skill.\n● BONUS: How to Take Advantage of Sleep to Process Information Faster.\n\n\nIn times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.\nYour best ROI is not a return on your investment, but a return on your information.\nLearning how to learn is life’s most important skill.\nWhy does learning matter? These little information edges turn out to be the difference between half-measure wannabes and a literal winner.\nOne skill you want to master in this day and age we live in, if you want to have an extraordinary life, is the ability to learn rapidly.\nLearning how to learn is the most powerful tool you can ever grasp and your life will be enriched beyond measure.\nThe global economy has shifted from a material-based to a knowledge-based model. Whereas material assets such as gold mines, wheat farms, and oil wells were historically the primary sources of riches, knowledge is now the primary source of prosperity.\nThe best thing a person can do is help another person learn more.\nBanking on living a “traditional” life: going to college, getting a job for a big firm, working hard, and climbing the corporate ladder, might not make sense. Instead, young people today should learn as much as possible and develop a flexible set of skills, so they can re-adapt themselves to whatever the future holds.\nThe path to success is the continuous pursuit of knowledge. We call this pursuit learning.\nLearning how to learn is the most important skill we can develop in the twenty first century.\nAlmost anything in life can be learned faster.\nMost people learn passively. They wait for insights to come to them.\nBut you can speed things up by actively searching for useful ideas.\nOne strategy is to ask top people you meet what they do. Make their best practices your baseline.\nAnother is to use this course to accelerate the process.\nThe ability to take responsibility for your growth — self-directed learning is a superpower in the age of knowledge abundance.\nLet’s get to it!\nInevitably, some people will be on the losing end of change even as the robots make society as a whole better off. One lesson from the freewheeling globalization of the 1990s and 2000s is that the growth in trade that was overwhelmingly beneficial triggered a political backlash, because the losers felt left behind. That is one more reason why firms and governments would do well to recognize the value of retraining and lifelong learning. As jobs change, workers should be helped to acquire new skills.\nAn expert is someone who, over many years, manages to remain confident enough to keep trying and humble enough to keep learning.\nLearning is the only thing the mind never exhausts, never fears, and never regrets — Leonardo Da Vinci\nThe path to success is the continuous pursuit of knowledge.\nSuccess is the product of accumulative advantage.\nThis course will cover accelerated learning and the retention of knowledge.\nThe famous futurist Alvin Toffler once said, “The illiterate of the future are not those who can't read or write but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”\nWhat got you here won't get you where you want to go.\n\n“Knowledge is exploding, so you need to commit yourself to a plan for lifelong learning.” — Don Tapscott\n\n\n“The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. — Naval\n\n\nLifelong learners are not afraid to unlearn to relearn. Beware of false knowledge. What you know could be holding you back. Learning to learn is a valuable skill in the modern world.\n\n\nTheir long term goal is personal satisfaction. The bigger goal of learning can help you lead a meaningful and fulfilling life.\n\n\nOver the long term, lifelong learners learn more from unstructured learning than from formal education. School gets you started; self-learning keeps you going.\nWhat you will learn:\nHow the brain works in learning\nFocused and Diffused Thinking\nHow the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (“chunks”) information.\nThe Feynman Technique\nDealing with procrastination\ntest-taking tips\nSeinfeld's Productivity Secret\nPomodoro Technique\nCreativity\nMemorization techniques\nCreate a Personal Knowledge Management System\nMind Mapping\nHow to take notes\nHow to Read for Knowledge acquisition\nHow to create a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system (what is sometimes called a second brain)\nHow to do Research\nHow to take advantage of sleep and your unconscious mind, priming yourself to assimilate information and solve problems more efficiently.\n\n\nThis course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. We’ll learn about how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (“chunks”) information. We’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects.\nUsing these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life. If you’re already an expert, this peep under the mental hood will give you ideas for turbocharging successful learning, including counter-intuitive test-taking tips and insights that will help you make the best use of your time on homework and problem sets. If you’re struggling, you’ll see a structured treasure trove of practical techniques that walk you through what you need to do to get on track. If you’ve ever wanted to become better at anything, this course will help serve as your guide.\n\n\nBreak Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential\nThis course reveals how we can overcome stereotypes and preconceived ideas about what is possible for us to learn and become.\nThe famous futurist Alvin Toffler once said, “The illiterate of the future are not those who can't read or write but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”\nAt a time when we are constantly being asked to retrain and reinvent ourselves to adapt to new technologies and changing industries, this course shows us how we can uncover and develop talents we didn’t realize we had—no matter what our age or background. Drawing on the latest neuroscientific insights, this course shepherds us past simplistic ideas of “aptitude” and “ability,” which provide only a snapshot of who we are now—with little consideration about how we can change.\nEven seemingly “bad” traits, such as a poor memory, come with hidden advantages—like increased creativity. We can turn perceived weaknesses, such as impostor syndrome and advancing age, into strengths. People may feel like they’re at a disadvantage if they pursue a new field later in life; yet those who change careers can be fertile cross-pollinators: They bring valuable insights from one discipline to another. John Cousins teaches us strategies for learning that are backed by neuroscience so that we can realize the joy and benefits of a learning lifestyle. Become a Learning Ninja takes us deep inside the world of how people change and grow. Our biggest stumbling blocks can be our own preconceptions, but with the right mental insights, we can tap into hidden potential and create new opportunities.\n\n\nHow to learn effectively\nLearn faster. Retain knowledge better. Stop procrastination. Make instant progress on developing your skills.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nIf you feel you’re capable of more and need to start functioning in your full capacity\n\n\nIf your learning is ineffective and you need to start to acquire knowledge better\n\n\nIf you want to become better at anything and need a firm framework to guide you\n\n\nWhat You will learn:\n\nMEMORIZE AND RETAIN\nMORE KNOWLEDGE\nGet more knowledge in your head with effective tips\n\n\nSTART ENJOYING YOUR STUDYING\nFind your own education style that fits you perfectly\n\n\nFIGHT YOUR\nPROCRASTINATION\nStrike a balance between perfectionism and procrastination\n\n\nStart a course on effective learning, and get smarter!\n\n\nLearn how to grasp new information and build a growth mindset. Discover hacks to fight procrastination, stay focused, and use your mind effectively.\n\n\nCourse syllabus is based on concepts and ideas from the latest niche researches, top university courses, specialized books and expert articles.\n\n\n“I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines,” said Charlie Munger.\nLearning doesn’t stop when you’ve finished formal education — that’s when it starts.\nNo matter your preferred method, just keep learning.\nCharlie Munger is especially fond of reading books. “In my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn’t read all the time — none, zero,” he said.\nAll in all, successful people are continuous learners. That’s how they stay at the top of their field.\nTo conclude with Munger’s words of wisdom, “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up.”\nThis course provides tips and techniques to learn faster and recall more of what you learn.\nI encourage you to take this course. But if you decide not to, please take another class, or read a book.\n\n\nTo know what you don’t know is power. To ask and learn what you don’t know is a superpower.\n\n\nInvesting in learning makes you better at earning.",

Sometimes, the challenge is knowing too much! Many knowledge workers and students struggle to keep up with the information that they have learned or the ideas they generate. Mind mapping is an excellent tool from bringing order to the chaos, and using all the ideas you possess to their full potential.\nContent Overview\nAt the end of this course you will be able to create mind maps that help you solve complex problems and learn important concepts.\nI made this course for anyone who thinks or learns as part of their most important work. Mind mapping is a tool that helps people work with lots of ideas that might otherwise be too overwhelming, or easily lost. Building mind maps can also help you brainstorm much more quickly, and then turn your raw ideas into organized plans in minutes.\nWe'll learn about how this creativity brainstorming works, and how to use mind maps to channel it. I'll show you how to structure a map to make the most of the ideas that you already have --and how to generate new ones.\nAfter we have explored the basics of building mind maps, I'll show you how you can take that knowledge and apply it to solving challenging problems. Whether you are working on an issue in your personal life, or something in your work, building mind maps can provide you a means of finding a solution.\nTo do all of this, I'll be showing you some basic and advanced features of Freemind, a great and open-source tool for mind mapping anyone can download. The skills you learn in this section will be transferrable to most other mind mapping tools.\nFinally, we will shift from creation to consumption by looking at the ways mind mapping can help us learn better. I'll show you tools for speeding up your reading, and boosting the retention of what you learn by using the skills you have already mastered in mind maps.",

      "description": "Unlock the Science of Learning: Help Students Overcome Barriers and Thrive\nTo learn effectively, we must be in our executive state—calm, focused, and ready to absorb new information. But when anxiety, lack of study skills, or neurodiverse needs interfere, students fall into survival or emotional states, where stress takes over and learning becomes difficult. This course helps educators, parents, and professionals understand these brain states and provides science-backed strategies to bring students back into their optimal learning state for long-term success and growth.\nThrough the LRAI Framework for Neuro Learning, you’ll explore how to foster critical thinking, emotional regulation, and effective study habits. You’ll also learn how to identify and remove common learning barriers, cultivate a growth mindset, and support neurodiverse students. Whether you're a teacher looking for practical tools, a parent wanting to help your child succeed, or a professional working with learners, this course will provide actionable strategies that you can apply immediately.\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have a comprehensive toolkit to help students regain focus, stay motivated, and develop the skills they need to thrive in any learning environment. Enrol now and start making a lasting impact on student success today—because every learner deserves the chance to thrive!",

A strand is called a pull.  A pull consists of eight individual pieces of horsehair.  Since horsehair. thinner at one end, thicker at the other you have to flip them so that when you twist the strand (pull) it will be even.  You will then take these pulls and tie them onto two strings around a wooden dowel, that are attached to a hitching jig.  A hitching jig is the main tool to hitching.   I will show you how to make the jig.  You will then proceed to use open and closed knots.  Turning the wooden dowel as you hitch each pull.  after hitching a inch or two.  You will start to hitch in your design.  At first this will consist of making a diamond pattern.  I will teach more complex designs at the course advances.  You will learn how to make belts, hat bands, inlay for leather.  Part of hitching horsehair involves using leather. Like belt ends for belts, inlay of wallets purses.  You can also make horse bridles, halters.  If you want you can also make the reins for the bridles.",

We see people who can recall facts, figures, and faces with effortless ease and we call them “geniuses” or “naturals.” We resign ourselves to our own perceived limitations, believing our memory is a fixed trait, like our height or eye color.\nThis single, damaging myth is the cage that has locked away your true cognitive potential.\nThe truth is, an extraordinary memory is not a gift. It is a skill. And like any skill, it can be learned, practiced, and mastered. It’s not about having a different kind of brain; it’s about having the right operating system for your brain—an operating system that schools never taught you, but that has been the secret weapon of the world’s top thinkers for over 2,500 years.\nImagine, for a moment, what your life would look like if you had this operating system installed.\nImagine walking into any room—a party, a networking event, a new class—and meeting ten new people, and then, an hour later, being able to address every single one of them by name, creating an instant and powerful sense of rapport and respect.\nImagine sitting down with a dense textbook or a technical manual for an hour, and then being able to close the book and mentally walk through every key concept, formula, and definition in perfect order, ready to ace any exam or certification.\nImagine crafting a presentation and, on the day you deliver it, leaving your notes behind. You step onto the stage, connect with your audience with genuine eye contact, and let the ideas flow from you with perfect clarity, confidence, and passion because you’re not trying to remember—you simply know.\nThis is not a fantasy. This is what it feels like to have a trained memory. It’s a life of less stress, less anxiety, and more confidence. It’s a life where learning is no longer a chore, but an exciting adventure. It’s a life where your mind becomes your single greatest asset—a well-organized, powerful, and reliable tool for achieving any goal you set for yourself.\nThis transformation is the promise of the Memory Palace, Memory Training Masterclass.\nThis is not just another collection of memory “tips” or “tricks.” This is a comprehensive, step-by-step blueprint designed to take you from an absolute beginner—even someone who currently struggles to remember their grocery list—and systematically build you into a true master of your own memory.\nWe will do this by teaching you the most powerful mnemonic system ever devised: the Method of Loci, or the Memory Palace. This isn't just a technique; it's a way to leverage your brain's own innate, powerful spatial memory system—the same system that allows you to navigate your home in the dark—to store and recall any information with astonishing clarity.\nThis memory palace masterclass is a journey. It’s an adventure into the vast, untapped potential of your own mind. And it’s structured to ensure your success every step of the way.\n\n\nYour Transformation: A Journey Through the Memory Training Masterclass\nThis memory palace course is meticulously structured into six transformational stages. You will begin as an apprentice, discovering the hidden power you already possess, and you will finish as a virtuoso, wielding your memory with effortless skill and precision.\n\n\nMEMORY PALACE MASTERCLASS SECTION 1: THE SPARK: UNLOCKING YOUR BRAIN'S HIDDEN MEMORY BLUEPRINT\nBefore you can build, you must discover the blueprint. This first section is the spark that will ignite your potential. We will dismantle the myths that have held you back and reveal the fundamental, brain-based principles that make this system work so flawlessly. You will move from feeling uncertain about your memory to feeling a profound sense of excitement and possibility.\nLecture: Why Your Brain Is Already A \"Memory Palace\" And You Didn't Know It: Your first major “aha!” moment. In this lecture, you will discover that you are already an expert user of your brain’s spatial memory system. We will analyze everyday actions, like your morning commute, to prove that you possess the raw, natural talent for this skill. This isn't about learning something new from scratch; it's about learning to consciously direct a superpower you use unconsciously every single day. You'll finish this lecture with the foundational belief: \"I can do this.\"\nLecture: The \"Method of Loci\": Deconstructing The 2,500-Year-Old Secret: We travel back in time to ancient Greece to uncover the dramatic origin story of the Memory Palace. You will deconstruct the timeless method into its two simple, core components: the locus (a location) and the image. Understanding this elegant, 2,500-year-old framework demystifies the entire process, showing you that at its heart, this powerful technique is incredibly simple and accessible.\nLecture: Neuroplasticity Unlocked: How This System Literally Rewires Your Brain: This is where we bridge ancient art with modern science. You will learn how using the Memory Palace isn't just a mental trick; it is a profound act of self-directed neuroplasticity. We'll explore how this training physically strengthens neural pathways, grows your hippocampus, and literally rewires your brain for better learning. You will understand that you are not just memorizing; you are actively upgrading your own cognitive hardware.\nLecture: The #1 Myth About Memory That's Holding You Back: We will identify and systematically dismantle the single most damaging belief that prevents people from improving: the idea that memory is a \"thing\" you have, rather than a \"process\" you perform. This lecture will be a liberation, freeing you from the prison of low expectations and showing you that forgetting is almost always a failure of process, not a failure of your brain.\nLecture: From Rote Learning To \"Sticky\" Knowledge: The Core Mental Shift: You will experience the profound difference between the brittle, fragile memories created by rote repetition and the robust, \"sticky\" knowledge created by meaningful association. We'll explore the cognitive science of \"deep processing\" and why creative, active learning is exponentially more effective than passive review. This lecture marks your permanent departure from inefficient and boring study habits.\nLecture: The Three Pillars Of A Perfect Memory Image: Action, Association, And Absurdity: Here, you learn the alchemical formula for creating unforgettable mental images. We will dive deep into the three essential pillars that turn a fleeting thought into a permanent memory trace. You'll learn why a static image is a dead image, how to forge an unbreakable link between a symbol and its meaning, and why a dose of the absurd and ridiculous is the secret ingredient to a perfect memory.\n\n\nMEMORY PALACE MASTERCLASS SECTION 2: THE ARCHITECT: BUILDING YOUR FIRST INDESTRUCTIBLE MIND PALACE\nWith the foundation laid, you now become the architect.

You will be able to learn that how we can recall images quickly, what kind of quality of images is required for retention of content. Here we will learn about the secret of memory improvement with the help of various examples. You will able to learn various memory techniques to make your learning effective and long lasting.\nMemory is not just about remembering facts; it’s about training your brain to store, retain, and recall information effectively. Over the years, psychologists and memory experts have developed multiple techniques that can boost recall power and sharpen focus.\nOne popular method is the Mnemonic Technique, where you create patterns, rhymes, or acronyms to make complex information easier to remember. Another powerful tool is the Method of Loci (Memory Palace), where you visualize information placed in different locations of an imaginary building or route .\nThe Chunking Technique involves breaking large information into smaller, meaningful units – like remembering a phone number in parts rather than as one long string. Similarly, Visualization and Association use strong mental images to link abstract data with something memorable.\nRepetition and Spaced Learning are crucial – instead of cramming, reviewing information at intervals helps in long-term retention. Mind Mapping also works by organizing ideas in a structured, visual way, making connections easier to recall.\nEach of these techniques can be adapted to suit students, professionals, and lifelong learners. With practice, these methods can transform forgetfulness into powerful, lasting memory.",

Scientifically we all people are born with special abilities. If someone tells you that you are born as a fool. It is the biggest lie ever. Because, we may fail in math but may draw an art which could be sold for 1 Million $. \"Anyone can learn anything\" is not a myth. It depends on how much we are involved in that. A great example for this was taught by my favorite lecturer, He said \"if we put a common man into the room with only a piano he will return after 5 months as an expert pianist. He doesn’t have any other choices to spent his time. so that he could try further and further and become an expert\". Basically, our brain has billions of cells at each portion of the brain part is capable of handling some specific knowledge. So if the person is playing piano again and again his brain cells will work repetitively. So that those neurons will be very active and efficient. Don’t wait. Just start doing what you want to do.\n\n\nHere, I have techniques to memorize, study smartly, study for longer periods, effective study, increase our concentration power and finally tips for exams. After this lecture is completed you know the tricks and tips to become a great student. You will have interest in studies if you follow the methods. Studying is the most interesting and easy thing in the world. In this lecture series there are several kinds of activities related to the subjects. You can involve in them and gain more practical knowledge rather than only a theory class. There are also interesting study materials to work on these techniques for you to download. The apps links are provided for you to download and practice.

But still, we are treated like we are all the same and this is often the reason while some of us succeed and others unnecessarily fail. Just like we have different geographic languages, we have different memory languages. Obviously, we will learn best in our own mother tongue and will face difficulties when communicated to in Swahili. Likewise, we will be faster and more successful in remembering and learning when using our favorite memory languages… and will struggle when trying in untrained languages. This way you can easily double or triple your memory and learning speed and efficiency.\nOr would you like to help others succeed?\n\n\nYour learning adventure starts immediately after you enroll in this course.\nI look forward to seeing you inside",

      "description": "Bu kursun, öğrenme konusunda oldukça fazla teknik denemiş ve artık gerçekten sıkılmışlar için son kapı olacağına inanıyorum. Burada ilk olarak hipnozun ne olduğuna ve kısa tarihine değineceğiz. Hipnoz psikolojiye göre, telkine yatkınlık gösteren bir tür yapay uyku veya uyku-uyanıklık arası haldir. Hipnoz dediğimiz olgu aslında trans ile vardır. Kurs içeriğinde bunu daha net anlayacağız ama kısaca buna da değinmek daha iyi olacak sanıyorum. Uyku uyanıklık arasındaki bu hale trans hali diyoruz. Bu trans halinde bilinçdışı, telkine daha yatkındır. Böylece bizler öğrenmek istediğimiz şey her ne ise bunu öğrenirken bir bakıma daha net öğreniyoruz. Yani girdiler daha anlamlı hâle geliyor. Kaldı ki karşımızdaki içerik anlaşılması rahat bir yapıdaysa geriye kalan tek şey odak sağlamak olduğundan aynı içeriği baştan defalarca izlemeye ya da tekrar tekrar okumaya da ihtiyaç duymayacağız. Daha sonrasında belli pratiklerle beraber odağımızı yönetmeyi öğreneceğiz. Bildiğiniz üzere mesele odak ya da diğer adıyla konsantrasyon sağlamak değil. İyi bir konsantrasyon sağladıktan sonra da bunu sürdürebilmek. Burada da devreye kelimelerin sihri giriyor elbette. Keskin bir odak durumunu oluşturan ve bu odağı sürdürmemize yardımcı olan hem etkili trans durumunun hem de özenle seçilen kelimelerin gücüdür. Kısa sürede sizin de emeğiniz ile odağınızı çok güzel seviyelere çıkarabilirsiniz. Unutmayın ki birçok başarının ardında muazzam bir odak gücü yatmaktadır. Umuyorum bu kurs öğrenmeye dair satın aldığınız son kurs olur.",

      "description": "I’ll be honest with you…\nFor years, I took notes like my life depended on it. Class notes. Book notes. Random ideas at 2 AM. But here’s the embarrassing truth: It didn't work out for me\n\n\nIt felt like I was building a dusty storage room of half-forgotten thoughts not a system that actually helped me learn. I’d come across a brilliant idea I’d written down months ago and think, “Wow, I completely forgot about this… imagine if I’d actually used it.”\nThen I found Obsidian. At first, I thought, “Great… another app I’ll download and ignore after a week.” But the more I explored, the more I realized… this wasn’t just a note-taking app. It was the missing piece to actually thinking with my notes.\nOnce I learned how to set it up right, it turned into my personal Second Brain — a place where every book I read, every video I watch, every thought I capture doesn’t just disappear… it connects, grows, and actually comes back to help me when I need it most.\n\nThat’s exactly what I want to share with you in this course. Not just how to “use” Obsidian… but how to turn it into your smartest learning partner.\n\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to learn something new — a language, a subject for school, a skill for your career — you know the drill:\n\nYou study for hours… and a week later, you can barely recall half of it.\nYou jot down page after page of notes… but when you need that one key idea, it’s buried somewhere in a messy pile of text files, sticky notes, and screenshots.\nYou save interesting articles, highlights, and quotes… but instead of becoming useful knowledge, they just sit there collecting digital dust.\nAnd worst of all — the more you try to keep track of everything, the more overwhelmed you feel. It’s like trying to drink from a firehose of information.\nIf you’re nodding right now, you’re not alone.\nBut here’s the thing: it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\n\nNow imagine this instead:\n\nYou learn something new today… and months from now, you can still find it instantly and actually remember it.\nYou open your notes and instead of a messy pile, you see a clear, connected system — almost like your own personal Google for everything you’ve ever learned.\nYou don’t just store information, you use it. You turn those notes into essays, videos, presentations, projects, or whatever you’re creating… without wasting hours digging for ideas.\nThat’s exactly what this course will help you do.\n\nI’m going to show you my Complete Obsidian Note-Taking System, a step-by-step method for building your very own Second Brain.\nThink of it like an extension of your mind — a trusted, organized place where every idea, insight, and piece of knowledge you collect is ready to be used when you need it.\nAnd the best part? You don’t need to be “techy” or a productivity guru to make it work. By the end of this course, you’ll:\n\nLearn faster because your notes actually help you process and understand ideas.\nRemember more because you’ll store and review information in a way that sticks.\nCreate with ease because your best ideas will never get lost again.\n\n\nMost note-taking apps are just digital drawers — you throw things in and hope you can find them later.\nObsidian is different. It’s more like having a living, breathing map of your mind.\nHere’s how Obsidian Convinced me:\n\nLink notes like a web of ideas — connect concepts instantly, and when you revisit them months later, you’ll see exactly how they relate. No more “I know I wrote this down somewhere…” moments.\nSee the bigger picture with Graph View — watch your ideas form clusters and patterns, helping you spot connections you would’ve missed in a linear notebook.\nSearch that actually works — type a keyword and find every note, quote, or thought you’ve ever written about it — instantly.\nYour notes, your way — customize layouts, templates, and workflows so your note-taking adapts to how you think, not the other way around.\nWith Obsidian, your notes don’t just sit there — they talk to each other.\nOver time, you’ll build a Second Brain: a trusted place outside your head where every idea you capture stays connected, easy to find, and ready to use whenever you need it.\n\n\nThis course is not about stuffing your vault with more and more notes you’ll never use.\nIt’s about finally making your notes work for you.\nBy the time you finish, you’ll have a complete, ready-to-use Obsidian setup that:\n\nCaptures ideas, notes, and references instantly (so nothing brilliant slips away)\nConnects them in a way that makes patterns and insights jump out at you\nRetrieves exactly what you need, exactly when you need it — no more digging through messy folders\nSupports your learning so you can remember more, understand deeper, and create faster\nI’ll walk you through everything, step-by-step — from your very first vault setup to building an advanced Second Brain system tailored to your way of thinking.\nAnd don’t worry… you don’t need to be “techy” to get it. If you can take a note, you can do this.\nWhen you’re done, you won’t just “have notes” — you’ll have a personal knowledge engine that actually helps you learn faster, remember longer, and create more of the work you’re proud of.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn Inside This Course\nThis isn’t just another “how to use Obsidian” tutorial.\nThis is a complete learning and knowledge system you’ll be able to use for the rest of your life.\nBy the end, you’ll have the tools to learn faster, remember more, and create from your notes with zero stress.\n\nHere’s how we’ll get you there:\n1. Your Obsidian Learning Hub\nSet up a clean, distraction-free workspace that feels good to open every day.\nA simple but powerful folder + tag setup so you never waste time wondering “Where should this go?”\nUse pinned notes, quick capture, and daily notes so ideas never get lost.\n2. Capture Without Clutter\nHow to save ideas, quotes, and references the moment they appear — from books, articles, or conversations.\nTemplates that make every new note instantly useful.\nAvoid “note graveyard” syndrome — keep your vault alive and valuable.\n3. Connect Your Notes for Smarter Thinking\nInternal linking that transforms scattered thoughts into a connected web of ideas.\nHow to see relationships between topics with Obsidian’s Graph View — and use those connections to spark insights.\nCreate topic hubs that pull related notes together automatically.\n4. Learn Faster & Remember Longer\nProgressive Summarization: distill big, messy notes into clear, usable ideas.\nActive Recall prompts built right into your vault so review becomes effortless.\nSpaced Repetition workflows without leaving Obsidian. And More\n5. Turn Notes Into Output\nHow to go from a handful of connected notes to a draft article, a presentation, or a study guide in minutes.\nPull ideas together for creative projects without endless searching.\nUse your Second Brain as your ultimate writing and content engine.\n6. Keep It Growing (Without Overwhelm)\nWeekly and monthly review habits that keep your knowledge fresh.\nHow to quickly refactor, merge, and restructure notes as your thinking evolves.\nA sustainable system that works for years — not just weeks.\n\n\nThe Transformation\nBefore you have a system, learning feels like a constant uphill climb:\n\n\nYou take lots of notes… but forget most of what you read.\nYour ideas get lost in a mess of random files, Google Docs, and half-filled notebooks.\nWhen it’s time to write, present, or study, you’re scrambling to remember where you put that brilliant thought from last month.\nYou keep “saving things for later,” but later never comes.\nIt’s frustrating.\nIt’s exhausting.\nAnd it slowly kills your motivation to keep learning.\n\n\nAfter building the Note-Taking System in Obsidian, everything changes:\n\nEvery idea, quote, or resource you capture has a clear home — and you can find it in seconds.\nYour notes aren’t isolated fragments; they’re part of a connected web of knowledge that grows smarter with time.\nYou don’t have to remember everything — Obsidian surfaces the right notes when you need them.\nStudying and creating become easier because your vault already contains the raw material for your work.\nInstead of starting from scratch, you’re building on your past thinking — which compounds your learning and creativity over years.\nThis isn’t just about taking better notes.\nIt’s about transforming your entire learning process into something that is organized, stress-free, and deeply rewarding.\nYou’ll go from feeling scattered and overwhelmed…\n…to feeling confident that every bit of effort you put into learning is an investment that will pay you back again and again.\n\nHey, I get it.\nBuying a course is a decision. You’re probably thinking:\nWhat if I don’t use it?\nWhat if it’s too complicated?\nWhat if it’s just another thing I buy and forget about?\nThat’s why I’ve made this completely risk-free for you.\nWhen you join Complete Obsidian Note-Taking System, you get a 30-day “Love It or Leave It” guarantee.\nThat means you can go through the lessons, set up your system, try it out with your own notes, and if you don’t feel more organized, more confident, and more in control of your learning — I’ll give you a full refund.\nNo forms to fill.\nNo awkward “prove you did the work” nonsense.\nBecause honestly — I only want you to keep this course if it actually changes how you learn.\nAnd if you’re still worried you won’t “have time” — here’s the thing: the system is designed to start working for you in just 15–20 minutes a day. Even if you’re busy, you can build this step-by-step without overwhelming yourself.\nSo there’s really no risk here — just the chance to finally get your learning organized, your ideas connected, and your Second Brain up and running.\n\nOkay, friend — here’s the truth:\nYou could keep doing what you’ve been doing.\nSaving articles. Highlighting books. Taking scattered notes.\nAnd still feeling like your brain is one giant messy desk where you can never find anything when you need it.\nOr…\nYou could decide that today is the day you finally fix it.\nComplete Obsidian Note-Taking System is your shortcut.\nIt’s not just another “how to use Obsidian” tutorial — it’s a full, practical system for turning your notes into a tool that actually works for you.\nWhen you click that Enroll Now button, here’s what happens:\n\nYou get instant access to all the lessons, downloads, and templates.\nYou start setting up your own Second Brain step-by-step, without overwhelm.\nWithin days, you’ll already see your learning and creativity click into place.\nAnd remember — you’re backed by the 30-day guarantee.

Si mémoriser une information est souvent vu comme une épreuve insurmontable c'est parce qu'on ne nous a jamais appris à le faire de la bonne manière. Les techniques de mémorisation sont en réalité très simples à acquérir, il suffit juste de les connaitre !\n\n\nCe cours a pour but de vous enseigner les techniques de base de la mémorisation. Enseigner, au sens profond du terme, vous n'allez pas simplement découvrir des techniques et vous convaincre après quelques vidéos que vous les comprenez. Vous allez pratiquer un exercice de mémorisation par jour pendant 28 jours. En moins de 5 minutes, chaque exercice vous guidera vers la compréhension et l'acquisition des techniques pour utiliser pleinement votre mémoire.\nCe cours ouvre un chemin aux motivés, qui leur permettra de comprendre pas à pas ce qu'est la mémorisation, d'expérimenter avec leurs propres neurones toutes ses facettes pour finalement découvrir un nouveau monde où mémoriser une information, peu importe sa forme, n'est qu'un tour de passe-passe, simple à réaliser et efficace.\n\n\nEn 28 jours, 4 semaines, vous parcourrez différentes techniques et les explorerez sous tous les angles possibles. En commençant par la storyfication, vous apprendrez à encoder des informations simples puis des informations numériques pour finalement arriver au terme de votre voyage à encoder tout type d'informations : formule mathématiques, recettes de cuisine, listes ordonnées ou non, informations contradictoires, informations en double, noms, prénoms, dates, chronologies, numéro de téléphone, de CB, mots de passes, pays, capitales, biographie... Vous apprendrez que tout ce qui est imaginable est mémorisable et surtout vous apprendrez comment le faire !\n\n\nPourquoi mémoriser quoi que ce soit alors que je peux trouver toutes les réponses en 5 minutes sur un téléphone ?\nSi vous pensez cela, alors je vous encourage davantage à parcourir le chemin proposé dans ce cours. Mémoriser certaines informations vous permet de faciliter votre quotidien, de connaître les bases de nombreux sujets, d'accéder à des endroits qui sont inaccessibles sans certaines connaissances, de trier les informations qui vous parviennent tous les jours. Et par dessus tout, mémoriser ne permet pas seulement d'accéder à une information, brique par brique cela permet de construire une compréhension bien plus profonde des concepts qui nous entourent. Plus vous mémorisez d'informations, plus vous tissez des liens entre des informations à première vue dissociées. Ces ponts vous permettent d'envisager bien plus d'options car vous pouvez réappliquer une leçon acquise à d'autres domaines.",

By examining the fundamental principles that underpin logical reasoning, participants will develop the analytical capabilities necessary to evaluate information with precision and clarity in today's complex information landscape.\nThroughout the curriculum, students will engage with diverse thinking frameworks that enhance their ability to identify assumptions, recognize logical fallacies, and construct well-reasoned arguments. The course places particular emphasis on developing systematic approaches to problem-solving that can be applied across various domains of knowledge and professional practice.\nParticipants will learn to deal with information environments with discernment, distinguishing between credible evidence and misleading claims. This skill is increasingly valuable in an era of information abundance and competing narratives. Through real-world case analyses, students will strengthen their capacity to synthesize complex data into coherent understandings that support sound decision-making.\nThe course guides students to comprehend critical thinking concepts and deploy them effectively in diverse situations. Individual reflection will help participants recognize their cognitive biases and develop strategies to mitigate their influence on reasoning processes.\nBy the conclusion of this learning experience, students will possess a sophisticated toolkit of cognitive skills applicable to both academic pursuits and professional challenges. These competencies include structured analysis of complex problems, evidence-based reasoning, and transparent decision-making processes. Such abilities represent essential capacities for thoughtful citizenship and professional excellence in contexts that demand nuanced understanding and reasoned judgment.\n\n\nIt's important for you to know that this course will continuously expand through regular additions of video content and learning modules. The current materials constitute merely the foundation of a much more extensive curriculum currently under development. This is only the beginning!",

Este curso de 4 semanas, diseñado por el psicólogo cognitivo Luis M Naranjo, te llevará a duplicar o triplicar esa velocidad, o incluso más. La capacidad final depende de cada persona. El objetivo de este curso es, cuando menos, superar la barrera de las 500 palabras por minuto.\nLo ideal es llevar el curso en 4 semanas (tomar una clase cada semana), pero deberás practicar diariamente los ejercicios sugeridos a fin de que veas resultados reales. La primera parte está destinada a elevar la velocidad de lectura y la segunda está dirigida a mejorar la capacidad de comprensión, de retención y aprovechamiento de la lectura.\nEs necesario escoger un libro para practicar, sugiero una novela corta o ficción ligera, algo que no sea muy importante. Esto porque en el proceso de aprendizaje de la lectura veloz, es probable que pierdas mucha información. Una vez que domines la técnica, podrás leer cualquier tipo de texto a una gran velocidad sin perder ningún contenido relevante\nNO se abordan temas de la lectura cuántica, fotolectura u otras técnicas que circulan en muchos lados, pero que no tienen ningún sustento teórico ni práctico. Este curso trata de técnicas reales, utilizadas incluso en el consultorio como estrategias para la mejora de pacientes que tienen alteraciones en las funciones de lecto escritura.",

      "description": "If you’re stuck around 1400 Elo and feel like you’ve hit a wall, this course is for you. I know exactly how it feels—I was there myself. The ideas and methods I teach here are not theory fluff or “one-size-fits-all” advice from some random YouTuber. I applied every single concept in this course to my own play and went from 1400 to 1800 Elo in just 45 days, while the average player only gains about 150 Elo in three months. That’s not hype—that’s what actually works in practice.\nI’m not going to pretend I speak like a professional coach or have some fancy credentials. I don’t. I speak like a regular player who figured out what works and what doesn’t. That’s actually the strength of this course: I cut through all the useless clutter and focus only on what will make a real difference in your games. You’ll learn practical tactics, opening ideas, and endgame strategies that most YouTubers won’t even mention because they either take too long to explain or they just aren’t as effective in real games.\nI’ll admit a weakness: I don’t sugarcoat things or try to make this sound more complicated than it is. I don’t write endless articles or pretend that you’ll become a grandmaster overnight. But here’s my biggest plus: I know what actually works. Every lesson here has been tested in real games, under time pressure, against real opponents. That means when you follow these methods, you’re learning something proven, not just popular.\nThis course is designed for ambitious intermediate players who are ready to break past the 1400 barrier and reach 1800 Elo. It’s for those who want a system that’s actionable, realistic, and fast, without wasting months on trial and error. By the end of it, you’ll not only see improvement in your rating, but you’ll also start thinking differently about the game, spotting tactics faster, making smarter decisions in the opening, and finishing endgames with confidence.\nI don’t promise magic. I promise what worked for me—and it can work for you too. If you’re ready to stop guessing and start winning, this course will get you there.",

The course is a mixture of videos alongside with an in depth training manual and exercises.\nNeuroplasticity is a fascinating subject as the human brain is incredibly complex.\nThink of the brain as a giant computer, one that is so powerful that it can process vast amounts of information before you can even blink. At one time, it was considered impossible to change the brain, to improve it, or, to have a chance of recovery following trauma to the brain but, this has now been proven untrue. This knowledge opens up the potential to continue learning, to change old negative behaviours and to respond more positively to the stressors of life.\nNeuroplasticity is the process of changing the neural synapses and pathways. Influences through neural adaptations, environmental or behavioural changes occur all the time without your knowing but, it does show us that the capacity of the brain to be altered is significant. With billions of nerve cells (neurons) it’s possible to adapt different learning processes either through creating new neural pathways or rearranging existing ones. This is done via communication between the nerves. The brain is exposed to new information and it can retain it.\nNeuroplasticity is action through experiences, through adaptation and through learning. How we think and feel reinforces neural pathways and will contribute to how we live our lives. Even though changes may be small, they can be significant. When thoughts, feelings or behaviours are adapted and repeated frequently, these start to form new habits and processes. There is a $15 admin fee (or your currency equivalent) if you wish to go ahead and have Karen’s certificate, which is different to the standard Udemy certificate - Details will be given in the course.\nOur easy to learn modules include:\nIntroduction to your Fully Accredited Professional Neuroplasticity Diploma Course\nYour Fully Accredited Professional Neuroplasticity Diploma Training Manual PDF\nThe Human Brain\nNeurons\nBrain Factors\nEmotions & The Brain\nThe Brain & CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy)\nNeuroplasticity Exercises\nFinal Reflections\nAccreditation\nFAQ\nThis Professional Diploma Course on Neuroplasticity is fully accredited by CTAA - Complementary Therapists Accredited Association.",

      "description": "40.000+ Öğrenci, En Çok Satan Listesinde\n*Udemy Üzerinde En Çok Satan Türkçe Hızlı Okuma, Hızlı Öğrenme Kursu*\n\n\nÖğrencilerimizden Gelenler:\n\"Hocam merhabalar. Çok güzel bir çalışma olmuş, kursunuzdan çok memnun kaldım. Daha önce 5 ya da 6 kere hızlı okuma kursuna katılmıştım. Fakat hiç bir şey öğrenemedim. Eğitmenlerde göz kaslarını güçlendirirsen hızlı okursun gibi bir düşünce mevcut. Belki de kasıtlı olarak yapılıyor bu bilemiyorum. Ben hızlı okuma diye bir şeyin olmadığını düşünmeye başlamıştım. İlk kez sizin kursunuzda hızlı okumanın teorik eğitimini gördüm. Teşekkürler.\"\nEngin Güzel\n\n\n\"Profesyonelce hazırlanmış, başarılı bir kurstu. Kendini bu alanda geliştirmek isteyen kişilerin mutlaka alması gereken bir kurs olduğunu düşünüyorum. Öncelikle hafıza tekniklerinin verilmesi, bilgiyi daha kolay kalıcı hale getirilmesi açısından mantıklı bir yaklaşım olmuş. Başarılarınızın devamını dilerim.\"\nKeşif Akademi\n\n\n\n\n\"Öğrenecek çok şey var ama zamanım yok.\"\n\"Neden bunları öğreniyoruz ki nasıl olsa unutacağız.\"\n\"Yaşlandım ben artık öğrenemiyorum.\"\nBu tür yakınmalar, neredeyse her ortamda duyabileceğimiz derecede sık rastlanan ancak hayat içerisinde bilgi edinmek ve ardından para kazanmak açısından ciddi eksikliklere yol açan sorunlardır. Bunun temel sebebi, eğitim sistemimizde bilgi vermeye odaklanırken bilgiyi nasıl öğrenmemiz ve hafızamızda tutmamız konusunda hiçbir şey öğretilmemesidir. Bir Deha Gibi Öğrenmek kursunda, tüm bu problemlere çözüm olacak, birçoğu hafıza şampiyonları tarafından denenmiş teknikler öğrenecek ve uygulayacağız.\n\n\n\"Nasıl öğrenmeli? Nasıl okumalı? Nasıl ezberlemeli?\" hatta \"Nasıl uyumalı\" ve \"Nasıl çalışmalı?\" sorularının cevaplarına ve daha nicesine bu kursta ulaşacaksınız.\n\n\nHızlı okuma ve öğrenme, birçok dizi, filmde efsanevi ve az rastlanan bir yetenek olarak işlendi ve işleniyor. Ancak son zamanlarda beyin ve hafızayla alakalı araştırmalar arttıkça bu yeteneğin nasıl işlediğini ve nasıl öğrenilebileceğini de öğrenmeye başladık. Bu kurs da Türkiye'de hızlı öğrenme yeteneğinin kazanılması amacıyla oluşturuldu.\n\n\nOkumayı ilk öğrendiğimiz zamanlar her kelimeyi heceleyerek ve sesli söyleyerek öğrendik. Bundan bir süre sonra kelimeleri tek seferde söylemeye ve gitgide hızlanmaya başladık. Daha sonrasında içimizden o kelimeleri okumayı başardık ve nihayet normal okuma seviyesine ulaştık. Aslında bunun sonraki seviyesi de var. Bu seviye de göz ile hızlı okumaktır.\n\n\nBu kurs, Türkiye'de bir dönem popüler olan hızlı okuma kurslarından TAMAMIYLA farklıdır. O kursların hatası öğrencilere kısa bir süreliğine illüzyonik tarzda hızlı okuyormuş gibi hissettirmesiydi. İllüzyonik çünkü öğrenci hızlı okumasına rağmen aslında çok az bir kısmını anlıyor ve bilgiyi hafızasına atmıyordu. Yüksek hızda okurken kelimelerle harcanan zaman azalacağı için hafızaya atmak için ayrı bir etap gerekir. Bu kursta hızlı okumaya zaman ayırmamıza rağmen daha fazla zamanı hızlı hıfzetmeye verdik. Dünya hafıza şampiyonlarının kullandığı teknikleri kullanacak ve uygulama videolarıyla teknikleri pekiştireceğiz. Nihayetinde bunları hızlı okurken, öğrenirken uygulayacağız.\n\n\nKursta öğretilen her teknik ciddi bir araştırma temeline dayanıyor ve daha önce birçok insan tarafından denenmiş ve başarılı olduğu kanıtlanmıştır. Kaynaklar üzerinden tekniklerin ayrıntısına ulaşabiliyor olacaksınız.\n\n\nÖncelikle öğrenmek ve hafıza oluşturmak konusunda beynimizin nasıl işlediğini konuşacağız. Öğrenme kapasitemizin zamanla neden düştüğünü, nasıl anı oluşturduğumuzu ve neden anıları zamanla unuttuğumuzu öğreneceğiz. Beynimizin işleyişini kavradıktan sonra çözümler için denenmiş ve başarısı kanıtlanmış tekniklere başvuracağız. Hızlı öğrenmek için kullanacağımız tekniklerin uygulama videolarını da bulacaksınız. Hemen ardından hızlı öğrenmeye başlayacağız ve 4 etaptan oluşan bu yeteneği öğreneceğiz. Hızlı okumanın yanında hızlı okurken nasıl hafızaya atacağımız konusuna ağırlıklı olarak odaklanacağız. Ek olarak, uyku, çalışma ortamı, nefes gibi verimliliği arttırabileceğiniz konularda da uzman tavsiyeleri öğreneceğiz.\n\n\nNeden Hızlı Okuma ve Öğrenme Eğitimimizin Online Kurs Olması Daha Avantajlı?\nHazırlanan videolar için günlerce çalışma yapılıyor ve en ufak seslendirme hatası dahi düzeltiliyor. Konuşulan kelimeler ve cümleler defalarca kontrol ediliyor. Dolayısıyla, izleyiciye en kısa sürede en fazla bilgi verilmiş oluyor.

      "description": "4차 산업혁명시대는 AI가 인간을 대체하고 넘어설 수 있는 시대다. 이에 인간만이 갖고 있다는 메타인지를 높이지 않으면 이 시대를 제대로 이겨낼 수 없다. 이를 위해 미래저널이라는 저널링 책을 필자는 펴냈다. 미래저널 책은 나는 누구인지, 왜 사는지, 왜 그 일을 하는지, 다른 사람은 어떻게 살고 있는지, 왜 화가 나는지, 감사하는 것은 무엇인지, 왜 화가 나는지를 매일 작성하는 것(박병기, 2021)으로 이것을 작성하면 전두엽에 영향을 미치고 메타인지가 향상된다. 메타인지는 고차원적인 사고로 “자신이 알고 있는 것에 대해 자각하고 이를 조절하고 통제하는 자기 성찰 능력”으로 이는 오직 인간만이 갖고 있는 것이다(李周殷, 2017; 최윤리, 2019) 미래저널 작성과 이를 타인과 온라인상에서 나누는 것이 전두엽에 영향을 미치고 이것이 메타인지와 연관성이 있음을 입증하면서 많은 사람이 새로운 시대를 준비하는 데 미래저널이 필요함을 나누면서 교육과 사회에 이바지하고자 한다.\n저널링에 대한 이론을 설명하자면 다음과 같다.\n우리가 쓰는 저널과 일기는 대부분 우리 자신을 위한 것이다. 인간은 한 번에 한 가지 이상의 생각을 갖는 것이 어렵기에 생각을 적으면, 여러 가지 모호하고 추상적인 것인 생각이 명확하고 구체적이 된다(Krashen, 2008). 생각이 종이에 쓰여질 때, 우리는 여러 생각 사이의 관계를 보고, 더 나은 생각을 떠올리게 된다고 언어학자이자 USC 교수인 크라센은 강조한다. 저널링과 일기는 우리를 더 똑똑하게 만든다고 크라센 교수는 덧붙인다. 그는 이어 “당신에게 어떤 문제가 있다. 그것을 적는다. 그러면 최소한 문제의 10%는 사라진다. 때로는 모든 문제가 사라진다”라고 설명한다.\n콜로라도주립대의 미생물학 박사과정에 있는 애들린 윌리엄스(2020)는 네이처에 기고한 글에서 “나는 두 개의 저널링을 하고 있는데 하나는 과학 저널링, 하나는 나를 돌아보는 저널링이다. 둘 다 손으로 쓰는데 손으로 쓸 때 컴퓨터로 타이핑할 때보다 늦게 쓰기 때문에 더 깊이 생각할 시간과 주변을 돌아보는 기회를 더 얻게 된다”고 썼다.\n저널링은 자신에 대한 깊은 성찰과 반성적 사고를 글로 표현하는 것이다(박소현 & 김한별, 2012:156). 저널링은 일기와 비슷하지만 조금 다른 것은 개인적인 반성, 사건에 대한 설명 및 경험에 대한 설명이 들어간다는 점이다. (Chabon & Lee-Wilkerson, 2006).\n미래 저널은 기존의 저널링에 한 발 더 나아가서 자신에 대한 깊은 성찰뿐 아니라 그로 인해 타인을 바라보게 하고 타인 중심사고를 하여 선한 영향력을 미치도록 이끄는 저널이다(강수연, 2020). 미래저널링은 또한 인생의 목적과 방향을 확고히 하여 공동체 유익을 생각하고 실천하도록 이끄는 기초활동이다. 미래저널은 4차 산업혁명 시대의 인재 양성을 목표로 하여 만들어진 것이다(박병기, 2021).\nChabon, S.

      "description": "The word Advancer does perplex at lot of bridge players.  Most players are unfamiliar with the term.\n\n\nThe Advancer is the player that is responding to the over-caller.  The role of the advancer is massive.  Believe this or not, the advancer holds the key to finding the correct contract level if they are able to give an exact account of their own points (with or without a FIT in partners suit).\n\n\nBidding your partners suit requires SUPPORT (a fit) with a certain amount of points.  Your point level will determine the level at which you offer that support.  In this course, you will learn what a CUE BID RAISE is when offering support.   Remember, the overcall may be weak and this is the very reason whey the cue bid raise is important.  It keeps the bidding nice and low.  This is key.\n\n\nWhether you are the responder to the opener or the advancer, a cue bid raise can be used to show support and a FIT with a certain amount of points (and losers).  For those players that are fixated with loser count, this bid is for you!   The amount of losers combined (subtracted from 18) will determine your contract level.\n\n\nPop in and enjoy.  Cue bid raises will take your bridge to another exciting level .",

While the intentions of other instructors are in the right place, most courses have many errors or misleading elements. There are a lot of gimmicks. Others are teaching advanced skimming techniques rather than speed reading. This will lead to reading without comprehension.\n\n\nThese are things the course does NOT do:\nUse reading material with a lower level to trick you into believing you're reading faster.\nPretend that you can read with comprehension by doing tricks.\nGive you an overnight solution.\n\n\nWe will teach you to identify what is stopping you from reading faster and how to correct it.\n\n\nA typical speed reader can take in information anywhere from 3 to 5 times faster than the average native English-speaking reader. This speed will be 2 to 4 times faster than where listening comprehension breaks down and constitutes a major advantage for anyone who has this skill.\n\n\nWe break Speed Reading into 7 skills that can be developed to grow your skills for the immediate term and for a lifetime. The 7 skills are - at this point - typically indirectly taught or not taught at all in school. They are completely ignored in most other courses. This is likely why so many have experienced mixed results. With this method, you will not give up speed for comprehension.\n\n\nMost people who are speed readers do not share with others how they acquired the ability. This is true in fields like Law, Technology, Financial Services, Consulting, and more. This is often because they did so by chance and have not thought about how you might transfer this knowledge effectively.\n\n\nThis course provides a no-gimmicks way to learn to speed read. It will address claims and misinformation found commonly in other courses.  We believe that by providing a real course that addresses the true obstacles that stop people from unlocking their innate abilities, we can help many achieve the goals they have, whether professional or personal.",

      "description": "Pass DP-700: Implementing Data Engineering Solutions Using Microsoft Fabric Exam in 3 Days 2025 - 80+% Student Passed Exam After Only Studying These Questions. Pass yours, enroll now!\n\n\nFree Sample Question 1 out of 3:\nAt DataFlow Solutions, the DevOps Team manages a Fabric workspace named Workspace1, and your company has acquired GitHub licenses. You need to configure source control for Workpace1 to use GitHub. The solution must follow the principle of least privilege. Which permissions do you require to ensure that you can commit code to GitHub?\nA. Actions (Read and write) and Contents (Read and write)\nB. Actions (Read and write) only\nC. Contents (Read and write) only\nD. Contents (Read) and Commit statuses (Read and write)\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\nTo commit code to a GitHub repository from a Fabric workspace, the necessary permissions revolve around managing the repository's content.\n1.  Contents (Read and write): This permission is fundamental for any source control operation involving code changes.\n*   `Read` allows the Fabric integration to fetch the current state of the repository (e.g., to see existing files or the branch history).\n*   `Write` allows the integration to push new commits, create branches, update files, and perform other actions that modify the repository's content. This directly enables the act of \"committing code.\"\n2.  Principle of Least Privilege: The question specifically states that the solution must follow the principle of least privilege. This means granting only the minimum necessary permissions.\n*   Actions (Read and write): This permission is for managing GitHub Actions workflows (CI/CD pipelines). While a Fabric workflow might eventually trigger or be linked to GitHub Actions, the act of *committing code* itself does not require `Actions` permissions. Including this would violate the least privilege principle as it grants more access than strictly needed for the stated goal of \"commit code.\"\n*   Commit statuses (Read and write): This permission is for updating commit statuses (e.g., indicating whether a build passed or failed). This is relevant for CI/CD processes but not for the act of writing the code changes themselves.\nTherefore, `Contents (Read and write)` is the exact permission set required for committing code, and providing only this set adheres to the principle of least privilege.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 2 out of 3:\nAt Stratos Data Corp., your Enterprise Data Management team manages a Fabric workspace with a Lakehouse. This workspace includes a Dataflow Gen2 dataflow copying data from an on-premises SQL Server, a notebook transforming and loading files, and a data pipeline loading a CSV file to the Lakehouse. To ensure these data loading processes execute sequentially and run every 15 minutes, which type of Fabric item should you utilize for orchestration?\nA. notebook\nB. warehouse\nC. Dataflow Gen2 dataflow\nD. data pipeline\nCorrect Answer: D\nExplanation:\nA Fabric data pipeline is the correct item to use for orchestrating multiple items sequentially and scheduling them.  Here's why:\n*   Data Pipeline (D): Fabric Data Pipelines are designed for orchestration, enabling you to chain together various activities, including running Dataflow Gen2 dataflows, executing notebooks, and performing data loading operations. They provide robust scheduling capabilities, allowing you to set up recurring runs at specified intervals, such as every 15 minutes. This perfectly matches the requirement to run multiple items one after the other and on a schedule.\n*   Notebook (A): While a notebook can perform data transformations and even trigger some operations, it is primarily a tool for interactive data analysis and transformation using code. It is not the primary or most efficient tool for orchestrating a sequence of *different types* of Fabric items, especially when considering robust error handling, monitoring, and diverse activity types.\n*   Warehouse (B): A warehouse in Fabric (or a Lakehouse) is a data storage and analytical engine. It is where data resides and is queried, not an orchestration tool for managing data movement and transformation workflows.\n*   Dataflow Gen2 dataflow (C): Dataflow Gen2 is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool used for ingesting and transforming data. While it performs data loading, it cannot orchestrate other items like notebooks or an entire sequence of distinct processes. It is one *type* of item that a data pipeline can orchestrate.\n\n\n\n\nFree Sample Question 3 out of 3:\nAt Innovate Solutions, your Data Engineering Team manages a Fabric deployment pipeline spanning Dev, Test, and Prod workspaces. To integrate and deploy an Eventhouse within this existing process, what tool or service should you utilize?\nA. an Azure DevOps pipeline\nB. an eventstream\nC. GitHub Actions\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\nTo automate the deployment of Fabric items, such as an Eventhouse, across multiple environments (Dev, Test, Prod) in a structured and repeatable manner, you need a robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool.\nA. an Azure DevOps pipeline: Azure DevOps pipelines are a powerful CI/CD platform that can automate the entire deployment process for Microsoft Fabric items. They allow you to define a series of steps to pull code from source control (like Git), build artifacts, and then deploy them to different workspaces (Dev, Test, Prod) using Fabric's Git integration, REST APIs, or other programmatic methods. This is the standard practice for enterprise-grade automation of deployments.\nB. an eventstream: An eventstream in Microsoft Fabric is a real-time data ingestion and processing capability. It is used to capture, transform, and route streaming data, often as an input to an Eventhouse. It is *not* a tool for deploying the Eventhouse itself or for managing the deployment process across environments.\nC. GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions is another popular CI/CD platform, similar in purpose to Azure DevOps pipelines. While it *could* theoretically be used to deploy Fabric items, given that Azure DevOps is a first-party Microsoft solution deeply integrated with the Azure ecosystem and often the preferred choice for enterprise Microsoft deployments, Azure DevOps pipeline is the most direct and commonly expected answer in this context.\nTherefore, an Azure DevOps pipeline is the most appropriate solution for automating the deployment of an Eventhouse as part of a structured deployment process across multiple Fabric workspaces.\n\n\nWhy Choose This DP-700 Exam Prep Course?\n• Full Exam Coverage – Master every core domain of the DP-700 exam: data ingestion, transformation, modeling, analytics, monitoring, and optimization using Microsoft Fabric.\n• Step-by-Step Explanations – Learn with clear, concise breakdowns of each question.

Spécialisé dans les stratégies d'apprentissage, il reçoit en consultation, depuis plus de 25 ans, des enfants et des adultes.\nL’attention, la mémoire, la compréhension, la réflexion et l’imagination sont au cœur de ses travaux. Il forme des équipes éducatives, accompagne des étudiants et des professionnels dans la réalisation de leurs projets.\nIl se passionne pour la conception et la mise au point de méthodes utilisables par les élèves au cours de leur scolarité.\nIl dirige l'Association de Recherches en Neuropédagogie (A.R.N.) fondée en 1989 pour développer une pédagogie de la réussite.",

Você vai entender o como isso acontece dentro do seu cérebro!\nVocê vai entender cada etapa da formação de uma memória no seu cérebro e quais limitações seu cérebro tem em cada uma dessas etapas.\nPorque assim, você vai conseguir entender o porquê das dicas de estudos que você vai aprender e de alguns sinais que seu corpo te dá, mas que muitas vezes você não entende.\nQuando você compra algum produto eletrônico, você recebe junto um manual de instruções do usuário. Mas infelizmente quando você nasceu, ninguém te deu um para o seu cérebro. Esse curso é como se fosse esse manual de instruções, aplicado a aprendizagem!\nPara isso, na segunda seção você vai saber quais são as restrições para o aprendizado de um adulto (já te adianto que não é a baixa capacidade do seu cérebro ou envelhecimento!) E também vai entender o que é procrastinação, de diversos pontos de vista, e como se livrar dela.\nNa terceira seção, você vai entender o porquê a memória não é como se fosse uma parte do nosso corpo da mesma forma que cabelos, cor da pele e dos olhos etc, ou seja, não existe ninguém com memória “ruim” ou “fraca”.\nA memória é um processo e você vai entender todas as fases e limitações desse processo, para poder aprender o como superar essas limitações e potencializar o seu aprendizado nas seções 4, 5 e 6.\nJá nas seções 7 e 9, você vai aprender o como algo chamado mindset, ou mentalidade, e a nossa saúde física e emocional afetam (e muito) a nossa capacidade de aprender.\nE por fim na seção 8, o como a aprendizagem muda nosso comportamento ao aplicarmos engajamento com a informação que recebemos!\nE o melhor é que as habilidades de aprendizagem que você vai ver neste curso são aplicáveis a muitos aspectos de sua vida diária.\nEntão, embarque nessa com a gente para essa descoberta incrível que é todo o potencial de aprendizagem escondido aí dentro de você!",

      "description": "Why take this course?\nAll in one :\nWhile I could have made it in several courses, in this single course you will learn every action known to man to develop a legendary memory, incredible creativity, ninja-like focus, uncanny reading speed and comprehension, and 1 in a million like IQ. That’s it all in one course, no marketing for another course, no buying other books, webinars or whatever. No BS. Take this course, EXERCISE, put in PRACTICE, and watch your new life unfold.\nThis course is unique:\nWhy? Because it comes from the real world!\nHere, you will find some techniques that are novel and others that are described elsewhere and that have been tweaked. However, the one thing that truly sets this course apart is that it comes from the real world! It’s the result of 10 years of using various techniques to learn and teach very dense and complex material, which led me to give up techniques that didn’t work (and that continue to be widely celebrated out there), tweak and hack techniques that needed modification to be suited for real-life (for e.g., some memory champions use specific techniques to memorize 200 digits of pie, how is that going to help me in my daily life?) and come up with strategies that are new altogether.\nAnother thing that sets this course apart is that, in most books, it’s all about speed, speed reading, speed memorization, how to learn this or that in 24 hours. Although this course heavily emphasizes speed and time-saving tricks, it’s also about making the learning experience FUN and enjoyable!\nSo this course is to the point, with only tips that do work, no crazy promises, no magic pill. I’m the doctor the pill that does work, so trust me!\nExercises:\nAccessing the powers of your brain (let’s call it brain-building) is a lot like bodybuilding in that it needs a lot of practice (actually, it’s a bit easier than bodybuilding, in that certain tricks do give you instant results). Still, you need a lot of practice. This is why this course isn’t all about theoretical principles and is filled with examples and exercises, because we learn by DOING (and that would be your first lesson).\nWhat topics are covered in the course?\nMemory:\nDo you happen to forget important stuff? Then you know how frustrating that can be. Plus, it can be of dramatic consequence like failing in a decisive exam. It can also be quite embarrassing, like forgetting the name of someone important. No matter what walk of life you are in, forgetting can make you appear very unprofessional if say you were to forget important facts discussed during meetings with coworkers/clients.\nWith a powerful memory, you can ease up all sorts of learning. Whether you’re learning a new skill, a new language or studying any topic you’ll find valuable insight that’ll make you say “If only I knew earlier”!\nThis course can help you not only memorize but also UNDERSTAND even the most complex topics (there is no topic your wonderful brain can’t grasp!).\nThink of what your life will look like after learning a myriad of new skills, and this course is about how to achieve that QUICKER than ever and the EASY WAY.\nCreativity :\nMaybe there’s one thing more annoying than forgetting, and that’s the blank page! How annoying it can be to look at a problem, to try and write a story, to try and draw something truly creative and to only come up with more and more blankness, to the point that you wonder if you really have what it takes to create beauty? No matter if you’re a student, a scientist or an artist we all need creativity to solve problems, coming up with new ideas and concepts and all in all change our lives (and the world!).\nCreative geniuses from all fields (science, literature, arts, engineering …etc.) have always fascinated me, and what I came to discover is that most of them had some common habits and ‘tricks’ which make one ponder upon that good old question “are geniuses made or born?”. I really believe they are made! And with the insights in this course I have the firm belief that many of you will find the inspiration to enchant and delight us with masterpieces in all fields. Can’t wait to hear about your achievements!\nFocus:\nMaybe the one factor most determinant of your chances in life is your ability to focus on one thing, one single thing, till the outcome exceeds all your expectations. It is unbelievable how much human potential, how many potential inventors, artists, millionaires are stuck in lives that are way below what they are meant to be simply because of their (acquired) inability to focus on one action, one thought, one goal as if nothing else existed.\nThe “zone” that room where there’s only one task and all the rest of the world is plain muted faded out is the one place everyone “wants” to go to, and so few get to.\nDistractions cost you time (years) and money and lost opportunity. This course is about giving you all this back while you have FUN because focusing is actually much much less pain than you giving in to distractions.\nSpeed reading:\nReading a text several times, and realize you don’t have a clue what you just read?\nFind reading boring? (more boring than say, watching a movie?)\nThis course is about tripling you read speed while improving your understanding and actually having a lot of FUN with the reading process, because that’s how reading was meant to be!\nIQ :\nEver wonder if you could actually increase your IQ? And how it would truly feel to have a higher IQ, to have an IQ of 190+?\nA person’s IQ is one the most critical factors that determine their success, be it with money, love life, skill learning, happiness, and yes, your IQ is a number that can be improved!",

Conscious Mind  – defines all thoughts and actions within our awareness. For example, the beauty and pleasance of the smell of a red tulip\n2. Subconscious Mind – defines all reactions and automatic actions we can become aware of if we think about them. For example, our ability to drive a car: once we get skilled we stop thinking which gears to use, which pedals to press, or which mirror to look at, yet can always become aware of what was done once we think about it.\n3. Unconscious mind – defines all past events and memories, though at times inaccessible to us no matter how hard we try to remember to bring things up. For example, the first word we’ve learned to say, or how it felt to be able to walk on our own.\nthey say that about 90% of our brain is Subconscious mind and plays a major role in maintaining body and mind balance as well as creating our core personality.\nOur Subconscious mind which is also known as \"Power House of Memory\" retains things only when saved in particular fashion. This is explained here.\nBy adapting this particular fashion it helps us to retain the content into our Neural storage.\nIn this course the language of our subconscious mind and its tricks are explained in detail. This would help kids in a miraculous way to remember concepts without memorizing it for hours together.\nSo why wait grab this opportunity and gift your child this wonderful memory techniques.",

      "description": "How to Study – Master Smart Study Habits in Just 7 Days\nHow to Study – Break Bad Habits and Build a Science-Backed Study System in 7 Days to Boost Focus, Memory, & Exam Results\nWhat if You’ve Been Studying Wrong Your Entire Life?\nLet’s be honest. Does this feel familiar?\nIt’s 11 PM. You’re staring at a textbook, your eyes scanning the same paragraph for the tenth time. Your highlighter ran out of ink hours ago, leaving fluorescent yellow streaks across pages you can barely remember reading. A cold cup of coffee sits beside a mountain of notes that feel more like a transcript of your lectures than a tool for understanding.\nYou feel a rising tide of anxiety. The exam is tomorrow. You’ve put in the hours—more hours than you can count. You’ve sacrificed sleep, canceled plans with friends, and told yourself over and over again to just “focus more” and “try harder.”\nYet, deep down, you have a sinking feeling that it’s not working. The information feels fragile, like a dream that will vanish the moment you wake up. You’re terrified that when you sit down in that exam hall, your mind will go completely blank. You see others who seem to grasp concepts effortlessly, and a quiet, frustrating voice in your head asks, “What’s wrong with me? Why is this so hard?”\nThis cycle of intense effort, overwhelming stress, and disappointing results is the silent epidemic among students and learners everywhere. It’s a frustrating, confidence-crushing experience that can make you question your own intelligence and your ability to achieve your goals.\nBut what if the problem isn’t you?\nWhat if the problem is the toolkit you were given? What if the very methods you’re using—the ones taught to you since you were a child—are fundamentally broken, unscientific, and inefficient? What if “trying harder” is not the solution, but the very source of the problem?\nImagine a New Reality… Just One Week From Today\nNow, take a deep breath. Clear your mind of that frustrating picture and imagine a different reality.\nImagine sitting down at your desk and feeling a sense of calm, focused purpose. You know exactly what you need to do, and you have a system to do it. Within minutes, you enter a state of deep concentration, the kind where the outside world fades away and you become fully immersed in your work. Time flies by, not because you’re distracted, but because you are genuinely engaged.\nImagine finishing a chapter and knowing, with deep certainty, that you understand its core principles. You haven’t just memorized facts; you’ve built a mental model of the information so strong that you could easily explain it to someone else.\nImagine looking at your calendar and seeing more free time. Time for friends, for hobbies, for rest. Your study sessions are no longer marathon slogs of misery, but short, intense, and highly effective sprints that achieve more in 90 minutes than you used to in four hours.\nAnd imagine walking into that exam hall. Your heart isn’t pounding with anxiety, but with a quiet, steady confidence. You don’t fear a blank mind, because you have a toolkit of retrieval techniques ready to deploy. You see the questions and you don’t just recognize the topics; you understand them, and you begin to write with clarity and precision.\nThis is not a fantasy. This is the reality of a strategic learner. This is the transformation this course is designed to guide you through.\nThis isn’t just a collection of tips. It is a comprehensive, science-backed operating system for your brain. It is a 7-day journey designed to systematically deconstruct your old, ineffective habits and install a new framework for focus, comprehension, and long-term memory that will serve you for the rest of your life.\nWhy This Course Is the Answer You’ve Been Searching For\nThere are thousands of \"study tip\" videos and articles online. Why do they fail to create lasting change? Because they offer disconnected tactics, not a cohesive system. This program is fundamentally different.\nThis Is a Complete System, Not Just a List of Tips: A random tip is like a single lego brick. It's useless on its own. We provide you with the full blueprint and all the bricks you need, showing you how to build a complete, interconnected system where each new skill builds upon the last. You will build your new learning machine piece by piece, day by day.\nThis Is Based on Science, Not Opinion: The methods in this course are not based on anecdotal advice or recycled \"hacks.\" They are grounded in decades of rigorous research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and performance psychology. You will learn why techniques like Active Recall, Spaced Repetition, and Interleaving work, giving you a deeper understanding that allows you to adapt and apply them to any subject.\nThis Is About Transformation, Not Just Information: Passively watching videos won't change your life. This course is designed as an active, hands-on experience. Each lecture comes with a clear action step, a small win that you can implement immediately. You will be building, practicing, and refining your skills from the very first day. This is a \"doing\" course, and the transformation happens in the application.\nThis Is a Structured Journey, Not an Overwhelming Library: We have designed this program as a focused, 7-day journey for a reason. It creates momentum and provides a clear path from A to B. You will never feel lost or wonder what to do next. You will progress from deconstructing your old mindset to mastering peak performance strategies in a logical, step-by-step sequence that is designed for maximum impact and lasting habit formation.\nYou are about to be handed the instruction manual for your brain that you should have been given in school.\nAn Unprecedented Look Inside Your 7-Day Transformation\nWe believe in complete transparency. We want you to see the incredible depth and value packed into every single day of this journey. Here is the exact blueprint of what you will learn.\nDay 1 How to Study Course: The 24-Hour Reset: Deconstructing Your Old Study Brain\nBefore you can build a skyscraper, you must clear the land and lay a solid foundation. Day 1 is dedicated to demolishing the pervasive myths and invisible habits that have been sabotaging your efforts for years. We will perform a “factory reset” on your approach to learning, creating a clean slate upon which to build your new intellectual home.\nLecture 1.1: Understanding the Most Common Myth That Sabotages Learning You’ve been told that multitasking is a skill. This lecture reveals the scientific truth. We will explore the concept of \"task-switching\" and the \"cognitive switching penalty\"—the hidden mental tax you pay every time you check your phone or glance at a notification. You'll understand that multitasking doesn't just slow you down; it actively damages your ability to form strong memories. By the end of this lesson, you will see single-tasking not as a limitation, but as the secret to profound focus and efficiency.\nLecture 1.2: Why \"Working Harder\" Isn't Always the Answer This lecture dismantles the \"brute force\" theory of studying. We’ve all been told to just “put in more hours,” but this advice leads directly to burnout and diminishing returns. You will learn about the limits of your working memory and why trying to force information in through sheer willpower is like trying to pour water into a full glass. We introduce the concept of \"desirable difficulty\" and begin the crucial shift from a mindset of \"more effort\" to one of \"better strategy.\"\nLecture 1.3: Creating Your Study Sanctuary Your environment is constantly sending signals to your brain. In this lecture, you will learn to become the architect of a space that signals \"focus.\" We provide a simple, 10-minute ritual to optimize both your physical desk and your digital workspace. You will learn why a dedicated study space is a powerful psychological trigger and how the \"out of sight, out of mind\" principle for your smartphone can instantly reclaim your most valuable cognitive resources.\nLecture 1.4: Unlocking Your \"Prime Directive\" for Motivation Why are you really learning this material? Motivation based on external pressures like grades is fragile. Here, you will learn a powerful questioning technique to dig deep and unearth your true, intrinsic motivation—your \"Prime Directive.\" You will craft a personal, powerful statement that connects your daily, often tedious, tasks to your most meaningful long-term aspirations. This becomes your unshakable anchor in moments of doubt.\nLecture 1.5: A Practical Guide to Overcoming Procrastination Procrastination isn't a character flaw like laziness; it's a brain-based response to uncomfortable feelings. This lecture deconstructs the trigger-routine-reward loop of procrastination. You will be equipped with a toolkit of scientifically-backed strategies to short-circuit this loop, including the immensely practical 5-Minute Rule to overcome starting friction, and Temptation Bundling to link work with reward.\nLecture 1.6: Your 7-Day Mission Briefing To conclude our foundational day, we formalize your commitment to this transformation. You will learn about the incredible science of neuroplasticity—your brain’s ability to physically change and form new habits. We will guide you in creating a personal commitment contract, solidifying your decision to engage actively with the program. This isn't just a course; it's a mission to build a better mind, and this briefing ensures you are ready for the journey.\n\n\nDay 2 How to Study Course: The Focus Architect: Engineering Stronger Concentration\nIn our modern world, the ability to concentrate deeply is not just a skill; it is a superpower. Day 2 is dedicated to building this power. You will move from being a victim of distraction to becoming the architect of your own focus, learning to engineer your sessions for sustained periods of deep, high-quality work.\nLecture 2.1: The \"Pulsing\" Method: Working Like a Sprinter Your brain is not designed for marathon-like focus. This lecture introduces the Pomodoro Technique, a system for working in powerful, focused sprints. You’ll learn how to leverage this \"pulsing\" rhythm of intense work followed by deliberate rest to keep your mind fresh, your energy high, and your focus sharp for hours, preventing the mental fatigue that plagues most students.\nLecture 2.2: An Introduction to \"Flow State\" “Flow” is that magical state of being “in the zone,” where work feels effortless and time disappears. It is not random. This lecture deconstructs the science of flow and reveals the three specific conditions you can engineer to trigger it: a clear goal, an immediate feedback loop, and the delicate balance between challenge and skill. You will learn to design study sessions that invite this peak state of performance.\nLecture 2.3: Your Brain’s Two Modes of Thinking Your brain operates in two distinct gears: the analytical \"Focused Mode\" and the creative, big-picture \"Diffuse Mode.\" The biggest breakthroughs happen when you learn to switch between them. This lecture will teach you to recognize each mode and, crucially, how to intentionally toggle from one to the other. This skill is the key to unlocking creative solutions to hard problems and avoiding the frustration of getting stuck.\nLecture 2.4: The “White Space” Principle of Strategic Breaks Breaks are not a waste of time; they are a biological necessity for learning. Here, you will learn the \"White Space\" principle, exploring the neuroscience of how your brain consolidates memories and recharges attentional resources during periods of rest. You will learn to distinguish between low-quality, distracting breaks and high-quality, restorative breaks that actively enhance your learning.\nLecture 2.5: Strategies for Digital Distractions You are in a battle for your attention against technology designed to be addictive. Willpower alone is a losing strategy. This lecture provides a tactical manual for building a \"Fortress of Focus.\" You will learn how to systematically dismantle digital distractions by purging notifications, redesigning your phone's home screen, leveraging website blockers, and creating a sealed, work-only digital environment.\nLecture 2.6: Training Your Attention Muscle Your ability to direct your attention is a muscle. This lecture provides you with a simple, 5-minute daily \"focus workout.\" This mindfulness-based exercise is designed to strengthen the neural circuits of attention. You will practice the core skill of noticing when your mind has wandered and gently, but firmly, returning it to your point of focus, building your resilience to distraction over time.\n\n\nDay 3 How to Study Course: The Active Learner's Toolkit: Becoming a Knowledge Builder\nHaving mastered focus, what do you do with it? Day 3 equips you with the essential tools of active learning. You will forever abandon passive, ineffective techniques like re-reading and highlighting and learn the powerful, engaging strategies that allow you to deconstruct, process, and truly own new information.\nLecture 3.1: The Feynman Technique for Deeper Understanding How do you know if you really understand something? This lecture teaches you the elegant and powerful Feynman Technique. You will learn a four-step process centered on explaining a concept in the simplest possible terms. This method ruthlessly exposes gaps in your knowledge and shatters the \"illusion of competence,\" forcing you to build a robust and genuine understanding of any topic.\nLecture 3.2: The Question-Maker Method for Active Reading Stop being a passive victim of boring textbooks. This lecture teaches you how to turn reading into an active treasure hunt. By learning to generate your own questions before you begin reading, you engage your brain’s \"seeking\" systems and program it to find the answers. Your comprehension will deepen, your mind will stop wandering, and the text will come alive.\nLecture 3.3: A System for Smarter Note-Taking Your notes should be a thinking tool, not a transcript. In this lecture, you will master the Cornell Note-Taking Method, a structured system for processing information in real-time. You will learn to segment your notes for paraphrasing, cue-word extraction, and high-level summary, creating a powerful study asset that has active recall built into its very design.\nLecture 3.4: The “Blank Sheet” Test to Find Your Knowledge Gaps This is your personal truth serum for learning. The \"Blank Sheet\" Test is the ultimate tool for practicing active recall and diagnosing your weaknesses with pinpoint accuracy. You will learn how to take a blank piece of paper and retrieve everything you know about a topic from memory. The resulting document gives you a perfect, personalized map of exactly what you need to study next.\nLecture 3.5: A Strategic Approach to Reading Reading dense, academic text is a cognitively demanding skill. This lecture explains why it can be so difficult for our brains. You will then learn the classic SQ3R (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review) method. This five-step framework provides the scaffolding you need to systematically deconstruct any chapter, extract its essential knowledge, and ensure it gets encoded into your memory.\nLecture 3.6: The Elaboration Effect for Connecting Ideas Memories are not isolated files; they exist in a connected web. The more connections a memory has, the stronger it is. This lecture teaches you the art of \"elaboration.\" You will learn powerful techniques, such as creating rich analogies and leveraging the self-reference effect, to consciously build a dense network of connections between new information and what you already know.\n\n\nDay 4 How to Study Course: Strategies for Long-Term Memory\nWhat good is learning if you forget it all a week later? Day 4 is dedicated to defeating the number one enemy of all learners: forgetting. You will dive into the science of memory and build a systematic approach to ensure the knowledge you work so hard to gain becomes durable, reliable, and accessible for the long term.\nLecture 4.1: Working With the \"Forgetting Curve\" Forgetting is a natural, predictable process. This lecture introduces you to the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve and reveals a powerful truth: because forgetting is predictable, it is also manageable. You will learn about the immense power of your first 24-hour review and the core principle of Spaced Repetition—reviewing at increasing intervals to make memories permanent.\nLecture 4.2: Advanced Strategies for Active Recall This lecture goes deep on the single most effective learning strategy ever discovered: active recall. You will explore the \"Testing Effect,\" understanding why the act of retrieving information is exponentially more powerful for memory than passively re-reading it. You will learn to make challenging retrieval the cornerstone of your entire study system.\nLecture 4.3: The Interleaving Effect for More Flexible Knowledge This lecture presents a counter-intuitive strategy used by top performers in every field. You will learn why practicing one topic in a solid \"block\" can create brittle knowledge, while \"interleaving\"—or mixing up—different topics in a single session builds a more flexible and adaptable understanding that prepares you for real-world application.\nLecture 4.4: The Role of Sleep in Memory Sleep is not an obstacle to studying; it is an essential part of it. This lecture explores the vital role sleep plays in cleaning the brain and consolidating memory. You will learn how different sleep stages contribute to learning and discover the \"Review Before Sleep\" hack—a simple technique to direct your brain’s natural memory-enhancement processes while you sleep.\nLecture 4.5: An Introduction to Mnemonics For information that is arbitrary or hard-to-remember, we need special tools. This lecture unleashes the power of mnemonics. You will learn how to create memorable acronyms, use the creative Keyword Method for vocabulary, and structure information along a mental journey using the ancient and powerful Method of Loci, or \"Mind Palace.\"\nLecture 4.6: A Practical \"Memory Insurance\" Ritual To make these principles practical, this lecture provides you with a concrete, easy-to-follow system. You will learn the \"1-5-15-30 Day\" review schedule, a simple but highly effective spaced repetition ritual. You'll learn how to use a basic calendar to automate this \"memory insurance\" policy, ensuring your knowledge lasts.\n\n\nDay 5 How to Study Course: The Idea Weaver: Tools for Deeper Thinking\nRemembering facts is one thing; understanding how they connect is another. True mastery comes from synthesis. Day 5 elevates your thinking to a higher plane. You will learn to use powerful mental frameworks to see the big picture, deconstruct problems, and forge your own original insights.\nLecture 5.1: The Power of \"Mental Models\" Experts see the world differently because they think in \"Mental Models\"—reusable frameworks for understanding. This lecture introduces you to this game-changing concept. You will learn about powerful models from different fields and how to build a \"latticework\" of them in your own mind, allowing you to analyze any situation with greater depth and clarity.\nLecture 5.2: An Introduction to First Principles Thinking This lecture teaches you to think like a true innovator. You will learn the method of First Principles Thinking—the art of deconstructing a problem down to its most fundamental, undeniable truths. By stripping away assumptions and reasoning up from that solid foundation, you can develop novel solutions that are invisible to conventional thinkers.\nLecture 5.3: Concept Mapping to Visualize the \"Big Picture\" Your knowledge is a web. This lecture teaches you how to draw it. You will learn Concept Mapping, a visual technique for organizing information and, crucially, defining the precise relationships between ideas. This process creates a visible representation of your understanding, allowing you to see the \"big picture\" and identify connections you never knew existed.\nLecture 5.4: The Analogy Generator for Creative Connections Analogy is the engine of understanding. This lecture teaches you how to move beyond simple comparisons and systematically generate powerful analogies. By identifying the deep, relational structure of a concept, you can build a bridge to something you already understand, making abstract ideas tangible and unlocking creative insights.\nLecture 5.5: A Problem-Solving Protocol for Any Challenge This lecture provides a robust, four-step protocol for tackling any complex problem, academic or otherwise. Based on the timeless work of George Pólya, you will learn to 1) Understand the problem, 2) Devise a plan, 3) Carry out the plan, and 4) Look back. This system provides a reliable framework for thinking clearly under pressure.\nLecture 5.6: The Synthesis Project: Forging Your Own Insights The final level of learning is to become a creator of knowledge, not just a consumer. This lecture introduces the \"Synthesis Project.\" You will learn how to take ideas from different sources, bring them into dialogue, and combine them to form your own unique arguments and insights. This is the path to true intellectual ownership.\n\n\nDay 6 & 7 How to Study Course: The Peak Performance Playbook: Applying Your Knowledge\nAll your preparation culminates here. The final two days are dedicated to performance—translating your knowledge into results when it matters most. You will learn the strategies and rituals to manage pressure, optimize your state, and approach exams with the confidence of a seasoned pro.\nLecture 6.1: The Pre-Exam Countdown Ritual The 48 hours before an exam are for strategic optimization, not panicked cramming. This lecture provides a detailed countdown ritual that covers your final review, nutrition, strategic exercise, and, most importantly, sleep. You will learn how to taper your preparations like a professional athlete to ensure you arrive on game day at your absolute peak.\nLecture 6.2: Strategies to Manage Test Anxiety This lecture provides a toolkit of evidence-based techniques to manage the debilitating effects of stress. You will learn cognitive reframing techniques like Arousal Reappraisal to turn anxiety into excitement, and physiological tools like Box Breathing to calm your nervous system on demand. You will learn to control your state, not be a victim of it.\nLecture 6.3: The Art of Triage for Exam Time Management On an exam, time is your most valuable resource. Here, you will master \"exam triage\"—the art of strategically navigating a test to maximize your score. You will learn to quickly scan and categorize questions, secure easy points first, and allocate your time intelligently, ensuring you never run out of time leaving points on the table.\nLecture 6.4: An Introduction to Intelligent Guessing When faced with a question you don’t know, there is a strategy between random guessing and leaving it blank. This lecture teaches you the skill of intelligent guessing. You will learn the powerful process of elimination, how to spot common \"distractor\" answers, and how to use logic to dramatically improve your odds on any multiple-choice question.\nLecture 6.5: The Post-Mortem Method for Learning from Tests Your graded exam is the most valuable, personalized feedback you will ever receive. This lecture teaches you the \"Post-Mortem Method.\" You will learn how to systematically analyze your mistakes, categorize their root causes (e.g., conceptual gap vs. simple error), and create an actionable plan for improvement. This turns every test into a powerful learning experience.\nLecture 6.6: Beyond the Test: Your Lifelong Learning System In our final lecture, we zoom out. The goal was never just to pass one test. The goal is to become a master learner for life. You will learn how to take the toolkit you've built over the last seven days and apply it to every future endeavor—your career, your hobbies, your personal growth. This is about solidifying your new identity as a confident, curious, and capable lifelong learner.\n\n\nThis How to Study Course Was Created For You If…\nYou are a University or College Student who feels like the volume and complexity of your coursework is impossible to keep up with, and you know there must be a better way to study.\nYou are an Ambitious Professional who needs to study for a critical certification or learn new skills for your career, but you have limited time and need the most efficient methods available.\nYou are a High School Student in challenging courses (like AP or IB) who wants to build an unshakable foundation of learning skills that will not only help you now but will give you a significant advantage in college.\nYou are a \"Hard Worker\" who is putting in the hours but feels deep frustration that your grades and results don’t reflect the true level of your effort and dedication.\nYou are a Lifelong Learner with a passion for new subjects, skills, or languages, and you want a structured system to help you learn deeply and retain what you learn for years to come.\nYou are anyone who has struggled with procrastination, distraction, or test anxiety and is ready to move beyond \"just trying harder\" and build a system of concrete, practical strategies.\n\n\nThis How to Study Course may not be for you if…\nYou are looking for a \"magic button\" solution and are not willing to actively participate in the exercises and apply the techniques.\nYou prefer to passively absorb information without engaging in the active, and sometimes challenging, work that creates real learning.\nYou are not open to challenging your existing beliefs and trying a new, systematic approach to your studies.\n\n\nThe Decision That Defines Your Future\nYou are at a crossroads.\nOne path is the one you’ve been on.

In diesem Film gehe ich besonders auf Lernstrategien zum Thema Aufmerksamkeit / ADS / ADHS / notivierender Arbeitsplatz / Zeitmanagement / Schriftbild ein.\nEs ist günstig, wenn du dir auch die anderen NLP Lerncoach Kurse ansiehst.\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach Teil 1 werden grundsätzliche Vorgehensweisen beim Lerncoaching gezeigt.\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach Teil 2 geht es um das Lernen von Sprachen. Oft bietet die Rechtschreibestrategie jedoch einen guten Einstieg für das Thema visuelles Lerne\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach 3: Dyskalkulie / Rechnen /  Mathematikverständnis / Umgang mit Textaufgaben / Formeln speichern und abrufen lernst du, wie du dich erfolgreich mit dem Thema Mathematik anfreunden kannst.\nIm NLP Lerncoach 5 geht es darum, Prüfungen effektiv vorzubereiten, große Wissensmengen schnell und leicht zu lernen, Wissen zu vernetzen und Wissen im inneren Raum gut erreichbar abzuspeichern.\nDu erhältst ein ausführliches Händout mit Erklärungen und Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitungen sowie Trancen, die du für dich selbst und andere nutzen kannst.\nIm Kurs findest du Demonstrationen mit unterschiedlichen echten Coachees die echte Themen vor der Kamera lösen!\nIn den Demos gefilmte Themen:\nDemo mit Livia (7 Jahre): Livia hat Probleme mit Rechnen. Im Laufe des Coachings fällt auf, dass sie hibbelig und ablenkbar ist. Deshalb führe ich  die ADHS-Strategie mit ihr durch, damit sie mehr Einfluss auf ihre innere Geschwindigkeit sowie die zeitliche Ordnung ihrer Filme gewinnt.\nDanach geht es kurz weiter mit Mathematik. Im Anschluss ankert Livia noch Ressourcen, um mehr Spaß und Leichtigkeit empfinden zu können.\nDemo mit Marius (25 Jahre):\nMarius enzdeckt mithilfe der ADHS-Strategie, bei welcher Geschwindigkeit und bei welchem Maß an innerer zeitlicher Ordnung er zuverlässig assoziiert bleiben kann.\nDemo mit Klaus-Dieter (65 Jahre): Klaus-Dieter denkt oft sprunghaft, wechselt zwischen unterschiedlichen Geschichten und Zeiten hin und her. Deshalb habe ich ihm die ADHS-Strategie angeboten, um die Geschwindigkeit und die zeitliche Ordnung seines Denkens besser steuern zu können.\nDemo mit Moritz (7 Jahre): Interessante Demo zur ADHS-Strategie - leider mit schlechter Tonqualität. Bedauerlicherweise ist meine Stimme als Hall im Video doppelt zu hören. Trotzdem haben wir uns entschieden, das Video in den Kurs aufzunehmen, da Moritzs Mutter im Feedback berichtet, dass das kurze Coaching sehr wirksam war.\nDemo mit Claudia (44 Jahre): Claudia erlernt die ADHS-Strategie. Neben Geschwindigkeit und zeitlicher Ordnung hat Claudia weitere wichtige Aspekte ihrer Aufmerksamkeitssteuerung entdeckt. Sie installiert Regler für unterschiedliche Perspektiven und Lautstärke.\nDemo mit Melissa (27 Jahre): Melissa hat bemerkt, dass sie im Anschluss an eine Vollnarkose besonders gut gelunt und entspannt war. Mihilfe des Demon States simulieren wir den Zustand, den sie dann im jeweils passenden Grad in ihr Leben integriert.\nDemo mit Claudia (44 Jahre): Claudia hat einmal beim Trinken von Rotwein erlebt, dass sie komplett in Reimen sprechen konnte. DenZustand, der ihr das ermöglicht hat, möhte sie zur Verfügung haben.\nDemon State mit Kerstin (39 Jahre): Kerstin wurde 2012 Multiple Sklerose diagnostiziert. Sie sitzt im Rollstuhl und wird oft von Spastiken geplagt. Deshalb erhält sie Medizinisches Cannabis, das sie im Moment nicht einnimmt, weil sie schwanger ist. Sie möchte auch weiterhin auf die Einnahme von Cannabis verzichten, weil sie sich als Mutter von 2 Kindern deutlich wohler fühlt, wenn sie keine Drogen zu sich nimmt.\nDie Kursen zum Thema Lerncoaching sind einerseits für Menschen jeden Alters geeignet, die sich selbst mit dem Thema Lernen beschäftigen, ihre eigenen Lernstrategien hinterfragen und optimieren möchten. Andererseits für Menschen, die andere als Coach beim Lernen unterstützen möchten. Coachees können Kinder oder Erwachsene jeder Altersstufe sein.\nNLP bietet eine Reihe nützlicher Strategien zu den klassischen Themen Rechtschreibung, Lesen, Textverständnis, Vokabellernen, Lernen von Regeln, Rechnen, Textaufgaben, Mathematikverständnis, Organisieren komplexer Lernaufgaben, innere Ordnung schaffen, Konzentration, große Wissensmengen schnell und sicher lernen, etc..\nDas einzige, was in einem Videokurs nicht leistbar ist, sind Antworten auf Verständnisfragen, Übungsgruppen und das Feedback zu deinen Erfahrungen in den Übungsgruppen... das solltest du dir entweder selbst organisieren, damit du alles Gezeigte trainieren kannst oder an unseren Online-Übungsabenden teilnehmen. Die Termine dafür teilen wir dir im Newsletter mit. Fragen kannst du natürlich auch stellen, wenn du Kontakt zu mir aufnimmst.\nWenn du einen Lerncoach-Kurs besuchst, kannst du das Videomaterial als wertvolle Ergänzung nutzen, denn du weißt ja, dass NLP eine Methode ist, die durch Modelllernen vermittelt wird. Je mehr Demonstrationen du zu einem Thema kennst, umso leichter wird es für dich, das Wesentliche herauszufiltern. Du lernst, an den individuellen Coaching-Bedarf angepasste Variationen des Vorgehens kennen und kannst dadurch souveräner mit eigenen Blockaden und Themen von Coachees umgehen.\nDer Kurs ist sowohl für Anfänger / Einsteiger ins NLP geeignet, als auch zur Vertiefung der Kenntnisse für fortgeschrittene NLP-Anwender.\nDie Trancen und Übungen sind bestens für die Selbstanwendung geeignet - du kannst dich durch das jeweilige Format führen lassen oder die Trancen auch zur Anleitung deiner Coachees nutzen\nNLP (Neuro Linguistisches Programmieren) ist in allen beruflichen Bereichen, in denen Lernen, Kommunikation, Beratungskompetenz sowie gelungene Selbststeuerung einen wesentlichen Anteil hat, von großem Nutzen.\nNLP ist eine Methode, die zunächst durch Modeling von Höchstleistungen entstand. Ursprünglich ging es dabei um effektive Psychotherapie. Die Methode hat sich inzwischen in vielen weiteren Bereichen etabliert, wie: Personalwesen, Führung, Werbung, Vertrieb, Kundenzufriedenheit, Gesundheit, Physiotherapie, Coaching, Seminargestaltung und Training, Sport und natürlich in allen sozialen Berufen wie Psychologie, Pädagogik, Sozial-Pädagogik, Coaching, Beratung, Schule und Erziehung...\n... Und natürlich ist NLP eine hervorragende Methode der Persönlichkeitsentwicklung.\nDu kannst...\nschnell große Mengen Wissensstoff sowie praktische Vorgehensweisen lernen\ndeine Ziele erreichen\nvergangene Ereignisse bereinigen und gestärkt aus ihnen hervorgehen\ndein Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstvertrauen verbessern\ndein Lebensglück und deine Zufriedenheit steigern\ndeine Überzeugungen und Glaubenssätze optimieren\nNLP als Methoden der Achtsamkeit und Meditation nutzen\ndeine innere Verfassung positiv beeinflussen\ndeine Gesundheit verbessern...\n...denn gute Stimmung und schnelles Überwinden von Stress-Zuständen unterstützt die Funktion deines Immunsystems.\ndeine Spiritualität fördern\n...",

Do you struggle to retain information when you need it the most — whether for exams, work, presentations, or daily life? Imagine being able to memorize anything faster, retain it longer, and recall it whenever you need to — with complete confidence.\nThis is not just another course filled with vague advice or complicated theories. Instead, you’ll get a practical system that shows you exactly how to memorize anything faster — from lists, numbers, facts, names, and speeches to study material, foreign language vocabulary, and more. You'll learn how to use your brain the way top memory champions and memory athletes do — but in a way that’s simple, fun, and applicable to real life.\nWhether you're a student, professional, entrepreneur, lifelong learner, or someone who simply wants to remember more and forget less — this course is designed to help you master your memory for good.\nWhat You’ll Learn\nHow to use visualization and association to instantly remember any fact\nThe key principles behind powerful memory techniques used by world champions\nWhy traditional repetition-based learning fails — and what works better\nHow to memorize long lists, speeches, or concepts without stress or anxiety\nHow to create mental “folders” to store and retrieve information on demand\nHow to build your own “memory palace” for massive recall of complex content\nHow to memorize names and faces with ease and confidence\nHow to retain what you study — and recall it effortlessly during tests\nHow to apply memory techniques to real-world tasks like learning languages, giving presentations, or remembering appointments and tasks\nHow to combine imagination, emotion, and structure to make anything unforgettable\nYou won’t just memorize more — you’ll understand more. These methods enhance comprehension, focus, creativity, and confidence — unlocking your full cognitive potential.\nWho This Course is For\nThis course is for anyone who wants to stop forgetting and start memorizing — faster, easier, and more reliably. Whether you’re:\nA student who wants to ace exams with less effort and more confidence\nA professional who needs to remember facts, data, or presentations quickly\nA public speaker or performer who wants to recall long scripts or speeches\nA language learner looking for better ways to memorize vocabulary and grammar\nA busy individual who wants to improve mental clarity and stay mentally sharp\nOr simply someone who loves learning and wants to optimize their brain\nNo matter your age, background, or current memory skills — these techniques are accessible, adaptable, and highly effective for everyone.\nWhy This Course Works\nMost people never learn how to use their memory properly. We’re taught what to learn, but rarely how to learn or retain it effectively. This course fills that gap by showing you how memory actually works — and how you can take control of it.\nAll techniques in this course are based on cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and decades of proven performance in the field of memory training. You’ll learn methods inspired by memory athletes but customized for practical, everyday use.\nWhat makes this course unique is its balance of scientific foundation and real-world application. You’ll not only learn the what and why behind each method — but also exactly how to use it, step-by-step, with practice exercises and examples.\nYou can move through the course at your own pace, revisit sections anytime, and apply the techniques instantly to whatever you're learning or working on.",

Have you ever wanted to learn a foreign language but gave up assuming that you are simply not good enough? Do you find it difficult to prioritize and get real results?\n\nIf you can resonate with this I have some good news.\n\nAccelerated Learning and Productivity are not just inborn talents. In fact, they are SKILLS YOU CAN LEARN. Many people don't realize that their approach to learning and productivity is wrong.\n\nThey can't produce results not because something is inherently wrong with them, but because they don't have the right set of tools.\n\nMany individuals from my existing audience have been asking me for a course that would help them to solve those issues. At one point I decided to pull the trigger. I went to my studio and started filming...\n\nIn this compact course I will share with you some of my best hacks for accelerated learning and productivity. I know that you are probably busy and the last thing you want is to watch hours and hours of long videos.\n\nThe cool thing about this particular course is that I made it very concise and extremely actionable. I  believe that there is a lot of power in simplicity. I could’ve filmed hours worth of videos, but instead I followed the 80/20 rule and decided to give you the best strategies that will help you to get the best results with the least amount of effort. Also, I will be posting bonus videos so make sure that you stay tuned for my updates.\nEnjoy the videos and I'm very excited to see you inside!\nJimmy",

Und quälen uns dabei auch noch durch die Materie.\nStell dir vor, du könntest für deinen Beruf, dein Hobby oder auch für deine Familie alle wichtigen Fähigkeiten in kürzester Zeit lernen.\n\n\nMein Ziel ist es, dass du mit weniger Aufwand als vorher überragende Ergebnisse erzielst. Dass du den Spaß am Lernen wieder entdeckst.\nDeswegen erhältst du hier erprobte Techniken, mit denen nicht nur ich, sondern auch schon über 2500 Menschen vorher die eigene Lernleistung massiv steigern konnten.\n\n\nEntscheide dich gegen die Durchschnittlichkeit!\nEine zweijährige Weiterbildung entspannt nebenberuflich in sechs Monaten schaffen? Von Note fünf auf Note eins? Oder einfach nur eine Fähigkeit, die dich und dein Umfeld weiter bringt in Rekordzeit meistern?\nDas alles ist möglich und zwar für jeden. Lass dir von niemandem erzählen, dass das für dich nicht geht. Du hast mit Deutsch eine der kompliziertesten Sprachen gelernt, also kann dein Gehirn wohl komplexe Dinge verarbeiten.\n\n\nSprenge also die angeblichen Grenzen, die dir in der Schule gezeigt wurden und werde ein echter High-Performer!\n\n\n\n\nVerdreifache deine Lesegeschwindigkeit\nWas nutzen aber die beste Lerntechnik, wenn wir bei Büchern immer wieder Fokus verlieren? Wenn wir große Mengen an Energie verbrauchen und beim Lesen schon am Ende der Seite nicht mehr im Blick haben, worum es am Anfang ging?\nGenau deswegen ermöglichen dir die Techniken, die du hier lernst nicht nur, deine Lesegeschwindigkeit mehr als zu verdreifachen- und das bei doppeltem Verständnisgrad. Du hast richtig gelesen - Schneller lesen und mehr begreifen.\n\n\nWenn du am Tag eine Stunde beruflich liest, kannst du so mehr als 45 volle Arbeitstage im Jahr sparen. Ein echter Schub für deine Produktivität. Du siehst also, Speed Reading lohnt sich schon nach der ersten Woche.\n\n\nDurch diese einzigartige Kombination aus Motivationstechniken, Meta-Lernmethoden und Speed-Reading bekommst du ein schlagkräftiges Paket für deinen Erfolg.\n\n\nMein Ziel\nGerade im deutschsprachigen Raum ist Gaming und generell vieles aus der digitalen Welt immer noch negativ belastet. Einer spielt Counter Strike, Fortnite oder PUBG? Du weißt, was da das Klischee gleich sagt. Gleiches gilt für Online-Spiele, wie World of Warcraft.\nDass aber jedes der genannten Spiele erst mal einen Lernprozess erfordert und die meisten Games nicht allein, sondern kooperativ oder kompetitiv gespielt werden, weiß jeder Gamer. Mit eSports, Twitch und der Tatsache, dass in allen Alters- und Gesellschaftsgruppen gezockt wird, zeigt sich doch, dass das Klischee vom Zocker als Verlierer nicht mehr haltbar ist.\nDie Macher dieser Spiele haben eine Menge Know-How aufgewandt, damit der \"Sucht-Faktor\", die Motivation immer weiter zu machen auch ja nicht so schnell aufhört.\nLernen könnte also wieder ein Begriff werden, den wir mit Spaß verbinden, wenn wir es nur richtig machen.\n\nLerne also wie ein Gamer - nicht wie ein Schüler",

You will be able to experience your improvements while taking this course. Our quizzes will track your learning progress and compare them with other students.\nSo far, more than 500 students improved their Study Skills and Advanced Memory Skills by 85%.\nWhat are you going to learn?\nBecome proficient with advanced study skills\nGain a better awareness of how your memory functions\nThe ability to understand which learning methods will work for you or not\nAn overview of the most efficient memorization techniques\nThe powerful impact of the loci method and the story method\nThe benefits of a mind-map\nA clear picture of how to maximize your time in a lecture or class\nA concrete guideline on how to read textbooks efficiently\nHow a learning group can make your life much easier\nHow to schedule recall sessions most efficiently (and save time)\nHow to organize your learning schedule\nHow to make use of sleep when studying\nAlthough we spend more than 25,000 hours in High school or College, we hardly learn how to develop efficient study skills. The result is that many students simply memorize content shortly before the exam and then forget most of it days later. Other High school or College students waste time by double learning or re-doing things, such as re-writing notes, re-reading textbooks or re-listening to pre-recorded lectures.\nDiscover how quick and easy it is to use your advanced study skills and build a sustainable knowledge level.\nIt's obvious to everyone that you cannot be successful in any type of sport if you start training the night before the competition. You need to build solid skills, techniques, and maintain a constant, high level of fitness. The same applies to your study skills. Once you start using the right technique and maintain this high level of standard, it will be very easy for you to build a solid foundation for your learning success. In this way you will not only be one of the best students around you but also increase your chances of visiting the best schools and getting the best jobs.\nBecome a real knowledge champion with advanced memory skills!\nEverything taught here is not a secret and has been successfully proven to work for many students around the world. You don't have to read dozens of specialized publications to get the full picture of how to improve your study skills for High school or College. This course gives you insight into the most efficient memorization techniques and will explain in a very easy, non-scientific way how your brain works. This will create an awareness on your end, why certain study methods work and others don't.\nBut that's not all. This course is not just about memorization techniques. What's the point of being able to memorize even more things, if you cannot organize the flow of new information? That's why we have created a four-step guideline on how to organize yourself, implement your acquired knowledge into an efficient learning schedule, and maximize your study time. That way you will reach your goals in a fraction of the time you might have spent before. In addition, a few exercises are included in the course that allow you to track your actual progress in your study skills and compare yourself with other students.\nThank you for your time and enjoy this course!\nBogdan and William",

      "description": "Bu kurs içerisinde sadece Hızlı okuma yer almamaktadır. Okuduğunu anlayabilme, anlamlandırabilme ve zeka gücünü artırarak etkili anlamayı da destekliyoruz. Bunun yanında okunan bilgilerin daha çok akılda kalması için hafıza teknikleri, konsantrasyonun gücünü de katarak en etkin hızlı okuma ve anlama kursunu oluşturduk.\nBu kurs sonrası sadece hızlı okumakla kalmayacak, etkili anlayabileceğiniz gibi, gündelik hayatta öğrenme kabiliyetinizin artığını fark edeceksiniz. Böylece gündelik hayatta hızlı öğrenen, hızlı anlayan ve aynı zamanda yetkin becerilerinin artacağını göreceksiniz.\nHızlı okumak, zihin ve göz arasındaki koordinasyonun hızlandırılmasını sağlamak demektir. Hızlı okumak, zihinde birim zamanda geçen, hatırlama oranının maksimize edilmesi demektir. Hızlı okuma, 1 dakika içinde okuduğumuz kelime sayısın standartların üzerine çıkarmak demektir.\nKelimeleri hızlı okumak da tek başına yeterli değildir. Hem hızlı okumamız hem de okuduklarımızı iyi anlamamız gerekir. Aksi takdirde hızlı okumanın hiçbir önemi yoktur. Hızlı okumanın tek başına bir şey ifade etmemesinin sebebi şudur:\nNeden Anlayarak Okumalıyız?\nOkuma yapmanın temel amacı öğrenmektir. Bir roman bile okusak, okuduklarımızın bize bir şeyler katmasını umarız. Okuduğumuz cümlelerin kuruluşları, hoş betimlemeler bile aslında öğrenmek, hissetmek istediğimiz şeylerdir.\nTek başına hızlı okuma, anlama olmayınca mermisiz silaha benzer. Yani hedeflediğimiz şeye ulaşamayız. O yüzden birincil önceliğimiz anlayarak okuma olmalıdır. Hızlı okuma ve anlama için yapılacak birçok şey vardır bunları makalenin ilerleyen kısımlarında anlatacağız.\nAncak eğer anlayamıyorsak ya da geç anlıyorsak bu tamamen bizimle ilgili bir sorundur. Yani bunu sadece okuduğumuz metne, okuma yaptığımız ortama, kafamızın dağınık olmasına bağlarsak hata etmiş oluruz.\nHızlı okuyup anlama için önce suçu kendimizde aramalıyız. Yeterince kendimi geliştirdim mi? Kelime hazinemi genişlettim mi? Hızlı okuma ve anlama teknikleri indirdim mi? Bir hızlı okuma ve anlama kursuna kaydoldum mu? Bol kitap okudum mu?\nKendime hiç hızlı okuma ve anlama testi uyguladım mı? Sorularını kendimize sorduğumuzda –Hayır! Cevabını veriyorsak o zaman hatalıyız. Ancak hatamızın farkındayız ve bu durumu telafi edeceğiz.",

      "description": "This Fully Accredited Course is the one course that explains the things that other memory courses don't.\nThat is because other courses provide you with many techniques on collecting and storing information, which is great, but very few, if any, discuss:\nwhy people struggle with the retention of information\nWhat factors prevent successful information processing and retention\nHow personality affects the collection and processing of information\nHow learning styles and learning characteristics affect information gathering, processing, and storing.\nIf factors these are not clearly understood, now Memory Technique will be completely successful, ever!\n\n\nTo increase your Memory, you need to know how memory works.\nYou need to understand how the human mind collects and processes information before it stores that information. Although the human brain works the same in general, every individual is different when it comes to the way we filter information, process information, and absorb information. It is crucial that you understand the important factors preventing you from processing and absorbing new information.\n\n\nThe moment that you understand this, your life will change!\nYes!\n\n\nYou see, the moment you understand how the mind absorbs information, and how it is stored, your memory will greatly increase. If you understand what prevents you from learning, you understand why you struggle to memorize content and how to overcome it.\nUnderstand your Mind. Boost your Memory.\n\n\nThink of it this way:\nBefore something can be stored in the Short-Term Memory, it must be learned. Even something like a street address. It must be repeated or written down where you can see it as a reminder. Then, after some more repetition, it moves from the Short-Term to the Long-Term Memory where it is stored for a long time.\nSo, for something to exist in your memory, whether short-term or long-term, it must be learned first, right?\n\n\nBut there are some factors that interfere with our ability to store something in the Short-Term and Long-Term Memory. These factors hinder your thinking and concentration, and in turn limit your ability to absorb new information.\nIn fact, some of these factors can block the processing of information completely.\n\n\nThere are many books and courses on Memory Techniques, but very few on how the human mind really processes information,  what factors interfere with information processing, and factors that limit information absorption.\nThis is the course you have been waiting for!\nThe one course that discusses the very important, yet completely overlooked factors, that play an important role in your ability to learn.\nAs mentioned, something must first be learned before it can be stored in memory.\nWhat are the barriers to effective learning which, in turn, affect both Short-Term and Long-Term Memory.\n\n\nJoin me on this great discovery as I share more than 30 years of research, knowledge and skill from adult education.",

Yet everything we're taught in school holds us back from actually learning.\nAnd that's why I created this course.\nWhen I took over a failing business a few years ago, I had no mentors, no boss and no one to help me. My education from a \"top 10 school\" was no help either.\nThat's when I discovered the power of books. Every question I had, there was a book with an answer. And the better I got at reading, the more frustrated I got that we're never taught how to read the right way in school.\nAnd that's why I decided to put together my course Become A Learning Machine: How To Read 300 Books This Year.\nMy goal is to share this message with as many people as possible.

      "description": "Student Success Testimonials and Reviews:\n\n\"Studying how to learn and how to love learning\n\"How to Become a Learning Machine\" is an excellent course that focuses on the practical basics of how to learn. The course teaches students about the right attitude to take when learning, the best way to absorb knowledge and how to set goals and achieve them. Thanks to my experience as a teacher, I went into the course understanding most of the concepts that Joe Parys covers. However, thanks to Joe's progressive and hybrid attitude towards learning I was able to take away some new things that have already helped me in my studies. First, Joe covers the importance of surrounding yourself with positive influence. He talks about reasons to stay away from the news. I have always stayed away from the news, but I never knew the reason. He briefly touches on this subject. The news is a source of negativity. I think that I would want to add that he did not say anything bad from gaining knowledge from reputable media like documentaries and lectures. Documentaries are a great way to open yourself to new concepts and start exploring topics of interest. Second, Joe talks about the use of audio books. He talked about how it can be a time saver and how it can supplement learning. Until taking this course, I had shunned audio books as a lazy way out of reading. However, after hearing the arguments for audio books and the reasons why it would benefit me, I immediately became a member of an audio book club. I have a 30-minute commute to work. By using this time to listen to audio books instead of listening to music, I have been able to complete some great books that help me at my job. Audiobooks during a commute are an efficient use of time and energy. The name of the course is a little misleading, but the content and subject matter of the course is top notch.\" -Dodzi D.\n\"Learning Course\nWhen I Purchased this course I was excited about it. After taking it I am even more excited! This course exceeded all of my expectations. The videos were fun, engaging, and I actually learned a lot about how to learn instead of what to learn. The concepts in this course were fascinating and the participation by the instructor is well with the price of enrolling. I can see why this instructor has lots of students in this course... Ton of value.\" -Willie\n\"Excellent and motivational!\nI really love this course because it is spot on everything I have been doing for many years. I really encourages me on where I am at and where I want to go next. Thank you Joe for making this course! Once I watched the first video I wanted to keep watching. I am two thirds through already. I really loved the quizes and questions. I'd like more of those because it really made me remember how much I love figuring these things out. For anyone who wants to be encouraged and get great advice I would take this course in a heart beat. Joe is not boring and I really like that he does all sorts of videos and not just inside a closed room. Great course that I would recommend to anyone.\" -Jamie GAMES\n\"Really got me thinking\nI love the mindset this course puts you in. It really makes me think about all of the times I had a poor mindset and attitude towards learning. Very eye opening lectures. I was impressed with the speaker and his ability to deliver learning in a fun and engaging way. I also really enjoyed the background of the videos and the structure of the course. Kept me moving and improving.

      "description": "O curso MAPAS MENTAIS | Revolução Estudo, Raciocínio e Memorização traz uma perspectiva revolucionária do uso dos Mapas Mentais. Diferente da imensa maioria das abordagens de Mapas Mentais, esse curso demonstra com uma metodologia passo a passo como funciona o raciocínio e os processos mentais envolvidos na elaboração de um Mapa Mental eficiente.\nTambém, como realizá-lo em cada situação, porque realizá-lo e quando realizá-lo. O curso é minuciosos e completo, abrangente e didático. Carrega uma visão orgânica e contextual do tema, além de ser amparado em autores e teorias consagradas, como Tony Buzan, Ivan Izquierdo e a Neurociência Cognitiva.\nA abordagem proposta no curso segue os padrões da Hackers do Estudo, que prioriza passar a técnica de modo prático, didático e com resultados marcantes: tanto na organização dos seus pensamentos, anotações em reuniões e aulas, como também, na área de estudo e memorização.\nMapas Mentais é uma estratégia de anotação/raciocínio avançada e seus princípios não são simples, pelo contrário, consistem em algo complexo para efetiva aplicação. Tratar Mapas Mentais como algo simples e fácil é sinônimo de queimar esse conteúdo e ser mais um dos tantos que olha por cima essa ferramente poderosa e não consegue usufruir de nenhum benefício dela.\nA abordagem de \"MAPAS MENTAIS|Revolução em Raciocínio, Estudo e Memorização\" é única na língua portuguesa.  Não há nenhum outro curso na nossa língua que trate o assunto da mesma forma.\nCom o aprendizado do curso, o aluno estará entrando em um território exclusivo e pouco explorado pela maioria dos indivíduos. O fato de poucas pessoas compreenderem o modo correto de usar Mapas Mentais acaba se transformando em uma imensa vantagem competitiva, tanto para provas de grande volume de conteúdo (Vestibulares, Enem, Concursos Públicos, Avaliações), como na vida acadêmia, profissional e nos estudos/memorização.\nO instrutor do curso se esforça bastante para passar todos atalhos e sua experiência prática. Trata com responsabilidade e honestidade o conteúdo, porque tem ciência que os alunos desenvolverão um molde de raciocínio que é capaz de literalmente revolucionar o modo como pensamos, organizamos ideias e entendemos memorização de longo prazo.\nTrata-se de uma jornada única, uma experiência com exercícios práticos e divertidos, uma expedição que evidenciará que existe uma maneira completamente diferente de raciocinar e enxergar/registrar informações, memorizar e formar um patrimônio intelectual\nBoa Jornada!\n\n\"A mente que se abre para uma nova ideia jamais voltará ao seu tamanho original\"\nAlbert Einstein\n\nAlgumas perguntas que serão respondidas no curso:\nComo fazer Mapas Mentais?\nQuando fazer Mapas Mentais?\nQual o passo a passo de um Mapa Mental?\nPor que fazer Mapas Mentais?\nQuais as diferenças entre Mapas Mentais para Estudo e Memorização e para Organização de Ideias e Raciocínio?\nQuais os benefícios dos Mapas Mentais?\nComo desenvolver um patrimônio intelectual com Mapas Mentais?",

The concepts and practical activities are taught in a way that's both engaging to listen to and watch, as well as to try and implement on our reading routines! Thank you for the course and knowledge!\"\nThe Improve Your Reading Speed and Comprehension course will help you become a better reader.\nWhen reading for pleasure, you will remember more of the material and engage with it in a deeper way.\nWhen reading for academic purposes, you will retain more information for quizzes, tests, and exams.  Also, you will have better access to the material for essay writing, book reports, speeches, and so on.\nBeing able to read is one thing - being able to read well and comprehend what your read is another!\nAlso, increasing your reading speed without losing the essential reading comprehension piece will bring you many rewards no matter what kind of reading you are doing.\nThis is not essentially a typical speed reading course. I want you to improve both speed and comprehension. There will be texts in your life that need to be read more slowly, and that's fine. Some material should even be read aloud. The tips here are primarily to increase speed while reading silently. Improving comprehension can slow one down at first.

You heard me right, go ahead and buy from \"my competition\". Because this is not about competition, but about you becoming the best version of yourself. And you can learn a whole bunch of valuable information about memory & study skills from each of them.\nEach of these courses are also more in-depth than mine. However, what eventually will happen is that you will know a whole bunch of study strategies, but are confused when to use which method and end up applying alomost none of the study tips out there. Maybe you are already facing this challenge right now. And that is where this course comes in. As the perfect companion to all the valuable information already out there. Teaching you the missing link of your chain. The bigger picture behind learning.\n\n\nAnd if you have read until now I would like to make you an offer:\nThis course comes with a 30-day money back guarantee. And to make the course as efficient and impactful as possible, the course is only about 1-Hour long. So order the course now, put a reminder into your calendar and watch the entire course. And if you did not receive more value than what you paid for, you return it without any regrets. With my full support doing so, because I only want to be paid if I served with more value in return.\n\n\nAnd if you are still not certain ask yourself one question:\nI agree, you could also come back in a year and still buy this course. But how are you going to feel in 1 year if you came less close to your goals than you could have?",

      "description": "Skill investing isn't something you hear a lot about.\nThere are a lot of books out there that show you how to invest your money.\nEven books on how to manage your time.\nBut none that go in depth on how to invest your combination of time, money and energy into learning information and building skills.\nThis course is about strategic thinking.\nWhat strategy are you using to invest in your skills?\nIs it a smart strategy?\nIs it a strategy you decided on? Or someone else decided for you?\nIs it just \"going with the flow?\"\n\nPeople spend lots of time and money figuring out how to invest for their future in the financial arena.\nBut they spend almost no time deciding how to invest in skills.\nSo try this thought experiment.\nHow much time do you spend each week building skills and learning in some way? Meaning time off the job when you aren't working in the traditional sense?\n3 hours?\n5 hours?\n10 hours?\nMultiply that number by 50.\nThat's about how much time you are spending in a year?\n5 hours a week? 50 weeks a year?\nThat's 250 hours.\nThat's whatever you make per hour times $250.\n$20/hour?\n$40/hour?\n$60/hour?\nLet's say $40 an hour.\nThat means you are investing $10,000 a year of your time into learning.\nAnd that doesn't even count what you are spending on books, courses, periodicals, subscriptions, etc.\nLet's tack on another thousand or two for that.\nOr don't even count it, it doesn't really matter.\n\nWhat matters is that you are investing 5 figures in your education, your skills, every single year.\nAnd you probably aren't spending any significant money or attention or time on learning HOW to do it.\nThis course teaches you how.\nIt teaches you how to think very strategically about 3 things.\nFirst, where you are. Who are you? What are your current skills? What are your aptitudes? Personality? Interests? Likes and dislikes?\nAll that is important.\nSecond, where is the world? Where is the demand? Where is the competition? Where is the excitement? Where are there untapped opportunities? Where is the future headed? Who is going to be left behind?\nThat's critical, skills aren't valuable unless they can be used to create something of value, almost always that means for other people, and for a business of some kind.\nThird, how do you integrate the two? How do you measure the value? How do you allocate your resources? Your time, money, energy, etc?\nYou will go through these 3 stages in the course. By the end you will have a much more strategic perspective on how you should be investing in your skills for the future.\nYou have easily 4, probably 5 figures riding on your investments every single year.\nIs it time to get more strategic about how you are investing in your skills?\nIf so, I'll see you inside the course.\n-Timothy",

      "description": "Intelligence is part of the Nature of any Human Being. We all have unlimited cognitive abilities. Our Brain is able to learn anything we want. When they say that Intelligence is the privilege of some, this is nothing more than a lie. We are capable, our Brain is capable. No matter our ethnicity, age, race, social status, or whatever, we are able to learn whatever we want.\nWhat prevents us from increasing our innate capacity are barriers of the unconscious. These barriers happen because of some flaw that we have committed in the past, and because of that, we are labeled as incapable. Not only that. When we see a classmate doing better than we do at school, we find that we have been deprived of intelligence and that is steeped in our Subconscious Mind, and by the time we reach adulthood, that mind executes what we programmed throughout our childhood, and since then , we find it difficult to learn.\nThe \"Super Intelligence\" Project aims to break these mental barriers and take you to another level, the level where we can all learn anything. In this Project you will do exercises that will stimulate your Pre Frontal Cortex that is responsible for our learning and intelligence. In addition, you will have the specific Isochronic Wave to activate this brain part for you to increase your cognitive ability.\nIn addition to the Isocronics, we have the Solfegios that will work intensely in your Subconscious to eliminate, as a nuclear bomb, any and all mental barrier that prevents you from increasing your innate ability, that is, increasing your intelligence.\n\n\nHere you can have the following benefits with the isocronic:\nIncrease Brain Capacity;\nHave the chance to learn more easily;\nLearn More Quickly;\nIncrease Your Self-Esteem;\nLearning something New;\nLearn a new Language;\nAnd much more;\n\n\nThe Solfeggios, which in this case also works as a support, will bring the benefits:\nIt will eliminate the guilty feelings of the past for some failure committed;\nIt will put you in tune with your Higher Self and show your innate ability;\nYou will find it easier to socialize with other people;\nEmotional intelligence;\nElimination of stagnant energies that impede learning;\nAnd several other benefits of these frequencies;\n\n\nThe Isochronic, in addition to acting directly on the Pre Frontal Cortex, serves as a guide for the Solfeggios to act on what is deep within their Subconscious.\n\n\nNext, see the performance of each Solfeggios Frequency in conjunction with the Isochronic Beta 14Hz:\n174Hz - This frequency will aim to give your Brain a sense of security;\n285Hz - Send messages to your power field to restructure any problems you have in your body;\n396Hz - It will release you from the feeling of Guilt or Fear that you have acquired in the past and that have prevented you from increasing your Cognitive Ability;\n417Hz - Cleaning of any mental limitations;\n528Hz - Increased Mental Clarity;\n639Hz - Ability to relate to others in a harmonious way;\n741Hz - This frequency will lead you to a pure and stable life;\n852Hz - Breakdowns that prevent you from communicating with your Higher Self;\n963Hz - Here you experience your true Nature, that is, your Inborn Capacity;\n\n\nThese frequencies quoted above are potentialized through the Visualization Power that are taught in the exercises in this project. So enjoy every moment, open yourself to these powerful frequencies and see with your own eyes the size of your ability.\nYou are capable and this is an indisputable fact. You can achieve any goal you want and it depends solely and solely on your will power to want. There is no impossibility for our brain. Our brain is an unlimited Human Computer capable of solving anything.\n\n\nPay close attention: \"What is possible for a person, is possible for anyone.\"\n\n\nKeep that phrase in your Subconscious Mind and use it whenever you feel it is necessary. That's all because you're capable. The miracle is just beginning!\n\n\nSee you soon!\n\n\nA Little About Evandro Angotti:\nBefore you talk about me, I want to make it clear that my only real intention is to help people. Today I was able to wake up and be happy to know that I am with this wonderful Project in 18 countries. I could not go that far if it were not for you. So, please stay here registered my gratitude for your life. I wish the Universe would grant you everything you want for your life. May you achieve all your goals. You are free to contact me ASAP.\nI have more than 10 years of experience in Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Isocronic Waves, Binaural and Solfeggios, Quantum Physics (Law of Attraction) and Personal and Spiritual Development. I have helped and continue to help thousands of people, now around the world. I feel fulfilled. I believe my purpose in life is coming to fruition as I see, people like you, achieving their goals. For me, it would be worthless, if this does not happen, it's worth nothing if you do not reach your goal.\nAnd finally, pay close attention: I am able to help you reprogram whatever you want into your life. But it all depends on you.\n\n\nNote: As already mentioned, despite having some important information, this project is not about a course, but about frequencies that you will use for 27 days to do a Mental Reprogramming.\nNote²: Each Project made available here in the Udemy Platform has its purpose. Each of them takes a certain amount of time for its complexity in development. In addition, I try to improve every day to deliver all of them with the best possible quality. If you are interested in developing in other areas, look for other projects, which I thought of you to do. Gratitude!!",

      "description": "Hands-On Experiential Skills, not just Theory!\nPeople who are keen observers naturally get many social benefits because of their high mind-reading motivation (MRM), and should use it for networking and leading teams at workplace, suggest researchers.\nMRM is a newly coined term for the practice of observing and interpreting bits of social information. It is the tendency to engage with the mental states and perspectives of others.  “We’re not talking about the psychic phenomenon or anything like that but simply using cues from other people’s behavior, their non-verbal signals, to try to figure out what they’re thinking,”\nIn addition to facilitating cooperation and better teamwork, people high in mind-reading motivation (MRM) also consider people in great detail and have a nuanced understanding of those around them.\nThere is a difference between focus, attention and concentration. It's important to know the differences and how to use each and every one -focus, attention, concentration- to be able to ignore the distractions around you and to focus on what's important.\n\n\nWhat people are saying:\n\"I hope people catch on to what’s happening here with these particular classes because it’s something very special. Unlike anything else I’ve encountered so far. Higher-level content. I’m still new but what I can say is, in general, watch/listen to these guidance repeatedly. Let it wash over you and maybe as you do you can enjoy just wondering what it might be like to experience something new, something expansive, the sort of thing that most everyone truly wants at a deeper level. You’ll see, you’ll know.\" Christopher J, USA\n\n\n\"I can see how being focused from higher mind allows me better and more accurate insight. The higher mind is more complex with more clarity. We need to learn to relax and clear our minds. When I focus on quieter thoughts I achieve more insight and a clearer mind; becoming self aware and adapting to this new and clearer way of thinking is a necessity. It's interesting that when I focus on an image how the mind knows how to concentrate better. It's nice to be so relaxed and at ease. Becoming more self aware and being more present surely adds to confidence.\" Natalia S, USA",

      "description": "Cultivate more self awareness and take back control of your mind and emotions!\nLet’s pretend that ADHD is a super power and that the individual just needs tools in order to learn to use it constructively! It’s not that those of us with ADHD can’t focus; we have hyper focus for the things that we enjoy. However, when we are required to do things that we don’t necessarily enjoy, we allow our minds to wander. Yes, we allow this to happen.\nGaining control of your random, wandering mind and inability to focus begins with learning to be present. Learning to be present and control your mind takes specific tools and active practice. To do this, we need the knowledge of how to approach it, the science of why it works and what techniques to use for success. From there we learn to laser point our focus and reduce, or all out annihilate, the symptoms of ADHD and Anxiety.\nBreath is an incredibly powerful, and often overlooked, tool in our ability to use focus and reduce anxiety. Breath is also something that is within our complete control. Knowing how, why and what techniques to use gives you the power to be your own hero.\nThrough specific breathing techniques, curated for ADHD, this course teaches you to control your mind and emotions instead of them controlling you. We will cover a number of different breathwork & focus techniques and nuances that are proven to enhance cognitive function, raise the necessary neurotransmitters and empower the individual.\nThis course is designed to be done one technique per day (maybe two) until it is moved through completely - also headphones are recommended.\nThis course is NOT designed to diagnose, treat or cure any illness. If you are pregnant or have high uncontrolled blood pressure, please consult your doctor before engaging in this course.\n\n\nA bit of wisdom:\nThe mind is a great servant and a bad master.",

      "description": "Mas com o avanço da tecnologia e o surgimento de uma infinidade de aparelhos e recursos digitais, infelizmente o interesse das pessoas pela leitura tem diminuído dia após dia.\n\nO mais engraçado disso tudo é que nunca lemos tanto como lemos hoje. É só pensar em quantas mensagens, e-mails, artigos de blogs ou sites e posts de redes sociais que lemos todos os dias. Sem dúvida isso é algo bom, pois de uma forma ou de outra nós estamos lendo.\nA quantidade da leitura aumentou exponencialmente, isso é um fato, mas a qualidade da leitura não acompanhou esse crescimento. E é aí que começam os problemas.\nOi! Eu sou Ismar Souza e este é o curso Estratégias de Leitura para Ler e Compreender Melhor, e eu tenho uma pergunta para você: EM UMA ESCALA DE 1 A 10, QUAL É SEU NÍVEL DE APROVEITAMENTO AO LER UM LIVRO?\nHmmm, talvez você nunca tenha pensado sobre isso. Ou pior, talvez você tenha respondido que tem um nível de aproveitamento maior do que a realidade. O que me diz?\nEscuta isso, em 2015, o site da câmara dos deputados noticiou que apenas 25% dos cidadãos brasileiros alfabetizados podem ser considerados leitores plenos, ou seja, pessoas que são capazes de entender qualquer tipo de texto. Você sabia disso?\nIsso significa que 3 entre 4 pessoas não conseguem entender claramente aquilo que leem. Será que você é uma dessas pessoas?\nVeja só o tamanho do problema que temos aqui!\nO que me deixa mais tranquilo é que se você está me ouvindo agora é porque está buscando alguma forma de melhorar seu nível de aproveitamento da leitura. E é justamente sobre isso que vamos tratar neste curso!\nNa década de 1980, um famoso filósofo e escritor norte-americano chamado Mortimer Adler escreveu um livro chamado \"Como Ler Livros\".\nTalvez você nunca tenha ouvido falar desse cara, mas acontece que esse livro ficou conhecido como o guia definitivo da leitura inteligente, se tornando a maior referência mundial no assunto.\nMas por que estou falando disso?\nSimples, é porque meu curso foi inspirado neste livro, e aqui você vai encontrar os principais conceitos desse guia e várias outras dicas super bacanas para melhorar sua leitura!\nBem, mas o que você vai aprender neste curso?\nNeste curso você vai descobrir que existem vários níveis de leitura. Mas fique tranquilo porque eu vou te dizer quando e como aplicar cada um deles. Ok?\nVocê também vai descobrir como funciona e como se aplica a leitura ativa de forma eficiente, o que vai aumentar muito sua capacidade de compreensão.\n\nAlém disso, você vai aprender a classificar um livro, a identificar as palavras e frases mais importantes do texto, a reconhecer, interpretar e criticar  a mensagem do autor.\n\nAh! Você também vai descobrir como economizar um tempo precioso selecionando os livros certos para leitura, e descobrir o assunto principal do livro muito mais rápido.\nTudo isso com uma linguagem clara, objetiva e bem simples de entender!\nEsse curso é 100% online, e você pode acessar todas as aulas a qualquer momento e de onde estiver, usando o seu computador, tablet ou smartphone.\nE pode ficar tranquilo, pois você tem 30 dias de garantia, se por qualquer motivo você não se sentir satisfeito pode pedir o reembolso e receber o seu dinheiro de volta.\nEntão não perca mais tempo, se matricule neste curso agora mesmo para conhecer Estratégias de Leitura que vão te ajudar a ler e Compreender muito Melhor.\nTe espero no curso. Até lá!",

      "description": "The most important promise of this course is that you can become a SUPER LEARNER . Whether you know it or not, you already have the capacity to memorize entire books. All it takes is a little motivation and a method to facilitate your learning.\nIn this course, I present my own original and extremely efficient method for learning any kind of information, a very versatile method that combines the most efficient memory techniques.\nI created this method after many years in which I had to learn a lot of abstract and highly diversified information. At one point, I asked myself the question: \"How could I approach in a unitary way the memorization of any kind of information, whether it is a biology essay or a philosophy book? What are the universal steps of any learning process and how can I adapt them to any type of material that I have to learn?\"\nThe answer came when I began to study and practice the memory techniques. I discovered that, by combining these techniques, not only did the learning process become faster, but at the same time the learned information remained much longer stored in my memory.\nOver time, I became a proactive learner and I synthesized a series of steps that transformed my learning into a pleasant and extremely effective experience.\nThere is a method—a formula, if you will—behind any ultra-efficient learning.\nAnd that’s what this course is about: taking you behind the curtain and showing you that formula.\nThis great learning tool, that I have named \"the SCALM technique\", is extremely effective because of its versatility. It can be applied to any type of material you will have to remember.\nBy following a series of clear steps and simple rules for memorizing different types of information, the SCALM method brings a systematic approach to a task that seems difficult for all of us: memorizing hundreds of pages of horribly abstract , unattractive and unrelated information.\n*                   *                  *\nI have to tell you from the beginning that this is not a theoretical course. Although I will try to explain in detail each concept and each step of this simple method, I hope this course will not seem very theoretical to you. I added as many examples as possible to help you better understand how the method works.\nYou might view this course as an opportunity to improve your proactive learning abilities and to add to your learning toolset an invaluable technique.\nThis course is an investment in your future!\nEnroll now and get lifetime access!\n\n\nChris M Nemo\nMemory Improvement Writer and Blogger at The Mnemo Bay",

Your memory of names, faces, dates, events, data, details and other things concerning the day-to-day life is the measure of your ability to survive in today's fast-paced, information-dependent society. With a good memory, you don't have to fear forgetting/misplacing important things and you can overcome mental barriers that restrict you from achieving a successful career and personal life.\nIn most cases, poor memory is due to lack of attention or concentration, insufficient listening skills, and other inherent habits. Memory is like a muscle - the more it is used, the better it gets. The more it is neglected, the worse it gets; however, it can be honed and developed using the right methods which we will see in this course.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS THIS COURSE ABOUT?\n\"Memory Improvement: Key Techniques To Improve Your Memory\" course is all about boosting your memory skills using key memory principles, proven memory tools and memory techniques.

      "description": "Memory Castle: Create Mental Worlds That Remember for You\nMemory Castle- Turn Your Imagination Into A Powerful Memory System Using Ancient Techniques Trusted By Memory Champions\nLet me ask you a question, and I want you to answer it honestly.\nHave you ever felt a flash of panic when your mind goes completely blank?\nPerhaps it was in a high-stakes exam, where a crucial formula you spent hours studying vanished into thin air. Maybe it was during a presentation, when you lost your train of thought in front of your boss and colleagues, the silence stretching for an eternity. Or maybe it was something simpler, but just as frustrating—forgetting the name of a person whose hand you were still shaking, or staring at your grocery list, knowing you forgot the one thing you actually needed.\nFor most of us, this isn't a rare occurrence. It's a daily, nagging reality.\nWe live in an age of unprecedented information overload. We are bombarded by facts, figures, tasks, and notifications, all competing for a sliver of our mental real estate. Our brains, struggling to keep up, feel slow, cluttered, and unreliable. We dismiss it as \"brain fog,\" a natural part of aging, or we resign ourselves to the idea that we just have a \"bad memory.\"\nBut what if that's not the truth? What if having a \"bad memory\" is a myth?\nWhat if the frustrating, embarrassing, and opportunity-costing moments of forgetfulness are not a symptom of a failing brain, but a symptom of using the wrong system to access your brain's true power?\nImagine, for a moment, a different reality.\nImagine walking into any room, meeting ten new people, and an hour later, being able to address every single one of them by name, effortlessly.\nImagine standing in front of an audience, with no notes and no slides, and delivering a powerful, persuasive, hour-long presentation, simply by taking a walk through a beautiful location in your own mind.\nImagine studying for an exam and feeling a sense of calm, creative engagement instead of stressful, repetitive cramming. Imagine being able to recall entire chapters of a textbook, complex scientific formulas, and long lists of historical dates as easily as you recall the layout of your own home.\nThis is not a fantasy. This is not a superpower reserved for a gifted few.\nThis is a skill. It is a trainable, learnable, and life-altering system that has been used for over 2,500 years by the world's greatest thinkers, orators, and memory champions.\nIt is the art of the Memory Castle.\nAnd this course is your key to becoming its master architect.\nWelcome to the Only Memory Training Course You Will Ever Need.\nThis isn't just another collection of \"memory tips\" or recycled brain hacks you can find on the internet. This is a world-class masterclass designed from the ground up to be the most comprehensive, practical, and transformative program on the planet for mastering your memory.\nWe are going on a journey together, a structured adventure that will take you from a complete beginner, perhaps someone who believes they have a \"terrible memory,\" and systematically build you into a confident, capable master of this ancient art.\nYou will learn to turn your imagination—the most powerful, yet underutilized, resource you possess—into a flawlessly organized, infinitely expandable, and perfectly reliable memory system. You will construct beautiful, intricate mental worlds, or \"Memory Castles,\" where information is not just stored, but brought to life.\nIn these castles, abstract facts and boring data are transformed into vivid, multi-sensory, and unforgettable experiences. Numbers, names, languages, entire books, and complex skills will no longer be things you struggle to remember; they will be landmarks on a map that you know by heart.\nThis course is designed for deep, permanent transformation. By the time you have completed this journey, you will not have just learned about the Memory Castle technique; you will have a fully functioning mental empire at your command.\nIs This Memory Castle: Memory Training Course for You? Let's Be Clear.\nThis masterclass has been meticulously designed for a few specific types of people. See if you recognize yourself in any of these descriptions.\nThe Ambitious Student. You're in high school, college, or graduate school. Your success depends on your ability to absorb and recall vast amounts of information, often under immense pressure. You've spent countless nights staring at textbooks, making flashcards, and highlighting notes, only to feel that sinking feeling during an exam when the answer just won't come. You're tired of the stress, the anxiety, and the feeling that your grades don't reflect your true effort. This course is your path to academic dominance. You will learn not just how to pass your exams, but how to master your subjects, cutting your study time in half while dramatically increasing your retention and confidence.\nThe Career-Focused Professional. You operate in a competitive world where knowledge, confidence, and relationships are everything. You've felt the sting of forgetting a key client's name or a crucial data point in a meeting. You've envied the leaders who can speak with authority and charisma, seemingly without any notes. You want to be that person. This course is your professional accelerator. It will equip you with the skills to build unshakable professional confidence, network like a master connector, learn new industry skills with astonishing speed, and position yourself as the expert in your field.\nThe Lifelong Learner & Personal Growth Enthusiast. Your curiosity knows no bounds. You dream of speaking a new language fluently, mastering a musical instrument, or diving deep into subjects like history, philosophy, or science. But you feel limited by your ability to retain what you learn. The excitement of starting something new often fades into the frustration of forgetting. This course is your key to unlocking your true learning potential. It will turn learning from a frustrating chore into a creative, joyful, and deeply rewarding game, allowing you to pursue any passion with the confidence that what you learn will stick.\nAnyone Feeling Overwhelmed by \"Brain Fog.\" You feel like you're living in a state of constant mental clutter. You misplace your keys, forget appointments, struggle to focus in a world of digital distractions, and worry that your mind isn't as sharp as it once was. You crave clarity, focus, and a sense of control over your own mind. This course is your blueprint for a total mental reset. It will teach you how to cut through the noise, organize your thoughts, and build a mind that is not only more memorable but also sharper, clearer, and more resilient.\nIf you saw yourself in any of those descriptions, then you are in the right place. This journey was designed for you.\nThe Transformation: What Your Mind Will Be Able to Do\nThis isn't about incremental improvements. It's about a quantum leap in your cognitive abilities. Let's paint a clearer picture of the tangible skills you will possess.\nYou will learn to Design and Build Powerful, Customized Memory Castles from Scratch. Forget abstract theories. You will get your hands dirty from the very beginning. We will guide you, step-by-step, through the process of selecting the perfect mental blueprint, plotting a flawless and unbreakable journey, and identifying unforgettable memory \"hooks\" or \"loci.\" You will learn to construct these magnificent structures from the familiar layout of your own home, from your workplace, or even from purely virtual spaces born from your imagination. Your mind will become a landscape of your own design, with infinite room to build.\nYou will learn to Turn Boring Data into Unforgettable Adventures. This is the alchemist's secret. A fact is forgettable. A story is forever. You will master the art of turning the most dry, boring, and abstract information—a number, a name, a date, a formula—into a bizarre, hilarious, multi-sensory, and emotionally charged mental cartoon. You will learn the Three Pillars of Unforgettable Scenes (Action, Emotion, Exaggeration) and the Symbolism Shortcut that makes abstract concepts tangible. This is where memory stops being a chore and becomes an act of boundless creativity.\nYou will learn to Apply Your Skills to Any Real-World Challenge. A powerful memory is useless if it stays in the realm of theory. This masterclass is relentlessly focused on practical application. You will learn:\nThe Name Game Assassin technique to remember the names and faces of everyone you meet, effortlessly.\nThe Presentation Secret to deliver powerful speeches and talks entirely from memory, freeing you to connect with your audience.\nThe Language Learner's Edge to master new vocabulary and complex grammar rules with astonishing speed.\nThe Exam Dominator system to systematically encode entire textbooks for total recall.\nThe Skill Acquisition Accelerator to build mental maps of new skills, allowing you to learn them in a fraction of the time.\nYou will learn to Master Advanced Systems for Numbers, Books, and Entire Subjects. This course takes you far beyond the basics. You will master:\nThe Major System, the gold standard for memorizing any sequence of numbers, from phone numbers to financial data to Pi.\nThe Nested Castle Principle, a sophisticated method for storing the entire contents of a book, chapter by chapter, in a single, organized castle.\nThe Mind Castle Room System, a technique for creating detailed profiles of complex topics, perfect for comparative analysis and deep subject mastery.\nYou will learn to Cultivate the Champion's Mindset. A powerful memory isn't just about techniques; it's about the mind that wields them. You will learn how to overcome the mental blocks, self-doubt, and perfectionism that sabotage most learners. You will develop the focus, confidence, and playful creativity of a memory champion, transforming not just what your mind can do, but how you feel about your own intellectual power. You will rewire your brain for sharper focus, deeper thinking, and enhanced creativity.\nA Journey Through Your Transformation: What to Expect Inside\nThis masterclass is a meticulously structured journey, divided into six transformative stages. Each stage builds upon the last, taking you seamlessly from novice to grandmaster.\nStage 1: The Architect's Awakening: Unlocking Your Brain's Visual Supercomputer\nYour journey begins not with a difficult, abstract exercise, but with a series of profound \"aha!\" moments that will fundamentally reshape your entire relationship with your own mind. This is the foundation. Before we ever build a single wall of your first Memory Castle, we must first reveal the incredible power of the architect—you. You'll discover that your brain is already a natural memory machine and that you've been using its most powerful principles your whole life without realizing it. We will shatter the \"Forgetting Curve\" myth that has caused so much frustration for learners everywhere, revealing the true reason we forget and how to defeat it permanently. You will master the single most powerful memory principle—The Law of Association—and finally learn how to \"see\" with your mind's eye, even if you firmly believe you can't visualize. This initial stage lays the unshakeable foundation for everything to come, rewiring your entire understanding of what memory is and what you are capable of. Inside Stage 1, you will experience a fundamental shift as you master these core principles, lecture by lecture:\nWhy Your Brain is Already a \"Memory Castle\" (And You Don't Even Know It) This is the first, and perhaps most important, revelation of the entire course. We begin by proving to you that you are already an expert in the core skill of this ancient art. When you mentally walk from your front door to your kitchen, you are effortlessly accessing a complex, detailed spatial map—a natural Memory Castle. We’ll dive into the neuroscience behind this, exploring the role of your hippocampus and its \"place cells\" that act as your brain's built-in GPS. You will understand that this isn't a new skill you have to learn from scratch, but an innate, evolutionary superpower you simply need to learn how to harness. This lecture removes the biggest barrier to entry—the fear that this is too difficult—and replaces it with the exhilarating realization that you are already 90% of the way to mastery.\nThe \"Forgetting Curve\" Myth: The Real Reason We Forget Things Every student and learner has felt the crushing frustration of the Forgetting Curve—the feeling that your brain is a leaky bucket, losing information as fast as you pour it in. In this critical lecture, we will shatter that myth. You will learn that forgetting is not a bug in your brain; it's a feature. It’s an efficiency mechanism designed to discard boring, disconnected, and seemingly unimportant information. We will expose why traditional study methods like rote repetition are a direct fight against your brain's natural wiring. More importantly, you will learn how to bypass this filter entirely. You'll discover how to make any piece of information so interesting, so meaningful, and so richly connected that your brain has no choice but to flag it as \"critical\" and hold onto it for the long term. You will no longer be a victim of the curve; you will be its master.\nThe Single Most Powerful Memory Training Principle: The Law of Association If your memory has an operating system, this is it. In this lecture, we unlock the master key to all learning and recall: the Law of Association. You will understand that nothing is ever remembered in isolation. Every memory is a link in a chain. We will show you how to stop trying to hammer new facts into your mind through brute force and instead learn the elegant art of \"linking\"—effortlessly attaching new, unfamiliar information to the strong, stable anchors that already exist in your mind. You'll learn why a single, creative association made in three seconds can be more powerful than an hour of mindless repetition. This principle is the engine that drives every technique in this course, and mastering it will change how you approach learning forever.\nVisualization 101: How to See With Your Mind's Eye (Even If You Think You Can't) \"But I'm not a visual person.\" This is the most common roadblock people face, and in this lecture, we dismantle it completely. You will discover that visualization is not about seeing a high-definition movie in your head. It is the simple, natural act of conceptualizing information in a non-verbal way—a skill you use every single day. We will guide you through simple but powerful exercises that prove you have this ability in spades. You will learn the difference between \"seeing\" and \"knowing\" and how to build rich, multi-sensory images that engage not just your mind's eye, but its ear, its nose, and its sense of touch. This lecture turns the biggest perceived weakness into a reliable, trainable muscle.\nThe #1 Mistake Beginners Make: The \"Passive Observer\" Trap Why do some people try memory techniques and fail? This lecture reveals the secret reason. You will learn to avoid the single biggest pitfall that traps aspiring mnemonists: the \"Passive Observer\" trap. We will show you the crucial difference between being a distant audience member to your memories and being the active, hands-on director of your own mental movie. You will learn why you must mentally interact with your images—exaggerating them, animating them, and even \"vandalizing\" your own mental locations—to make them stick. Mastering this one tiny shift in approach is the difference between a memory that fades in minutes and one that lasts a lifetime.\nActivating Your Spatial Genius: The GPS In Your Head In this culminating lecture for Stage 1, we bring everything together and switch on your internal supercomputer. You will learn how to consciously activate and navigate the sophisticated \"GPS\" in your brain, the system that effortlessly maps your world. We will cover the practical rules for creating stable, reliable mental journeys—how to establish a consistent perspective, why movement is the key, and how to utilize three-dimensional space to create more memory slots. You will learn to trust your intuitive sense of place, freeing yourself from the need for notes or diagrams. By the end of this first stage, your perspective will be permanently altered. You will no longer see your mind as a mysterious black box, but as a tangible, navigable, and infinitely powerful space that you are about to build into an empire.\n\n\nStage 2: Forging the Foundation: Your First Unforgettable Journey\nTheory is nothing without action. In Stage 1, you awakened the architect. In Stage 2, you will be handed the blueprints, the tools, and the materials to lay the foundation of your first magnificent structure. This is where the abstract becomes concrete, where potential becomes power. You will roll up your sleeves and build your very first Memory Castle, a real, functional, and reliable mental tool that you will use to achieve your first exhilarating win. We will guide you through choosing the perfect mental \"blueprint,\" plotting an unbreakable path, and identifying your first set of powerful \"loci\" or memory hooks. You'll also be equipped with the \"Pegword\" system, a powerful complementary technique for quick-access memory. This stage is all about building unstoppable momentum, proving to yourself beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can do this, and creating a solid foundation upon which your entire mental empire will be built.\nHow to Choose the Perfect \"Blueprint\" For Your First Castle The success of your first build depends entirely on the quality of your foundation. A skyscraper needs to be built on solid bedrock, and your first Memory Castle is no different. In this lecture, you will learn the critical criteria for selecting the perfect mental location—one that guarantees a smooth and successful experience. We will guide you to choose a place of deep familiarity (almost certainly your own home), a space your brain has already mapped with incredible detail over thousands of hours. You'll learn why a real, known place is infinitely superior to an imaginary one for your first build, as it provides an unshakable feeling of stability and reality. We’ll show you what to look for: a logical, natural path and a wealth of distinct features that can serve as memory hooks. This lecture removes all guesswork and ensures you begin your construction on the most solid ground possible.\nThe \"Unbreakable Path\": Plotting a Flawless Mental Journey A castle without a path is just a collection of rooms; the journey through it is what turns it into a powerful, sequential memory system. This is where you learn to plot a flawless mental route that is impossible to forget and removes any chance of getting lost. We will give you a set of simple but unbreakable rules that the masters use: always starting and ending your journey outside, following the natural flow of the space, and, crucially, navigating each room in a consistent clockwise (or counter-clockwise) direction. This simple system makes the journey itself automatic, freeing up all your cognitive power for the creative act of placing your memories. You will map out your first 10-stop journey, a path that will soon become as familiar and automatic as your own signature.\nYour First Five \"Loci\": Identifying Unforgettable Memory Training Hooks Now that you have a path, you need to identify the specific stops along the way. These are your \"loci,\" the memory hooks where your information will live. You will learn that a great locus is not just a vague space (\"the kitchen\"), but a specific, concrete, and memorable object (\"the cold, steel handle of the refrigerator door\"). We will guide you through selecting your first five official loci, analyzing them for their strength and \"interact-ability\"—the secret ingredient that allows you to create truly dynamic mental scenes. You'll learn why to avoid clutter and ambiguity, and how to use the \"mental snapshot\" technique to make each locus stand out as a clear and distinct anchor in your mind.\nThe Pegword Primer: Your First Digital Filing System for Ideas The Memory Castle is the king of memory systems, but a true master has more than one tool in their arsenal. In this lecture, we will equip you with the Pegword system—a brilliantly simple and creative technique that is perfect for memorizing short, numbered lists on the fly. You will learn the classic \"One is a Bun, Two is a Shoe, Three is a Tree...\" pegs, a system so simple it takes only minutes to master. We'll show you how this verbal, rhyming system differs from your spatial castle and when to use it for maximum effect. It's like adding a high-speed, quick-access filing cabinet to your mental office, making you a more flexible and versatile mental athlete.\nYour First Real Test: Memorizing a Shopping List, Effortlessly This is the moment of truth. Theory, rules, and techniques all come together as you apply your new skills to a practical, real-world challenge: memorizing a shopping list. We will guide you, step-by-step, as you take each item on the list and place it as a vivid, bizarre, and interactive scene within your newly built 5-locus castle. You will experience the thrill of active, creative encoding. Then comes the magic moment: the mental review walk. You will close your eyes, walk your mental path, and be astonished as each image—and its corresponding item—appears in your mind's eye, in perfect sequence, without any effort. This is the lecture where belief transforms into absolute certainty. You will know, not just think, that this system works.\nWhy This Tiny Shift Changes Everything: Reviewing vs Re-Walking You've successfully memorized your first list. But how do you make memories permanent? This final lecture of Stage 2 reveals a secret that separates amateurs from masters. We will show you why the traditional method of \"reviewing\"—passively re-reading notes—is inefficient and weak. You will learn the new, far superior method of \"re-walking\"—actively taking a stroll through your Memory Castle. You'll understand the profound power of \"retrieval practice\" and how each mental walk strengthens not just the information you stored, but the very structure of the castle itself. This tiny shift in your approach to review is what makes knowledge stick for a lifetime, turning review from a painful chore into a fast, creative, and empowering act of mental exploration.\n\n\nStage 3: The Alchemist's Secret: Turning Boring Data Into Golden Memories\nThis is where the true magic begins. You've built the physical structure of your castle; now you will learn the alchemist's art of turning the leaden, forgettable data of daily life into golden, unforgettable memories. This stage is a deep dive into the creative heart of the memory arts. You will activate your \"Imagination Engine\" and discover the profound, scientifically-backed reasons why being weird, absurd, and emotional is the secret to a perfect memory. We will move far beyond simple visualization and into the realm of rich, multi-sensory creation. You will master the Three Pillars of Unforgettable Scenes—Action, Emotion, and Exaggeration—and learn the vital Symbolism Shortcut for encoding abstract concepts that have previously been impossible to hold onto. By the end of this stage, you will wield the creative power to make any piece of information so vivid and so \"sticky\" that your brain will refuse to let it go. No fact, figure, or concept will ever seem \"boring\" to you again.\nPrepare to unlock your inner creative genius with these transformative lessons:\nThe Imagination Engine: How To Make Any Image Instantly \"Sticky\" Why do we remember a strange dream from years ago but forget a password we created yesterday? The answer lies in your brain's powerful \"novelty detector.\" In this lecture, you will learn how to deliberately hijack this system to your advantage. You'll discover how to craft images that are instantly \"sticky\" by violating expectations, personifying inanimate objects, and injecting humor into everything you want to remember. We will give you a simple but powerful formula to ensure every image you create is so engaging that your brain is compelled to pay attention. This is where you learn to work with your brain's natural tendencies, not against them, turning your imagination into a high-performance engine for memory creation.\nThe Multi-Sensory Hook: Going Beyond Sight to Smell, Sound, and Touch Most people try to remember things with only one sense: sight. This is like trying to enjoy a feast by only looking at it. A master of memory creates an immersive, 360-degree experience. In this lecture, you will learn how to forge powerful \"multi-sensory hooks\" that anchor your memories with incredible strength. You’ll learn to add a rich soundtrack to your mental scenes, to feel the texture and temperature of your imagined objects, and to incorporate the potent power of smell—the sense most directly wired to your brain's memory and emotion centers. You will discover that a memory encoded with three or four senses is exponentially more durable than a memory encoded with one.\nUnlocking the Power of The Absurd: Why Weird is Wonderful for Memory Prepare to unlearn a lifetime of conventional thinking. In the world of memory, logic is the enemy. Sense and reason are the fast track to forgetting. In this paradigm-shifting lecture, you will unlock the incredible power of the absurd. We will explore the science behind why bizarre, illogical, and even surreal images are so effective—a principle known as the Von Restorff effect. You will be given permission to break the laws of physics, to think like a surrealist artist, and to let your imagination run wild. You will learn that the weirder the image, the stronger the memory. This lesson is liberating, fun, and it is the absolute key to making your memories truly permanent.\nAction, Emotion, Exaggeration: The Three Pillars of Unforgettable Scenes How can you consistently create powerful images, every single time, without guesswork? In this lecture, we distill the entire creative process into three simple, unforgettable pillars: Action, Emotion, and Exaggeration. You will learn why a static image is a dead image and how to inject every scene with powerful, dynamic verbs. You'll discover how to use emotion as the \"neurological glue\" that makes memories stick. And you will master the art of exaggeration, pushing your scenes beyond the limits of reality to make them impossible for your brain to ignore. These three pillars will become your personal mantra, a reliable checklist to ensure every memory you forge is of the highest possible quality.\nThe Symbolism Shortcut: How to Encode Abstract Concepts into Concrete Images This lecture solves the single biggest challenge for most learners: \"How do I remember things I can't see?\" We will equip you with the Symbolism Shortcut, the master key for encoding abstract concepts like \"justice,\" \"economy,\" or \"freedom\" into concrete, visual images. You will learn how to act as a \"mental translator,\" turning intangible ideas into tangible objects. We will also reveal the powerful phonetic link technique, a method for turning complex names, jargon, and vocabulary into simple, sound-alike pictures. This is the lecture that closes the gap between memorizing simple lists and mastering complex, abstract subjects.\nFrom Data to Drama: Weaving a Story Through Your Memory Castle In this final lecture of Stage 3, you will elevate your skills to a new level of sophistication. You will learn to go beyond placing individual, disconnected images in your castle and instead weave them together into a continuous story. We'll introduce the \"Link Method,\" showing you how to make each scene flow seamlessly into the next, creating a high-drama mental movie that unfolds as you walk your journey. This narrative approach creates a \"chain reaction of recall,\" a powerful backup system that makes your memories even more robust and fail-proof. You will graduate from being a mental architect to being the master storyteller of your own mind.\n\n\nStage 4: Beyond Rooms and Routes: Building Your Mental Empire\nWith your foundations secure and your creative engine firing on all cylinders, it is time to scale. A single castle is a powerful fortress, but a true master of memory does not live in a single fortress; they rule an empire. In this stage, you will learn the advanced strategies required to expand your mental real estate from a single building into a sprawling, interconnected, and flawlessly organized empire of knowledge. You will learn the expansion strategy for building and linking multiple castles, the agile \"Micro-Castle\" technique for on-the-go memory needs, and the \"Virtual Castle\" gambit for creating infinite memory space from pure imagination. You will also learn the crucial principles of advanced castle management to catalogue, maintain, and even reuse your mental worlds, and the incredible Nested Castle Principle that allows you to store entire books within a single location. This is where you graduate from being a builder to a true information architect, capable of managing vast quantities of information with ease and elegance.\nIn this advanced stage, you will learn the strategies of the grandmasters to construct a true mental empire:\nThe Expansion Strategy: How to Build and Link Multiple Castles What happens when you need to master history, learn a programming language, and memorize all your business plans? One castle is not enough. In this lecture, you will learn the grand strategy for expanding your memory capacity to handle any number of subjects. We'll show you how to build a portfolio of thematic castles—a \"Work Castle\" in your office, a \"Language Castle\" in a virtual villa—to keep your knowledge perfectly organized and prevent any cross-contamination of ideas. Crucially, you will learn how to create vivid, multi-sensory \"portals\" that allow you to travel instantly from one castle to another, transforming your separate memory locations into a single, navigable network.\nThe \"Micro-Castle\" Technique: Using Everyday Objects as Memory Systems Inspiration strikes, a great idea for your business, a sudden list of errands you must run—what do you do when you need a memory system right now? In this lecture, you will learn the agile and incredibly practical \"Micro-Castle\" technique. We will show you how to turn any object in your immediate environment into a temporary, disposable memory system. You will learn to use your own body as a 10-point journey, to turn your car's dashboard into a mobile memory aid, and to see the loci hidden in a simple coffee table. This technique makes the entire world your mnemonic playground and ensures you are never again without the tool you need to capture a fleeting thought.\nThe \"Virtual Castle\" Gambit: Creating Infinite Memory Space from Scratch So far, you have built upon the bedrock of real, familiar places. Now, we break the chains of reality. This lecture introduces the \"Virtual Castle\" gambit, the key to unlocking truly infinite mental real estate. You will learn how to construct vast, detailed, and perfectly stable Memory Castles from pure imagination. We'll show you how to use blueprints from your favorite video games, novels, and movies, or how to design a completely customized castle from the ground up, perfectly tailored to the information it will hold. This is the skill that allows memory masters to store hundreds of thousands of data points—you are limited only by your imagination, and we will show you how to make it limitless.\nAdvanced Castle Management: How to Catalogue, Reuse, and Maintain Your Worlds A great empire is not just conquered; it is governed. A massive mental library is useless if it's a mess. In this crucial lecture on logistics, you will learn the advanced principles of castle management. We'll show you how to create a simple external \"Table of Contents\" for your empire, how to safely reuse castles for temporary information using the \"Blow It Up\" method, and how to deal with the stubborn \"Ghost Image\" problem. You will learn a simple, effective review schedule based on spaced repetition that will act as a maintenance plan for your castles, ensuring the knowledge you store remains vivid and accessible for life.\nThe Nested Castle Principle: Storing Books and Entire Subjects Inside a Single Location This lecture alone is worth the price of admission. Here you will learn one of the most powerful mnemonic systems ever devised: the Nested Castle Principle. You will move beyond memorizing simple lists and learn how to store vast, hierarchical systems of information, such as an entire book. You will discover how to make a single locus in your main castle a portal to a smaller, \"nested\" sub-castle that holds all the key ideas of a single chapter. This creates a flawless mental file cabinet, allowing you to get a \"big picture\" overview of any subject in minutes, or \"zoom in\" to access granular details on demand. This is the technique that allows you to truly master complex subjects.\nThe \"Memory City\": Integrating All Your Castles Into One Cohesive Mental Universe This is the breathtaking culmination of Stage 4. You have built castles, linked them with portals, and even nested them within each other. In this final lecture, you will learn how to integrate every one of your mental structures into a single, cohesive \"Memory City.\" We will guide you in designing your city's layout with thematic districts (a Science District, an Arts District), creating mental \"subway lines\" to travel between them, and erecting giant landmarks as navigational beacons. You will create a mental world so vast, so organized, and so interconnected that it not only stores your knowledge but actively helps you forge new, creative links between different fields of study. You will have built a true mental metropolis—the ultimate testament to a well-organized and powerful mind.\n\n\nStage 5: The Master in Action: Applying Your Castle to The Real World\nA skill is only valuable when it fundamentally changes your life. This is the stage where your training pays off in tangible, powerful, and life-altering ways. You have built your castles, mastered the art of unforgettable imagery, and learned the strategies for creating a mental empire. Now, you will deploy that empire to conquer the most common and high-value challenges you face in your personal and professional life. This stage is 100% focused on real-world results. We will walk you through, step-by-step, how to apply your new skills to dominate exams, deliver speeches like a world-class orator, learn new languages with astonishing speed, remember the names of everyone you meet, master complex new skills, and finally conquer the abstract world of numbers. This is where your new power becomes practical.\nIn this transformational stage, you will learn to apply your new skills to the most high-value areas of your life:\nThe Language Learner's Edge: Using Castles to Master Vocabulary and Grammar For anyone who has ever given up on learning a new language out of sheer frustration, this lecture is your path to victory. You will discover how to demolish the two biggest roadblocks for any language learner: vocabulary and grammar. We will guide you in creating a dedicated \"Language Castle\"—a virtual Spanish villa or a French café—where every room is themed for a different category of words. You'll learn how to instantly encode new vocabulary using phonetic links, how to assign unforgettable visual cues for grammatical gender (e.g., making all masculine nouns burst into flames, and all feminine nouns freeze in ice), and how to store entire verb conjugations in a single, dynamic mini-story. You will create your own personal immersion environment that you can access anytime, anywhere, transforming the painful slog of language learning into an intuitive and engaging journey.\nThe Name Game Assassin: How to Remember Names and Faces at Any Event Prepare to acquire a genuine social superpower. In this lecture, we will train you to become a \"Name Game Assassin,\" capable of recalling names and faces with flawless accuracy. You will learn the simple, four-step process that will make you unforgettable at any networking event, party, or client meeting. We’ll show you how to truly listen, how to identify a person’s most distinctive facial feature to act as a \"locus,\" how to instantly turn their abstract name into a concrete image, and how to link the two together in a bizarre, action-packed scene that is impossible to forget. People feel respected and valued when you remember their name. This single skill will elevate your rapport-building and networking abilities to an elite level, giving you an undeniable edge in any social or professional setting.\nThe Presentation Secret: Delivering Speeches and Talks Entirely From Memory Imagine standing in front of any audience—investors, colleagues, or a packed auditorium—and speaking with complete confidence and charisma, without a single note. This lecture reveals the secret. You will learn how to turn your Memory Castle into the ultimate \"invisible teleprompter.\" We'll show you how to structure your entire presentation as a journey, placing each key idea, story, and data point at a specific locus. You will learn to encode the essence of your points, not memorize them word-for-word, which allows you to speak naturally and authentically. This frees your mind to focus on what truly matters: making eye contact, reading the room, and connecting with your audience. You will even be able to handle unexpected questions with ease, always knowing your exact place in your mental journey. This is the skill that separates good speakers from truly captivating communicators.\nThe Exam Dominator: Encoding Entire Textbooks for Total Recall This is the lecture that will revolutionize your academic life. You will learn the \"Exam Dominator\" system for systematically downloading the core content of your courses into a perfectly organized, long-term mental library. We'll show you how to dedicate one castle per subject to avoid confusion, and how to use the powerful Nested Castle principle to store entire textbooks, chapter by chapter, section by section. You will learn to deconstruct your material, identify the most critical information, and encode it with vivid imagery. We will paint a picture of your new reality: walking into an exam hall feeling calm and prepared, and when you see a question, you simply take a mental stroll to the correct room in your castle and read the answer from the scene you created there. This is the end of stressful, ineffective cramming and the beginning of confident, academic excellence.\nHow To Memorize Numbers: The Major System for Dates, Pi, and Phone Numbers Numbers are the final frontier for most people—abstract, meaningless, and seemingly impossible to remember. This lecture equips you with the \"Major System,\" the gold-standard technique used by memory champions to turn any number into a concrete image. We will break down this elegant system in a simple, step-by-step way, showing you how to convert digits into consonant sounds, and then into visual, image-able words. You'll be amazed as you learn to memorize a historical date like 1492 by creating a short story about a Tire causing great Pain. You will see how this system, combined with a Memory Castle, allows you to store phone numbers, financial data, scientific constants, and even the digits of Pi, conquering the most challenging memory task of all.\nThe Skill Acquisition Accelerator: Using Mental Maps to Learn New Skills Faster This powerful lecture shows you how to use your new memory skills as a \"meta-learning\" tool to accelerate the acquisition of any new skill. Whether you want to learn to code, play the guitar, or master a new software, you will learn how to build a \"Skill Castle\" that acts as a mental map of the entire discipline. We'll show you how to memorize complex workflows, create a \"Mistake Museum\" to learn from your errors, and use your castle for powerful mental rehearsal to perfect your technique. By mastering the theory and procedures in a fraction of the time, you free up your cognitive bandwidth to focus on what really matters: effective, hands-on practice. This is how you learn smarter, not just harder.\n\n\nStage 6: The Grandmaster's Gambit: Advanced Strategies for Lifelong Mastery\nThe final stage of your journey is about ascending from a skilled practitioner to a true grandmaster of this art. Mastery is not just about knowing the techniques; it's about internalizing them, refining them, and understanding their deepest implications. In this capstone stage, you will learn the sophisticated systems that allow for deep analytical thinking, the strategies for maintaining your mental empire for a lifetime, and the psychological framework that separates the world's best from everyone else. You will learn how to practice deliberately to keep your skills razor-sharp, and you will discover the most profound truth of this journey: that you have not just trained your memory, you have fundamentally upgraded your entire way of thinking. This is the grandmaster's gambit—the final move that cements your skill, confidence, and mental power for life.\nIn this final, elite stage, you will cement your skills for life and truly master the art of your own mind:\nThe \"Mind Castle Room\" System: Assigning Corners to Detail Categories Prepare to move beyond simple, linear journeys and into the realm of structured, multi-dimensional databases in your mind. In this lecture, you will learn the sophisticated \"Mind Castle Room\" system, a technique for using a single room to perform a deep-dive analysis of any complex topic. You'll learn how to assign permanent categories to the corners of a room—for example, when studying a historical figure, one corner for their early life, another for their major accomplishments, and so on. This transforms your castle from a simple storage unit into a powerful analytical tool, allowing you to see connections, compare subjects, and access specific categories of information with surgical precision.\nThe Ghost Image Problem: How to Overwrite Old Data Without Confusion As you become a prolific user of your castles, you will eventually face a challenge that only advanced practitioners encounter: the \"Ghost Image\" problem, where faint impressions of old memories can interfere with new ones. This lecture provides the high-level maintenance skills to ensure your mental world remains pristine. You will learn powerful, targeted techniques like the \"Blow It Up\" method to violently smash old images and the \"Shrink and Sweep\" method to gently clear a locus before reuse. This knowledge ensures the long-term integrity of your mental library and gives you the confidence to manage your castles with expert control.\nSpaced Repetition Supercharged: Combining Digital Tools With Your Castle In this lecture, the ancient art of memory meets the cutting edge of modern technology. You will learn how to create a near-perfect system for lifelong learning by supercharging your Memory Castle with Spaced Repetition Software (SRS). We will show you how to use digital tools like Anki as your personal, intelligent assistant, a system that automatically schedules your mental review walks for you. The SRS tells you when to review, and your castle provides the rich, contextual, and creative how. This hybrid system removes all the cognitive load of tracking your reviews, guaranteeing the most efficient and effective path to permanent knowledge retention.\nThe Champion's Mindset: Overcoming Mental Blocks and Building Unshakeable Confidence The most powerful techniques in the world are useless without the right mindset to wield them. This lecture is a deep dive into the psychology of a memory champion. We will help you identify and shatter the limiting beliefs—\"I'm not creative enough,\" \"I have a bad memory\"—that hold most people back. You will learn how to embrace the initial \"awkward phase\" of learning, how to cultivate a \"confidence spiral\" through small, consistent wins, and how to treat your practice like a playful game. This is perhaps the most important lecture of all, as it builds the unshakeable self-belief that is the true foundation of your entire mental empire.\nThe Art of Deliberate Practice: Drills and Exercises to Sharpen Your Skills to a Razor's Edge World-class athletes and musicians don't just \"play\"; they run specific drills to hone their skills. In this lecture, you will learn how to train like a true mental athlete. We will equip you with a toolkit of powerful drills and exercises—like Image Generation Sprints and 30-Second Castle creation—each designed to target and sharpen a specific component of your memory skillset. You will learn the difference between simply using your memory and deliberately practicing to improve it. This is the secret to continuous, lifelong improvement, ensuring your mental tools never dull.\nBeyond Memory: How This Skill Rewires Your Brain for Creativity and Deeper Thinking In this final, culminating lecture, we reveal the most profound and unexpected reward of your entire journey. You will understand that you have accomplished something far greater than just improving your memory. We will connect the dots and show you how the very skills you have been practicing—creative association, structured visualization, and deep focus—have been fundamentally rewiring your brain for higher-order thinking. You'll see how your ability to form novel connections has boosted your creativity, how the focus required to build castles has enhanced your concentration, and how the act of structuring information has made you a clearer, more logical thinker. You will leave this course knowing you haven't just acquired a new skill; you have unlocked a better version of your own mind.\n\n\nWhy This Memory Castle, Memory Training Course? Why Now?\nThere is no shortage of information about memory techniques. But there is a massive shortage of transformation.\nYou can spend weeks piecing together fragmented blog posts, watching superficial videos, or reading dry academic texts. Or, you can give yourself the gift of a single, complete, expertly guided system that is designed for one thing and one thing only: your success.\nWe have poured everything into this masterclass to ensure it stands as the most effective, engaging, and comprehensive program of its kind. We don't just teach you the \"what\"; we show you the \"how\" and instill in you the \"why.\" We focus not just on the techniques, but on the mindset, the strategy, and the real-world application that creates lasting change.\nThe question you have to ask yourself is not \"Can I do this?\" because we have designed this journey to guarantee that you can.\nThe real question is, \"What is the cost of not doing this?\"\nHow many more opportunities will be missed? How many more connections will be lost? How much more time will be wasted on inefficient study? How many more moments of frustrating \"brain fog\" will you endure?\nEvery day you wait is a day you choose to operate with a less powerful, less confident, and less capable version of yourself.\nThe power to change this is right in front of you. The ability to build a mind that is sharp, organized, confident, and creative is not a distant dream; it is a structured, learnable skill. The journey is mapped out. The tools are ready. The guide is waiting.\nYour new mind is waiting to be built.\nIt's time to become the architect.\nEnroll now, and let's begin construction.",

      "description": "The course gives SIMPLE strategies and a better understanding of how to help yourself or others become great learners .The course currently has a section on understanding what is likely to help and what is likely to hinder learning and a section on various strategies and techniques to help enhance learning. I also discus theories and modes about how your brain works (based on NEUROSCIENCE).\nThe course in its original format was designed for Parents and teachers to help the children in their care become effective learners. However it soon became clear (from the participant feedback and as further lectures were added) how helpful this course is to EVERYONE. For many of us, school actually sabotaged our natural learning abilities: so this course, whatever your age, can get your natural LEARNABILITY back on track.\nSo how can we best encourage our learning to be effective?\nIf we enjoy learning, we are 8/10ths of the way to becoming good learners and great students. However If we don't or didn't enjoy ‘school’, or college and learning is a 'chore', then we struggle. If it is us doing the ‘teaching’ and the ‘students’ are our own children for example, then unless they have our understanding, our unconditional love and our continuing support we can actually sabotage their best efforts (as this course demonstrates).\nLet us not forget that Einstein was a late talker, a slow learner and did very poorly at school. Many highly successful people received poor reports at school. So whatever your age now, your performance at school is or was not a good predictor about how successful you can be. So let's take the pressure off and focus on what we do well and let's stop doing the things that hinder natural learning progress.\nOur 'LEARN-ABILITY' - the ability to learn (and how good we are at it) is key to our success as human beings in the 21st Century and WE ALL HAVE IT.\nAs a bonus the course includes my two part  \"Five Secrets of Memory\" Webinar recording",

      "description": "Improve how you think, gain invaluable problem solving skills, understand the world more accurately, and with that improve your decision making and your quality of life.\n\n\nLOGICAL REASONING\n\n\nLearn to think better: learn critical thinking, logic, and how to examine information that is presented to you. After you synthesize all the information and put it through a good examination, you'll be more confidently and accurately able to classify certain information as true and false.\nOnce you have reliable information through critical thinking, you will then be able to use that information for your problem solving for life and career.\n\n\nLOGICAL FALLACIES WITH REAL-LIFE APPLICATIONS\n\n\nMost philosophy and critical-thinking classes online and at universities are too theoretical, and that makes them boring. But in this course, every logical fallacy we'll encounter will have real-life applications and examples to help you make the course applicable to your life.\n\n\nBROADER OUTLOOK THAN MOST PROBLEM-SOLVING COURSES\n\n\nMany problem solving courses and strategies focus on few robotic steps to solve a problem. But they miss the bigger picture. Real people are the ones solving the problems so we must also include human elements that go into problem solving. Those human elements include your confidence, mental health, and interest in the problem.\nAll those parts of problem solving are as important as the logical parts of problem solving, and when they are combined, your problem solving skills rise to a new level.\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR DECISION MAKING\n\n\nWhen you are better equipped to examine information you are presented, you will be better able to understand which information is accurate and which information in misleading. Having more accurate information to deal with will immediately improve your decision making.\n\n\nInvest in your future! Enroll today.",

Improve your competency?\n\nMastering Your Memory isn't just about HOW to strengthening your memory, it's about WHAT you remember! Your memory impacts all areas of life:\n·        How you view the world\n·        The way you communicate\n·        How you define love\n·        Your career choices\n·        What makes you happy\nAll of this comes from past memories. These past memories give us a foundation on which to understand the world and how we fit in it.\nWhen I failed my first year of college, even though I would spend hours upon hours studying, it impacted my belief in myself and what I thought was possible for my future.\nHowever, after having my brother pass away in a car accident, I was committed to going back to school and making a difference in my life.\nI had a professor who told me that the best thing I could do is study memory techniques.\nAnd so I did, and I was blown away as I started to see the results in my life. I became a super learner with my new memory techniques. I developed memory techniques that would allow me to study for a fraction of the time and still get an A in the class while retaining the information long term (AKA: super learner) . Because of these techniques I was able to go from a college drop out to graduating from graduate school with all A’s. I had become a super learner that could use my new memory skills to truly impact my potential in life.\nMore importantly, these memory skills have helped me thrive in many aspects of my life. It has allowed me to move up in organizations I worked in and contracted with as a super learner. Eventually the memory skills and being a super learner helped me build multiple thriving businesses.\nWhy have memory skills help me? Because they helped me:\n·        Learn things quickly\n·        Retain more of the information that I would learn\n·        Retrieve the information and use it creativity when I had challenges\nMemory is more than just remembering, it is knowing how to strengthen your most important muscle: your brain. This is what makes you a super learner.\nSo, if you are ready to be a super learner, more powerful speaker, thrive in your career or business, and increase your ability to recognize opportunities all around you, then the Psychology of Memory: Strengthen and Improve Your Memory is for you.\nIt will help you drastically cut down the time it takes you to memorize information, as well as help you effortlessly recall the things you have learned.\nThis course is for YOU if want to become a super learner and:\n·        effortlessly memorize and recall information.\n·        cut down the time you study or prepare for something.\n·        have your mind work for you instead of you for it.\n·        create success in school, career, or business.\nThe difference with this program:\nThe difference between this course and other memory courses out there is that most courses only focus on giving you memory techniques (which we DO give you in this courses). Knowing memory techniques is great, however the benefits are limited if you don’t truly know how your brain works and, specifically, how to take in information and recall it. By understanding the psychology of memory you will become a As a super learner and be able to more easily apply these techniques and take control of your mind at a deeper level.\n\n\nSo, are you ready to transform your life through proven memory hacks?

      "description": "Mein Selbstexperiment: Von Durchschnittsstudenten zum Einserkandidat in 3 Monaten\nKlingt das für dich reißerisch?\nFür mich auf alle Fälle, dennoch habe ich genau das geschafft. Und diesem Videokurs werde ich dir zeigen:\nWie ich in 3 Monaten gelernt habe meinen Notendurchschnitt 3 Noten zu verbessern.\nWie ich meinen Spaß & Motivation am lernen wieder entdeckt habe und es kaum erwarten konnte bis das neue Semester beginnt.\nWie ich in kürzester Zeit enorme Mengen an Inhalt zu verstehen und nahezu perfekt auswendig zu können.\nEs gibt unterschiedliche Gründe warum du einen Kurs wie diesen suchst.\nAls ich damit angefangen hatte, war ich an einem Punkt wo ich mein zweites Studium begann. Endlich konnte ich Psychologie studieren. Ich hatte nie den Notendurchschnitt, weil ich bereits in der Schule schon immer nur unteres Mittelmaß war. Ich hatte bereits die Hauptschule mit einem 3er-Schnitt beendet. Real- und Hochschulreife genau so. Und selbst mein Erststudium als Medientechnologe habe ich mit 3,2 beendet.\nFür mich war es OK. Denn ich hatte bereits während des Studium mich intensiv mit Coaching beschäftigt und es hatte sich abgezeichnet, dass dies mein Beruf werden wird.\nAber jetzt dieses mal war alles anders. Nach lange hin und her hatte ich mich doch nochmal zu studieren. Psychologie. Als Coach nicht verwunderlich, aber es war auch schon immer mein Traum. Aber mit einem 3er-Schnitt eben nicht möglich. Jetzt konnte ich das aber neben meinem Beruf an einer Fernuniversität machen. Also begann ich damit und es passierte was immer passierte.\nUnd obwohl mich die Inhalte interessieren und ich total dafür brenne, waren meine Noten wieder nur Durchschnittlich.\nDa wurden mir zwei Dinge klar.\nInteresse ist zwar wichtig, scheint wohl alleine nicht zu reichen\nIch hatte die Schnauze voll und wusste, jetzt packe ich das an und bewiese mir selbst, dass ich besser als nur Durchschnitt bin.\nUnd hier bemerkte ich erstmal, welche Probleme es beim lernen geben kann. Ich musste mich mit so einigem herumschlagen:\nWenig Zeit, da ich neben meinem Beruf lernen musste. Als Schüler und Student hatte ich allerdings auch immer etwas besseres zu tun :)\nDas lernen stresst mich oft, weil ich nicht so viel schaffe, wie ich mir vornehme\nVieles bleibt auch nach mehrmaligem durcharbeiten nicht im Gedächtnis hängen\nIch benötigte neben viel Selbstmotivation auch noch viel Zeit. Die Ergebnisse hingegen waren eher mittelmäßig.\nIch könnte jetzt noch weiter schreiben, aber ich denke du kennst das in der ein oder anderen Art und Weiße.\nAlso hab ich mich intensiv mit dem Thema lernen beschäftigt. Den dieses mal hatte ich zwei enorme Vorteile. Erstens, ich hatte rechtzeitig damit angefangen, mich mit dem Thema \"Lernen\" zu beschäftigen. Und zweitens, ich hatte das Fach Kognitionspsychologie und \"Gedächtnis & Lernen\" war ein Schwerpunkt in dieser Vorlesung.\nIch hatte also viele Studien, die Vorlesung und einige Fachbücher zum Thema Lernstrategien gelesen und und auch das Ganze Semester Woche für Woche angewendet.\nUnd dann hatte es tatsächlich funktioniert. Ich merkte bereits vor meinen Prüfungen, dass ich den Lernstoff sehr viel besser drauf hatte als in allen anderen Semestern meiner Studienzeit zuvor. Ich ging bereits selbstbewusst in die Prüfungen und behielt auch bei schwierigen Fragen einen kühlen Kopf.\nDas Ergebnis: 1,3 am Ende des Semesters\nDas entspricht einer Verbesserung von ca. 3 Noten. Und das Beste ist, dass lernen ist bereits so zu Routine geworden, dass das neue Semester genau so gut anfängt wie das letzte aufgehört hat. Vom ersten Tag an war es einfach direkt wieder zu lernen ohne das ich mich dazu motivieren müsste.\nUnd nun verbinde ich meine Tätigkeit als Coach und das Lernen miteinander mit diesem Videokurs. Ich habe einen knapp 3 Stündigen Videokurs gemacht, in dem ich Dir fundiert das Wissen weitergebe, welches ich gelernt und auch praktisch erarbeitet habe. Alle Übungen und Strategien sind auf die Praxis ausgelegt und dennoch wissenschaftlich fundiert .Psychologie halt :)\nAlso, was wirst Du in diesem Kurs lernen?\nIch zeige dir, wie du deine Lernmotive findest, welche dich dauerhaft motivieren\nWie du ein starkes Commitment zu deinem Lernziel aufbaust\nIch zeige dir, wie du dein Zeitmanagement so optimierst, dass du nicht unter Zeitdruck beim lernen kommst\nWie du optimale Lernpläne entwickelst und auch durchführst\nWie du es schaffst, pünktlich anzufangen\nWie du Ablenkungen minimierst und dauerhaft konzentriert an deiner Aufgabe bleibst\nWelche unterschiedlichen Arten von Information es gibt und wie du die richtige Lerntechnik für jedes Art von Wissen auswählst\nIch zeige dir, wie du Wissen schnell und dauerhaft im Langzeitgedächtnis speicherst\nWie du dein Verständnis für Wissen vertiefst und deine Inhalte tief durchdringst\nWelche Lernblockaden es gibt und wie du diese auflöst\nFür jede Aufgabe habe ich extra Arbeitsblätter entwickelt die du digital oder ausgedruckt nutzen kannst und strukturiert durcharbeiten kannst.\nBonus: Du bekommst von mir noch ein E-Book zum Thema blockierende Gedanken & Glaubenssätze. Hier lernst Du deine unbewussten Gedanken aufzuspüren und entkräften. Zusätzlich bist du in der Lage, neue selbstwirksame Gedanken und Glaubenssätze zu erschaffen.\nZusätzlich hast du eine 30-Tage-Money-Back-Garantie\nDu kannst meinen Kurs für 30 Tage ohne Risiko testen.\nAlso, lass und beginnen. Schreibe dich jetzt in den Kurs ein und entdecke dein noch schlummerndes lernpotential mit mir zusammen.",

I managed to perfectly store and recall Pi to 500 decimal places.\nEnroll now and watch me recall this number on a white board. No games, jokes or gimmicks. Just pure memory!\nI achieved this not by memorising the number, but by creating a visual image of the number.\nThis is the secret to building a powerful memory – creating photographic images.   I will show you the entire process step by step. You can apply this method to any type of information you want to learn.\nIf you can already do this, then you are a memory master already, and you may not gain much from this course.\nBut for the majority of us mortals, developing a powerful memory is extremely hard to do using conventional memory strategies.\nHowever, when you learn the secrets to developing a powerful memory taught in this course, you will be able to remember anything you want.\nI will show you how to learn all kinds of information: mostly numerical but also how to apply this method to facts.\nLike me, you might be blown away when you discover what you are really capable of memorising.",

      "description": "[Update April 18 from Kim: In an effort to give full disclosure to future students I'd like to let you know that I'm undergoing treatment for Stage 4 Lymphoma. I hope and aim to make a full recovery by next year! This means I'm not able to participate as an instructor as much as I'd like to but students have excellent reviews of my courses and ask surprisingly few questions - I hope that means that my courses are complete enough without needing lots of clarification. Please remember there is a money back guarantee so if you purchase my course then decide you would need more instructor input you can utilise that feature. So remember life is short - take the course - learn the skills - make the move - do the thing - eat the cake - and remember to always check that what you are doing makes you happy!]\n\n\nThe Memory Palace technique, AKA the Method of Loci is a very powerful tool for us mortal humans to learn vast amounts of facts, figures, lists and words that seem impossible. This course guides you to be able to use the Method of Loci by building your own imaginary journey and associating memorable images with each place.\nYou don't need to have an amazing memory like Rain Man and you don't need to take hours reciting - you just need the ability to visualise and the willingness to learn!\nWe'll actually apply the method by memorising Asia's countries and their capitals in alphabetical order. At the end you'll be able to reel off the countries and their capitals forwards, and often backwards too! You'll know that Azerbaijan's capital is Baku and that South Korea's capital is Seoul - without Googling it!\nWe'll look at applying this method to anything you want to memorise in the future, and discuss how creating a memorised list becomes a 'frame' that future learning can be built upon - memorising a structure within a subject makes learning the rest of that subject easier and more interesting.\nI've built this course using pictures and occasional animations to help the memorable visualisations stick in your head easier, and I've provided links to supplementary information should you wish to further your learning both for the geography element and the Method of Loci technique, BUT I've deliberately kept the course quite short in time - I want you to see how quickly you can memorise things and I want you to have more time to go out afterwards and apply your new memorising technique.\nHeres the course outline:\nIntroduction\nDiscuss the Method of Loci\nLets create our first Memory Palace journey\nMapping out our journey (you will need paper and pens)\nAsia - Afghanistan to Indonesia\nRecap\nAsia - Iran to North Korea\nRecap\nTest yourself\nCreate an additional stage to our Memory Palace journey\nAsia - South Korea to Pakistan\nRecap\nTest yourself\nAsia - Philippines to Saudi Arabia\nCreate the last stage to this Memory Palace Journey\nAsia - Singapore to Yemen\nRecap\nTest Yourself\nUsing your new memorised information as a frame for learning\nCreating more Memory Palace journeys\nI can't wait to help you to learn this amazing, powerful technique. It will change your life!",

      "description": "QUESTION: Do you want to DOUBLE, even TRIPLE your reading speed in the next 30 days?\nA month and a half ago, I created a reading course on How to Read 300 Non-Fiction Books This Year. I was blown away by the response. But there was one question I kept getting...\nWhat about fiction?\nBecause that course is all about going through books to extract information from non-fiction books you can use in your life -- which means sometimes you'll be reading every word, sometimes you won't. But what about reading fiction books, or textbooks, or books you need to read every word in? Is there a system that works for that just as well as my system for non-fiction books?\nSo I spent a month going through every speed reading book, video and article to answer that question for my students. And in the process, after going through a lot of fluff in most other courses, came up with what I believe to be the simplest, most direct system to permanently doubling or tripling your reading speed in the next 30 days.\nAlthough, you can take the techniques and instantly read more quickly, this is no magic pill. Because I'm more interested in teaching you the skill of speed reading which can last a lifetime, than teaching you to read just a little bit more quickly.\nInside, I'll show you why we read slowly, and exactly what to do about it. And if you really want to reach your maximum reading speed, it will take 15 minutes of practice every day. For that reason, this is not for everybody.\nBut if you are willing to put in a little bit of time every day for a month to benefit for years, here's exactly what we'll cover...\n1. How to make sure you read every day\n2. The 5 causes of slow reading we learned in school (and still do to this day)\n3. How to cure all 5 causes of slow reading\n4. The difference between reading and practicing speed reading -- and when to do each\n5. The 4 stages of reading you'll have to go through from learning to read to becoming a speed reader\n6. Four techniques you can use to reach your maximum reading potential\n7. The secret to understanding everything you read\n8. The two tools you can use to use to learn to read even faster in your spare time\n9. And more...\nThere's no skill more valuable than reading. To learn to double, or even triple your reading speed in the next 30 days, click the \"Take This Course\" button in the top right. There's a 30 day money back guarantee, so there's nothing to lose, but a lifetime of faster reading to gain.\nTo your success,\nBrandon",

      "description": "Welcome to How to build a Powerful Memory: Learn information faster and keep it longer.\nThis is my free course which introduces you to some of the foundational concepts of building a better memory.\nThis course is geared towards people who want to improve their memory, be that for school, university or college.  If you need to study and learn a lot of information, then it pays to know a few good strategies on how to do that.\nIn this course I share the basic concepts around using memory palaces and mental routes to store lists of information. Practically all information comes in lists. Think about theory, parts of things, chronological dates - they are all sequential in some way or other.\nThis course will help you learn that sort of information. So far, for the sake of building these courses to demonstrate how this works, I have arbitrarily learnt Pi to 500 decimal places, and the entire periodic table using these methods. In fact, using these strategies I could recall 500 decimals of pi or the periodic table backwards (and of course forwards which is a no brainer).\nIn this course I explain these fundamentals of memory and present you with 3 exercises to get you started. The exercises are simple and easy to do, and should not take much time out of your day. But you will certainly get the idea on how to use these techniques if you do the exercises.\nUsing my knowledge of psychology, I have given you a good rationale on why these memory strategies work. Psychologically they are grounded in brain research and science. I have put my faith in them, so I hope you will too, and use them to your advantage.\nSince I learnt these methods, I have discovered that when I forget to use them, that is when I start to forget. They certainly help me in my day to day life, and I am sure they will help you too.",

      "description": "Over 165,000 students in 201 countries are already enrolled in my courses!\nThis is the course I wish I had 30 years ago...\nHi!\nYou're probably reading this because you want to see if it's possible to hone your memory skills to the point that you never forget an important piece of information again. A name. A face. A birthday. An anniversary. The atomic number of Plutonium...\nActually, you know it can be done, because some lucky people can do it. You may even know some of them...The question is, how do they do it, and can you learn to do it too?\nWhen I was in my late teens and early twenties, I had to sit a total of 13 professional exams. I bluffed my way through most of them...I say bluffed, but I was actually pretty good at my job, so I knew the answers intuitively...but there was one exam that was a problem. A BIG problem: Contract law. You see, the thing is, with a contract law exam, there's no bluffing your way through it. You may understand the basics, but you can't guess the names of the parties, or when the law was passed...and to pass the exam, you had to be able to cite case law. Lots and lots of case law. There's no way around it.\nI failed the exam (spectacularly)...twice. It seemed the harder I studied (and we're talking a lot of hours here) the worse my memory became. I learned one new thing, and forgot two old things. I asked my law professor how he knew so many cases, and he said he'd been a practicing solicitor for 30 years, and it comes with experience...but I hadn't got experience...or 30 years!\nI was in trouble, so I did the thing that most young men do when faced with such a monumental issue in life...I sat on the couch, and put the television on...\nIt was a Saturday night, I remember it clearly. There was a show called \"Monkhouse's Memory Masters\", hosted by Bob Monkhouse...it was a game show, where regular members of the public were \"trained\" to develop perfect memories. And these guys were recalling hundreds and hundreds of facts...impressive. But more impressive to me was that they learned how to do this in a matter of hours! yes, HOURS!\nI gleaned what I could from the clips in the show, and then spent every penny I had in the local book store buying and devouring every book in print on how to develop these super-human feats of recall. I thought it must be something new and revolutionary...but it turns out these systems have been around since the Greeks! So why wasn't everyone doing this?\nIt's now 30 years on, and I still have the same question.\nThe truth is, ANYONE can learn these systems, and train their memory to become almost perfect. Not just for an exam you're taking next week, but store the information forever...\nAnd that is precisely what you will learn in this course. In just a few hours, you will be able to memorise anything...perfectly. To get you started, in this course you will master:\nHow to encode information, so it can be recalled instantly...ALWAYS!\nHow to memorize foreign languages!\nHow to memorize the US state capitals\nHow to memorize the European capitals\nHow to memorize ancient Greek and Roman Mythology\nHow to memorize names and faces\nHow to memorize numbers and dates\nHow to memorize the planets (in order)\nHow to memorize wedding anniversaries & birthdays\nHow to memorize the 10 Commandments\nHow to memorize collective nouns\nHow to memorize the names of phobias\n...does that sound like a good use of a few hours of your life?\nIf so, taking THIS course could be the best decision you ever made. It literally could change your life. It did mine.\nSee you in the course...\nAlan",

Many times it happen when we find it difficult to recall the information, important days/ dates, events/meetings or sometimes even the names of the persons we met some time back. Students find it difficult to retain what they have learnt and this especially happens before exam or right in the examination hall while writing the exam. Why do you think this happens? And what do you think we can do to improve our memory retention capability? Well, before we move towards how to retain information, we first need to understand why we forget the information. The main reason is anxiety. When we are anxious, nervous or tense, it becomes very difficult for our subconscious mind to recall the information. Self hypnosis helps you to heighten your memory retention and this video is designed to serve this purpose. 2. How Self Hypnosis Can Help? 1) Self hypnosis helps to connect with the deep sources of power and energy within you 2) Self hypnosis helps change your limiting beliefs and thoughts 3) Self hypnosis brings more mental alertness 4) Self Hypnosis helps you a great wave of relaxation refreshing your whole body 5) Self hypnosis helps maintain positive attitude 6) Self hypnosis treats stress, anxiety, nervousness and depression successfully\nThis course is ideal for students who want to heighten their memory retention and also improve their memory to score well in exams and excel in their academics . It is also helpful in general for people to improve their memory\nIt is also very helpful for people who want to get over depression , anxiety , insomnia , negativity and stress.\nThis course contains a lot of exercises and more than 30 minutes of live video content designed over 8 lectures in English including bonuses.",

Se fosse vero, non potremmo leggere e capire questo testo per­ché non ricorderemmo le lettere dell’alfabeto ed il significato delle parole.\nLa memoria, diversamente da quanto si pensa, non è una sola. La nostra mente lavora combinando le diverse memorie (procedurale, visiva, emotiva, ecc.), ciascuna delle quali può essere attivata e migliorata attraverso semplici tec­niche.\nMi chiamo Paolo Viola e sono un divulgatore scientifico. Da oltre trentacinque anni mi occupo dei processi dell’apprendimento e del po­tenziamento della memoria. Nel corso della mia lunga attività, ho collaborato con l’Istitu­to Quadrifor (Istituto Bilaterale per lo Sviluppo e la Forma­zione Nazionale dei Quadri del Terziario), formando più di un migliaio di manager, e ho tenuto conferenze per il Centro Alti Studi per la Difesa delle Forze Armate, dedicandomi alla formazione degli alti ufficiali.\nGrazie alle mie lezioni del corso avanzato imparerete, in modo divertente, i metodi per potenziare la vostra memoria: dal metodo per ricordare volti e nomi a quello per studiare in modo proficuo, dal metodo per ricordare date e numeri importanti alle tecniche per memorizzare formule e codici, ed altri ancora. I risultati vi sorprenderanno. In aggiunta, nelle mie lezioni scoprirete notizie interessanti, tratte dall’ambito delle neuroscienze, che risponderanno a domande quali: «Che cos’è il “dejà vu”?», «Perché avviene il cosiddetto “blocco dello studente”?»",

      "description": "História do Trello\nO Trello foi liberado no evento TechCrunch pelo fundador da Fog Creek, Joel Spolsky. A revista ''Wired'' nomeou a aplicação em setembro de 2011 uma das \"The 7 Coolest Startups You Haven’t Heard of Yet\". Lifehacker afirma que a colaboração de projetos é simples e bem agradável.\nEm julho de 2012, o site ultrapassou 500.000 usuários, passou 1.000.000 de usuários em dezembro de 2012 e 4.000.000 em 7 de maio de 2014. Em setembro de 2014 ultrapassou cinco milhões de usuários e em 14 de outubro de 2015 alcançou a marca de mais de 10 milhões de usuários.\nEm 2014, levantou US $ 10,3 milhões em financiamento da Index Ventures e Spark Capital.\nCaracterísticas\nTrello utiliza o sistema Kanban para gerenciamento de projetos e se tornou popular ao ser utilizada pela Toyota. Os projetos são representados por quadros (boards), que contêm listas com várias tarefas. Cada tarefa é representada por meio de cartões criados dentro das listas. Cartões podem ser movidos, copiados ou compartilhados entre as listas, de modo a alterar seu progresso. Usuários podem ser adicionados aos cartões que podem ter comentários, anexos, enquetes, votações, calendário e checklist.\nCurso\nMetodologia desenvolvida para pessoas que necessitam estudar muitas matérias para processos seletivos, provas ou concursos variados.\nÉ impressionante o quanto uma ferramenta simples e prática como o Trello pode lhe impactar positivamente.  Esse curso abordará EM POUCO MENOS DE UMA HORA tudo o que você precisa saber para planejar a organização dos estudos  e potencializar sua aprovação nas provas, vestibulares e concursos públicos. Com um sistema simples e dinâmico, vocês se surpreenderão com a agilidade na organização das matérias e tarefas relacionadas, fazendo com que o tempo despendido seja o menor possível.\nEste que vos escreve e ministra o curso já foi aprovado em concursos nos seguintes órgãos:\n- Orgão Gestor de Mão de Obra - OGMO ES (2005)\n- Guarda Municipal de Vitória - GMV (2007)\n- Ministério Público do Estado do Espírito Santo - MPES (2007)\n- Secretaria de Estado de Gestão e Recursos Humanos - SEGER (2007)\nNaquela época, o Trello ainda não existia e todo o planejamento era feito com base em planilhas excel e textos no word. Demandava muito tempo para atualizar,  escrever e consultar todo o planejamento. Recentemente, ao retomar o propósito de voltar aos estudos - agora direcionados para a carreira de Auditor Fiscal da Receita Federal - percebi um incrível poder de planejamento e organização utilizando o Trello e aplicando um processo bem simples e fácil de ser aprendido. Assim, decidi compartilhar o conhecimento e a metodologia desenvolvida.\nE aí, quer assumir um desafio, estudar com dedicação e planejamento, ter mais tempo para aproveitar sua família, amigos e lazer. Essa é a nossa proposta com esse curso.  Aqui nós vamos direto ao ponto, capacitações rápidas e completas, sem enrrolação!!!\nO que está esperando? Se inscreve aí e vamos nessa!!!!\nLeonardo Daher",

      "description": "How to Memorize Presentations: No Notes Needed\nA Masterclass in Effortless Recall & Unstoppable Presentations\nDo you ever feel like you're just moments away from a massive communication breakthrough?\nImagine this: You step onto the stage, the lights are bright, the room is quiet, and every eye is on you. You're not holding a single notecard. You don't have a teleprompter. You simply take a deep breath, look out at your audience, and begin to speak.\nThe words flow effortlessly. Your thoughts are crystal clear. You're not reciting; you're connecting. You’re not just speaking; you're commanding. Your body language is open, your eye contact is authentic, and your message lands with absolute, undeniable power.\nThat’s not a dream. That’s the reality of a world-class presenter who has mastered their memory.\nFor too long, we’ve been told a lie: that some people are just \"naturally good\" at public speaking and memorization. We've been taught that the only way to feel prepared is to write down every single word, leaving us chained to a script, afraid to look away from the podium.\nThis course shatters that myth forever.\nWelcome to The Cognitive Kitchen: A Masterclass in Effortless Recall & Unstoppable Presence. This is not another public speaking program filled with generic tips. This is a revolutionary, brain-based system designed to transform you from a nervous speaker into a confident, note-free expert who can captivate any audience, anytime, anywhere.\nThis is the exact methodology used by memory champions, elite communicators, and top performers to deliver unforgettable presentations without a single note. It's a skill that will not only change how you present but will fundamentally rewire how you learn, think, and communicate for the rest of your life.\n\n\nWhy This Course Is Different: The 3 Pillars of Unstoppable Memory\n\n\nMost programs on this topic are either surface-level or rely on outdated, brute-force memorization. They teach you to \"cram and hope,\" leaving you with an insecure, fragile memory that collapses under pressure.\nOur approach is different. It is built on three unbreakable pillars of cognitive science and communication mastery:\nPillar 1: The Architect's Blueprint: Your Brain's Natural Memory Superpower\nYou will discover that your brain is not a computer hard drive; it's a powerful visual and spatial processor with an almost limitless capacity for certain types of information. We'll show you how to bypass the limitations of your short-term memory by tapping into your brain's ancient, innate architecture.\nYou will learn the secrets of the Mind Palace: We'll guide you, step-by-step, to build a personal \"Memory Map\" by linking your presentation's key points to a familiar physical location. This is how you will transform a daunting list of facts into a simple, effortless mental journey.\nYou will master Visual Alchemy: We’ll show you how to turn every abstract concept, from \"synergy\" to \"market disruption,\" into a vivid, often bizarre, mental image. Your brain will latch onto these images with astonishing speed and retain them for the long term.\nYou will orchestrate a Sensory Symphony: We’ll go beyond sight and teach you to layer rich auditory, tactile, and even olfactory details onto your mental images, forging a memory trace so deep it becomes impossible to forget.\nPillar 2: The Recall Accelerator: Smarter, Not Harder Practice\nThe biggest mistake most people make is practicing passively—re-reading notes, highlighting text, and hoping for the best. This creates an illusion of mastery. We’ll introduce you to scientifically proven techniques that make your practice sessions exponentially more effective.\nYou will master the \"Active Recall Revolution\": We will teach you how to use powerful \"Blank Slate\" and \"Self-Quizzing\" strategies that force your brain to retrieve information from scratch. This mental effort is where the real learning happens and is the single most effective way to embed information deeply.\nYou will conquer the \"Forgetting Curve\": You will learn \"The Spaced Repetition Blueprint,\" a strategic, low-effort method for timing your review sessions perfectly. This will ensure your memorized content becomes a permanent fixture in your long-term memory, freeing you from the fear of memory fade.\nYou will implement the \"Feedback Loop\": We’ll introduce you to \"The Self-Correction Engine,\" a system for identifying and eliminating your memory weaknesses with pinpoint accuracy. You'll learn how to use a simple video camera and a powerful \"Recall Refinement Audit\" to turn every stumble into a profound learning opportunity.\nPillar 3: The Unforgettable Presenter: Beyond Memorization to True Presence\nHaving a perfectly memorized presentation is only half the battle. The other half is delivering it with a calm, confident, and authentic presence that truly captivates your audience. This is where most programs fail, but where our system excels.\nYou will conquer stage fright with the \"Pre-Flight Check\": We'll provide you with a powerful toolkit of psychological and physiological techniques, including \"power poses\" and controlled breathing, that will transform pre-presentation anxiety into focused, commanding energy.\nYou will embody the \"Improvisation Mindset\": With our system, your recall will be so robust that you'll feel the freedom to move beyond mere recitation. You’ll be able to improvise, adapt, and connect with your audience in real time, making your delivery feel like a natural conversation, not a performance.\nYou will achieve \"Effortless Flow\": By integrating all these skills, you will be able to deliver your message with a natural rhythm, using strategic pauses for emphasis and authentic body language to amplify your impact. You will not just be speaking from memory; you will be speaking from a place of deep, undeniable ownership.\n\n\nThis Course is for You If...\n\n\nYou’ve ever felt your mind go blank the moment you step into the spotlight.\nYou are a professional who wants to stand out by delivering your insights without the crutch of notes.\nYou’ve tried rote memorization, highlighting, or re-reading and found they simply don’t work for you.\nYou are an entrepreneur, student, or expert who wants to be seen as a truly authoritative and magnetic speaker.\nYou want to stop fearing public speaking and start enjoying the thrill of commanding a room.\nYou believe that true mastery comes from building a powerful, internal skill set, not from external crutches.\nThis course is your one-way ticket to a profound transformation.\nYou will not just learn to memorize; you will learn to think, learn, and communicate with unprecedented power. This is the skill that separates a good speaker from a truly great one. It’s the difference between a forgettable presentation and an unforgettable experience.\nImagine the confidence you'll feel when you can deliver your message anywhere, at any time, with nothing but your own brilliant mind. That’s the freedom we are going to unlock together.\nEnroll now and start your journey to becoming a truly masterful, note-free presenter. Your future self will thank you.",

      "description": "In society, we see parents are struggling for their children's development and growth, and face many issues related to concentration, attention, creativity, grasping, memory and recollection because their particular brain area related to that functioning does not work powerfully. The brain is our whole controlling and activating power system. Up to 14 years of age the brain is in the developing stage so each and every individual up to 14 years of age must work on Brain Development.\n\n\nGenius Kids –\nEveryone functions with both brain hemispheres but usually, only one hemisphere is dominant or used effectively. What if a person is able to Use Both Hemispheres Effectively? Wouldn’t that person excel in his thinking ability??? The human brain will function optimally if the left & right brains are in equilibrium. Whole-brain development is a method to stimulate & balance the left & right brain which ultimate result will be the activation of Intuition.\n“The purpose of education in the future will not be to create people with heads crammed full of knowledge but to rear children who know how to efficiently use the whole brain. Rearing children with enormous ability, rich creativity & the capability to make use of a high proportion of their brain should be the goal of child-rearing.” Professor Makoto Shichida\n“Are you an Einstein?”\n“Of course not” your answer\nBut that’s not true.\nA Genius is sleeping within you- You just need to wake it up\nThe Neuroscience behind the course -\nArchimedes himself invented a physical theory while he was relaxing, that is, when he immersed his body into the bathtub, where then the “AHA Phenomenon” arose automatically. Even Einstein normally played the violin first to let his brain relax and thus be able to invent. So, it’s clear now, the relaxed condition will take our brain toward alpha-theta waves where our brain’s performance will be maximum, our brain will function optimally. When the brain functions optimally, all human senses will be in their top performances including the capability of intuition. Intuition leads to discovery and innovation.\nAmazing course –\nIt is a more fun-filled course than just the recorded lectures. It has a combination of activities, physical exercise, different techniques, fun games, Alpha-level meditation, and many more. Children and grown-ups will equally enjoy and experience new learning. Several times a month, you'll receive educational announcements from me, posts from my blog, with additional insights about brain development. The course itself will grow over time, as I add more new updated content to it.\nJoin now, as this course will help parents to discover the Genius within their child.",

The course contains a lot of systems and it can be difficult for younger children to understand and implement them successfully.

Además, nos facilita una mayor concentración durante el proceso de leer y una mejor asimilación y retención de los textos. Paralelamente, se logra una disminución del cansancio mental y físico (principalmente ocular) que habitualmente acompaña al acto de leer. En general, cuando las técnicas de lectura rápida han sido bien aprendidas, el lector adquiere el dominio de su propio proceso de lectura, tanto en sus aspectos perceptivos como en los relacionados con el intelecto.\nEl “lector veloz” estará en condiciones de guiar eficientemente sus ojos no sólo al leer sino para ver cine o televisión, para analizar diagramas, gráficos y planos, para leer partituras musicales, para observar lo que lo rodea. Todo esto tiene aplicaciones en los más diversos campos y profesiones , incluso en actividades tan cotidianas como cruzar una calle o manejar un automóvil. Es más, para capacitar a pilotos y artilleros en el reconocimiento de aviones en vuelo, la Fuerza Aérea de Estados Unidos recurre a las mismas técnicas de adiestramiento visual empleadas en el método de lectura rápida (y fue precisamente en ella donde, después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, se organizaron algunos de los primeros cursos de lectura rápida).\nAdemás del adiestramiento visual, la lectura veloz implica un desarrollo de la capacidad intelectual aplicada al proceso de leer pero que, también, se traduce, en una mejora general de la actividad intelectual .",

      "description": "A história se repete, dia após dia.\nO indivíduo respira fundo na frente do computador. Começa determinado para extrair conhecimento do universo de informações que o cerca (cursos, blogs, livros, revistas, vlogs, afins), mas a tarefa se mostra mais complexa do que a aparência demonstra.\nAo invés de colher conhecimento, a sensação é de que está confuso, exausto, perdido. (Overload Information)\nNo princípio, surge um leve nó na garganta, uma sensação de impotência frente a vastidão de \"respostas\" que parecem caçoar da inabilidade de captá-las. Posteriormente, o nó desce para o estômago e uma angústia se apodera. Parece-lhe que é ele que não tem capacidade para aprender e que todas as informações se confundem em uma mesma coisa.\nApesar de não desistir, ele deixa aquelas tarefas “intelectuais” e de “estudo” para um \"depois\". Conforme o \"depois\" chega e a história se repete (exaustão, sensação de que as informações são hostis, frustração), o \"depois\" acaba ficando cada vez mais longo.\nE assim, pela falta de um sútil ajuste de rota e de uma habilidade efetiva para lidar com o excesso de informações, ele deixa um enorme potencial de conhecimento inexplorado.\nHá uma jazida inteira de inteligência esperando para ser descoberta. E as informações são as ferramentas necessárias para atingi-la.\nE justamente nesse ponto que surge o curso Economia da Atenção & Excesso de Informações. Nele, será apresentado uma estratégia efetiva e completa que envolve toda a cadeia de construção do conhecimento na Era do Excesso de Informações. Como de praxe da Hackers do Estudo, o tema é abordado de modo Objetivo, Didático e com Resultados Práticos.\nNo Economia da Atenção & Excesso de Informações será tratado desde a etapa inicial de como direcionar seus objetivos com o conteúdo a ser consumido, e também, o modo de processamento das informações visando formar inteligência. (Entendimento, Reflexão, Memorização e Acesso)\nO curso é inédito no Brasil e apresenta uma síntese que irá equipá-lo para explorar de modo confiante a vastidão das informações que nos cercam hoje. Obrigatório para todos que buscam se desenvolver através do conhecimento. Uma verdadeiro Norte para aqueles que estão comprometidos com a aprendizagem.\nAlguns temas que serão abordados:\n* Atenção como Recurso Finito (Critérios e Economia da Atenção)\n* Como criar uma estratégia de alinhamento de Objetivos com Consumo de Informações (Folha Norte e Folha Projeto)\n* Coleta, Entendimento, Reflexão, Memorização e Acesso. (Ebbinghaus, Técnica de Feynman, Posicionamentos Mentais)\n* Hacks de Gerenciamento de Ignorância (Posso fazer de tudo, mas não tudo)\n* Como navegar, ao invés de naufragar, no Oceano de Informações\n* Como estudar na Era do Excesso de Informações (e lidar com o Overload Information)\n* Lentes da Informação (Utilidade, Interesse, Sentido e Resultados Reais)",

It works and will definitely work for you.\nAlthough this method is very simple, it works better than anything else I've ever tried.\nHi. My name is Ian Stables.\nI discovered a very simple way of studying that gave me almost total recall at exam time.\n\nJust over two hundred took a very difficult insurance exam. Only 10% passed. I was one of them.\n\nLet me tell you, insurance was a very dry study subject indeed. I found it to be a real struggle to remember what I needed. Lots of dry facts, regulations, dates, and so on had to be remembered. I had to learn it. My employer had made it a requirement. My job depended on it.\nI searched through all manner of study material. Searching for a method of study that would make it easier for me.\nI came across a method that relied on computer software. I saw merit in it and found it to be very effective. However, despite its effectiveness, I also found it to be impractical.\nAfter a lot of thought and testing, I came up with a practical way to use this method. All I needed was a small notepad, a certain way of imputing facts to be remembered, and an effective way to use it.\nI used this method for twenty to thirty minutes, twice a day, while traveling.\nIn this short course, I show you how to set up your study notepad and use it to its greatest effect.\nBenefits of this study method:\n-- Almost total recall at the exam.\n-- No final revision required.\n-- Just twenty to thirty minutes, twice a day.\n-- No need to lug heavy textbooks with you. Just a notepad.\nLet me show you a far easier way to study and pass your exams. Join now.",

      "description": "Unutkanlık çağımızın en büyük sorunu. Sosyal yaşamımızda , iş yaşantımızda , okul hayattamızda hatta oynadığımız oyunlarda bile hafızamıza ihtiyaç duyarız. Sevgilimizin özel günleri , toplantı saatleri , sınav notları , oyunlardaki taktik ve hile kodları bunların hepsini yapabilmemiz için hafızamıza ihtiyaç duyarız. Yoksa , önümüzdeki firsatları göremeyebiliriz. Neyse ki hafızamı teknikleri sayesinde hafızamızı güçlendirebiliriz. Bu sayede sosyal yaşantımızda , iş yaşantımızda , okul hayattımızda ve hatta oynadığımız oyunlarda bile başarımızı ve  hayat kalitemizi artırabiliriz. Şöyle düşünün: Sevgilinizin doğum gününü unuttursanız neolur? Yada; GTA Vice City' deki hile kodlarını kağıda yazmak yerine hepsini tek seferde akılda tutuğunuzu düşünün? İşte iyi bir hafızaya sahip olmak bizi hem gündelik hayattından stressinden uzak tutar hem de hayattımızı bir üst seviyeye çıkarmamıza yardımcı olur. Bu kurs sayesinde neredeyse istediğiniz herşeyi rahatlıkla hafınıza alabileceksiniz. Canlı örnek: Yabanci dil kursları yada okulunuzdaki yabanci dil dersi. Geçmişe gidin bakın. Grammeri herkes yapabiliyor. Sadece temel dil bilgisine sahip olan herkes yabanci dilin grammerini kolaylıkla yapabilir. Ama, bütün sınıfta tüm kelimeleri bilen ve hiç zorlanmadan cümle kuran çok çok az kişi vardır. Ve o insanları daha önce hiç görmeseniz bile hatırlıyorsunuz değil mi ?  İşte bu kurs hem yabancı dilinizi geliştirmeye hem de sosyal çevreniz de ön plana çıkmanıza yardımcı olur. 37 dakika dan oluşan bu kursumuz sizin farkı gerçek ve ispatlanmış hafıza teknikleri kullanarak izleyicisinin hafıza gücünü artırır. Diğer kurslar gibi saatlerce öğrenme sıkıntısı yaşamadan, hızlı ve kalici öğrenme sağlar. Üstelik bu kısa kurs size gereken bilginin yanında örneklerle pekiştirmenize yardımcı olur. Kafanızda onlarca hafıza tekniği yerine bir tane teknik üzerinden hızlı bir biçimde türetilmiş teknikleri size sunar.\n\n\nKursu bitirdikten sonra anlayacaksınız ki hafızanızın güçlü olması hayatta ki bir çok probleminizi kendiliğinden çözecektir. Neler mi bunlar ? Altta yazıyor.\n\n\nBu kurs neden senin için uygun:\n1)  Takıldığın sözel dersleri daha çabuk öğrenmek istiyorsun.\n2) Saatlerce not ezberlemek istemiyorsun. Tek sefer de okuyup, hafızama kaydettip sınav vakti kullanarak en yüksek notu almak istiyorsun.\nNot: 2. maddenin aynı zamanda çevrendeki arkadaşların saatlerce onlarca sayfayi ezberlemek için uğraşırken senin 10 dakika herşeyi öğrenip onları izlemek gerçekten çok KEYİFLİ :)\n3) Sosyal ilişkilerde karşındakinin detaylarını daha fazla akılda tutup sevdiğin insanlara daha çabuk samimi olmak istiyorsun\n4) Yabanci dil kurslarına binlerce lira harcayıp grammerini en üst seviyeye çıkarmış olsan da yeni kelimeleri hafizana almakta zorlanıyorsun\n5) Yurtdışına gitmek isterken özgeçmiş hazırlaman gerekicek bunun içinde iyi bir kelime havuzuna ihtiyacın var. Ve yabancı kelimeleri hızlıca öğrenmek istiyorsun.\n6) Alışverişten geldiğinde poşetti kontrol ettiğinde eksik bir şey olduğunu görmek istemiyorsun\n7)  Geçemediğin sözel dersi geçmek istiyorsun. Ayrıca; Hep o kafana takılan o 100 puanı bu şekilde daha rahat alabilirsin.\n8) Hayatta ki sorunlarını akılda tutarak boş vakitlerinde onları çözmek istiyorsun.\n9) Oyunlarda hile kodlarını veya stratijik taktikleri akılda tutarak rakiplerine karşı üstünlük sağlamak istiyorsun. Örnek: GTA Vice City ( Hile kodları ) ,\n10) Sosyal ilişkilerde sevgilinin detaylarını daha iyi akılda tutarak daha huzurlu bir hayat istiyorsun.\n\n\nVe en basiti; Unutarak, hayatta kaybettiğin şeylerin önüne geçmek istiyorsun.\n\n\n\n\nBu kurs kimler için uygun:\nSosyal ilişkilerde insanların detaylarını hatırlayarak kendini ön plana çıkmak isteyenlere. ( Tanınmak istiyorsan önce tanımalısın. )\nOkul yaşamında sınav notlarında daha çabuk öğrenerek lisans ve okul başarısını çıkarmak isteyenlere\nAşk, aile , arkadaş ortamında detayları daha iyi hatırlayarak huzurlu bir yaşam isteyenlere\nOnline oyunlarda veya tekli taktik oyunlarında daha iyi bir başarı isteyenlere\nHafıza şampiyonalarına katılmak hedefinde olan ve buna bir başlangıç yapmak isteyenler\nHafızası zayıf olanlar ( Hasta olmaması şartıyla )\n\n\n“Tarihini bilmeyen bir millet, yok olmaya mahkumdur.” - Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\n\n\nSen de kendi tarihini bil ki geleceğine yön ver.\nUnutma!

      "description": "NLP Lernstrategien\nLerne schnell ohne viel zu üben und rufe dein Wissen sicher und zuverlässig ab - in jedem Alter!\nIn diesem Videokurs  geht es darum, Prüfungen effektiv vorzubereiten, große Wissensmengen schnell und leicht zu lernen, Wissen zu vernetzen und Wissen im inneren Raum gut erreichbar abzuspeichern.\nwusstest du schon…\n…in der Psychologie versteht man unter Lernen jede Veränderung von Verhalten und Erleben – nicht nur das Aneignen von Wissen…\n…am besten funktioniert Lernen mit guter Laune…\n…und Lernen macht glücklich, weil Aha-Erlebnisse das Körpereigene Belohnungssystem stimulieren uns so das Glückshormon Dopamin freigesetzt wird!\nLernen lernen geht leicht mit NLP!\nWeiterhin erlernst du...\n... herauszufinden, was genau  du lernen solltest, um die Prüfung gut zu bestehen\n... die richtigen Priorizäten zu setzen\n... induktives Lernen zu nutzen\n... visuelle Lernstrategien zu nutzen\n... das Lesetempo zu erhöhen\n... mit Lernsurfen sehr schnell und hochkonzentriert zu lernen\n... mit Ruhe und Konzentration an die Sache zu gehen\n... zuversichtlich an die Aufgabe heranzugehen\n... Wissen zu vernetzen\nDu erhältst eine komplette Unterrichtssequenz zum Thema NLP-Lerncoaching, also genau das - oder sogar etwas mehr, was du in ca. zwei Tagen einer nlpaed-zertifizierten Lerncoach-Ausbildung  lernst. In diese Film fließen alle vorherigen Themen ein und du siehst komplette Beratungen von Coachees, die sich auf gößere Prüfungen vorbereiten oder ihr Gedächtnis im Allgemeinen verbessern möchten.\nEs ist günstig, wenn du dir auch die anderen NLP Lerncoach Filme ansiehst.\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach Teil 1 werden grundsätzliche Vorgehensweisen beim Lerncoaching gezeigt.\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach Teil 2 geht es um das Lernen von Sprachen. Oft bietet die Rechtschreibestrategie jedoch einen guten Einstieg für das Thema visuelles Lernen.\nIm Videokurs  NLP-Lerncoach 3: Dyskalkulie / Rechnen /  Mathematikverständnis / Umgang mit Textaufgaben / Formeln speichern und abrufen lernst du, wie du dich erfolgreich mit dem Thema Mathematik anfreunden kannst.\nim Videokurs NLP Lerncoach 4 findest du Themen rund um das Thema Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration / Schaffen eines motivierenden Arbeitsplatzes / ein optimales Zeitmanagement / Verbesserung des Schriftbildes.\nDu erhältst ein ausführliches Händout mit Erklärungen und Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitungen sowie Trancen, die du für dich selbst und andere nutzen kannst\nIm Kurs findest du Demonstrationen mit unterschiedlichen echten Coachees die echte Themen vor der Kamera lösen!\nIn den Demos gefilmte Themen:\nDemo mit Marius (26 Jahre): Marius vernetzt sein Wissen aus verschiedenen Quellen zum Thema Selbstmarketing\nDemo mit Franziska: Thema Lernsurfen. Franziska kann sich viele Dinge selbst nach monatelangem lernen nicht merken. Durch das Lernsurfen schafft sie es zum ersten Mal.\nDemo mit Christina: Thema Lernsurfen. Christine möchte leicht durch ihre Ausbildung kommen. Durch das Lernsurfen erhält sie eine tolle Möglichkeit ihre Lerninhalte spielerisch abzuspeichern.\nDemo 1 mit Sophia: Sophia möchte gerne Pharmazie studieren. Für die Zulassung zum Studium muss sie einen allgemeinen Eignungstest und spezielle Eignungsprüfungen an verschiedenen Unis absolvieren. Bisher hat Sophia Angst vor schriftlichen Prüfungen.\nDemo 2 mit Sophia: Diesmal geht es um effektive Prüfungsvorbereitung. Sophia entstresst das Thema \"Konzentration unter Zeitdruck\" und plant, wie genau sie beim Lernen vorgehen kann, um möglichst effektiv Wissen über induktives Lernen zu speichern und sicher abzurufen. Sie erschafft sich eine innere Bibliothek in greifbarer Nähe, ankert einen motivierenden Arbeitsplatz und macht eine Zeitreise.\nDemo mit Leilani (17 Jahre): Leilani glaubt, sie ist zu faul zum Lernen. sie ist in Klasse 11 und möchte nach dem Abitur Biologie studieren. Dafür benötigt sie einen bestimmten Notenschnitt, um einen Studienplatz zu bekommen. Sie nimmt sich vor oft vor zu lernen, hält das jedoch nicht ein. Leilani erlern Strategien rund ums Thema Mathematik.\nDemo mit Bettina: Bettina hat eine Ausbildung zum psychologischen Berater absolviert und schreibt demnächst eine große Prüfung. Sie lernt bisher auditiv und kann gelesene Texte nicht gut in einem anderen Zusammenhang abrufen.\nBettina erlernt die visuelle Speicherstrategie für die Bedeutung abstrakte Texte\nSie trägt ihr Wissen bisher in sich (in der Körpermitte). An dieser Stelle ist es nicht gut sichtbar. Deshalb platziert sie das Wissen in greifbarer Nähe im Gesichtsfeld  damit es jederzeit gut sichtbar und erreichbar ist. Bettina macht eine Zeitreise in eine Zeit, in der sie die Prüfung bestanden hat und bereits fließend englisch spricht.\nDemo 1 mit Judith: Judith strebt eine Zertifizierung als Legasthenie-Therapeutin nach der Davis-Methode an. Die Prüferin erwartet, dass die in der Methode vorgegebenen Anleitungen wortwörtlich benutzt werden - Judith findet die Texte sperrig und kann sie sich einfach nicht merken. Judith überwindet ihre Bockaden mit Hilfe der Veränderung von Submodalitäten, dem direkten Arbeiten mit persönlichen Metaphern, Teilearbeit und einer Zeitreise.\nDemo 2 mit Judith: Judith sieht bisher das Wissen zur Davis-Methode nur in einem geschlossenen Ordner relativ zentral vor sich.\nSie entwickelt im Coaching eine günstigere Vorstellung, die es ihr ermöglicht, die benötigten Texte Wort für Wort vom inneren Bild abzulesen, da das von den Prüfern verlangt wird. Weitere Blockaden zeigen sich, die wir im Coaching mit Hilfe eines Change History-Prozesses, der bis zur Uroma zurück geht,  aufgelösen.\nDie Kursen zum Thema Lerncoaching sind einerseits für Menschen jeden Alters geeignet, die sich selbst mit dem Thema Lernen beschäftigen, ihre eigenen Lernstrategien hinterfragen und optimieren möchten. Andererseits für Menschen, die andere als Coach beim Lernen unterstützen möchten. Coachees können Kinder oder Erwachsene jeder Altersstufe sein.\nNLP bietet eine Reihe nützlicher Strategien zu den klassischen Themen Rechtschreibung, Lesen, Textverständnis, Vokabellernen, Lernen von Regeln, Rechnen, Textaufgaben, Mathematikverständnis, Organisieren komplexer Lernaufgaben, innere Ordnung schaffen, Konzentration, große Wissensmengen schnell und sicher lernen, etc..\nDas einzige, was in einem Videokurs nicht leistbar ist, sind Antworten auf Verständnisfragen, Übungsgruppen und das Feedback zu deinen Erfahrungen in den Übungsgruppen... das solltest du dir entweder selbst organisieren, damit du alles Gezeigte trainieren kannst oder an unseren Online-Übungsabenden teilnehmen. Die Termine dafür teilen wir dir im Newsletter mit. Fragen kannst du natürlich auch stellen, wenn du Kontakt zu mir aufnimmst.\nWenn du einen Lerncoach-Kurs besuchst, kannst du das Videomaterial als wertvolle Ergänzung nutzen, denn du weißt ja, dass NLP eine Methode ist, die durch Modelllernen vermittelt wird. Je mehr Demonstrationen du zu einem Thema kennst, umso leichter wird es für dich, das Wesentliche herauszufiltern. Du lernst, an den individuellen Coaching-Bedarf angepasste Variationen des Vorgehens kennen und kannst dadurch souveräner mit eigenen Blockaden und Themen von Coachees umgehen.\nDer Kurs ist sowohl für Anfänger / Einsteiger ins NLP geeignet, als auch zur Vertiefung der Kenntnisse für fortgeschrittene NLP-Anwender.\nDie Trancen und Übungen sind bestens für die Selbstanwendung geeignet - du kannst dich durch das jeweilige Format führen lassen oder die Trancen auch zur Anleitung deiner Coachees nutzen\nNLP (Neuro Linguistisches Programmieren) ist in allen beruflichen Bereichen, in denen Lernen, Kommunikation, Beratungskompetenz sowie gelungene Selbststeuerung einen wesentlichen Anteil hat, von großem Nutzen.\nNLP ist eine Methode, die zunächst durch Modeling von Höchstleistungen entstand. Ursprünglich ging es dabei um effektive Psychotherapie. Die Methode hat sich inzwischen in vielen weiteren Bereichen etabliert, wie: Personalwesen, Führung, Werbung, Vertrieb, Kundenzufriedenheit, Gesundheit, Physiotherapie, Coaching, Seminargestaltung und Training, Sport und natürlich in allen sozialen Berufen wie Psychologie, Pädagogik, Sozial-Pädagogik, Coaching, Beratung, Schule und Erziehung...\n... Und natürlich ist NLP eine hervorragende Methode der Persönlichkeitsentwicklung.\nDu kannst...\nschnell große Mengen Wissensstoff sowie praktische Vorgehensweisen lernen\ndeine Ziele erreichen\nvergangene Ereignisse bereinigen und gestärkt aus ihnen hervorgehen\ndein Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstvertrauen verbessern\ndein Lebensglück und deine Zufriedenheit steigern\ndeine Überzeugungen und Glaubenssätze optimieren\nNLP als Methoden der Achtsamkeit und Meditation nutzen\ndeine innere Verfassung positiv beeinflussen\ndeine Gesundheit verbessern...\n...denn gute Stimmung und schnelles Überwinden von Stress-Zuständen unterstützt die Funktion deines Immunsystems.\ndeine Spiritualität fördern\n...",

You will start to read faster within 2 hours. Guaranteed.\nJoin 9,257+ students already enrolled. 89% of the reviews are rated 5 stars! (Read some of the 118 reviews to make sure you are making the right decision)\nOnce you understand what speed reading is about, you will be confident enough to spend your money and watch the entire course. You will improve your reading speed in a way that will surprise you!\nYES YOU CAN READ ENGLISH 33 TO 100%+ FASTER OR YOUR MONEY BACK!\nAlex Garcez discovered that your brain loves speed, and he thinks that fast is fun - slow is boring! If you think you have short attention span to read books, documents and social media, then you probably read slowly and carefully. Instead of understanding the text you get bored and distracted, needing to skip back to re-read text countless times. The main reason is that your brain is too powerful to go at such a slow pace and will drift off into something more interesting to think about.\nAlex Garcez gave up his Engineering degree in the third year because he was a very slow reader, however, his weakness became his strength, after taking a speed reading course, and deciding he was not going to become a laborer but an entrepreneur. Since then he took a Business Degree, Masters in Marketing and Advertising, and developed the Revolution Speed Reading Method. He personally coached more than 3,600 people and more than 98.4% of his clients improved their reading performance by at least 33%. In fact most of his clients improve their reading speed by more than 100%.\nWith more than 9,257 clients taking this two hour course in 53 countries, Alex expects to motivate people to read more books. His method is based on science, and he has achieved amazing results while coaching professionals from companies such as: Goldman Sachs, GE, J P Morgan, Google, Bloomberg, eBay, The Wall Street Journal, Sage, The Walt Disney Company, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Thomson Reuters, Adecco, Lloyds Bank, Citigroup, PwC, HSBC and O2.\nYou will assess your reading speed at the beginning and throughout the course. So, if you spend 3 hours reading at work and improve your reading speed, on average, by 33%, you will save a whole month of work (24 days) every single year.\nTake this ultimate Speed Reading Course right now and improve your reading speed.\nAttention: This course has similar content to the Basic Speed Reading for IT.",

Afraid of missing something important? Would like to have more free time?\nUse 20+ years combined study, teaching and working experience. Based on modern scientific studies.\nWhat about to have more fun and less stress in school or work? Both is possible. Find help in this course.\nI show you how to learn faster and get more time for your hobbies and friends. Do you want it? ;)\nSee the first results in few days.\n----\n\nJoin almost 3.000 students already benefiting from the series School Can Be Fun courses!\n\n---\nStudents confirm that this course help: \"It took me months to learn some new stuff before. I can learn complex computer topics only in three days now! And to master in some specific topic I require only one month now.\" Navis Michael Bearly\n\nThis course works. It is backed by actual scientific studies done to investigate how people learn, how they remember, and how they utilize time. I have taken what these studies have to say and combined it with over 25 years of personal experience (24 years student, 20 years teacher and lecturer) to develop study techniques that will allow you to study less and learn more.\nThis course is actually three courses in one. I cover brain function, time management, and study skills each in their own module so you aren't faced with a massive overhaul of your study practices. You can incorporate one technique, see the effect it has on your study time and your performance, and go on to incorporate the rest of the techniques one at a time.\nOnly some details had to be changed in last three years. It describes the quality of the course!\nI provide a broad range of information in this course, and that will be satisfactory for most of you, but if you would like to take an advanced course or read some specialized material, you're more than welcome to do so. I provide information on many additional resources on given topic at the end of each section.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe course consists of 39 lectures, nine quizzes, and nine podcasts. In addition, there are several self-evaluation tests designed to help you understand your abilities so you can target areas of weakness for extra work.\nThe length of the lectures varies from two minutes to five minutes and it's possible to watch them all in two hours. I recommend, however, that you do not do so. The way to get the most out of this course is to take each module separately and incorporate it into your study routine before moving on to the next section.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe course is aimed at high school students and freshman college students, but will be of use to anyone who wants to improve his/her study skills.\nI guarantee that you will see some results immediately after applying these techniques. You'll want to continue through the whole course. Many of the techniques require diligent practice, but you will be able to see the results right from the beginning and feel your confidence rise as you progress. You should see your grade improvement at the end of your term while practicing these techniques.\nThis course will teach you:\nHow to manage your time.\nHow to take notes effectively and efficiently.\nHow to improve your ability to remember facts, figures, and dates.\nHow to effectively utilize the resources you have.\nHow to recognize what is important and what isn't.\nThe basics of deeper learning.\nMost of all, this course will teach you how to be the best student (whatever age you are) you can be by finding the right balance, using the right methods, and working with the right motivation and the right timing.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis course is part of a wider project called “School Can Be Fun\". Find a lot of other free stuff on our Facebook page, Twitter account, and YouTube channel.\nAnd remember, there is a 30 day money back guarantee so if you are unsatisfied for any reason, you can request a refund.",

Doğru bir oto ses sistemi seçmek, araç içinde kaliteli bir ses deneyimi yaşamanızı sağlar. İşte oto ses sistemleri hakkında birkaç tavsiye:\n\n\n1. Kaliteli hoparlörler: Oto ses sisteminizin en önemli parçaları hoparlörlerdir. Hoparlörlerin ses kalitesi, netliği ve gücü, müzik deneyiminizi etkiler. Yüksek kaliteli hoparlörler seçerek, müziği daha net ve etkileyici bir şekilde duyabilirsiniz. Ayrıca, hoparlörlerin araç içindeki yerleşimi ve uyumu da önemlidir.\n\n\n2. Amplifikatör: Amplifikatör, hoparlörlerinize güç sağlayan bir bileşendir. Yüksek güçlü bir amplifikatör, sesin daha yüksek ve güçlü bir şekilde çıkmasını sağlar. Amplifikatör seçerken, hoparlörlerinizin ihtiyaç duyduğu gücü karşılayacak bir model seçmeye özen gösterin.\n\n\n3. Subwoofer: Eğer daha derin ve güçlü bir bas istiyorsanız, bir subwoofer eklemek iyi bir seçenek olabilir. Subwooferlar, düşük frekanslarda daha etkileyici bir bas sağlar. Araç içindeki boş alanı kullanarak subwooferı uygun bir şekilde yerleştirmeniz önemlidir.\n\n\n4. Ses izolasyonu: Araç içindeki ses kalitesini artırmak için ses izolasyonu önemlidir. Ses yalıtım malzemeleri kullanarak dışarıdaki gürültüyü azaltabilir ve araç içinde daha temiz bir ses deneyimi elde edebilirsiniz.\n\n\n5. Profesyonel kurulum: Oto ses sistemlerinde her madde önemli bir rol oynasa bile asıl etken profesyonelce ve bilinçli bir montajdır. Bu son madde uygulanmazsa diğer 4 maddede harcamış olduğunuz para ve elde ettiğiniz ürünler size büyük sorunlar açabilir..",

      "description": "This practical and targeted course combines sound therapy and neurological cognitive techniques, designed to significantly improve your memory and concentration skills, effectively enhancing your overall brain health.\n\nThe benefits of this course stem from a blend of time-tested techniques that support cognitive functions and innovative explorations in the realm of sonic therapy. This multifaceted strategy is designed to be both stimulating and adaptable, fostering relaxation, focus, and memory recall during periods of intense learning or when concentration wanes.\n\nPrepare to engage in a series of progressive exercises, each meticulously crafted to create new neurological connections. It utilizes the 432 Hz tuning, known for its natural resonance with human perception, and the musical harmony derived from Bach's distinguished geometrical sound patterns. These elements form the cornerstone of its therapeutic impact.\n\nBy integrating skills and techniques you acquire in this course into your routine, you will experience a more balanced approach to learning, characterized by efficient session management that respects the brain's need for rest and recovery. This method, aligning with the spacing effect, ensures that learning is sustainable and that breaks for the “Neuro-sonic Harmonics” exercises rejuvenate the mind, enhancing your ability to retain new information and process cognitive tasks efficiently.\nAs a therapeutic tool, the calming properties of sound therapy significantly reduce stress and create an optimal environment for memory retention and recall. Daily exercises in the course help mark the transition between intense focus and relaxation, maintaining high levels of concentration without the risk of burnout. Additionally, the structured sound therapy sessions that culminate this course serve as the nucleus of the entire program, enhancing your brain's health in real time. This helps you absorb and integrate new knowledge while protecting against the relentless distractions of the digital age. Importantly, these sound therapy sessions can be continued post-course as a recovery tool, further activating and sustaining their therapeutic potential over time.",

      "description": "Duygusal öğrenme, insanların duygusal zekalarını geliştirmelerine yardımcı olan önemli bir konudur.\nBilgi ve teknoloji çağında gün geçmiyor ki yapay zeka çok daha çılgın bir boyutta ulaşmasın. Tekrarlanan tüm işleri yapay zeka alırken insanoğlunun en önemli kozu Duygulardır. Peki Duygusal öğrenmeyi fark edip bunu kendi avantajımıza kullanmayı başarırsak ne olur?\nİnsanların çoğu öğrenme faaliyetlerini zeka üzerine kurmuş olup duygusal öğrenmeyi pek kullanmamaktadır. Oysa geçmiş yüzyılın zeka üzerine öğrenme yöntemleri bu çağda pek işe yaramamakta ve sürekli olarak sorunlar yaşanmasına neden olmaktadır.\nTekrar tekrar benzer sorunları yaşadınız mı, karar verirken zorlandınız mı, problem çözme davranışlarınızı geliştirmekte zorlanıyor musunuz, kendini tanımıyor musunuz, öz farkındalık ve öz yönetiminizi geliştirmek mi istiyorsunuz; o halde bu eğitim tam size göredir.\nBu eğitim sayesinde;\nBüyük duyguları yönetmek, ilişkiler kurmak, kişisel farkındalık kazanmak, sorunları çözmek, sorumlu seçimler yapmak ve hedefler belirlemek için gereken becerilerin öğretilmesi ve geliştirilmesini sağlayacaktır.\nDuygusal öğrenme, insanların duygusal zekalarını geliştirmelerine yardımcı olan çok önemli bir konu olarak karşımıza çıkar. Duygusal öğrenmenin bu kadar önemli olmasının asıl nedenleri şunlardır;\n\n\nİnsan İlişkileri: Duygusal öğrenme, empati ve sosyal becerileri geliştirir. Bu, insanların başkalarının duygularını anlama yeteneğini artırır ve daha sağlıklı ilişkiler kurmalarına olanak sağlar. İyi ilişkilerin önemi hem kişisel hem de profesyonel yaşamda başarı için kritik bir öneme sahip olduğu zaten bilinen bir gerçektir.\nİş Hayatı: İş dünyasında; duygusal zeka, liderlik, işbirliği ve iletişim becerilerini içerir. İş yerinde duygusal olarak zeki olan kişiler, takım çalışmasında daha etkili olurlar ve stresle daha iyi başa çıkma becerileri kazanırlar.\nKişisel Gelişim: Duygusal öğrenme, öz farkındalık ve öz yönetim yeteneklerini en üst düzeye çıkarmakta katkı sağlar. Bu, insanların kendi duygusal tepkilerini anlamalarına ve yönetmelerine yardımcı olan bir beceridir.\nDuygusal Öğrenmenin en önemli araçları ise şu şekildedir;\nEmpati: Empati, başkalarının duygularını anlama ve onları anlamaya çalışma yeteneği olarak bilinir. Ancak bu beceriyi bu kadar dar bir kalıba sokmak mümkün değildir. Empati, insanların ilişkilerini güçlendirir ve işbirliği yapmalarını kolaylaştırır. Yapay zeka çağında, bu beceri, insanlar arasındaki etkileşim becerilerini artırması için önemlidir.\nSosyal Beceri: Etkili iletişim, işbirliği ve çatışma çözme yeteneğini içerir. İnsanlar, sosyal becerilerini geliştirdikçe iş ve kişisel yaşamlarında daha başarılı bir kariyer çizgisi oluşturdukları gibi daha rahat bir yaşam sürerler.\nÖz Farkındalık: İnsanların kendi duygularını ve düşüncelerini anlama yeteneği olarak ifade edilebilir. İnsanlar, öz farkındalıklarını artırdıkça, daha iyi kararlar alabilmekte ve birçok problemi hızlı bir şekilde çözebilmektedir.\nÖz Yönetim: Duygusal tepkileri kontrol etme ve hedeflere ulaşmak için kendini motive etme yeteneğini kendi içerisinde bulunmasına katkı sağlar. İnsanlar, öz yönetim becerilerini geliştirdikçe, daha etkili bir şekilde çalışabilirler. Yapay zeka sistemleri de verimli çalışmak için bu beceriyi kullanmak üzere çalışmalarına başlamıştır.\nSosyal Farkındalık: Sosyal farkındalık, çevremizdeki insanların duygusal durumunu en net şekilde anlama yeteneğini bize kazandırır.\nTürkiye' de bu kurs içeriği ilk defa ele alınmış olur, daha önce hiç bir kuruluş ve eğitmen bu içeriği oluşturmamıştır. Çünkü bu kurs yapay zekanın geliştiği şu günlerde insanlığın en büyük kurtarıcısı olacaktır.",

We go through some insights from scientific psychology to help you take control of your breaks!\nYou've been taking breaks since before you knew how to.  “I don't need to learn how to take breaks,” you sigh. “I need to know how to stay engaged with my work!”  Staying engaged for the long haul is the whole trick to being an effective learner. There are lots of factors that go into this: passion, curiosity, discipline…. And pacing yourself. With breaks.\n\nOur brains are not designed to engage in endless hours of sustained concentration. We are designed to be good at bursts of concentration, peppered with lots of breaks. And if you don't plan your study strategy accordingly, you will burn out. You need to be proactive in order to win this game.\nUnderstanding the psychology of learning that can help you harness your learning abilities. I have worked one-on-one with dozens of students to help them get through the painful parts of the learning curve, including students with learning difficulties like dyslexia and ADHD. I know a lot about the challenges you are facing when you have big learning goals.\nIf you have trouble sticking to a study program because you get tired or turned off, check out the material in this course.\nThis course is about getting to the point where you can learn more, faster. This course does that by focusing on helping you improve one vital piece of study hygiene: study breaks.\nStudents who will benefit the most are those who:\n1) Find that despite their passion for lessons, they lose the motivation to continue;\n2) Have trouble managing their study breaks (i.e., they run too long)\nThis course can help you smooth out the rough edges to your learning curve. Check out the free previews and course descriptions to see if it’s right for you.\nYou have access to the materials and to me, for any questions. You get access to my expertise if you have any questions or are dealing with an issue that isn't addressed in the course.\nAs always, you have a 30 day no questions asked money back guarantee, so if you are not 100% satisfied, Udemy will refund you the full cost of the course.\nThe course runs about 1 hour long, and I’ve packed it with usable nuggets of psychological wisdom, and kept up a brisk pace. I know your time is valuable.\nIf you’ve been looking for a course that can help you get through to your learning goals, you’ve found it. Enroll to learn the secret to effective study breaks today!",

Learn how to read anything faster.\nThe teacher, Alex Garcez, discovered that your brain loves speed, and he thinks that fast is fun - slow is boring! If you like playing video games you already know that, the faster it gets, the more exciting the game becomes. If you think you have short attention span to read books, documents and social media, then you probably read slowly and carefully. Instead of understanding the text you get bored and distracted, needing to skip back to re-read text countless times. The main reason is that your brain is too powerful to go at such a slow pace and will drift off into something more interesting to think about.\nAlex Garcez gave up his Engineering degree in the third year because he was a very slow reader, however, his weakness became his strength, after taking a speed reading course, and deciding he was not going to become a laborer but an entrepreneur. Since then he took a Business Degree, Masters in Marketing and Advertising, and developed the Revolution Speed Reading Method. He personally coached more than 3,500 people and more than 95% of his clients improved their reading performance by at least 33%. In fact most of his clients improve their reading speed by more than 100%.\nWith more than 9,000 clients taking this two hour course online in 53 countries, Alex expects to motivate people to read more books. His method is based on science, and he has achieved amazing results while coaching professionals from companies such as: Goldman Sachs, GE, J P Morgan, Google, Bloomberg, eBay, The Wall Street Journal, Sage, The Walt Disney Company, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Thomson Reuters, Adecco, Lloyds Bank, Citigroup, PwC, HSBC and O2.\nYou will assess your reading speed at the beginning and throughout the course. So, if you spend 3 hours reading at work and improve your reading speed, on average, by 33%, you will save a whole month of work every single year.\nYou can find more information at www.thespeedreadingcoach.com\nTake this ultimate course Speed Reading Course for IT right now and learn how to read fast.\nAttention: This course has similar content to the You Can Read 33% Faster course because it is foundational.",

Como puedes ver en el currículo del curso, está estructurado en tres módulos:\nMotivación (manual de instrucciones del cerebro). Descubrirás cuál es tu capacidad de estudio actual, tu inteligencia, tus talentos y cómo aprendes más fácilmente. Porqué recuerdas algunos datos y otros los olvidas y cómo usar el proceso de memorización - que es inconsciente - a tu voluntad.\nEstrategia de Estudio (técnicas de lectura rápida, de memorización y de estudio). Es la parte que tiene el mayor peso y te ayudará a sistematizar tu forma de estudiar. Aumentarás tu velocidad de lectura y de comprensión; aprenderás reducir tu temario sin perder su esencia y a plasmarlo en mapas mentales. A memorizar de forma precisa y a largo plazo. Y a estudiar de un modo u otro en función del tipo de examen al que te presentes.\nAuto-Confianza (para que nada te frene a la hora de conseguir el objetivo por el cual realizas este curso). Profundizarás en el funcionamiento de tu mente y en cómo gestionar el estrés y los nervios para enfrentarte a cualquier tipo de examen u oposición.\nComprobarás que la manera de aprobar no es luchar al máximo, sino estudiar de otra forma. Se trata de un sistema de enseñanza con un enfoque holístico, que busca el desarrollo de tus capacidades potenciales.\nEl curso es 100% práctico: tras una explicación teórica procederemos a la puesta en práctica para que integres todo el contenido a medida que realizas el curso. Se incluyen ejercicios y materiales en pdf, en audio, tests, etntre otros formatos.\nSólo de ti dependerá que lo practiques y compruebes los extraordinarios resultados que se obtienen.

But the 3 parts above are really the key to learning something when you have a curriculum in front of you, which is common when you are in school.\nThe reason why this course is important is because self learning takes one key person out of the equation...your teacher.\nYou pick your school, and you let them figure out who the best teachers are.\nBut when you are learning on your own, you don't have that certainty of knowing that you have a good teacher leading you on the right path towards learning your chosen subject matter.\nInstead, you have hundreds of Youtube videos, thousands of books and millions of articles all competing to teach your the same subject matter.\nSo the question becomes, how do you choose where to learn from among all these options?\nHow do you know you are on the right path?\nAre you even looking in the right places?\nAre you spending too much money? Or not enough?\nHere's a thought exercise for you:\nPick any subject you want to learn...just pick one, and imagine that you are now a student learning that subject at an ivy league school with the top expert in the world teaching you.\nExcept it's 30 years ago, mid 1980s.\nDo you still want to learn from that person today?\nIs information that is 30 years old still relevant and useful to you?\nMaybe, but for many of you the answer is no.\nLook at almost any domain of knowledge, especially the ones related to skills of the future, and you will find that information gets old very quickly.\n(And on the flip side, often times the classics from hundreds or thousands of years ago are better than any more modern treatment.)\nSo why go through this whole exercise?\nBecause research isn't just about getting \"good\" information, it's about getting the information that is useful right now.\nAnd much of what is easily available online is outdated.\nBut it's hard to know this when you don't know anything about how a certain field of knowledge is progressing. What was true and right and the best way 5 years ago is usually not what the thought leaders are doing today.\nAnd if you are an entrepreneur, or looking to find a new career or do something on the side, you know that part of the secret to success is knowing about trends before they happen.\nBefore I finish here, I want to ask you one more question:\nHow much time should you spend planning a project before you actually get started doing it?\nThe answer most people give is 10 or 20%.\nBut most of them rarely spend this much time, especially on big decisions.\nLet's say you're going to learn that new subject you were thinking about earlier.\nRough estimate, maybe that is a 100 hour or 500 hour or 1000 hour skill.\nMeaning maybe you don't spend that time to get to a beginner level, but that is the total time you will spend for the rest of your life using and developing and learning that skill.\nLife long learning at it's core (Shout out to Scott).\nWhat that means is, even if you are a risk taker, you probably don't want to go below 10% for planning.\nAnd research is your \"planning\" stage for learning.\nIf it's a big time skill, maybe it's even more than 1000 hours. That means you should be spending ALOT more time researching than you probably are right now.\nIt's so important to get this part right.\nBecause if you learning the wrong framework, the wrong model, the wrong language, from the wrong teacher, you are going to have to re-learn that stuff later on, and at the same time fight off the old way of thinking.\nThat's why it takes pro golfers or NFL quarterbacks so long to fix their swing/throwing motion, because they have to undo thousands of hours of practice to build into muscle memory the new pattern.\nBut I get it, when you do the math it still does add up to a lot of hours, and you may be thinking, well...I already get enough out of Google. After a few pages the results aren't that good anymore anyways.\nWell, you are in for a surprise. Because this course is going to show you all the ways that most people never think about for how to spend that research time so that by the time you start, you are already in the fast lane and totally confident that you have the right info to learn going forward.\nResearch is the sleeper in the race because most people think they have it already figured out. It's the dark horse that will give you a permanent performance boost if you put your money on it.\nIf you're ready to ride, sign up above and let's get started.\nTimothy",

      "description": "Imagine transforming your brain into a supercharged learning machine that can memorize textbooks, master complex subjects, and retain information effortlessly.\nMemory palace techniques aren't just ancient tricks—they're scientifically proven methods that literally rewire your brain for superior performance.\nWhether you're a student drowning in study materials or a professional needing to learn faster, this complete system will revolutionize how you acquire and retain knowledge.\nMaster The Ancient Art That Modern Neuroscience Finally Explains\n• Build your first memory palace in under 30 minutes using familiar locations\n• Apply the Major System to memorize numbers, dates, and formulas instantly\n• Master advanced PAO techniques used by world memory champions\n• Implement AI-powered tools to create unlimited virtual memory environments\n• Transform abstract concepts into unforgettable visual stories\n• Develop spatial memory skills that work for any subject or profession\n• Access cutting-edge research on cognitive enhancement and brain plasticity\nThis isn't just memorization—it's cognitive transformation backed by 2,500 years of proven results.\nWhy is mastering memory palace techniques more crucial than ever? Recent fMRI studies by Eleanor Maguire at University College London revealed that memory champions don't have different brains—they simply use different strategies, activating spatial navigation regions that most people ignore. A groundbreaking 2017 study published in Neuron proved that ordinary people trained in the method of loci for just six weeks developed brain activity patterns identical to world champions.\nIn our information-overload era, where professionals consume 5x more data than a decade ago, those who can rapidly learn faster and retain complex information gain massive competitive advantages. Medical students memorize 20,000+ new terms, law students master thousands of legal precedents, and business professionals constantly upskill across multiple domains. The rise of AI makes human cognitive enhancement not just valuable, but essential for staying competitive.\nThe science is clear: your brain's hippocampus—the same structure that helped ancient humans remember where food grew and predators lurked—can be trained to encode any type of information with extraordinary efficiency.\nWhat You'll Learn In This Complete System\nYou'll master the complete memory palace system, from basic spatial encoding to advanced mnemonic techniques that compress massive amounts of information into single mental images. Starting with the foundational neuroscience—why your hippocampus is wired for spatial memory and how the Baker-baker paradox explains why some memories stick while others vanish—you'll progress through hands-on palace construction using your own familiar locations.\nThe course covers professional applications including the Major System for numerical data (transforming abstract numbers into concrete images), PAO compression for sequential information (the same technique used to memorize shuffled card decks in under 60 seconds), and symbolic encoding for abstract concepts like legal statutes or scientific formulas. You'll discover how to break down complex subjects into their essential components and weave them into unforgettable spatial narratives.\nAdvanced modules explore cutting-edge AI VR memory palace systems that provide unlimited mental real estate, cross-cultural techniques like the Russian \"vigor-motor\" method for multi-sensory encoding, and therapeutic applications being researched for cognitive health maintenance.\nWho This Course Is For\nStudents overwhelmed by textbook memorization who need to master large volumes of information quickly and efficiently.\nMedical and law students facing thousands of technical terms, procedures, and precedents.\nProfessionals learning complex technical skills, software systems, or industry regulations.\nLanguage learners building vocabulary in new languages.\nCertification candidates preparing for exams in IT, finance, healthcare, or other professional fields.\nLifelong learners seeking cognitive enhancement and mental agility.\nAnyone who feels frustrated by forgetting important information despite repeated studying.\nNo prior experience needed—just willingness to think differently about how your brain works and commitment to practicing proven techniques.\nCommon Concerns Addressed\n\"Isn't this just outdated memorization tricks from ancient times?\" → This course teaches evidence-based cognitive enhancement grounded in modern neuroscience. Recent studies published in The Lancet Neurology show memory palace training delays cognitive decline and builds lasting neural pathways. fMRI scans prove these techniques activate the same brain regions used by memory champions. You're learning skills that literally change your brain structure for permanent improvement.\n\"I don't have time for complex memory systems.\" → Each module takes 15-30 minutes and delivers immediately applicable techniques. The system is designed for busy professionals and students. You'll build your first functional memory palace in the opening lesson and start memorizing real information within the first hour. Many students report dramatic improvements after just the first week of practice.\n\"Will this actually work for modern, technical subjects?\" → Absolutely. Current students use these methods for medical school anatomy, law school case studies, programming languages, business certifications, and scientific formulas. The course includes specific frameworks for abstract concepts, technical terminology, and professional knowledge. Medical students memorize drug interactions, lawyers encode case precedents, and engineers learn complex specifications using these exact techniques.\n\"What about AI replacing human memory? Why not just look everything up?\" → AI enhances but doesn't replace spatial memory skills. While AI handles information retrieval, humans with superior cognitive abilities create connections, see patterns, and make decisions faster. The course shows how to leverage AI tools for palace creation while developing irreplaceable human cognitive abilities that complement technology rather than compete with it.\n\"I've tried memory techniques before and they didn't stick.\" → Most memory courses teach isolated tricks without explaining the underlying neuroscience or providing systematic practice. This course builds comprehensive skills through progressive modules, real-world applications, and understanding why techniques work. You'll develop lasting cognitive abilities, not temporary tricks.\nThe Science Behind Your Transformation\nNeuroscience reveals exactly why memory palace techniques work so powerfully. Your brain evolved sophisticated spatial navigation systems over millions of years—the same hippocampal networks that helped ancestors survive by remembering resource locations, safe paths, and dangerous territories. Memory palace techniques hijack these ancient, powerful circuits to encode any type of information with extraordinary efficiency.\nWhen you place a bizarre image in a familiar location, you're activating multiple brain regions simultaneously: spatial memory networks, visual processing centers, and emotional systems. This creates what researchers call \"elaborative encoding\"—transforming weak, abstract memories into rich, interconnected neural networks that resist forgetting.\nStudies show this approach increases retention by up to 300% compared to repetition-based methods. The technique works because it transforms abstract information into the type of spatial-visual memories your brain evolved to remember perfectly. Instead of fighting your brain's natural tendencies, you're working with millions of years of evolution.\nComplete Course Structure & Content\nModule 1: The Unshakable Foundation - Journey from Simonides in ancient Greece through modern neuroscience discoveries. Understand the Baker-baker paradox, hippocampus function, and why spatial memory dominates abstract memorization. Build scientific confidence in the approach.\nModule 2: Architectural Blueprints - Choose perfect palace locations from your existing knowledge, master the art of creating unforgettable images, and complete your first 20-item memorization using professional encoding techniques. Hands-on practice with immediate results.\nModule 3: Advanced Systems - Master the Major System for converting numbers into memorable images, PAO compression for complex sequences, and symbolic frameworks for academic subjects. Apply techniques to real-world information from your field.\nModule 4: The 21st Century Mnemonist - Manage multiple palaces without interference, overcome memory ghosting effects, and leverage AI VR memory palace technology for unlimited expansion. Future-proof your skills with cutting-edge tools.\nExtra Modules- Explore Renaissance memory systems from Giordano Bruno, cross-cultural techniques from Chinese and Russian traditions, and clinical applications for cognitive health based on recent medical research. Exclusive content not available elsewhere.\n\n\nYour Cognitive Transformation Starts Now\nMemory palace mastery isn't just about remembering more—it's about thinking differently, learning faster, and developing cognitive confidence that transforms every area of your life. Students report improved academic performance, faster professional advancement, and genuine excitement about learning again.\nThis system works whether you're 22 or 72, studying your first degree or pursuing advanced certifications. Your brain's spatial memory networks remain powerful throughout life and can be strengthened at any age.\nJoin thousands of students who've already revolutionized their learning capabilities and discovered cognitive abilities they never knew they possessed.\nClick \"Enroll Now\" and unlock the full potential of your mind.

So absorb this page completely until the very end while you still can. Deal?\n\n\nDon’t Just Look Like A Genius - Be One.\nWalk with me for a moment as we imagine you waking up tomorrow being able to do lightning fast math in your head.\nYour family and friends are going to look at you like you are some kind of a genius. Since calculations are done in your head, you would have acquired better memory habits in the process, and your concentration and your ability to think quickly would have also improved.\nSo you will not just look like a genius. You will actually be one.\nYou know what the best part is?\nWithin the next 7 days, you will start thinking like a genius. This will in turn start to positively influence other areas of your life.\nFirst, I must tell you why we find it so difficult to do math in our head.\nSchool Taught You The Wrong Way To Do Math\nWe use so much of our working memory when we do math the way we have been taught in school. Working memory is the short term memory required for you to complete a task. Think of it like the RAM of your computer.\nDoing math in our head the way we have been taught in school, overloads our working memory, slowing down our brain like an over loaded computer.\nWe end up struggling with even the basic math skills we have otherwise mastered.\nStop Doing Math The Way You Have Been Taught In School\nThe way you have been taught math in school is what slows you down, I will show you what I mean with an example:\nTry to multiply the 73201 x 3.\n1 x 3 =\n0 x 3 =\n2 x 3 =\n3 x 3 =\n7 x 3 =\nThis is an easy multiplication problem and in fact it would only take most people seconds to multiply the individual numbers. However to get the final answer, you need to remember every single digit you calculated so far to put them together.\nYou might even end up multiplying again because you forgot one of the numbers. So it might take quite a bit of effort to get the answer of the multiplication. Mental math will become a whole lot easier if you didn’t have to use so much of your working memory.\nIn school, we have been taught to write down the numbers on a paper to free up working memory. But there is another way, and I will show you that in a moment.\nImagine when we tried to multiply 73201 x 3, if you could have come up with the answer in the time it took you to multiply the individual numbers. Wouldn’t you have solve the problem faster than the time it takes you to punch in the numbers inside a calculator? I will show you how to do that in a moment, so keep reading.\nA Weird Trick to Calculate Faster\nBefore we get into the actual method of calculating in your head fast without writing anything down, I need to tell you about a weird trick that made me go from hating math to making math my full time job.\nWhen we try to do math, we sometimes have sweaty palms, feel nervous and find it hard to concentrate. This phenomenon is called math anxiety and it will only slow you down. Most of us suffer from math anxiety of various degrees.\nYou might think you are anxious about math, because you are bad at it. But it’s often the other way around. You are doing poorly in math, because you are anxious about it.\nMath anxiety decreases your working memory. Worrying about being able to solve a math problem, eats up working memory leaving less of it available to tackle the math itself. So you can struggle with even basic math skills like arithmetic that you have otherwise mastered.\nYour new math super power is not going to make you a super hero unless you relax. If you ever feel math anxiety, take a few deep breaths and you will actually be able to do the math faster. Use the knowledge about how your working memory works to create a mindset where you enjoy doing math.\nSee math as a challenge that will expand the limits of your intelligence. Do this and you will increase your mental math calculation speed even further.\nCan you see yourself not only doing math fast but also enjoying yourself being a mental math super hero?\nDo The Opposite Of What You Have Been Taught In School\nOk, remember what I told you earlier about how the way we have been taught math in school requires us to remember a lot of numbers?\nThe secret of doing mental math fast in your head is to do the OPPOSITE of what you have been in taught in school. This is called the LR Method.\nLet me tell you, if you do not do this, any trick you can possibly learn to do mental math, will really be useless. This secret is like the rocket fuel for your mental math skill. Everything else just builds on top of this.\nThis works so well because it frees your working memory almost completely. You will be using the absolute minimum amount of working memory.\nLR stands for Left to Right.\nThe secret of doing mental math is to calculate from left to right instead of from right to left. This is the opposite of what you have been taught in school.\nLets try to do the earlier example where we multiplied 73201 x 3.\nThis time multiply from left to right, so we get\n7 x 3 = 21\n3 x 3 = 9\n3 x 2 = 6\n0 x 3 = 0\n3 x 1 = 3\nNotice that you started to call out the answer before you even finished the whole multiplication problem. You don’t have to remember a thing to recall and use later. So you end up doing math a lot faster.\nIn our example, we used a one digit multiplier 3. Imagine calculating with the same speed for more complex numbers like two and three digit multipliers eg (73201 x 38 or 73201 x 432). Imagine doing addition, subtraction and division with the same speed.\nLet me tell you that this is as ridiculously simple as multiplying using the LR method.\nYou have two choices in front of you:\nOption 1 - You could use what you learnt about calculating from left to right and apply it to every math problem you solve in the future.\nIt might not be very easy to figure out how to do this in every situation and you might find it confusing on your own. Which brings us to our savvy Option 2.\nOption 2 - This is the quickest, easiest and smartest way to do math in your head and it will change the way you do math forever.\nI have already done the work for you. Why start from scratch and try to reinvent the wheel, when there is already a proven and tested system you can immediately apply.\nA system that has been used by countless thousands of men and women across all ages to do math faster in their head than in a calculator. This is what the vast majority of people decided to do and its called Ofpad Mental Math Program.\nIntroducing Ofpad Mental Math Program From The School Of Genius\nThe Ofpad Mental Math Program is the only system to do math in your head faster than a calculator making math your new super power.\nThese radically simple techniques for mental math will work for you, EVEN IF you hate math and are terrible at math to begin with or even if you have tried everything.\nNo Pen & Paper Required - No Complicated Rules For Special Situations\nTo save your time, and mine, let me be upfront and tell you what Ofpad Mental Math Program is NOT, before I tell you what it is…\nYou will not find complicated rules that work for specific situations in this program. Instead you will learn broad concepts that you can apply to all types of arithmetic problems.\nYou will not find math techniques that will require you to use a pen and paper.\nReplicate The Success Of Mental Math Geniuses\nRather the mental math program is the product of analyzing the techniques used by over 27 mental math geniuses across the world from countries including Sweden, India (Vedic Math) and China.\nI uncovered these hidden patterns and unique (sometimes 'odd') tactics they use to do math with super human speed. What is remarkable about this system is it is so simple that even a child can do it.\nAnd now, starting TODAY, their success can be your success.\nThe strategies of these math geniuses can NOW be duplicated easily by you, giving you the power of using math and numbers in life, as you enjoy an improved memory and a laser sharp concentration all while you calculate faster than you ever dreamed possible.\nWarning: This Course Is Not For Everyone\nThere are some people I simply do not want to give a copy of this course to... and I mean NO offense. I just don't want you to waste your time and money. Fair?\nOfpad mental math program is WRONG for you if you are looking for that “Magic Pill” that will make you a genius in seconds, something you already know will never ever work in practice.\nIf that is what you want, then you need to leave this page right now.\nAfter you watch the videos in the program you will immediately start calculating in your head faster than before. However for the techniques to become second nature to you, you will have to do the practice exercises that come with the course. So don’t think you can become a math genius without practice.\nWho This Course Is For\nThe Ofpad Mental Math program isn't your fantasy land nonsense. It's the real deal, and it is only for folks like you who are really serious about improving their intelligence and who are willing to put in the time to practise and hone this new skill.\nWhile doing math in your head isn't \"easy\" (nothing worthwhile is), with the Ofpad Mental Math program I have made mental math as easy as it can get.\nSo, if you're like most folks reading this, and you're 100% ready to learn the real secrets of doing mental math faster than a calculator, here's what you can expect:\nSo, if you really want to:\nMake math and numbers more useful\nDevelop better memory habits\nIncrease concentration\nAnd do math in entirely in your head faster than a calculator\nThen Ofpad Mental Math Program isn't just \"a\" solution for you it's the ONLY solution for you!\nHere is What You Can Expect In Each Lesson:\nLesson 1. Introduction To Mental Math – You will learn how the course is structured and will get a taste on how to do mental math by learning the age old trick to multiply by 11.\nLesson 2. LR Addition & Subtraction – We will take the LR method we learnt and apply it to addition and subtraction. You will learn variation of the LR method in this module.\nLesson 3. LR Multiplication – We take the LR method we learnt and take it to the next level. You can learn just this and nothing else and you will be calculating lightning fast.\nLesson 4. Basic Multiplication – This lesson was added for completeness of the course, we will cover really large multiplication with smaller numbers from 3 to 12. Most students choose to use the LR Multiplication but this lesson is there for those who want more.\nLesson 5. Squaring – You will learn how to square numbers quickly in this lesson.\nLesson 6 & 7. Advanced Multiplication – LR Method is difficult for really large numbers. This is where this module comes in and we will cover multiplication with the Bridge & Vitruvian man method.\nLesson 8. UT Method – Another technique to multiply really large and complex numbers quickly and efficiently.\nLesson 9. FP Division – You can use this technique to divide numbers quickly in your head. This will take quite a bit of practice to truly master.\nLesson 10. DS Checking – Finally you will learn how to check the answer of any arithmetic problem quickly with 99% accuracy.\nBonus: Limited Time Bonus For Next Batch of Students\nNow, you're not just receiving Ofpad Mental Math Program today. For the next batch of students, I am giving away the weekly training material as an added bonus to practise after completing this course.\nThis bonus will be priced at an additional $97 for the later batch of students, because that is the cost we have to bear to deliver it to our students.\nHowever I am giving this as a value added bonuses free of charge, just to help you master mental math after completing the course.\nYou will only get this bonus if you join before we get enough students to close enrollments for next batch.\nWhy The Price Is Just $65\nThe Ofpad Pad Mental Math Program sold by itself is valued at $297. Even without the bonus, it's a steal at that price. And, when you add in the bonuses, the retail value of Ofpad Mental Math Program is $297 + $97 = $394\nHowever, only for the next batch of students, the price is dropped to $65.\nThere are two reasons for this discount:\nFirst this is the first time I am offering this program online and we need enough students to get feedback and improve this course even further.\nSecond, let me share my vision with you: it's a CAUSE I'm inviting you to join today.\nNot too long ago, I gave myself a goal: I dedicated myself to helping at least 1,000,000 men and women improve their own lives, by giving them the knowledge they need, to realize their life’s full potential.\nSince then I have helped thousands of people, through Ofpad’s website and the people I have helped, help create a better world by helping others or creating and doing things that was otherwise impossible.\nSo, I came to the decision that I need to let as many men and women into this cause as possible for the benefit of everyone. A cause I call: Awaken The Genius Within\nThis course was created as a way to fund this cause and help make the cause more self-sustainable.\nThe Good News?\nYou are one of the first founding students. That means a MUCH lower price for you today...because frankly, I want you to join my cause, and I refuse to let finances stop you!\n30 DAY - 100% Money Back - Triple Guarantee\nI know this might still be a large investment for you and I know it can be a bummer to waste money on something that does not work.\nSo don't decide right now... Take advantage of my Unconditional \"Triple Guarantee\":\nJust try the Ofpad Mental Math Program for 30 days and\nIf you are not calculating with the speed you expect at the end of 30 days OR\nIf you do not start calculating faster in 48 hours after completing the program OR\nIf you are not happy with the program for any other reason\nJust let me know and I will say thank you for trying and will refund every penny you invest in this program.\nNo questions asked, no hassles, and no hard feelings.\nI have a feeling that is not going to happen. But I just want you to know that the option is there, so your investment today is going to be 100% risk free.\nBad News: Price Will Go Up As Soon As We Have Enough Students\nRemember we are giving this at this ridiculous discount only to our founding students. Once we get enough students, the price will be moved closer to the actual value.\nSo you risk coming back at a later date or even a few minutes from now to see the price go. So lock in on your discounted price while you still can.\nJoin The School Of Genius\nRemember: It's not just a fantastic bargain you'll be receiving today. You'll be joining in on one of the biggest movements in history. Plus, you'll join the ever growing Ofpad community.\nNot to mention the fact you'll make a whole new group of friends that will help you progress, stay inspired, and have more fun along the road to success!\nClick on the green button that says \"Buy Now\" and lock in your discounted price today!\nYou'll be granted immediate access to everything in the Ofpad Mental Math Program.\nClick \"Buy Now\"!",

      "description": "NLP Lernstrategien\nLerne schnell ohne viel zu üben und rufe dein Wissen sicher und zuverlässig ab - in jedem Alter!\nNeutralisiere schlechte Prüfungs-Erfahrungen wie z.B. einen Blackout und löse Prüfungsängste auf\nWusstest du schon…\n…in der Psychologie versteht man unter Lernen jede Veränderung von Verhalten und Erleben – nicht nur das Aneignen von Wissen…\n…am besten funktioniert Lernen mit guter Laune…\n…und Lernen macht glücklich, weil Aha-Erlebnisse das Körpereigene Belohnungssystem stimulieren uns so das Glückshormon Dopamin freigesetzt wird!\nLernen lernen geht leicht mit NLP!\nIn diesem Kurs geht es darum zu erkennen, ob es sich bei Lernschwierigkeiten um  Speicher- oder Abrufprobleme handelt.\nWeiterhin erlernst du grundsätzliche Lernstrategien, wie\nRichtiges Visualisieren\nEin inneres Ordnungssystem erschaffen, um Fehler zuverlässig auszusortieren\nEinen inneren Helfer etablieren\nZugehörigkeit stiften\nPrüfungsängste (Abrufprobleme) meistern\nDu erhältst eine komplette Unterrichtssequenz zum Thema NLP-Lerncoaching, also genau das - oder sogar etwas mehr, was du in ca. zwei Tagen einer nlpaed-zertifizierten Lerncoach-Ausbildung  lernst. In diesem Film gehe ich besonders auf grundsätzliches Vorgehen  beim Lerncoaching ein. Weitere Lerncoach-Filme zu speziellen Lernthemen werden folgen.\nEs ist günstig, wenn du dir auch die anderen NLP Lerncoach Filme ansiehst.\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach Teil 2 geht es um das Lernen von Sprachen. Oft bietet die Rechtschreibestrategie jedoch einen guten Einstieg für das Thema visuelles Lerne\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach 3: Dyskalkulie / Rechnen /  Mathematikverständnis / Umgang mit Textaufgaben / Formeln speichern und abrufen lernst du, wie du dich erfolgreich mit dem Thema Mathematik anfreunden kannst.\nim Videokurs NLP Lerncoach 4 findest du Themen rund um das Thema Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration / Schaffen eines motivierenden Arbeitsplatzes / ein optimales Zeitmanagement / Verbesserung des Schriftbildes.\nIm NLP Lerncoach 5 geht es darum, Prüfungen effektiv vorzubereiten, große Wissensmengen schnell und leicht zu lernen, Wissen zu vernetzen und Wissen im inneren Raum gut erreichbar abzuspeichern.Du erhältst ein ausführliches Händout mit Erklärungen und Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitungen sowie Trancen, die du für dich selbst und andere nutzen kannst.\nIm Kurs findest du Demonstrationen mit unterschiedlichen echten Coachees die echte Themen vor der Kamera lösen!\nIn den Demos gefilmte Themen:\nDemo mit Meryem: Meryem hatte starke Probleme mit der Rechschreibung. In der Demo erhält sie ein mentales inneres Ordnungssystem, um korrekt erinnerete Wörter von Fehlschreibungen zu trennen. Fehler werden so aussortiert und eindeutig korrektes Wissen kann in Zukunft zuverlässig abgerufen werden.\nDemo mit Gudrun (mir selbst) - hier ist Marius mein Coach: Ich hatte eine hohe Fehlerquote beim Drehen des Teasers (der Kursvorstellung). Diese Fehler entstanden dadurch, dass ich beim Drehen des ersten Udemy-Teasers stark unter Druck stand, da ich in möglichst kurzer Zeit alles Wesentliche auf den Punkt bringen sollte / wollte. Dadurch kam es zu Versprechern und ich musste immer wieder neu starten. In der Demo habe ich alle Fehler-Filme aussortiert, mir eine klare innere Struktur erschaffen und danach den Teaser auf Anhieb korrekt gedreht.\nDemo mit Marius: Marius erhält einen inneren Helfer, der für ihn Aufgaben als unbewusste Routine übernimmt. Marius hat bisher nur unregelmäßig gesund für sich gekocht, obwohl er genug Zutaten im Kühlschrank hatte. Der innere Helfer erinnert ihn nun daran, was er leckeres daraus zaubern kann und wann die beste Zeit zum Kochen ist.\nDemo mit Marius: Marius möchte zu den Menschen gehören, die sich auch in bunter Kleidung wohlfühlen. In der Demo erweitert er seine Zugehörigkeit von Menschen, die sich nur in schwarzer oder grauer Kleidung wohlfühlen durch die Gruppe der Menschen, die sich auch in bunter Kleidung wohlfühlen. Nun gehört er der Gruppe von Menschen an, die sich immer wohlfühlen - egal welche Farbe ihre Kleidung hat.\nDemo mit Lara: Lara überwindet mithilfe des integrierten Augenbeweungsprozesses die Abneigung gegen das Thema Schreiben\nDemo mit Janes (Marius als Coach): Janes hat viele belastende Erfahrungen während seiner Schulzeit gemacht. Diese werden mithilfe des integrierten Augenbeweguingsprozesses zu Ende verarbeitet, damit Janes seine Rechtschreibeprobleme lösen kann.\nDemo mit Marius: Marius verarbeitet belastende Erfahrungen aus der Schulzeit mithilfe des integrierten Augenbewegungsprozesses zu Ende\nDemo mit Niklas (Niklas ist blind!): Niklas verarbeitet alte Ängste, die  an Störgeräusche geknüpft sind, zu Ende.\nDemo mit Satu: Satu hatte in der Vergangenheit bei einer wichtigen Prüfung einen Blackout und musste diese Prüfung wiederholen. Seither hatte sie massive Prüfungsängste. Da in einigen Wochen eine wichtige Prüfung ansteht, möchte sie diese Prüfungsängste auflösen. In der Demo seht ihr, wie Satu die alten Blackout-Erfahrungen durch Anleiten von Augenbewegungen verarbeitet und neutralisiert und anschließend mit Hilfe eines Ruhe-Ankers einplant, wie sie die Prüfung gelassen und souverän meistert.\nDemo mit Rabea (28 Jahre)  Sie war ein Frühchen und hat Lernprobleme. Sie hat bei ihrer Ausbildung zur Hauswirtschafterin die Praktische Prüfung nicht bestanden, weil sie sehr gestresst war. Dies Prüfungsängste neutralisiert Rabea mithilfe eines Gelassenheitsankers. Den geankerten Zustand bringt Rabea zusätzlich in ihr komplettes Leben ab der ersten Zelle ein, um weitere Stressfaktoren, wie die Frühgeburt zu neutralisieren.\nDemo mit Madita (17 Jahre): Madita hat Prüfungsängste. Besonders im Fach Mathematik kann sie ihr vorhandenes Wissen in Arbeiten nicht abrufen.\nUm die Prüfungsängste zu meistern, setze ich mit Madita einen Anker für Gelassenheit, das Angst mit lockerer Muskulatur nicht eempfunden werden kann. Stresshormone, die zu Abrufproblemen führen, werden durch angespannte Muskulatur ausgeschüttet.\nWenn du dich für weitere spezielle Lerncoachingthemen interessierst, findest du weitere NLP-Lerncoaching-Filme von uns:\nIm Videokurs  NLP-Lerncoach Teil 2 geht es um das Lernen von Sprachen. Oft bietet die Rechtschreibestrategie jedoch einen guten Einstieg für Menschen, die Probleme mit Mathematik haben. Sie sind oft besser in Sprachen und fühlen sich wohler, wenn sie das Visualisieren von Wissensinhalten zunächst an einem beliebteren Thema einüben.\nWeitere Lerncoach-Filme zu folgenden Themen sind geplant:\nNLP-Lerncoach 3: Themen rund um Mathematik, wie Mengen und Ziphern zuordnen, Das 1 x 1 mit Ergebnissen visuell abspeichern, Textaufgaben verstehen und lösen, Formeln schnell speichern und sicher abrufen.\nNLP-Lerncoach 4: Themen rund um die Steuerung der Aufmerksamkeit / ADS / ADHS / einen motivierenden Arbeitzsplatz ankern/ das Schriftbild verbessern\nNLP-Lerncoach 5: Hier geht es darum, Prüfungen effektiv vorzubereiten, große Wissensmengen schnell und leicht zu lernen, Wissen zu vernetzen und Wissen im inneren Raum gut erreichbar abzuspeichern.Die Kursen zum Thema Lerncoaching sind einerseits für Menschen jeden Alters geeignet, die sich selbst mit dem Thema Lernen beschäftigen, ihre eigenen Lernstrategien hinterfragen und optimieren möchten. Andererseits für Menschen, die andere als Coach beim Lernen unterstützen möchten. Coachees können Kinder oder Erwachsene jeder Altersstufe sein.\nNLP bietet eine Reihe nützlicher Strategien zu den klassischen Themen Rechtschreibung, Lesen, Textverständnis, Vokabellernen, Lernen von Regeln, Rechnen, Textaufgaben, Mathematikverständnis, Organisieren komplexer Lernaufgaben, innere Ordnung schaffen, Konzentration, große Wissensmengen schnell und sicher lernen, etc..\nDas einzige, was in einem Videokurs nicht leistbar ist, sind Antworten auf Verständnisfragen, Übungsgruppen und das Feedback zu deinen Erfahrungen in den Übungsgruppen... das solltest du dir entweder selbst organisieren, damit du alles Gezeigte trainieren kannst oder an unseren Online-Übungsabenden teilnehmen. Die Termine dafür teilen wir dir mit. Fragen kannst du natürlich auch stellen, wenn du Kontakt zu mir aufnimmst.\nWenn du einen Lerncoach-Kurs besuchst, kannst du das Videomaterial als wertvolle Ergänzung nutzen, denn du weißt ja, dass NLP eine Methode ist, die durch Modelllernen vermittelt wird. Je mehr Demonstrationen du zu einem Thema kennst, umso leichter wird es für dich, das Wesentliche herauszufiltern. Du lernst, an den individuellen Coaching-Bedarf angepasste Variationen des Vorgehens kennen und kannst dadurch souveräner mit eigenen Blockaden und Themen von Coachees umgehen.\nDer Kurs ist sowohl für Anfänger / Einsteiger ins NLP geeignet, als auch zur Vertiefung der Kenntnisse für fortgeschrittene NLP-Anwender.\nDie Trancen sind bestens für die Selbstanwendung geeignet - du kannst dich durch das jeweilige Format führen lassen oder die Trancen auch zur Anleitung deiner Coachees nutzen\nNLP (Neuro Linguistisches Programmieren) ist in allen beruflichen Bereichen, in denen Lernen, Kommunikation, Beratungskompetenz sowie gelungene Selbststeuerung einen wesentlichen Anteil hat, von großem Nutzen.\nNLP ist eine Methode, die zunächst durch Modeling von Höchstleistungen entstand. Ursprünglich ging es dabei um effektive Psychotherapie. Die Methode hat sich inzwischen in vielen weiteren Bereichen etabliert, wie: Personalwesen, Führung, Werbung, Vertrieb, Kundenzufriedenheit, Gesundheit, Physiotherapie, Coaching, Seminargestaltung und Training, Sport und natürlich in allen sozialen Berufen wie Psychologie, Pädagogik, Sozial-Pädagogik, Coaching, Beratung, Schule und Erziehung...\n... Und natürlich ist NLP eine hervorragende Methode der Persönlichkeitsentwicklung.\nDu kannst...\nschnell große Mengen Wissensstoff sowie praktische Vorgehensweisen lernen\ndeine Ziele erreichen\nvergangene Ereignisse bereinigen und gestärkt aus ihnen hervorgehen\ndein Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstvertrauen verbessern\ndein Lebensglück und deine Zufriedenheit steigern\ndeine Überzeugungen und Glaubenssätze optimieren\nNLP als Methoden der Achtsamkeit und Meditation nutzen\ndeine innere Verfassung positiv beeinflussen\ndeine Gesundheit verbessern...\n...denn gute Stimmung und schnelles Überwinden von Stress-Zuständen unterstützt die Funktion deines Immunsystems.\ndeine Spiritualität fördern\n...",

      "description": "BOOST YOUR LEARNING AND BECOME TOP ACHIEVER\nby Dr. T. G. Arora\nLearning starts the day we are born and it is a lifelong process; knowingly or unknowingly. There is difference between “to study” and “to learn”. Study is our effort to learn something by reading, listening or observation whereas learning is understanding, remembering, recalling and applying it at appropriate time and at appropriate place. Learning involves three factors; the learner (his/her learning ability), learning methods and the material being learnt. In an exam the material to be learnt is the same. It is the learner and his/her learning methods which decide the grade and rank in the exam. This course focuses on the learner and learning methods.\nTo accelerate the learning, the course will guide you to train in relaxation, Alpha meditation and visualization. Research in the area of brain, neurons, brain waves and sub conscious mind reveals that in the Alpha state, the brain is more energetic, left and right hemisphere of the brain work in harmony and there is better coordination between sub-conscious and conscious mind. In this course you will learn Alpha meditation to increase your brain power and tap the power of sub-conscious mind. This will improve concentration, memory, problem solving ability and much more.\nThere is one thing common between all successful and unsuccessful people and that is time. Both get 24 hours time per day! Successful people make best use of time; their learning is fast; they have better understanding, concentration, memory and problem solving skills. They learn more in less time and their learning is long lasting. They knowingly or unknowingly, by virtue, have learnt the methods to learn efficiently and effectively. Anybody who masters the learning techniques can succeed in life. In this course you will learn the techniques to improve the learning ability and performance.\nThe course has become lengthy as the practice sessions to train you in relaxation, Alpha meditation and visualization are included. Also precautions to be taken during these sessions are explained in depth. The course is presented in simple way. The ALPHA Meditation and visualization once mastered can be used for improvements in personality and achieving success in all walks of life.\nIF WE INVEST A LITTLE TIME TO LEARN BETTER, WE WILL PERFORM BETTER\nWhat you will be able to do after completing this course?\nAfter completing this course you will be able to,\n§ Learn faster any activity, skill, game, sport, hobby\n§ Improve concentration for studies\n§ Understand the concepts in better way\n§ Remember the learnt material for longer time\n§ Recall the learnt material effortlessly\n§ Improve the problem solving ability\n§ Make best use of the class room teaching\n§ Manage your time efficiently\n§ Check your progress yourself by feedback table\n§ Improve your grades in examination\n§ Improve your ranking in entrance and competitive exams\n§ Refresh your body and mind in just 20 minutes by simple relaxation technique\n§ Improve creativity through visualization\n§ Use Alpha Meditation for personal developments\n\n\nWhy you should join this course?\n§ To boost your brain power and programming the mind to become top achiever\n§ To learn effective and efficient learning techniques\n§ To improve grades in board/university examinations and ranking in entrance and competitive exams\n§ To make the efficient use of your time\n§ To master the activity, skill, game, sport and hobby you wish to learn\n§ To learn to refresh your body and mind in just 20 minutes by relaxation technique\n§ To improve creativity by visualization\n§ To use Alpha Meditation for personal development",

It also feels more like a personal course than it does someone just talking at you. It was also just a friendly and calm course; it was almost refreshing to turn to the next section.\nI also loved the extra bit of guidance at the end for people with dyslexia. I don't personally have it but it was nice that those with possible reading difficulties were addressed as well.\"",

      "description": "Inteligência faz parte da Natureza de qualquer Ser Humano. Todos nós temos capacidades cognitiva ilimitada. O nosso Cérebro é capaz de aprender qualquer coisa que queremos. Quando dizem que a Inteligência é privilégio de alguns, isso não passa de pura mentira. Nós somos capazes, o nosso Cérebro é capaz. Não importa a nossa etnia, idade, raça, status social, ou seja lá o que for, nós somos capazes de aprender quaisquer coisas que queiramos.\nO que nos impede de aumentar essa nossa capacidade inata são barreiras do inconsciente. Essas barreiras acontecem por conta de alguma falha que cometemos no passado e, por causa disso, somos rotulados de incapazes. Não somente isso. Quando vemos algum colega se dando melhor que nós na escola, nós achamos que fomos privados de inteligência e isso fica impregnado na nossa Mente Subconsciente e quando chegamos na fase adulta, essa nossa mente executa aquilo que programamos durante toda a nossa infância e, desde então, sentimos dificuldades de aprender.\nO Projeto “Super Inteligência” tem o objetivo de quebrar essas barreiras mentais e levar você a um outro nível, o nível onde todos poderemos aprender quaisquer coisas. Neste Projeto você fará exercícios que irão estimular o seu Córtex Pré-Frontal que é responsável pela nossa aprendizagem e inteligência. Além disso, você terá a Onda Isocrônica específica para ativar essa parte cerebral para você aumentar a sua capacidade cognitiva.\nAlém dos Isocrônicos, nós temos os Solfeggios que irão trabalhar intensamente no seu Subconsciente para eliminar, como uma bomba nuclear, toda e qualquer barreira mental que impeça você de aumentar a sua capacidade inata, ou seja, aumentar a sua inteligência.\n\n\nAqui você poderá ter os seguintes benefícios com os Isocrônicos:\nAumentar a Capacidade Cerebral;\nTer a chance de Aprender com mais Facilidade;\nAprender mais Rapidamente;\nAumentar a sua Auto-Estima;\nAprender algo Novo;\nAprender um novo Idioma;\nE muito mais;\n\n\nJá os Solfeggios, que nesse caso funciona também como um suporte, irá trazer os benefícios:\nVai eliminar os sentimentos de culpa do passado por algum fracasso cometido;\nVai te colocar em sintonia com o seu Eu Superior e mostrar a sua capacidade Inata;\nVocê terá mais facilidade de se Socializar com outras Pessoas;\nInteligência Emocional;\nEliminação de energias estagnadas que impedem a aprendizagem;\nE vários outros benefícios destas frequências;\n\n\nOs Isocrônicos, além de atuar diretamente no Córtex Pré-Frontal, ele serve como um guia para os Solfeggios atuarem no que está no mais profundo do seu Subconsciente.\n\n\nA seguir, veja a atuação de cada Frequências de Solfeggios em conjunto com o Isocrônico Beta 14Hz:\n174Hz - Esta frequência terá o objetivo de dar uma sensação de segurança ao seu Cérebro;\n285Hz - Envia mensagens para o seu campo de energia para reestruturar qualquer problema que você tenha em seu órgão;\n396Hz - Vai liberar você do sentimento de Culpa ou Medo que você adquiriu no passado e que impediram você de aumentar a sua Capacidade Cognitiva;\n417Hz - Limpeza de qualquer limitações mentais;\n528Hz - Aumento de Clareza Mental;\n639Hz - Capacidade de se relacionar com outras pessoas de forma harmoniosa;\n741Hz - Esta frequência irá levar você a uma vida pura e estável;\n852Hz - Quebra de bloqueios que impedem você de se comunicar com o seu Eu Superior;\n963Hz - Aqui você experimenta a sua verdadeira Natureza, ou seja, a sua Capacidade Inata;\n\n\nEstas frequências citadas acima é potencializada através do Poder de Visualização que é ensinadas nos exercícios neste projeto. Então, aproveite cada momento, se abra para estas frequências poderosas e veja com os seus próprios olhos o tamanho da sua capacidade.\nVocê é capaz e isso é um fato incontestável. Você pode alcançar qualquer objetivo que queira e isso depende única e exclusivamente da sua força de vontade de querer. Não existe impossível para o nosso cérebro. O nosso cérebro é um Computador Humano ilimitado e capaz de resolver qualquer coisa.\n\n\nPreste bem atenção: “O que é possível para uma pessoa, é possível para qualquer pessoa.”\n\n\nGuarde essa frase na sua Mente Subconsciente e use ela sempre que achar necessário. Isso tudo porque você é capaz. O milagre só está começando!\n\n\nTe vejo em breve!\n\n\nUm Pouco sobre o Evandro Angotti:\nAntes de falar sobre mim, eu quero deixar claro que, o meu único e real intuito é ajudar pessoas. Hoje pude acordar e ter a felicidade em saber que estou, com este Projeto maravilhoso, em 18 países. Eu não poderia ir tão longe se não fosse você. Então, fique aqui registrado a minha gratidão pela sua vida. Eu desejo que o Universo lhe conceda tudo o que você deseja para  sua vida. Que você alcance todos os seus objetivos. Você tem a liberdade de entrar em contato comigo QUANTAS VEZES achar necessário.\nEu conto com mais de 10 anos de experiência em Programação Neuro-Linguística, Ondas Isocrônicas, Binaurais e Solfeggios, Física Quântica (Lei da Atração) e Desenvolvimento Pessoal e Espiritual. Já ajudei e continuo ajudando milhares de pessoas, agora ao redor do mundo. Me sinto realizado. Acredito que o meu propósito de vida está se concretizando a medida que eu vejo, pessoas como você, alcançarem seus objetivos. Para mim, de nada valeria, se isso não acontecer, de nada vale se você não alcançar seu objetivo.\nE por fim, preste bem atenção: Eu sou capaz de ajudar você a reprogramar qualquer coisa que você queira para a sua vida. Mas tudo isso depende de você.\nObservação: Como já foi mencionado, apesar de ter algumas informações importantes, este projeto não se trata de um curso, mas sim, de frequências que você irá utilizar por 27 dias para fazer uma Reprogramação Mental.\nObservação²: Cada Projeto disponibilizado aqui na Plataforma Udemy, tem o seu objetivo. Cada um deles leva um determinado tempo pela sua complexidade no desenvolvimento. Além disso, procuro melhorar a cada dia para entregar todos eles com a melhor qualidade possível. Se você tem interesse em se desenvolver em outras áreas, busque por outros projetos, que eu pensei em você para fazê-lo. Gratidão!!",

      "description": "La era actual se caracteriza por la inmediatez y la búsqueda de resultados rápidos. Es la mal llamada era de la información, incluso podríamos decir que es más apropiado el término de “saturación”, ya que nos inunda constantemente de contenidos para ver, leer…\nNos encontramos con gran cantidad de información de todo tipo y por todos los canales. Hoy se habla de “infoxicación”, como la intoxicación de la información. Por ello, cada vez más, necesitamos herramientas que nos ayuden tanto a filtrar la información, como a tratarla con mayor velocidad.\nSin embargo, la media de velocidad natural de lectura no suele ser muy alta. ¿Por qué? Porque al igual que con las técnicas de estudio, la memoria, la atención u otras habilidades, no las hemos aprendido, no han formado parte de nuestro bagaje en la educación formal y, por ende, no las hemos desarrollado ni aprovechado todo su potencial.\nLa lectura rápida consiste en un conjunto de métodos y técnicas que sirven para aumentar la velocidad al leer, pero sin reducir el nivel de comprensión ni la retención de la información. No todas las personas son capaces de llevar una lectura rápida, por eso nos parece importante compartir una serie de estrategias para aumentar la velocidad de lectura.\nUna de las características de la lectura rápida es que permite analizar el texto al mismo tiempo que se lo lee, con lo cual se aumenta la velocidad de lectura pero sin reducir el nivel de comprensión lectora ni la retención de los datos.\nLa lectura rápida puede ser utilizada para cualquier tipo de texto y consiste básicamente en la implementación de ciertas estrategias como el agrupamiento de palabras y frases, en la reducción de la subvocalización y en el movimiento rápido de la vista.\nDe todos modos, la principal estrategia para la lectura rápida es el entrenamiento diario porque permite mejorar la movilidad ocular. Es decir que la habilidad de los movimientos oculares se adquiere mediante la práctica y el entrenamiento frecuente.\nAdemás de entrenar la vista es importante adoptar una actitud activa frente a la lectura, esto implica lograr un nivel de concentración adecuado y un propósito bien definido, a fin comprender al máximo el contenido del texto.\nEl siguiente curso persigue mostrarte las técnicas y herramientas que van a ayudarte a doblar o triplicar, como mínimo, tu habilidad para leer más rápidamente, comprendiendo, y filtrando la información necesaria.",

      "description": "Accelerated learning is one of the most valuable skills you will ever possess because it unlocks everything you want in life.\nWe human have infinite potential, but we dwarf our capabilities by applying wrong strategies to acquire new skills. Imagine learning any skill, hobby, or passion in just days versus months, and becoming good enough to make money with it.  This is the power of accelerated learning.\nI am a self-made entrepreneur who has founded multiple startups. I have been building profitable businesses for last 12 years. In that span, I have run and sold multiple internet companies, and have also raised millions of dollars in venture capital.\nI started as a solo entrepreneur, and at peak, I was running a company with over 100 employees. I learned programming, marketing, content creation, hiring, book-keeping, etc. all on the job.\nI taught myself various skills in different phases of my life.\nIn the process, I have developed a unique seven step framework for rapid skill acquisition that has helped me in accelerating my learnings.\nAccelerated learning is one of the most advanced and effective learning methods in use today.\n--------------------------\nWhat makes accelerated learning so effective is that it’s based on the brain’s natural learning cycle. It takes into account of how our brain acquires, retains and recalls information.\n--------------------------\nAccelerated learning helps you maintain a pleasantly relaxed, yet receptive state of mind so that you learn new information in ways that actively involves both the left and right brains.\nThe good news is that this learning methodology is pretty straightforward and easy to learn. In fact, you can master it in just a few days and can start implementing it immediately.\nThis is exactly what this course will do for you.\nThis hands-on course will teach you how to master the art of accelerated learning  and become a superlearner, by breaking down the steps in concise and to-the-point lectures.\nI have done extensive research on accelerated learning and have developed a seven-step framework, using which I have taught myself multiple skills ranging from content writing, video production, marketing, programming, finances, etc.\nBy the time you will be finished with this course, you will learn a systematic and actionable technique to learn any skill at a much faster pace and become a super learner. You will drive an exponential growth in your career, business, and personal life.",

      "description": "Abbiamo davvero la convinzione di non avere memoria? Se ciò fosse vero, non potremmo leggere e comprendere questo testo per­ché non potremmo ricordare le lettere dell’alfabeto ed il significato delle parole.\nDiversamente da quanto si è soliti pensare, la memoria non è una sola. La nostra mente, infatti, lavora combinando le diverse memorie (procedurale, visiva, emotiva, ecc.), ciascuna delle quali può essere attivata e migliorata attraverso semplici tec­niche che si possono imparare.\nIl mio nome è Paolo Viola, sono un divulgatore scientifico e, da oltre trentacinque anni, mi occupo dei processi dell’apprendimento e del po­tenziamento della memoria. Nel corso della mia lunga attività sul campo, ho lavorato con l’Istitu­to Quadrifor (Istituto Bilaterale per lo Sviluppo e la Forma­zione Nazionale dei Quadri del Terziario), curandomi della formazione di più di un migliaio di manager, e ho tenuto conferenze per il Centro Alti Studi per la Difesa delle Forze Armate, occupandomi della formazione degli alti ufficiali.\nGrazie alle mie lezioni imparerete, in modo divertente, i metodi per riuscire a potenziare la vostra memoria. Qualche esempio? Scoprirete il metodo associativo e quello «a stampella», il metodo sostitutivo e le tecniche per memorizzare termini stranieri, ed altri ancora. I risultati - ne sono certo! - vi sorprenderanno. In aggiunta, nelle mie lezioni potrete scoprire anche notizie interessanti, tratte dall’ambito delle neuroscienze, che risponderanno a domande quali: «Perché non ricordiamo la nostra nascita?», «È possibile contrastare l’invecchiamento del cervello?»",

      "description": "NLP Lernstrategien\nLerne schnell ohne viel zu üben und rufe dein Wissen sicher und zuverlässig ab - in jedem Alter!\nAlles zum Thema Mathematik: Löse Dyskalkulie / Rechenschwäche auf und verbessere dein Mathematikverständnis oder helfe Menschen die diese Probleme habe.\nWusstest du schon…\n…in der Psychologie versteht man unter Lernen jede Veränderung von Verhalten und Erleben – nicht nur das Aneignen von Wissen…\n…am besten funktioniert Lernen mit guter Laune…\n…und Lernen macht glücklich, weil Aha-Erlebnisse das Körpereigene Belohnungssystem stimulieren uns so das Glückshormon Dopamin freigesetzt wird!\nLernen lernen geht leicht mit NLP!\nIn diesem Kurs geht es darum, das Mathematikverständnis zu verbessern\nweiterhin erlernst du...\nMengen und Ziphern zu visualisieren\nDie Textaufgaben zu visualisieren\n1x1-Aufgaben mit Ergebnissen visuell abzuspeichern\nMathematische Formeln mit passendem Anwendungsfall als Bild abzuspeichern\nEin inneres Ordnungssystem zu erschaffen, um Fehler zuverlässig auszusortieren\nDu erhältst eine komplette Unterrichtssequenz zum Thema NLP-Lerncoaching, also genau das - oder sogar etwas mehr, was du in ca. zwei Tagen einer nlpaed-zertifizierten Lerncoach-Ausbildung  lernst. In diesem Film gehe ich besonders auf Lernstrategien zum Thema Mathematik ein.\nEs ist günstig, wenn du dir auch die anderen NLP Lerncoach Kurse ansiehst.\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach Teil 1 werden grundsätzliche Vorgehensweisen beim Lerncoaching gezeigt.\nIm Videokurs  NLP Lerncoach Teil 2 geht es um das Lernen von Sprachen. Oft bietet die Rechtschreibestrategie jedoch einen guten Einstieg für das Thema visuelles Lerne\nim Videokurs NLP Lerncoach 4 findest du Themen rund um das Thema Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration / Schaffen eines motivierenden Arbeitsplatzes / ein optimales Zeitmanagement / Verbesserung des Schriftbildes.\nIm NLP Lerncoach 5 geht es darum, Prüfungen effektiv vorzubereiten, große Wissensmengen schnell und leicht zu lernen, Wissen zu vernetzen und Wissen im inneren Raum gut erreichbar abzuspeichern.\nWeitere Lerncoach-Filme zu folgenden Themen sind geplant:\nNLP-Lerncoach 4: Themen rund um die Steuerung der Aufmerksamkeit / ADS / ADHS / einen motivierenden Arbeitzsplatz ankern/ das Schriftbild verbessern\nNLP-Lerncoach 5: Hier geht es darum, Prüfungen effektiv vorzubereiten, große Wissensmengen schnell und leicht zu lernen, Wissen zu vernetzen und Wissen im inneren Raum gut erreichbar abzuspeichern.\nDu erhältst ein ausführliches Händout mit Erklärungen und Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitungen sowie Trancen, die du für dich selbst und andere nutzen kannst.\nIm Kurs findest du Demonstrationen mit unterschiedlichen echten Coachees die echte Themen vor der Kamera lösen!\nIn den Demos gefilmte Themen:\nDemo mit Livia (7 Jahre): Livia hat Nachholbedarf beim Rechnen und ist langsam bei Lösen der Aufgaben. Während des Coachings fiel auf, dass sie viele komplizierte Zwischenrechnungen macht, unsicher ist und sich zwischendurch überprüft, was sie von der eigentlichen Aufgabe ablenkt. Außerdem zappelt sie viel herum. Deshalb führe ich mit ihr eine Strategie durch, die ihr dabei hilft, das richtige innere Tempo und das passende Maß an zeitlicher Ordnung zu finden. Livia stellt dann fest, dass sie sehr nervös ist. Deshalb setze ich mit ihr zusammen noch Anker, die ihr helfen, mehr Spaß und Leichtigkeit zu empfinden.\nDemo mit Steffi (24 Jahre): vermutlich Dyskalkulie. Steffi hat vermutlich Dyskalkulie. Sie berichtet, dass sie immernoch mit Fingern rechnet und bei den einfachsten Aufgaben Fehler macht. Da Mathematik für sie sehr belastend ist, zeige ich ihr die Visualisierung zunächst am Thema Rechtschreibung, die ihr nach eigener Aussage leichter fällt. Steffi hat viele belastende Erinnerungen an die Schuzeit, da sie gemobbt wurde. Das hat zahlreiche Lernblockaden hinterlassen, die erst aufgelöst werden müssen, bevor wir mit dem eigentlichen Thema Mathematik beginnen können.\nDemo mit Marius (23 Jahre): Formeln auswendig merken. Marius möchte sich Formeln merken können. Bisher mustte er sie in der Formelsammlung nachschlagen. Er lernt, Formeln mit eindeutiger Definition wofür sie angewendet werden, visuell abzuspeichern.\nDemo mit Leilani: Sagt sie ist zu faul zum lernen: ist in Klasse 11 und möchte nach dem Abitur Biologie studieren. Dafür benötigt sie einen bestimmten Notenschnitt, um einen Studienplatz zu bekommen.\nSie nimmt sich vor oft vor zu lernen, hält das jedoch nicht ein.\nLeilanis ist in Mathematik nicht besonders gut. Deshalb erforsche ich mit ihr zusammen, ob sie bisher optimale Lernstrategien in Mathematik nutzt und wie sie mathematische Themen innerlich repräsentiert.\nDemo 1 mit Rabea (28 Jahre): Visualisieren von Mathematikinhalten. Rabea hat Probleme mit Mathematik - besonders mit Formeln. Sie lernt, mathematische Inhalte visuell abzuspeichern. das gelingt bei 1x1-Aufgaben schnell und zuverlässig. Bei Formeln wird es schwierig, weil Rabea wenig Zuversicht hat, viele Fehlspeicherungen auftauchen und sie bei Unsicherheit immer wieder ins auditive system fällt. In diesem Coaching kommen wir bei den Formeln noch zu keinem guten Ergebnis - deshalb findet ein weiterer Coaching-termin statt.\nDemo 2 mit Rabea (28 Jahre): Ate Belastungen wegwinken und Formeln visualisieren: Rabes hat viele belastende Erlebnisse zum Thema Mathematik, die sie bisher daran hindern, Formeln rein visuell abzuspeichern und abzurufen. Diese Belastungen winken wir weg und wenden uns dann erneut dem Thema Formeln zu. nun gelingt die visuelle Speicherung viel besser.\nMadita (17 Jahre): Mathematikstratgei an unterschiedlichen Themen. Zunächst finden wir die grundsätzliche Mathematik-Strategien heraus. Madita visualisiert - das ist grundsätzlich schonmal gut. Madita kann das 1x1 sicher visuell abrufen. Das Abspeichern von Formeln zeige ich Madita am den Formeln zum Kreisumfang und der Kreisfläche. Bei aktuellen Aufgaben kommen frühere Versäumnisse zum Tragen: Klammern / Brüche + Dezimalzahlen/ Stellvertreter wie x, y.\nDazu arbeiten wir induktiv, um klare Definitionen der jeweiligen Rechenvorschriften zu erzeugen.\nNun hat Madita Aufgabe, gefühlsmäßig zu überprüfen, wo es unangenehm wird, weil sie etwas nicht weiß. Dann soll sie die Grundlagen dazu induktiv erlernen z.B. über Youtube-Videos, um die aufgedeckten Lücken zu schließen.\nDie Kursen zum Thema Lerncoaching sind einerseits für Menschen jeden Alters geeignet, die sich selbst mit dem Thema Lernen beschäftigen, ihre eigenen Lernstrategien hinterfragen und optimieren möchten. Andererseits für Menschen, die andere als Coach beim Lernen unterstützen möchten. Coachees können Kinder oder Erwachsene jeder Altersstufe sein.\nNLP bietet eine Reihe nützlicher Strategien zu den klassischen Themen Rechtschreibung, Lesen, Textverständnis, Vokabellernen, Lernen von Regeln, Rechnen, Textaufgaben, Mathematikverständnis, Organisieren komplexer Lernaufgaben, innere Ordnung schaffen, Konzentration, große Wissensmengen schnell und sicher lernen, etc..\nDas einzige, was in einem Videokurs nicht leistbar ist, sind Antworten auf Verständnisfragen, Übungsgruppen und das Feedback zu deinen Erfahrungen in den Übungsgruppen... das solltest du dir entweder selbst organisieren, damit du alles Gezeigte trainieren kannst oder an unseren Online-Übungsabenden teilnehmen. Die Termine dafür teilen wir dir im Newsletter mit. Fragen kannst du natürlich auch stellen, wenn du Kontakt zu mir aufnimmst.\nWenn du einen Lerncoach-Kurs besuchst, kannst du das Videomaterial als wertvolle Ergänzung nutzen, denn du weißt ja, dass NLP eine Methode ist, die durch Modelllernen vermittelt wird. Je mehr Demonstrationen du zu einem Thema kennst, umso leichter wird es für dich, das Wesentliche herauszufiltern. Du lernst, an den individuellen Coaching-Bedarf angepasste Variationen des Vorgehens kennen und kannst dadurch souveräner mit eigenen Blockaden und Themen von Coachees umgehen.\nDer Kurs ist sowohl für Anfänger / Einsteiger ins NLP geeignet, als auch zur Vertiefung der Kenntnisse für fortgeschrittene NLP-Anwender.\nDie Trancen und Übungen sind bestens für die Selbstanwendung geeignet - du kannst dich durch das jeweilige Format führen lassen oder die Trancen auch zur Anleitung deiner Coachees nutzen\nNLP (Neuro Linguistisches Programmieren) ist in allen beruflichen Bereichen, in denen Lernen, Kommunikation, Beratungskompetenz sowie gelungene Selbststeuerung einen wesentlichen Anteil hat, von großem Nutzen.\nNLP ist eine Methode, die zunächst durch Modeling von Höchstleistungen entstand. Ursprünglich ging es dabei um effektive Psychotherapie. Die Methode hat sich inzwischen in vielen weiteren Bereichen etabliert, wie: Personalwesen, Führung, Werbung, Vertrieb, Kundenzufriedenheit, Gesundheit, Physiotherapie, Coaching, Seminargestaltung und Training, Sport und natürlich in allen sozialen Berufen wie Psychologie, Pädagogik, Sozial-Pädagogik, Coaching, Beratung, Schule und Erziehung...\n... Und natürlich ist NLP eine hervorragende Methode der Persönlichkeitsentwicklung.\nDu kannst...\nschnell große Mengen Wissensstoff sowie praktische Vorgehensweisen lernen\ndeine Ziele erreichen\nvergangene Ereignisse bereinigen und gestärkt aus ihnen hervorgehen\ndein Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstvertrauen verbessern\ndein Lebensglück und deine Zufriedenheit steigern\ndeine Überzeugungen und Glaubenssätze optimieren\nNLP als Methoden der Achtsamkeit und Meditation nutzen\ndeine innere Verfassung positiv beeinflussen\ndeine Gesundheit verbessern...\n...denn gute Stimmung und schnelles Überwinden von Stress-Zuständen unterstützt die Funktion deines Immunsystems.\ndeine Spiritualität fördern\n...",

Estas pessoas costumam apresentar quadros de intensa angústia e atitudes desadaptativas quanto à integração social, como a precipitação ou evitação diante de desafios. Este curso foi, então, motivado pela necessidade de dar relevância a fatores psicossociais, como a autoconfiança e a ternura, que parecem interferir no desempenho intelectual e, assim, promover sua otimização. Sentir-se bem é condição necessária para uma eficaz ativação dos recursos cerebrais e neuropsicológicos preservados.\nEm paz com o cérebro é uma proposta de reflexão conjunta, com vídeos e exercícios que convidam os participantes a assumir uma perspectiva autônoma na interação com os estímulos do meio, promovendo melhorias no uso da atenção, memória e outras habilidades intelectuais. Em linguagem acessível, o curso está estruturado em seções que fazem uma analogia aos pontos em comum entre processos cognitivos, emocionais e sociais. Com duração determinada pelo ritmo do participante, levará entre 6 e 8 semanas para ser concluído.",

      "description": "THIS IS THE 4 HOUR SPEED READING COURSE PROGRAMME THAT CAN DOUBLE YOUR READING SPEED\nYou will read at least 66% faster or your money back.\nThe teacher, Alex Garcez, gave up his Engineering degree in the third year because he was a very slow reader, however, his weakness became his strength, after taking a speed reading course, and deciding he was not going to become a laborer but an entrepreneur. Since then he took a Business Degree, Masters in Marketing and Advertising, and developed the Revolution Speed Reading Method. He personally coached more than 3,500 people and most of his clients improve their reading speed by more than 100%.\nWith more than 9,000 clients taking this two hour course online in 53 countries, Alex expects to motivate people to read more books. His method is based on science, and he has achieved amazing results while coaching professionals from companies such as: Goldman Sachs, GE, J P Morgan, Google, Bloomberg, eBay, The Wall Street Journal, Sage, The Walt Disney Company, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Thomson Reuters, Adecco, Lloyds Bank, Citigroup, PwC, HSBC and O2.\nAlex Garcez discovered that your brain loves speed, and he thinks that fast is fun - slow is boring! If you think you have short attention span to read books, documents and social media, then you probably read slowly and carefully. Instead of understanding the text you get bored and distracted, needing to skip back to re-read text countless times. The main reason is that your brain is too powerful to go at such a slow pace and will drift off into something more interesting to think about.\nYou will assess your reading speed at the beginning and throughout the course. So, if you spend 3 hours reading at work and improve your reading speed, on average, by 33%, you will save a whole month of work every single year.\nYou can find more information at his website.\nPlease Google \"The Speed Reading Coach\"\nThis is what you'll cover during the training course:\nAssessment of reading speed and comprehension\nUnderstanding the Reticular Activating System\nReading actively instead of passively\nAvoid back skipping to re-read\nBrain waves to do intellectual work\nSpeed reading online software\nSpeed read without any training\nSee how the eyes work when you read faster\nThe mechanics of speed reading strategies\nUnderstanding the left and right brain functions\nUnderstand how to speed read using a pace maker\nSpeed reading practice\nExpanding your memory\nUnderstanding mental blocks\nFurther speed reading practice\nNeuro-Linguistic Programming applied to speed reading\nDevelop your focus and online reading\nExpanding peripheral vision\nAdvanced reading practice\nErgonomics and performance\nAssessment of reading speed and comprehension\nUsing the Mini Max Target\nHow to plan to speed read a book\nMotivation to start reading more\nBecoming an expert in your area\nTake this speed reading course now, improve your reading skills and save your valuable time!\nThis is a 4 Hour course.

      "description": "Most of the memory improvement courses are full of dusty theories, containing a lot boring and theoretical stuff about the functioning of the brain and memory, but dealing too little with the practical part of this fascinating field.  In the same way you don't have to be a computer programmer to know how to use a computer efficiently, you don't need to become a neuro-psychiatrist to improve your memory. In this practical course, you will learn many powerful memory tools and, more importantly, you will see how to use them in your daily activities to become more efficient in your studies, personal life, or career and achieve greater success.\nThis course is intended to be a condensed guide to memory techniques that will provide you with a solid foundation for practicing them in the future. The good news is that once you learn these techniques, it's like learning a new foreign language. New horizons and perspectives will open up to you almost as soon as you start practicing them, and your performance will move to a higher level. In fact, armed with these powerful mind tools, you will become a completely new person.\nMemory training is similar to body training. Once you start this practice, you can already call yourself a \"memory athlete\". The results will be visible from the first days of memory training. Soon, you will probably set new goals for the future, maybe to participate in a memory championship and (why not?), to become a Grandmaster of Memory.\nRemember, all you need to become a memory athlete is a set of tools and a lot of practice. This course will teach you the tools and will guide you to effective practice.\nKeep in mind that the memory methods and systems presented in this course are tested and used by memory experts and they will also work for you. Whether you are at the beginning of your journey to improving your memory, or you already have notions in this area, I am convinced that in this course, you will find new and interesting things to apply to your daily activities.\nImproving your memory can be fun, and you can achieve astonishingly impressive results very quickly!\nI'm sure you will enjoy it and I can't wait to be your guide and mentor on this exciting new journey!\n\n\nYour Instructor,\nChris M Nemo\nMemory Improvement Writer & Blogger\nCreator of The Super Clever Advanced Learning Method (SCALM)",

I’m happy I went with this choice.\"\n-- Barrington Cummings            5 STARS\nDescription\n\nThe latest ground-breaking course from Dr. Matthew Checkley, the #1 rated instructor from Warwick Ventures and Connect Midlands, and author of Strategy Skills.\n\nFrom the author: \"For the last twenty five years, I've spoken with over two hundred world-class performers in academia and business. In that time, I've garnered the best and quickest-to-make-effective techniques for accelerated learning and powerful use of that new knowledge.\n\n\"This course shares the distilled tools, tactics, and 'insider knowledge'; all selected for rapid learning, ease-of-use, and the creation of one integrated training system. It also includes life lessons from my own decades of struggle to build better skills and knowledge.\n\n\"What makes the course different is a relentless focus on immediately-actionable skills that all work together. This is reflected in the questions answered. For example: What memory techniques are easiest to use? What does an effective improved-learning program look like, and why? How can you dissect ideas and plans to make them stronger? What are the most under-valued learning skills for novices in this field? What is a potent system for great decision making?\n\n\"I don't view myself as an expert on learning. I view myself as a practical researcher. If I can't understand the foundations of an idea or skill, and its value in everyday life, I'm not interested.\n\n\"Everything within this course has been vetted, researched, and applied to my own life in some way. I've used dozens of the tactics and methods in high-pressure environments, or business dealings. The lessons have made me hundreds of thousands of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration.\n\n\"I created this course - my record of simple, super-quick learning tools -  for myself. It's changed my life for the better, and I hope the same for you.\"\n...and don't forget Udemy's 30-day no questions asked money back guarantee.  If you're not happy, we're not happy.  This should make your decision an easy one.",

      "description": "Memory Training- Memorize & Remember Names & Faces Easily\nMemory Training- Secrets To Effortlessly Recalling Names & Faces With Proven Memory Techniques For Lasting Connections\n\n\nYou’ve just been introduced. The handshake was firm. The smile was genuine. You repeated their name back to them. And now, less than ten seconds later… it’s gone.\nA cold wave of panic washes over you. Your mind, once clear, is now a frantic, empty void where that name used to be. You’re still smiling, still nodding, but you’re no longer present in the conversation. You're a detective in your own brain, desperately searching for a clue that isn't there.\n“Was it Sarah? Susan? Something with an S… right? Or was it Jen? Jessica?”\nThe rest of the interaction is a blur of anxiety. You avoid using their name, resorting to awkward phrases like “So, you were saying…” and “That’s a great point you made.” You feel disingenuous. Disrespectful. Incompetent.\nWhen the conversation ends, you walk away with a knot in your stomach. It was an important contact. A new colleague. The parent of your child’s best friend. A potential client who could have changed everything for your business.\nAnd you made them feel forgettable.\nThis isn’t just a minor social inconvenience. This is a critical handicap in a world built on connection. Every forgotten name is a missed opportunity. A relationship that never starts. A door that remains closed. It’s the silent saboteur of your professional success and your social confidence.\nYou’ve probably told yourself a story about why this happens.\n“I’m just not a ‘names person.’” “I have a terrible memory.” “I’m too busy/stressed/distracted to remember these things.”\nThese are not reasons. They are excuses your brain has created to protect you from the deep-seated fear that you’re simply not good enough. That you lack the natural charisma you see in others—the people who walk into a room and effortlessly recall the name of every person they greet, making each one feel like the most important individual in the world.\nBut what if I told you that story is a lie?\nWhat if I told you that an exceptional memory for names and faces has nothing to do with natural talent, innate genius, or some genetic lottery you lost?\nIt is a skill. And like any skill, it requires the right technique and the right teacher.\nMost memory courses overwhelm you with a dozen different complex methods—memory palaces, linking systems, phonetic alphabets—that are fascinating in theory but collapse under the pressure of a real-life introduction. They give you a toolbox full of complicated tools when all you need is one perfect, unbreakable key.\nThis masterclass is different. It is built around one singular, powerful, and devastatingly effective system: The Single Name Memory Formula.\nThis is not a collection of cheap party tricks or flimsy “memory hacks” that fail you when it matters most. This is a definitive, comprehensive, and life-altering system designed to permanently install a single, game-changing technique into your mind until it becomes as automatic as breathing.\nThis masterclass is the bridge from the person you are now—anxious in social situations, missing opportunities, feeling inadequate—to the person you were always meant to be: confident, charismatic, influential, and deeply connected to the people around you.\nStop accepting a life of missed connections. Stop letting your potential be limited by a skill you were never taught correctly. The power to connect with anyone, anytime, anywhere is not a gift you’re born with; it’s a choice you make. Today is the day you make that choice.\n\n\nThe Unspoken Cost of Forgetting: Why This Is More Than Just a “Nice Skill to Have”\nLet’s be brutally honest for a moment. The inability to remember names and faces is costing you more than you can possibly imagine. It’s a silent tax on your ambition and your happiness.\nIn Your Professional Life:\nImagine you’re at a major industry conference. You meet dozens of people: potential employers, high-value clients, future business partners, industry influencers. Each handshake is a potential lottery ticket. But when you follow up with an email, you can’t quite place the face with the name. You send a generic message, and it gets deleted. The person you met feels like just another number to you, and they treat you the same way.\nNow, imagine your colleague at that same conference. They meet the same people. But the next day, they see the CEO of a target company in the hallway and say, “Great to see you again, Sarah! I really enjoyed our chat yesterday about your company’s expansion into Asia.” Sarah stops. She smiles. She feels seen, heard, and respected. A real conversation begins. An opportunity is born.\nWhich person are you?\nForgetting a client’s name can lose you a sale. Forgetting your new boss’s name can brand you as careless. Forgetting the names of your own team members erodes trust and makes you seem like a distant, uncaring leader. In the corporate world, in sales, in entrepreneurship—rapport is currency. And nothing builds instant rapport faster than the simple, powerful act of remembering a name. It says, “You matter to me. I was paying attention.” Forgetting says the exact opposite.\nIn Your Social Life:\nThink about the last party or social gathering you attended. Did you hide in the corner, sticking only to the people you already knew? Did you feel a surge of panic when someone you’d met before approached you with a warm smile, their name completely absent from your mind?\nThis anxiety is exhausting. It makes you avoid new situations. It prevents you from turning acquaintances into friends. It makes you seem aloof, uninterested, or even arrogant, when in reality, you’re just terrified of the embarrassment of forgetting.\nThe people who thrive socially are connectors. They remember that this is Jane, who loves hiking, and that’s Tom, who just got back from Italy. They can re-introduce people with confidence, weaving a social fabric that makes everyone feel welcome and included. They are the hubs of their social circles, not because they are the most attractive or the loudest, but because they invest the small amount of mental energy required to remember others. This small investment pays massive dividends in friendship, community, and a sense of belonging.\nIn Your Personal Confidence:\nPerhaps the highest cost is the one you pay internally. Every time you forget a name, it’s a tiny crack in your self-esteem. It reinforces the negative self-talk: “I’m so forgetful.” “My memory is getting worse.” “I’m just not good with people.”\nOver time, these small cracks widen into a chasm of self-doubt. You begin to believe the story that you have a \"bad memory,\" and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. You stop trying. You accept this limitation as a permanent part of who you are.\nThis is the most tragic cost of all, because it is based on a complete misunderstanding of how human memory works. Your brain is not a faulty hard drive. It is the most powerful learning machine in the known universe. It is fully capable of storing and recalling tens of thousands of names and faces with perfect clarity.\nYou just haven't been given the right user’s manual. This masterclass is that manual.\n\n\nThe Transformation: Picture the Person You Will Become\nI want you to close your eyes for a moment and genuinely imagine a new reality. A reality that is not just possible, but inevitable, once you master the single, powerful skill within this course.\nImagine walking into your next business meeting. A new executive from another department is there. You are introduced once: “This is Cassandra.” As you shake her hand, the Single Name Memory Formula clicks into place in your mind automatically. You don’t just hear the name; you process it. You connect it. You lock it in.\nThirty minutes later, as the meeting concludes, you look her in the eye and say, “It was a pleasure to meet you, Cassandra. I’m looking forward to working with you on this project.” Watch the subtle but powerful reaction on her face. A flicker of surprise, followed by a warm smile of genuine appreciation. You are no longer just another colleague. You are the one who paid attention. You are the one who cared. You have already established yourself as competent, thoughtful, and a person to be taken seriously.\nImagine attending your partner’s company party. You’re introduced to a whirlwind of new faces. In the past, this would have been a nightmare. But now, it’s a game. It’s a challenge you relish. The CEO, Robert. His wife, Emily, who is an artist. The head of sales, Ben, who has a ridiculously loud laugh. The new intern, Priya, who is nervous but brilliant.\nThroughout the night, you navigate the room with a newfound grace and confidence. You greet people by name. You introduce people to each other seamlessly. “Robert, I’d love for you to meet my partner. And Emily, I was just hearing about your new gallery exhibition—it sounds incredible.” You are not just a plus-one; you are a social asset. You are magnetic. People are drawn to your confidence and your genuine interest in them. You leave the event not drained and exhausted, but energized and connected.\nThis is not a fantasy. This is your future.\nThis masterclass will transform you into a person who:\nWalks into any room, professional or social, with unshakable confidence.\nBuilds instant and lasting rapport with clients, colleagues, and customers.\nBecomes a networking superstar, effortlessly turning contacts into contracts and acquaintances into allies.\nStrengthens personal relationships by making friends, family, and community members feel truly seen and valued.\nDevelops a powerful, reliable, and “superhuman” memory that begins with names and extends into all areas of your life.\nFinally silences the inner voice of self-doubt and replaces it with the quiet confidence of true competence.\nThis is the promise. And this masterclass is the path.\nYour Learning Journey: A Guided Path to Mastery\nThis masterclass is a meticulously crafted, step-by-step system. We leave nothing to chance. Each lesson builds logically on the last, taking you from foundational mindset to real-world application, all with me, your trainer, by your side every step of the way.\nPart 1: The Foundation - A Journey of Transformation\nBefore you can learn the technique, you must believe it’s possible.

Je häufiger diese Verbindungen beansprucht werden, desto stärker werden sie ausgebaut, ähnlich wie beim Training eines Muskels.\n\nGenau so, wie wir im Büroalltag unsere Muskeln nicht besonders gut trainieren und deshalb ins Fitnessstudio gehen, genau so ist Jonglieren das Fitnessstudio für das Gehirn.\n\nDurch die ständige Überschreitung der Körpermitte mit dem Zentrum der Aufmerksamkeit, wird das Gehirn ganzheitlich trainiert und zudem die körperliche Ausführung der Signale verbessert.\nDas hat einen ähnlichen Effekt, wie die REM- Schlafphase, bei der sich die Augen schnell hin und her bewegen, während im Gehirn neue Verbindungen geschaffen werden.\n\nDas ist einer der Gründe, warum viele Teilnehmer berichten, nach dem Jonglieren entspannter, kreativer und kognitiv leistungsfähiger zu sein und beispielsweise deutlich schneller lernen!\nAuch psychisch hat es den Effekt vom Loslassen im wahrsten Sinne, weil wir uns nur auf die Bälle fokussieren. Da ist kein Platz mehr für andere Gedanken. Daher hat es einen ähnlichen Effekt wie Meditition.\nUnd natürlich bringt Jonglieren viel Spaß und Lachen ist gesund und ein Feuerwerk der Seele.\n\n\nMelde dich zum Kurs an und beginne gleich, mit den ersten Übungen für dein Gehirn 2.0!",

      "description": "Learning How to Learn Masterclass: Learn Anything 10x Faster\nLearning How To Learn- Accelerate Learning, Reduce Study Time,& Remember Information Easily Using Elite-Level Learning Strategies\nHave you ever felt like you’re running on a hamster wheel, putting in hours of effort—studying, reading, practicing—only to end up exactly where you started?\nYou spend the entire weekend cramming for a Monday morning exam. You highlight every other sentence in your textbook until the pages glow with neon ink. You re-read dense chapters, your eyes glazing over, telling yourself, “This time, it will stick.” You feel the exhaustion, the mental strain, and you assume this must be the feeling of learning.\nBut when the moment of truth arrives—whether it’s the blank page of an exam, a high-stakes question in a meeting, or an empty project file on your computer—your mind goes silent. The information you spent so much time trying to force into your brain is gone, vanished as if it were never there.\nYou’re left with a sinking feeling of frustration, a flicker of self-doubt that whispers, “Maybe I’m just not smart enough for this.”\nOr perhaps you’re trapped in what has become known as “Tutorial Hell.” You’re an aspiring professional, a creative, a career-changer, and you know the skill you want to learn. You buy the courses, you watch the videos, and you diligently follow along with the instructor, step-by-step. And it feels great. You’re making progress. You complete the project, and it works.\nBut the moment you try to create something on your own—to apply that knowledge to a new, unique problem—you freeze. You can follow the recipe, but you can’t cook. You realize, with a dawning sense of dread, that you haven’t been learning how to think; you’ve just been learning how to copy.\nThis is not a personal failure. It is a system failure.\nThe truth is, the way we were all taught to learn is fundamentally broken. We were educated in a system designed for a different era, a factory model that treated our brains like empty vessels to be filled with facts through passive absorption and brute-force repetition. This outdated method is the real enemy. It’s the source of your frustration, the architect of your self-doubt, and the invisible barrier standing between you and your true potential.\nIt’s a system that creates the agonizing “Illusion of Competence,” where the comfortable feeling of recognizing familiar information is mistaken for the power of genuine understanding. It’s a system that respects the clock more than the mind, leading you to believe that the hours you spend in a chair are a measure of your progress. It’s a system that leaves you feeling perpetually overwhelmed, drowning in a sea of information, and constantly afraid of being left behind in a world that demands you learn more, faster, every single day.\nBut what if you could break free from that system forever?\nWhat if you could trade in that slow, sputtering, and unreliable engine for a high-performance, precision-engineered machine for acquiring, retaining, and applying knowledge?\nImagine, just for a moment, a different reality…\nImagine waking up with a sense of calm and total confidence before a major presentation or exam, knowing that the information is not just memorized, but deeply understood and instantly accessible.\nImagine being able to pick up any complex skill you choose—a new programming language, a musical instrument, a foreign language, data analysis—not in years, but in months, or even weeks. Imagine the career opportunities that would unlock, the creative projects you could finally bring to life, the person you could become.\nImagine sitting down with a dense, 400-page book on a challenging subject and being able to deconstruct its core arguments and extract its most valuable insights in a single afternoon.\nImagine becoming the go-to problem-solver on your team, the innovator in your field, the person who can connect disparate ideas in new and brilliant ways because you have a mental framework that allows you to see the world with a clarity that others lack.\nThis is not a pipe dream. This is the predictable, achievable result of installing a new operating system for your brain.\nWelcome to the definitive masterclass on learning how to learn.\nThis how to learn course is not a collection of flimsy “study tips” or recycled “life hacks.” It is a complete, step-by-step system for re-wiring your brain and revolutionizing your entire approach to learning. It is a synthesis of decades of research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, combined with the proven, real-world strategies of the world's fastest and most effective learners.\nYou will not just learn what to do. You will learn why it works. You will gain a deep understanding of your own mind—how it absorbs information, how it forges memories, and how it builds skills. You will learn to work with the natural architecture of your brain, not against it, turning its supposed limitations into your greatest strengths.\nThis is not about working harder. It is about working smarter. It is about trading brute force for elegant efficiency. It is about turning the frustrating, uphill battle of learning into a joyful, empowering, and deeply rewarding adventure.\nOver the how to learn course of this masterclass, you will be guided through a profound, six-phase transformation. Each phase is a monumental leap forward, systematically upgrading every aspect of your learning ability until you are operating at a level you may not have thought possible.\nYou will not just learn a skill. You will become a different kind of person. You will become an Apex Learner.\nWhat You Will Master: A Deep Dive into Your Transformation\nThis is not a surface-level overview. This is a comprehensive, structured journey into the science and art of elite-level learning. Here is the exact blueprint of the transformation that awaits you inside.\nPhase I \"Learning How To Learn Course\": Deconstruct & Rebuild Your Learning OS\nBefore we can build, we must clear the foundation. In this first, critical phase, we will identify and dismantle the limiting beliefs and disastrously inefficient habits that have been sabotaging your efforts. You will install the core mindset of an elite learner, creating a solid platform for all the advanced techniques to come.\nThe Learning Illusion: Why Busyness Doesn’t Equal Progress: You will discover the single biggest trap in all of learning: the illusion of competence. We’ll expose why hours of passive rereading and highlighting feel productive but create zero long-term value, and you’ll learn to replace these vanity metrics with a system for measuring true, tangible progress.\nUnlocking Neuroplasticity: Your Brain Is Not Fixed: This is the most liberating concept in modern science, and it is the foundation of your future growth. You will learn the hard science of how your brain physically changes in response to challenge and focus. You will understand, once and for all, that your intelligence and abilities are not fixed traits, but skills that you can build and expand, and you will learn the precise tools to direct this process consciously.\nThe #1 Myth That Sabotages Your Learning Speed: You will finally break free from the self-imposed prison of “learning styles.” We will debunk the popular but scientifically disproven myth of being a “visual” or “kinesthetic” learner and show you how to embrace multi-modal learning to create richer, more durable, and more interconnected knowledge.\nHow To Instantly Double Your Focus With The \"Distraction Bubble\": In a world engineered for distraction, focus is a superpower. You will learn a step-by-step, practical method for creating an impenetrable sanctuary for deep work. You’ll learn to conquer digital, physical, and even internal distractions, making focus the path of least resistance instead of a constant, draining battle of willpower.\nThe \"Curiosity Engine\": Why Your 'Why' Is A Superpower: You will learn that fleeting motivation is a poor fuel source for the long journey of learning. Instead, you will discover how to tap into a far more powerful and stable energy source: a deep, intrinsic sense of purpose. You will learn the “5 Whys” technique to connect any learning goal to your core identity, activating a “Curiosity Engine” that makes learning feel like an exciting investigation rather than a chore.\nEscaping “Tutorial Hell”: The Critical Shift From Passive to Active Learning: This lecture is the antidote for anyone trapped in the endless cycle of following tutorials without building real, independent skill. You will learn the crucial mindset shift from being a passive consumer of information to an active creator of knowledge, a principle that is the key to building tangible, real-world competence.\nPhase II \"Learning How To Learn Course\": The High-Bandwidth Brain—Absorb Information Like A Supercomputer\nWith a new operating system installed, we will now upgrade your input hardware. This phase is dedicated to transforming the way you consume information. You will learn how to process books, lectures, articles, and data with a level of speed and efficiency you never thought possible, turning the firehose of information overload into a manageable, valuable stream.\nThe “Skim-And-Scope” Method: Read Smarter, Not Harder: You will abandon the inefficient, linear reading method you were taught in elementary school. You’ll master a strategic, two-phase approach to deconstruct any non-fiction text in minutes, extracting its core structure and arguments before you ever commit to a deep read. This technique alone will save you hundreds of hours.\nWhy Speed Reading Is A Trap (And What To Do Instead): We will expose the myths and false promises of traditional speed reading. Instead of teaching you parlor tricks that destroy comprehension, we will give you scientifically-backed strategies to increase your effective reading speed—the speed at which you can read with full understanding—by making your eye movements more efficient and focused.\nDeconstructing Expertise: The Art of Finding The 20% That Matters Most: The secret to rapid skill acquisition isn't learning more; it's learning the right things first. You will master the art of applying the Pareto Principle (the 80/20 Rule) to any subject, allowing you to identify the small handful of foundational concepts that provide the vast majority of understanding and results.\nActive Listening Secrets: How to Capture More from Lectures and Audiobooks: You will turn listening from a passive, forgettable activity into an active, engaging sport. You will learn how to use your excess mental bandwidth to question, summarize, and structure information in real-time, allowing you to retain exponentially more from any lecture, podcast, or audiobook.\nThe “Question-Driven” Reading Technique For Maximum Comprehension: This powerful technique will fundamentally change your relationship with the written word. You will learn to transform reading from a passive monologue into an active dialogue with the author by generating questions before you read, turning the process into a focused and highly effective hunt for answers.\nUnlocking Visual Learning: How to Decode Diagrams, Charts, and Data Fast: In our data-driven world, visual literacy is a non-negotiable skill. You will learn the simple but powerful “T-A-L-K” framework to systematically decode any chart, graph, or diagram, allowing you to instantly find the story and insights hidden within the data.\nPhase III \"Learning How To Learn Course\": The Architect's Mind—Building Fortresses of Understanding\nAbsorbing information is worthless if it remains a disorganized pile of facts. In this phase, you will become a mental architect. You will learn how to take raw information, process it deeply, connect it to your existing knowledge, and build magnificent, durable structures of understanding that will stand the test of time.\nBeyond Highlighting: The Smart Note-Taking Revolution: You will finally understand why your brightly colored, highlighted notes have been failing you. You will learn the crucial shift from passive “recording” to active “processing” and master powerful, structured note-taking systems like the Cornell Method and the QEC Method, turning your notebook from a graveyard of facts into a vibrant workshop for thinking.\nThe “Connection Web”: How To Link New Ideas to Old Knowledge: You will learn that memory works by association. Isolated facts are weak. You will master the art of “elaborative interrogation,” using analogies, metaphors, and active questioning to weave every new piece of information into your existing web of knowledge, making it stronger, more resilient, and easier to recall.\nUnlocking Mental Models: The Secret Frameworks of Top Thinkers: You will gain access to the thinking tools of the world’s most brilliant minds. You will learn what mental models are, why they are like software for your brain, and how to build a “latticework” of these powerful frameworks from different disciplines to analyze problems from multiple perspectives and make dramatically better decisions.\nWhy This Tiny Shift in Note-Taking Changes Everything: Concepts Over Facts: You will discover the profound difference between a “fact collector” and a “concept learner.” By learning to organize your knowledge around core concepts rather than disconnected facts, you will not only boost your memory but also gain the superpower of “transfer”—the ability to apply what you’ve learned to new and unseen situations.\nThe “Generative Learning” Principle: Create to Understand: You will learn that your brain is not a sponge; it is a muscle. You’ll discover why the act of generating content—summarizing from memory, creating your own diagrams, explaining a topic to yourself—is exponentially more powerful for building understanding than passively consuming information.\nHow to Instantly Improve Your Logic with First-Principles Thinking: You will learn the legendary problem-solving technique used by innovators like Elon Musk. You will master the art of deconstructing any problem or system down to its most fundamental, irreducible truths, allowing you to reason from the ground up and develop truly original, breakthrough solutions.\nPhase IV \"Learning How To Learn Course\": The Vault—Forging Unbreakable Memory & Instant Recall\nThis is where we turn your mind into a fortress. You will go beyond mere understanding and master the science of memory itself. You will learn battle-tested, scientifically-proven techniques to encode information into your long-term memory so effectively that recall becomes a fast, reliable, and automatic process.\nThe Forgetting Curve Is Your Enemy: Here’s How to Defeat It: You will meet the arch-nemesis of your memory—the Forgetting Curve—and understand why your brain is designed to forget information so rapidly.

      "description": "\"The faintest ink is better than the best memory.\"\nBut what if we could flip that on its head? What if your memory wasn’t just good… it was extraordinary? That’s the question we’ll keep circling back to throughout this journey into Cognitive Memory Mastery. Whether you're a student prepping for high-stakes exams, a professional juggling a million things, or a lifelong learner with a curious brain—you’re about to learn how to make your memory your superpower.\nLet’s start with a simple fact: you were born with an extraordinary brain. But, like most of us, you probably never got a user manual. That’s what this course is—your manual for understanding how your memory works, how to make it stronger, and how to use it intentionally in your daily life.\nNow, here's something fascinating. The human brain has about 86 billion neurons—tiny messengers firing electrical signals constantly. And these neurons form trillions of connections. This web of connections is where your memories live. Neuroscientist Paul Reber from Northwestern University estimates the brain can store 2.5 petabytes of information. That's the equivalent of three million hours of TV shows. Imagine having that kind of hard drive... and actually knowing how to access it.\nBut here’s the kicker—memory isn't a single thing. It's not just one file folder in your brain. There’s short-term memory, which holds bits of information briefly (like remembering a phone number just long enough to dial it), and long-term memory, which can last a lifetime. Then there’s working memory, which is like your brain's scratchpad—actively holding and manipulating info (think mental math). And we haven’t even touched on episodic, semantic, procedural, or implicit memory. Yep, your memory is a multitasking genius.\nLet’s make this real. Have you ever walked into a room and forgotten why you went there? Welcome to a lapse in working memory. Or maybe you smell a specific perfume and you’re instantly taken back to your grandma’s kitchen—that’s episodic memory, often triggered by the senses. There’s a term for that: Proustian memory, named after the French writer Marcel Proust, who famously described vivid childhood memories brought on by the taste of a madeleine cookie.\nSo how do we take this complex, powerful, sometimes forgetful system and make it work for us?\nThe answer lies in memory strategies, and in this course, we’ll experiment with the best science-backed methods out there. For instance, the spacing effect, discovered in the 1800s by Hermann Ebbinghaus, shows that we remember better when learning is spaced out over time—not crammed. His famous forgetting curve shows that we lose over 50% of new information within an hour unless we actively reinforce it. That’s wild, right? But here’s the good news: with spaced repetition systems (SRS), like the ones used in Anki or Quizlet, you can beat that curve.\nAnother game-changer? Chunking. Take this sequence: 1-4-9-2-1-7-7-6. Hard to remember, right? But if you chunk it as 1492 (Columbus), 1776 (American independence)—suddenly it's easier. Your brain loves patterns and meaning.\nAnd then there’s the classic method of loci, also called the memory palace technique. It’s ancient—used by Greek orators and Roman senators—and still works today. Fun fact: modern memory champions use it to memorize entire decks of cards in under a minute. It works by tying information to locations in your mind, like visualizing grocery items along a familiar path in your house. Sherlock Holmes? He made it famous in fiction, but the science behind it is very real.\nLet’s talk mnemonics—rhymes, acronyms, and silly images. Think \"Every Good Boy Deserves Fruit\" to remember musical notes, or \"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos\" for the planets. You might laugh, but studies show these whimsical tools boost recall significantly, especially for students.\nNow, ever wonder why you forget? It’s not always because you're careless. Stress, lack of sleep, multitasking, and poor nutrition can wreck your memory. Chronic stress literally shrinks the hippocampus, the brain's memory hub. And sleep? That’s when your brain consolidates memories, transferring them from short-term storage to long-term. Sleep less, remember less. Simple as that.\nSpeaking of stress—let’s look at how emotions affect memory. Highly emotional events are etched into our memory in vivid detail—called flashbulb memories. Think 9/11 or personal milestones. It’s because emotions activate the amygdala, which enhances memory encoding. But here’s the catch: emotion can also distort memory. Eyewitness testimonies? Often flawed, especially under stress. This has serious implications in legal psychology and real-world decision-making.\nWhat’s exciting is that this course isn't just theory—it’s highly practical. You’ll learn techniques like PQ4R (Preview, Question, Read, Reflect, Recite, Review) and SQ3R (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review)—powerful methods to supercharge reading retention. You'll also explore the Feynman Technique, where you learn by teaching. If you can explain a complex idea in simple terms, you own that knowledge.\nLet me give you a real-world example. There’s a medical student in London who used the memory palace technique to memorize every bone and muscle in the human body. Not only did he ace his exams—he taught the same technique to his peers, and their scores improved by an average of 30%. That’s not just impressive—it’s transformative.\nBut it’s not just for academics. Business professionals use memory techniques to deliver speeches without notes, actors use it to memorize scripts, and athletes use mental rehearsal (a form of procedural memory) to sharpen performance.\nAnd if you’ve ever thought, “I’m just not a memory person,” let me stop you right there. There’s no such thing. Memory is not a talent—it’s a trainable skill. Just like going to the gym strengthens muscles, memory workouts strengthen your neural networks. Brain plasticity—the brain’s ability to change and grow—is real at any age.\nNow, as we move into the final leg of the course, we’ll dive into ultra-learning strategies. Think of this as the memory equivalent of high-intensity interval training. You’ll learn how to structure your environment for deep work, eliminate distractions, and optimize for flow states. These aren’t just tips—they’re neuroscience-backed strategies that people like Elon Musk and polymath Josh Waitzkin use to master multiple fields.\nOne last thing—we recommend you read The Art of Becoming a Champion Student by IPP. It aligns perfectly with this course and offers powerful tips for academic excellence. Also, look into the Academic Championship for Students program. It’s more than a course—it’s a complete system for turning you into a learning machine.\nSo, are you ready to unlock your brain's full potential? Let's transform the way you think, learn, and remember—starting now.",

Finally, four placeholders are replaced by four respective calculated numbers to get the desired sum. This section concludes with several tips for performing the Lando trick in front of an audience.  Also, an example is demonstrated.  In the last section of the course, The third section of the course justifies the recipe by a discussion of a 4X4 diagonal mutually orthogonal Latin square or MOLS. It is shown that the super magic square implements a diagonal MOLS. Then, relocating an arbitrary entry of the diagonal MOLS to an arbitrary cell is performed in two steps, without recalculation of the entries.  It is shown that in the second step, may necessitate flipping of opposite corners.  That ability in diagonal MOLS justifies the recipe for Lando trick.",

      "description": "Se você já se pegou pensando o porquê de esquecer das coisas com facilidade, não se preocupe, isso faz parte do dia a dia de milhares de pessoas. Nós achamos que temos memória limitada e isso é mentira. A nossa capacidade de memorização, assim como a capacidade cognitiva, é ilimitada. Não existe restrições e nem limitações para memorizar, o que existe é falta de disposição para treinar o Cérebro.\nO Cérebro é como um músculo, quanto mais treinamos esse órgão, mais ele se fortalece. Isso é independente da sua idade. Não importa quantos anos tem, o seu cérebro pode ser fortalecido e voltar ao seu Estado Natural, que é ser capaz de memorizar qualquer coisa que queremos.\nHá quem acredite que, a falta de exercitar o cérebro, pode causar a Doença de Alzheimer, porém, quando temos um cérebro ativo, forte e treinado, há poucas chances de obter essa doença.\nO Projeto “Ultra Memory” visa aumentar a sua capacidade de Memorização e fortalecimento para evitar o Mal de Alzheimer.\n\n\nVeja alguns dos benefícios na utilização do Isocrônico deste projeto:\nAumento da Capacidade de Memorização;\nAtravés dos Exercícios, você será capaz de aumentar a atividade na área do Hipocampo;\nVocê será capaz de perceber o seu Poder de Memorização;\nSerá capaz de memorizar nomes com facilidade;\nFisionomia não será mais problema para memorizar;\nUtilizando o Poder da Visualização, ensinado nos exercícios, você poderá memorizar listas de vários ítens;\nE muitos outros benefícios;\n\n\nAssim como os nossos músculos, um cérebro acomodado atrofia. Temos que exercitar este órgão o tempo todo através de exercícios, leituras, desafios, enfim, temos que nos dispor para aumentar a nossa capacidade, que, na verdade, já faz parte da nossa natureza. Não é apenas privilégio de alguns um cérebro que é que capaz de memorizar qualquer coisa, mas também é nosso privilégio.\nAlém dos Isocrônicos, que atua na Área do Hipocampo, responsável para a memorização, os Solfeggios atuam no mais profundo do nosso Subconsciente para quebrar as barreiras que nos limitam. Estas frequências, que são 9 em sua totalidade, irão atuar para eliminar as crenças que temos de que não somos capazes.\n\n\nVeja alguns exemplos na atuação dos Solfeggios:\nEliminação de Barreiras Mentais;\nEliminação de Crenças Limitantes;\nAjuda na Prevenção do Mal de Alzheimer;\nFortalece o Cérebro;\nAjuda na Capacidade Cerebral;\nAumenta o seu Poder Pessoal de Memorização;\n\n\nA seguir será listado cada Frequência de Solfeggio e como ele atua em conjunto com o Isocrônico Beta 18Hz:\n174Hz - Esta frequência traz uma sensação de segurança para o Cérebro, motivando-o a dar o seu melhor;\n285Hz -  Pode curar qualquer problema que esteja na área guiada pelo Isocrônico;\n396Hz - Limpa limitações impregnadas no Subconsciente;\n417Hz - Ajudar o seu Cérebro a utilizar o seu Potencial Criativo;\n528Hz - Aumenta a Energia Vital e Clareza Mental;\n639Hz - Assim como o Projeto “Super Inteligência”, essa frequência aumenta a sua Capacidade de Relacionamento e Comunicação;\n741Hz - Limpa as Células de Toxinas;\n852Hz - Ajuda no despertar para a sua Força Interior e o seu Poder Pessoal;\n963Hz - Retorno ao seu Estado Natural de Ser, ou seja, de volta ao seu Poder de Memorização;\n\n\nNão há limites e isso é um fato. A própria ciência ainda não conseguiu chegar uma conclusão sobre o nosso Cérebro. A sua capacidade vai além de qualquer estudo até hoje realizado. O que importa nisso tudo é que você é capaz de Memorizar qualquer coisa. Pare de ficar pensando que no futuro próximo, você irá perder a sua capacidade de memorização, porque isso não é verdade. Mude a sua forma de pensar, coloque os exercícios, que são simples, em prática e utilize estas frequências, que você irá se surpreender.\nTudo é possível para aquele que acredita nas infinitas possibilidades. A Física Quântica veio para nos provar essa teoria. Mude a forma de como você olha o seu mundo, e o seu mundo mudará. E lembre-se sempre, Você é Capaz. O Milagre está apenas começando!\n\n\nTe vejo em breve!\n\n\nUm Pouco sobre o Evandro Angotti:\nAntes de falar sobre mim, eu quero deixar claro que, o meu único e real intuito é ajudar pessoas. Hoje pude acordar e ter a felicidade em saber que estou, com este Projeto maravilhoso, em 18 países. Eu não poderia ir tão longe se não fosse você. Então, fique aqui registrado a minha gratidão pela sua vida. Eu desejo que o Universo lhe conceda tudo o que você deseja para  sua vida. Que você alcance todos os seus objetivos. Você tem a liberdade de entrar em contato comigo QUANTAS VEZES achar necessário.\nEu conto com mais de 10 anos de experiência em Programação Neuro-Linguística, Ondas Isocrônicas, Binaurais e Solfeggios, Física Quântica (Lei da Atração) e Desenvolvimento Pessoal e Espiritual. Já ajudei e continuo ajudando milhares de pessoas, agora ao redor do mundo. Me sinto realizado.

No experience or familiarity with mahjong is necessary.\nWe do some counting techniques, shape recognition, introduce distractions so you can train yourself on focus, and put you in situations where you have a limited timeframe to track items as they move around the screen. We also introduce you to the game of mahjong. You will learn about the mahjong tiles and how to recognize them so you can do some of the memory exercises we created for you. You do not need to be familiar with mahjong to do this course. You will not learn how to play a mahjong game from this course. You also do not need to learn any more about mahjong than you do in this course. If you decide to learn mahjong after this course, your skills learned in this course will help you when you play.\nI am a brain injury survivor that used mahjong to regain memory, cognitive functioning, and focus. My Mahjong for Memory program is my way of sharing what I know, what I learned, and what I experienced as I gained back my brain health. There are many tools and resources you can use when it comes to regaining or retaining memory and improving brain health and functioning.

Want a more focused mind?\nThis course will not only develop your memory, attention, and problem solving skills, but it will also teach you how to undo the negative cognitive side-effects of our modern technologies.\nI’ve been writing and teaching at universities across North America about the mind, the brain, and cognition for the past fifteen years. I am continually struck by how unaware people are of the simple things they could be doing to improve their mental and emotional well-being.\nHeavy technology use will lead to brain fatigue, stress, and depression\n… unless coping strategies are implemented.\nThis course will give you those tools:\n— Exercises and techniques for developing a daily brain/body routine that works with your lifestyle;\n— Knowledge of the most important brain basics so that you can make healthy life choices.\nThe course is designed to be followed as a four-week programme, five days/week. Each week is a focus module: Brain Basics, Cognitive Exhaustion, Cognitive Distraction, Attention and Memory. On each of the five module days you will watch a short, easy-to-follow video lecture in which you will either learn some of the basic concepts relevant to the week’s focus or you will be shown exercises and techniques to help you optimise with respect to that focus. You will also be encouraged to do a daily meditation — the course offers many different guided meditations for you to choose from!\nWhat People are Saying about Dr. Salay and The Course:\n“Seriously, this class is fantastic. … I’ve learned so much and am practicing most of the things suggested – they only take a few minutes a day. Memory, focus and productivity are improving. Anyone who is interested in learning and growing will benefit from taking this class.”\n— Deb, Udemy Student\n“I took this course as part of my Continuing Professional Development as a professional accountant--but this course would be useful to all professionals, students, and anyone who wants to improve their cognitive capacities: focus, concentration, and productivity. The daily meditation with Dr. Salay quickly became the highlight of my day.”\n— Erin Webster, CPA",

      "description": "GREAT NEWS FOR MY CURRENT AND FUTURE STUDENTS THAT WANT TO LEARN HOW TO LEARN !!\nThis 'LEARNING HOW TO LEARN' course is now a 'TWO-IN-ONE COURSE'!\nI added my 'Learning How to Learn with Flashcard Mapping' course to the 'Learning How to Learn with the REAL Learning Process Path' course (it starts in Section 11 of this course).\nI did this to give my students more value in one course so they could learn how to learn!\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nThere will be some overlapping and repetition (in the second course), but this is good and a great consolidation!\nYou can start with Section 1, complete the first course, and then do the second one.\nOR, you can go to Section 11 immediately and do the Flashcard Mapping course first, as it can be done first.\nThe Flashcard Mapping Course can still be purchased separately.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWHAT SOME OF MY STUDENTS (FROM 65 COUNTRIES, SPEAKING 21 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES) ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS LEARNING HOW-TO-LEARN COURSE\nCecil: I know a couple of learning strategies and techniques, but what this course does is put them into a well-structured plan that is easy to understand and follow for teachers and students (of all ages).\nJavier R: Out of all the Udemy learning programs, I have to say this is the best program I have taken. It is worth every single penny. I have changed a lot, and I am very happy with the results. This program has helped me in my learning process.\nAndrea A: So glad I came across this course!\nSue D:  A very clear model that is well broken down with an invaluable amount of resources\nDesiree S: Thank you for an excellent course I will be using this in my practice as well as in my studies.\nShannon P: Estelle, you have designed a well-researched, well-paced, and thorough course. I will need to put aside time to go through all the additional resources and readings. Thank you for sharing all this. I especially liked the way that you designed the course; you were really applying what you were teaching us. Bite-sized chunks of information using a multi-sensory approach and then regular quizzes to recall what we had learned. You are an excellent educator.\nAlberta V: The Real Learning Process Path is a must for every student, regardless of age. The course presentation and materials are user-friendly and relevant to teaching and learning. Not only does it prepare the playing field for meaningful lifelong learning, it also makes teachers think anew about teaching materials, teaching methods, intervention, and their responsibility for lifelong learning. I wish I had been exposed to the course 40 years ago. It would have made my teaching and learning so much more streamlined.\nMarcel T: Hele goede cursus waar ik nog heel vaak op kan terugvallen.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWHY DID I DEVELOP THIS LEARNING HOW-TO-LEARN COURSE?\nI developed this course, 'Learning How to Learn with the REAL Learning Process Path'  to support school and adult learners as part of my intervention process, but this course WILL HELP YOU TOO!\nI've used my knowledge and experience of working with school and adult learners over more than two decades and combined it into a powerful 6-Step Process. But every lecture/video that unpacks the 6 processes can be backed up with the science of learning.\nSo I know this course will be helpful to you!\nIt's not just a collection of random study tips and hacks.\nIt's a step-by-step REAL Learning Process to become a better and more self-regulated learner!\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAND NOW A BIT MORE INFO ABOUT THIS LEARNING HOW TO LEARN COURSE (HPCSA ACCREDITED)\n'Learning How to Think' and 'Learning How to Learn' are often called life's most important skills!\nWe all need to learn to think and learn better to cope in a world that's changing faster than we can often keep up with. Do you know that as a learner today, you'll have to deal with more disruption, challenges, and new problems than your parents and grandparents? But, even if you can't predict the future, you can prepare for it.\nChange, disruption, and new problems can push you out of your comfort zone. The COVID pandemic, for example, forced adults and schoolchildren to move out of their comfort zones in various ways. Thousands of learners all over the world are still struggling with the transition between online and in-person learning.\nI've worked with school and adult learners as an occupational therapist for more than two decades (as part of my working career). I've experienced an increase in the lack of thinking skills (and metacognition); learning skills; and executive function skills in learners for twenty years. And the COVID-19 pandemic has increased these problems.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSEE HOW THIS LEARNING HOW-TO-LEARN COURSE CAN HELP YOU!\n\n\nIf you are an older or adult learner (with or without underlying difficulties), you can do the course on your own to become a more metacognitive and effective learner who thinks about your thinking and learning to make changes to achieve your goals;\nIf you are a younger learner, you can do this course with a parent to improve your knowledge and skills, become a better learner, and improve your marks with some simple steps.\nIf you are a parent who wants to support your child/children to develop better metacognitive learning skills, this course will be an excellent resource, as you will get stacks of valuable information and resources. And most of all, you'll have lifetime access to all these videos and resources!\nIf you are a professional who works with children, this course will be a great resource to support your clients in developing better metacognitive learning skills (and it will save you lots of time and effort!)  It can also help you to expand your existing services or start additional services in your practice. You'll be able to go back to the short informative videos over and over and even use the videos in your therapy sessions (like some of my other students and therapists are doing already and with good results).\nIf you are an educator, this course will help you support the learners in your classes to develop better metacognitive learning skills (and improve their marks!) It can also help you to be more aware of possible adaptations that you can make in your way of teaching, such as creating PowerPoint presentations or notes, etc.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nUSE THIS LEARNING-HOW-TO-LEARN COURSE WITH MY OTHER COURSES\nI added my 'Flashcard Mapping Course' to the 'Learning How to Learn with the REAL Learning Process Path Course'.\nSo this TWO-IN-ONE COURSE now provides more in-depth information and an extra course on Flashcard Mapping (that is a surprising summary strategy!).\nThis comprehensive course can be used together with my other Udemy online course titled '7 Metacognitive Steps to Be More.'.\nIf you have both courses, you will have more information about metacognition and how the 7 Metacognitive Steps can be used to be more effective with executive function problems such as organization, focus, and time management. These skills require attention, especially in the first step of the REAL Learning Process and that's why this course can be used with the 'Learning How to Learn' course.\nWith both of my courses, you'll be ready to become a better thinker and learner or to help others become better thinkers and learners!\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU IN MY LEARNING COURSE!\nJoin me and my growing number of students from more than 65 countries!\n\n\nREMEMBER:\nYou'll have lifetime access to this course. The course is updated regularly, and additional videos and resources will be added in the future.",

      "description": "Your brain is central to everything you think, feel and do!\n\n\nLearn how to utilise your greatest asset to learn easier and create a more positive relationship with yourself!\n\n\nNo matter where we are or what we do - our brains are either working with us or against us. Or so it seems. The problem is that  we often don't slow down and pay enough attention to what our brain is trying to do - which is essentially look after us. It just doesn't always \"get it right\" for our modern world.\nWith some more knowledge (which we will teach you), some more self-awareness (we've got activities to get you started), and some proactive steps you can take right now (we've got you covered here too) - you can develop an amazing relationship with your Brain!\n\n\nHi! I'm Tanya, CEO/Founder of Learn Grow Become, a social enterprise based in regional Queensland (Australia) and dedicated to reinvesting 51% of profits back into Indigenous education initiatives.\nI've had a love /not-love relationship with my brain for pretty much forever. It's only in recent years I've become more and more focused on understanding how it all works, and how it can work better for me.\nWhen it comes to learning, I literally struggled for years and years and years, to get through various courses. It was only when I had the opportunity to expand my own teaching skills that I had the epiphany that if we taught students how to learn they would be empowered to create a learning (or life in general) experience that would work for them AND be a complete game changer.\nThis, combined with my curiosity around how our mind, body and emotions interconnect (and the brain/s in general) has led to the creation of this course. I personally believe that our relationship with our brains is a game changer for all parts of our lives.\nWe become much more aware and intentional - and stop wasting time and energy on the beliefs, words and actions that are not helping us feel good.\n\n\nSo what is this course all about?\nThis course is designed to teach you in a brain-friendly way, all about how your brain works and doesn't work when it comes to learning anything new. By the end:\nYou will have a deeper appreciation of what actually motivates you and what holds you back\nYou will have a support map in place and strategies to apply to any new learning situation\nYour awareness of your own marvellous brain will be expanded with some useful actions to take to improve its, and your effectiveness\nYou will have greater confidence in your own learning ability.\nAnd lots of other stuff too!\nIt is actually the first part of our Learn2Learn program.  All of the content is research based and research validated (CQUniversity, Swinburne University of Technology) to ensure that what outcomes we think you should get from the course are in fact possible, probable even. In short, it changes lives.\n\n\nYour Brain is a Game-Changer is an opportunity for you to learn more about how you can make the most of this magnificent part of yourself, and gain more control over how well you feel, think and act - in all parts of your life.\n\n\n\n\nFeedback from the entire Learn2Learn program:\n\"I needed to make some significant changes in my life…I would not have found the courage to do this without the help of the Learn2Learn programme…in learning about boundaries and strategies and goal setting. Writing why I wanted to study, goals, motivation really did fire up my courage to reach our for help to change things so I could study effectively and realise my dreams for a great life\"\n\n\n\"After completing my first semester and being awarded a supplementary exam for one of my units, I heavily, and negatively reflected on how i got this, naively thinking I was just going to cruise through university. this broke me. I cried for days, wondering why this have happened. I look at Learn2Learn as a big opportunity to redeem not just my study regime but my mental health. Learn2Learn makes my brain stop and reflect.\"\n\n\n\"The program really helped me go, okay I do need to get a schedule, and I do need to do things, sit down and do them properly, and learning how to do that was amazing…. I found that I retained stuff. Going into this term previously… [I’d be] ‘what did I do last semester?’ Now I’ve come to Term 3 and I can still apply the knowledge I’ve learned from Term 2 because I actually went through and did it properly.\"\n\n\n\"I found the Learn2Learn program truly empowering and inspiring. I really resonated with the engaging style and now feel that I am able to take charge of my own learning and truly succeed. As a qualified trainer I’d highly recommend this course to anyone ready to take charge of their learning and succeed, and it’s not often I’m able to say this about a course!\"\n\n\n\"Returning to University study for the first time in 20-something years was exciting and a bit daunting as well. I knew I had skills and experiences under my belt that would help me, but I also knew there were gaps and that I needed to prepare for what was ahead.\nThe Learn 2 Learn program was the perfect preparation for me. L2L is the right balance of big picture things (eg, how brains learn, things that get in the way of study success), and on-the-ground skills for Uni (eg study strategies, practical tips). The program is very well paced and a good balance of reading, videos and activities. It’s also great to be able to refer back to topics covered.\nL2L has given me some excellent hands-on skills for study, as well as increased my confidence to study. It’s also helped me feel like I belong to this bigger body of students/Uni life/academia, and that I am as worthy and as capable as anyone else to be there.\"",

      "description": "Hands-On Experiential Skills, not just Theory!\nAttention is the most important skill of life, and it is the basis for all other skills you need to be independent, productive and successful at what you do.  Attention is the ability to choose and concentrate on relevant stimuli. This cognitive ability is very important and is an essential function in your daily life.\n\nIt has become much more difficult to pay attention, due to having instant access to a large stream of incoming information AND entertainment (!) quite literally in the palm of your hand - the cell phones, tablets or other wireless handheld devices. These technological innovations have already impacted our attention span, staying focused and completing the higher priority projects.\n\nAttention is a cognitive and behavioral process which allows us to plan, monitor and regulate our Thoughts, Feelings and Actions.\n\nWe cannot understand, learn or remember that which we do not pay attention to. But we DO have the ability to choose to focus and concentrate on relevant stimuli and ignore or allocate minimal attention resources to stimuli that are not important at the moment.\n\nFocusing, focalization is different from concentration. Focusing involves holding an open attention, a non-judgmental observation which is directly experienced but is not found in words, more like Simultaneous attention.\n\nTherefore, in this course we will dive deeper on the Simultaneous Attention and different Types of Focusing, developing unique skills: awareness and observation are of crucial importance to best manage Focalization, Concentration.\n\nWe will combine the Cognitive with the Intuitive methods, developing a new set of Skills while we also make it fun.",

Então, se surgir essa dúvida, já respondo por aqui! Esse curso de mapas mentais é para todos que desejam aprender a usá-los, e não só para desenvolvedores.\n\n\nO mapa mental é uma ferramenta que proporciona diversos benefícios em qualquer área, seja de atuação ou da vida!\n\n\nPortanto, se você não é programador ou aspirante a um, saiba que esse curso de mapas mentais online é para você também!\n\n\nNão irei exigir nenhum conhecimento sobre desenvolvimento nem qualquer outra área, preciso apenas que queira aprender e desenvolver seu aprendizado!\n\n\nPor que fazer um curso de mapas mentais?\n\n\nPorque ao fazer um curso de mapas mentais você aprende a como organizar de forma clara suas atividades em qualquer área da vida, ganhando tempo e desenvolvendo melhor suas atividades do dia a dia.\n\n\nNesse curso você terá a oportunidade de aprender diferentes abordagens e estratégias para criar mapas mentais eficientes e visualmente atraentes.\n\n\nSe você for aluno, saberá utilizá-los ao seu favor durante sua aprendizagem, e se for professor, poderá aprender e pensar como trabalhar mapas mentais em sala de aula!\n\n\nAlém disso, mapas mentais oferecem uma maneira visual de representar as ideias, permitindo que você organize e conecte os conceitos de forma clara e intuitiva. Isso facilita a assimilação e a retenção das informações estudadas.\n\n\nAo criar mapas mentais, você pode explorar conexões não lineares entre os conceitos, usar cores, ícones e imagens para representar informações e desbloquear insights criativos. Essa abordagem amplia sua capacidade de visualizar e relacionar diferentes elementos, promovendo uma compreensão mais profunda e abrangente do assunto estudado.\n\n\nOutro aspecto importante é a melhoria da produtividade e eficiência de estudo. O uso de mapas mentais permite que você destaque informações essenciais, identifique lacunas de conhecimento e crie um plano de estudo mais organizado e estruturado.\n\n\nVale ressaltar que os benefícios do estudo por mapas mentais vão além do ambiente acadêmico. Essa técnica pode ser aplicada em diversas áreas da vida, como planejamento de projetos, resolução de problemas e organização pessoal.\n\n\nPor que estudar por mapas mentais?\n\n\nPor meio de uma representação gráfica, é possível identificar a estrutura e as conexões entre as ideias de forma clara e intuitiva. Além disso, os mapas mentais permitem uma visão panorâmica do assunto estudado. Ao criar um mapa mental, você pode visualizar o panorama geral, bem como os detalhes específicos relacionados a cada tópico.\n\n\nIsso ajuda na retenção de informações, pois você estará construindo uma representação visual que reflete a maneira como seu cérebro organiza e associa as informações.\n\n\nAlém disso, os mapas mentais são altamente personalizáveis e adaptáveis às suas próprias preferências e estilo de aprendizagem. Você pode criar mapas mentais à mão, utilizando papel e canetas coloridas, ou utilizar ferramentas digitais que permitem criar e editar mapas mentais de forma mais rápida e flexível.\n\n\nPor fim, estudar por mapas mentais pode tornar o processo de aprendizagem mais envolvente e divertido. Ao utilizar cores, imagens e padrões visuais, você está estimulando diferentes áreas do cérebro e tornando o estudo mais interativo e agradável.\n\n\nEstá pronto para dominar essa técnica e aprender como fazer um mapa mental para agilizar seu aprendizado em qualquer conteúdo? Então te vejo no curso!",

Bu araştırmaları yaparken hayretler içinde kaldım. Nasıl olur da bu çok değerli bilgileri okullarda geçirdiğimiz onca sene boyunca kimse bizimle paylaşmadı. \"Çok çalışmalısın\" diye öğüt veren çoktu fakat nasıl ders çalışılır?, daha doğrusu etkili bir öğrenme için beynimizi nasıl kullanmalıyız bunu bize kimse öğretmedi malesef. Onun için bu şaşırma hissleri yanında, bir de üzüntü ile kızgınlık kapladı içimi. Fakat sonradan anladım ki, meğerse bu çok değerli bilgileri bilen insan sayısı çok azdı, öbür türlü bunun bir izahı olamazdı.\nDüşünün çocuklarınıza bilimsel olarak etkili olduğu kanıtlanmamış ilaçlar verir miydiniz? Tabi ki de asla. Çocuklarımızın 16 seneden fazla okullarda geçirdikleri süre zarfında sürekli kullanmaları gereken beyinlerini, bilimsel olarak kanıtlanmış, etkililiği yüksek yöntemler ışığında kullanmak yerine, kulaktan dolma yöntemler ile ne kadar çok boşuna zaman ve enerji kaybettiklerini bilmek beni fazlasıyla üzmekte. Bu yüzden kendinizi çok ama çok şanslı saymalısınız çünkü artık bu çok değerli ve aynı zamanda çok güçlü bilgileri evinizin komforunda ulaşabileceksiniz.\n\n\nbeyinMAX  Masterclass kursunun içeriğinde ne var?\n1 - Üst düzey hafıza teknikleri: En güçlü hafıza tekniklerinden birisi olarak bilinen HAFIZA SARAYI tekniğini daha önce hiçbir kursta görmediğiniz ayrıntılandırılmış  örnek uygulamalarla en ince detayına kadar öğrenmiş olacaksınız.\n2 - Bilimsel araştırmalarca kanıtlanmış yüksek etkili aktif öğrenme teknikleri: İnsanların büyük çoğunluğu tarafından kullanılan (muhtemelen siz de dahil) düşük etkili teknikler yerine, BİLİMSEL OLARAK KANITLANMIŞ YÜKSEK ETKİLİ AKTİF ÖĞRENME TEKNİKLERİ öğrenerek hem okulda hem de iş hayatınızda üst düzey başarılar elde edin.\n3 - Odaklanma becerinizi tekrar elde ederek derin çalışma moduna geçmek için yöntemler: Bulunduğumuz dijital çağıda çoğumuzun kaybettigi odaklanma becerisini tekrar elde ederek derin çalışma moduna nasıl geçebileceğinizi öğrenmiş olacaksınız.\n\n\nSoru-cevap\n1. Kurs kimler içindir?\nÖğrenciler, Öğretmenler, Ebeveynler, Çalışanlar,Çalışanlarının performanslarını yükseltmek isteyen şirketler, Etkili öğrenmek isteyen herkes\n2. Kursa yeni videolar eklenecek mi?\nEvet. Kursumuz içerik bakımından oldukça zengin olduğu halde, ekleyeceğimiz yeni videoları da ekstradan hiçbir ücret ödemeden ulaşabileceksiniz\n3. Kursa ömür boyu erişebilecek miyim?\nEvet. Kursu bir kere satın aldığınızda artık ömür boyu içeriğe ulaşabileceksiniz, üstelik kursa yeni eklenen videolara da ücretsiz erişebilme imkanına sahipsiniz",

      "description": "Method of Loci: Master This Ancient Memory Skills in 7 Days\nThe Method of Loci for Total Recall: A Step-by-Step Guide & Ultimate Blueprint to Visualize, Store, & Recall Anything\n\n\nHave You Ever Felt the Unmistakable Sting of Your Own Mind Failing You at the Worst Possible Moment?\nIt’s a sensation that is both universally understood and deeply personal. It’s the sudden, unnerving silence in your own head when you desperately need a fact, a name, or an idea. It’s the heat that rises in your cheeks when you meet someone for the second time and you can see in their eyes that they remember you, but their name has vanished from your mind like smoke. It’s the quiet frustration of walking into a room with a clear purpose, only to stand there, bewildered, the intention completely gone, leaving you feeling adrift in your own home.\nThink back. Have you ever been in a crucial exam, your future hanging in the balance, staring at a question about a topic you know you studied for twelve hours straight, yet the answer remains just beyond your mental grasp? It’s there, somewhere in the fog, but you can’t access it. It’s a feeling of betrayal, not by a person, but by your own cognitive machinery.\nOr perhaps it was a professional setting. You were in a boardroom, surrounded by your peers and superiors. A brilliant, game-changing idea sparked in your mind. You saw the perfect moment to contribute, you opened your mouth to speak, and… nothing. The elegant point you had formulated dissolved into a clumsy, half-finished sentence. The moment passed, someone else spoke, and you were left with the lingering ghost of a missed opportunity, a feeling that you could have, and should have, been sharper.\nThis is the silent epidemic of the modern age. We are drowning in a sea of information—emails, reports, books, articles, news, data—and we are trying to navigate this tsunami with a mental rowboat. We accept forgetting as a simple, unchangeable fact of life. We laugh it off as a \"senior moment,\" even when we’re in our thirties. We plaster our lives with digital and physical crutches: endless notifications, alarms, sticky notes, and to-do lists, all in a desperate attempt to compensate for what we believe is a fundamentally flawed, leaky memory.\nBut what if this entire premise—the belief that your memory is a fixed, unreliable trait—is completely wrong?\nWhat if the extraordinary mental athletes you see on television, the ones who can memorize the names of everyone in a 200-person audience, weren’t born with superhuman brains? What if the legendary orators of ancient Rome who could speak for hours without a single note, the Renaissance polymaths who mastered dozens of disciplines, and the top CEOs who can recall minute details from a report they read six months ago, all share a common secret?\nThey do. It’s not a gift. It is a system.\nA system so powerful, so elegant, and so perfectly aligned with the way your brain is already designed to work that it can transform even the most scattered, forgetful mind into a highly organized, impeccably reliable, and instantly accessible fortress of knowledge. This system has been the secret weapon of the world’s greatest thinkers for over 2,500 years. It is called the Method of Loci, more evocatively known as the \"Mind Palace.\"\nThis method of loci course is your key. It is the definitive, step-by-step masterclass designed to take you from a state of mental frustration and chaos to one of absolute clarity, confidence, and cognitive control. This is the moment you stop accepting the limits of your memory. This is the moment you learn to build a mind without limits.\n\n\nThe True, Unspoken Cost of an Untrained Memory: A Heavy Price You No Longer Have to Pay\nBefore we can build a new reality, we must be brutally honest about the old one. The price of an untrained memory is far greater than the occasional inconvenience. It’s a cascade of subtle failures that erode our confidence, limit our opportunities, and steal our most valuable resource: time. Let’s hold a mirror up to these struggles and see if they reflect a part of your own experience.\nFor the Student Drowning in a Sea of Information… Imagine this scene: It's 2:00 AM. You’re surrounded by a fortress of textbooks and highlighted notes. Your eyes burn from staring at a screen, trying to force one more chapter, one more formula, one more historical timeline into your exhausted brain. You live on caffeine and anxiety, driven by the fear of the upcoming exam. The study methods that scraped you through high school—rote memorization and frantic, last-minute cramming—are now failing you spectacularly under the crushing weight of a university or graduate-level workload. You’re putting in the hours, but the knowledge isn’t sticking. It feels like pouring water into a bucket full of holes. You walk into the exam not with the quiet confidence of a scholar, but with the desperate hope of a gambler, praying that the few facts that happened to stick are the ones on the test. The grade you ultimately get feels like a judgment not on your intelligence, but on your inability to simply remember. This cycle of immense effort for mediocre results is demoralizing, and it makes you question if you even belong there at all.\nFor the Professional Whose Credibility is on the Line… You’re in a critical client meeting. You’re presenting a proposal you’ve worked on for weeks. But instead of connecting with the people in the room, your attention is fractured. Half of your mind is trying to deliver your message, while the other half is frantically trying not to lose your place in your notes. You make a key point, and someone asks for the specific data that supports it. You know it’s in the appendix of the report on your laptop, and the awkward pause while you say, \"One moment, let me just find that for you,\" feels like an eternity. The perception of expertise shatters in that moment, replaced by a perception of being unprepared. Later, at a conference, you bump into a potential business partner you met a month ago. You remember the conversation, but their name is gone. The warm re-introduction you envisioned becomes a clumsy, \"Hey… you!\" and the opportunity to deepen the relationship cools. These aren’t major failures, but they are a death by a thousand paper cuts to your professional reputation, your confidence, and your career trajectory.\nFor the Passionate Language Learner Stuck in \"Flashcard Purgatory\"… You fell in love with a new language and a new culture. You diligently practice the grammar rules and can deconstruct a sentence with precision. But when you try to speak, you hit a wall. A wall made of vocabulary. You spend hours drilling flashcards—digital or physical—trying to force hundreds of new, abstract sounds into your brain. You might remember a word for a day or two, but it’s fragile. In the heat of a real conversation, it’s gone. You can’t find the right noun, the perfect verb, the correctly gendered article. So you resort to simple, broken sentences, feeling like a caricature of yourself, unable to express the nuance of your thoughts. You are trapped in the \"intermediate plateau,\" and the joy of learning is slowly being replaced by the tedious, soul-crushing grind of rote memorization.\nFor the Lifelong Learner and Creative Mind Feeling the Fog… You have an insatiable curiosity. You devour non-fiction books, listen to podcasts, and watch documentaries. You feel a thrill every time you learn something new. But a deep, nagging frustration follows you: the knowledge is ephemeral. You can’t recall the brilliant arguments from the book you finished last month. The fascinating historical facts you learned have blended into a vague soup of information. Your mind feels less like a library and more like a junk drawer, full of interesting but disorganized and inaccessible items. Or perhaps you’re a creator, an entrepreneur with a mind full of brilliant ideas. But they swirl in a chaotic vortex, and when you try to structure them, they slip away. You fear your best ideas are lost to the ether simply because you lack a system to capture, organize, and build upon them. This isn’t just about memory; it’s about honoring your own curiosity and giving your ideas the structured home they deserve.\nThese struggles are not a reflection of your intelligence or your worth. They are the symptoms of a single, underlying problem: you were never taught how to learn. This course will finally give you the manual for your own mind that you should have been given on your first day of school.\n\n\nThe Grand Unveiling: The \"Mind Palace\" and the Science of Unforgettable Memory\nThe solution to these deep-seated frustrations is not a futuristic gadget or a complex new theory. It is, in fact, an ancient piece of wisdom, a technology of the mind that is as relevant today as it was in the forums of Rome. It is elegant, it is intuitive, and it is built upon the very foundation of how your brain loves to work.\nThe story of its discovery, passed down through generations, is a lesson in itself. Around 2,500 years ago, the Greek lyric poet Simonides of Ceos was attending a lavish banquet in a nobleman’s hall. He was called outside for a private message. In the moments he was gone, a catastrophic failure in the building’s structure caused the roof to collapse, crushing every single guest inside. The tragedy was so complete that the bodies were unrecognizable, leaving the grieving families unable to identify their loved ones for proper burial.\nAs the authorities despaired, Simonides, the sole survivor, stood amidst the ruins. He closed his eyes. In his mind, he did not see the chaos before him; he saw the banquet hall as it was just moments before the disaster. He began a mental walk around the great table. He saw the face of the first guest, sitting in his specific chair. He moved to the next seat, and saw the next guest, and the next, and the next. With flawless, unerring accuracy, he was able to name every single victim based on where they were located in the room.\nIn that moment of profound insight, Simonides discovered the fundamental principle of superior memory: the human brain may struggle to recall abstract, non-associated facts, but it is an absolute master at remembering places.\nThis is the very essence of the Method of Loci, the Mind Palace. You leverage your brain’s powerful, innate spatial memory as a filing system for any information you want.\nHere’s why this isn’t a parlor trick, but a deep neurological truth. When you try to remember a fact through rote repetition—chanting it over and over—you are using a very fragile, energy-intensive part of your brain’s working memory. It’s like trying to hold a dozen slippery fish in your bare hands. It’s exhausting, and you’re bound to drop most of them.\nBut when you use a Mind Palace, you are engaging a completely different, far more powerful part of your brain. You are tapping into the hippocampus, a beautiful, seahorse-shaped structure that acts as both your brain’s cartographer for spatial mapping and its librarian for encoding long-term memories. These two functions are deeply intertwined. By taking a piece of abstract information—like the name \"Christopher Columbus\"—and turning it into a concrete, interactive image (perhaps a giant crystal ball being held by a column) and placing it at a specific location in a familiar place (like your front doorstep), you are creating a rich, multi-sensory neural pathway. You are giving your brain the context, the visual cues, and the spatial anchors it craves.\nYou are, for the first time, working with the grain of your mind, not against it. That’s why it feels so effortless. That’s why the memories are so durable. And that is why this single technique can completely revolutionize your capacity to learn.\n\n\nThis is More Than a Course—It is a Guided, Step-by-Step Transformation\nThere are countless places online where you can find a superficial, two-minute summary of this technique. This is not one of them. A superficial understanding leads to superficial results. True mastery—the kind that allows you to deliver a speech from memory or ace a law school exam—requires a deep, structured, and systematic approach.\nThis masterclass is that system. It has been meticulously designed as a transformative journey, taking you by the hand and guiding you from the most basic foundations to the most advanced applications. We don’t just show you what to do; we explain the 'why' behind every step, we guide you through the practical exercises, and we build your skills layer by layer, ensuring you never feel overwhelmed.\nHere is a glimpse of the transformative journey you are about to embark upon, broken down into its six core phases:\n\n\nPhase 1 Method of Loci Course: Forging Your First Mind Palace This is where the transformation begins. We understand that your first experience must be one of success and empowerment. We guide you with surgical precision through the process of selecting the perfect, high-potential location for your first palace. You'll learn the non-negotiable rules for creating a palace that is stable and easy to navigate, and we will reveal the #1 catastrophic mistake that causes 99% of beginners to fail—so you can sidestep it with ease.

A future powered by a fully trained, reliable, and limitless memory. This isn't just about remembering more; it’s about becoming more.\nThe New You as a Student: You walk into your final exam, and for the first time, you feel a profound sense of calm. You don’t hope, you know. As you read the first complex essay question, you don’t feel a surge of panic. Instead, you feel a click of recognition. You close your eyes for a brief second and transport yourself to the third room of your \"Biology 101 Palace\"—the one you designated for cellular respiration. You begin your mental walk. At the first locus, the doorway, you see your ridiculous image for Glycolysis. At the second, the window, is the image for the Krebs Cycle. At the third, the bookshelf, is the image for the Electron Transport Chain. The information isn't a jumbled mess; it's a journey. You pick up your pen and begin to write, not just facts, but a structured, coherent, and deeply understood answer. You walk out of that exam not feeling drained, but feeling powerful.\nThe New You as a Professional: You are standing at the front of the conference room. Your CEO is in the front row. The quarterly presentation is about to begin. Your PowerPoint slides are elegant, containing only powerful images and a single keyword. There are no notes on the podium. You are the presentation. You start by making direct eye contact with everyone in the room. You tell a compelling story to open, an anecdote you stored at the entrance of your \"Quarterly Review Palace.\" You move seamlessly from financial data (stored on the couch) to marketing successes (stored by the window) to future outlooks (stored on the television). When the CEO interrupts with a pointed question about a specific metric from two quarters ago, you don't flinch. You mentally jump to the corresponding locus in your \"Q1 Palace,\" see the image, and answer with the exact number, confidently and without hesitation. The meeting ends not just with applause, but with a new level of respect and trust in your competence.\nThe New You as a Communicator: You are at a large social gathering, meeting your partner’s extended family for the first time. In the past, this would have been a nightmare of forgotten names and awkward re-introductions. But not anymore. As you meet Uncle David, you instantly link his distinctive laugh (your hook) to an image of the Star of David. When you meet Cousin Karen, you link her bright red hair to an image of a giant carrot. Later, you’re able to walk up to Uncle David and ask him about the fishing trip he mentioned, using his name. The warmth and surprise in his eyes tell you everything. You are no longer the forgetful outsider; you are the person who listens, who remembers, who cares. You are building genuine connections, one perfectly remembered name at a time.\nThis new reality is the direct promise of this course. It is a life characterized by confidence instead of anxiety, clarity instead of chaos, and competence instead of self-doubt. It is a life where your mind is your most powerful and reliable ally.\n\n\nWhy This Course? Why Now? The Unwavering Path to Genuine Mastery\nIn your search for a solution, you will encounter alternatives. You will find books on memory techniques. You will find free videos and articles that give you a taste of the Mind Palace. And for a small percentage of highly disciplined autodidacts, that may be enough. But for the vast majority of people, this fragmented, self-guided approach is a recipe for failure.\nA book can give you knowledge, but it cannot guide your practice, correct your course, or provide a structured, cumulative learning path. A free video can give you a momentary flash of inspiration, but it will leave you with critical gaps in your understanding and no clear strategy for moving from the basics to advanced application.\nThis masterclass is fundamentally different. It is not a collection of information; it is a coaching system.\nIt is a meticulously designed, step-by-step journey where every single lecture builds logically on the last. We anticipate the challenges you will face and provide the solutions before you even encounter them. We don't just teach you a technique; we instill the habits, the mindset, and the advanced strategies that separate the dabblers from the masters. We provide the structure that ensures you don’t just start, but that you actually finish and emerge with a fully integrated, life-changing skill.\nThe decision you face now is not simply whether to learn the Method of Loci. Its power and effectiveness have been proven beyond any doubt for over two millennia. The real decision is about you. It is a decision about what you believe you are capable of. It is a choice between two distinct futures.\nOne future is the continuation of the present: the familiar cycle of forgetting, the low-grade anxiety of information overload, the acceptance of a ceiling on your cognitive performance.\nThe other future is one of command, confidence, and control. It is a future where you possess a powerful, internal system for learning, remembering, and creating. It is a future where your mind is not a limitation but your greatest source of strength.\nThere is a cost to inaction. The cost is another semester of inefficient studying. The cost is another year of missed opportunities at work. The cost is another brilliant idea lost to the fog. The urgency you should feel is not external; it is the internal, pressing call of your own untapped potential.\nEvery day you delay is a day you could have been laying the foundations of your first palace. Every week you wait is a week you could have been mastering the art of encoding. Every month you postpone this decision is a month you could have been living with the benefits of a truly powerful memory. The perfect time will never magically appear. The time to act is now.\n\n\nYour Journey to a Limitless Mind Begins with a Single Step\nYou have read this far because you feel a resonance with the promise of this transformation. You recognize the frustrations, and you are inspired by the vision of a new reality. You stand at the threshold of a decision that can have a profound and lasting impact on every area of your life.\nDown one path is the world you already know, a world governed by the frustrating limitations of an untrained mind.\nDown the other is a world of your own creation, a world where your mind is an ordered, expansive, and beautiful palace of knowledge—a place you can explore, build, and rely upon. It is a path to becoming the most confident, capable, and intelligent version of yourself.\nThis course is the gateway to that second path. It contains the map, the tools, the guidance, and the step-by-step instruction to ensure you walk it successfully. Everything you need is here. The only thing required to begin this extraordinary journey is your commitment.\nThis is your invitation. An invitation to stop compensating for a \"bad memory\" and start cultivating a brilliant one. An invitation to join the lineage of the world's most effective thinkers. An invitation to finally unlock the incredible, untapped power that already resides within your own mind.\nEnroll now. Let's lay the first stone of your new mental empire, together.",

      "description": "Understanding Cognition and Cognitive Decline\nCognition encompasses the mental processes that allow individuals to function in daily life. It involves various abilities such as learning, remembering, and making judgments. These cognitive abilities enable a person to perform tasks, interact socially, and navigate their environment effectively.\nWhat is Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD)?\nSubjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) refers to a self-perceived worsening of cognitive abilities, specifically in memory and executive functions, without objective evidence of impairment measured by standard cognitive tests. Individuals experiencing SCD might notice they are more forgetful than usual—for instance, misplacing everyday items like car keys or a TV remote, or having trouble recalling names or directions.\nImplications of SCD\nSCD is significant as it can be one of the earliest indicators of potential future cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. It's important to note, however, that SCD does not guarantee the development of such conditions, but it can serve as an early warning sign prompting further evaluation and monitoring.\nDaily Challenges and Psychological Impact\nThe impact of SCD extends beyond mere forgetfulness. It can affect the ability to carry out everyday activities, such as cooking, cleaning, and personal care, which in turn can lead to increased dependency on others. The frequent inability to perform routine tasks can also severely affect self-esteem and confidence, contributing to stress and anxiety.\nRole of Art Therapy in Managing Cognitive Decline\nArt therapy offers a therapeutic approach that can be particularly beneficial for individuals with SCD or early cognitive impairment. Here’s how art therapy can help:\nCognitive Stimulation: Engaging in artistic activities stimulates the brain, potentially slowing cognitive decline by enhancing neural connectivity.\nEmotional Expression: Art provides a non-verbal medium for expressing feelings and thoughts, which can be especially useful for individuals who might be struggling with verbal expression due to cognitive changes.\nStress Reduction: The act of creating art is often relaxing and meditative, helping to reduce stress, which is a known factor that can exacerbate cognitive decline.\nSocial Interaction: Participating in group art therapy sessions can decrease feelings of isolation and provide social support, important for emotional and cognitive health.\nConclusion\nAddressing the challenges of SCD through therapeutic interventions like art therapy can be a valuable strategy for maintaining cognitive health and enhancing quality of life. It can offer not only a creative outlet but also a form of cognitive rehabilitation, which might help to stabilize or improve the perceived decline. For individuals noticing signs of SCD, or for those helping someone with these symptoms, incorporating art therapy can be a proactive step towards managing cognitive health.",

      "description": "Memory Mansion Masterclass- Guide To Ultimate Memory Power\nMemory Manson Masterclass- The Definitive Guide to Unlocking Your Photographic Memory and Conquering Any Information.\nHave you ever felt that frustrating, sinking feeling of a forgotten name? The maddening search for a key fact that’s just on the tip of your tongue? The silent dread of a mental blank during a presentation? You’re not alone. In a world of infinite information, our most powerful tool—our mind—often feels like a disorganized, cluttered mess. We're told we have \"bad memories,\" that we're simply not wired for recall, that some people are just born with it. That lie has been holding you back.\nThis course is your demolition crew for that lie. It's your blueprint for building a palace. It’s your masterclass in becoming a cognitive architect.\nWelcome to Memory Mansion: Build a Palace in Your Mind, the definitive program for anyone ready to transcend the limits of their memory. This is not about rote memorization or dusty flashcards. This is about a fundamental, powerful transformation. Over the next twelve sections, we will guide you on an extraordinary journey to unlock your brain's innate genius, a latent superpower you've possessed since birth. We will show you how to build a mental fortress so robust, so organized, and so effortlessly accessible that no piece of information will ever truly be forgotten again.\nThis is for the ambitious student drowning in lecture notes, the professional striving for an edge in a competitive world, the lifelong learner with an insatiable curiosity, and anyone who has ever felt their mind was working against them. You will discover that your memory isn't broken; it's simply been waiting for the right system. And that system is what we will build together.\nThe Grand Tour: Your Journey Through the Memory Mansion Masterclass\nThis course is a meticulously designed journey, moving you from a complete beginner to a master of your mind. We will not just tell you what to do; we will build each skill step-by-step, with a powerful practical challenge after every core lesson. Here is a detailed look at the extraordinary journey you are about to take:\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 1: The Mind's Untamed Wilderness: Unleashing Your Latent Cognitive Power\nThis first section is your gateway to a cognitive revolution, a profound journey to dismantle the single biggest lie that has held you back: the belief that you have a \"bad memory.\" We start by confronting this misconception head-on in our foundational lecture, The Untapped Brain: Unlocking Your True Memory Potential. You'll discover that your memory isn't a fixed, unchangeable trait; it's a dynamic skill that has been waiting for the right guidance. Most of us have been taught to memorize in the most inefficient way possible—through tedious, mind-numbing repetition that our brains actively resist. We've been operating on flawed software. This lecture will be your \"aha!\" moment, a realization that your mind is an extraordinary machine, already a master at remembering what it finds interesting, emotional, or, most importantly, spatial.\nWe delve into the science behind this. You will learn that your ability to navigate the physical world—to walk through your childhood home in your mind's eye, to recall the winding turns of your daily commute, or to remember the precise location of your car in a parking lot—is not random. It's a testament to your innate spatial intelligence, a primal superpower hardwired into your brain for survival. The lecture reveals how this natural ability, when consciously harnessed, becomes your secret weapon for retaining any type of information, from phone numbers to complex scientific principles. This insight fundamentally shifts your perspective, transforming you from a passive victim of your memory to its active master. You will understand that your memory problems are not a result of a broken mind, but of a missing system.\nThe journey from passive memory to active mastery begins with your first, crucial step. In the accompanying practical challenge, Your First Cornerstone: Identifying Your Ideal Memory Space, you will move from theory to tangible action. This is more than a simple exercise; it's the foundational act of creating your cognitive home. We guide you to select a physical location you know intimately—your home, a favorite park, a well-known route—and then systematically, mentally walk through it. This intentional act of observation and visualization is the first step in building your Memory Mansion, the personal, organized, and infinitely expandable fortress where all future knowledge will reside. You will begin to map this space, noting the key landmarks and objects that will serve as the anchors for your memories.\nThis is a powerful act of creation. It's about taking something you know instinctively and giving it a new purpose. We'll show you how to engage all your senses in this mental walk, solidifying the space in your mind to a degree you've never experienced before. By the end of this section, you will not only have debunked the myth of a \"bad memory\" but will have also laid the unshakeable cornerstone of your own personal palace of the mind, a space that will become the bedrock of a new, more powerful you.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 2: Architecting the Impossible: Foundations of Your Mental Palace\nThis section is where your creative journey truly begins. You've established your mental home base, and now, it's time to learn the language your brain understands best: vivid, absurd, and multi-sensory images. This is the alchemy of memory, the powerful secret to transforming a simple word or fact into an unforgettable, dynamic picture. The lecture, The Unforgettable Image: Igniting Your Creative Recall Engine, will reveal the CRAVE principle—a simple, powerful acronym that stands for Colorful, Ridiculous, Action-packed, Vivid, and Emotional. You'll discover that your brain isn't interested in generic, static images; it actively craves the strange, the bizarre, and the emotionally charged. We'll show you precisely how to apply each of these principles, turning a mundane shopping list item into a chaotic scene that makes you laugh out loud, a dry scientific term into a hilarious, chaotic cartoon, or a difficult name into a memorable, theatrical character. This is the heart of our system, and it will fundamentally change how you encode all future information, making every new piece of data a captivating story waiting to be told.\nThe concepts we discuss in the first lecture will be immediately solidified in your second practical challenge, Your First Masterpiece: Crafting Vivid Memory Images. This isn't just a mental exercise; it's a creative act, a hands-on application where you will take the first steps to truly mastering your imagination. You'll be given a set of five challenging, unrelated pieces of information—perhaps a foreign vocabulary word, a historical date, or a technical term—and, with our step-by-step guidance, you'll apply the CRAVE principles to each one. You will not only prove to yourself that you can do this, but you will create the first inhabitants of your growing mental palace.\nAs you craft these unforgettable mental masterpieces and place them into the first room of your Memory Mansion, you'll feel a powerful shift. The act of learning will no longer be a chore but a playful, imaginative, and highly effective experience. You will be actively building, not just memorizing, and creating the first, vivid pieces of art in your own magnificent mind.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 3: Blueprinting Brilliance: Designing Your Memory Mansion Layout\nA powerful palace needs a solid blueprint, and a disorganized mind needs a clear map. This section is dedicated to transforming your Memory Mansion from a simple space into a functional, impeccably organized system. The lecture, Crafting Your Mansion's Logical Flow, will teach you the art of strategic design. You'll discover that a collection of isolated, vivid images, while memorable, isn't a true system. True mastery comes from creating a fixed, sequential path through your mental space. You will learn how to design a logical flow that guides your mind effortlessly from one piece of information to the next, just as a well-designed building guides a visitor from room to room. This powerful technique, which we'll refer to as the \"sequential superpower,\" turns chaotic data into a logical, navigable journey, eliminating the frustrating feeling of getting lost in your own thoughts.\nThe concepts of strategic layout will be immediately put to the test in your practical challenge, Mapping Your Mansion's Detailed Layout. This is where you move from the conceptual to the concrete. You will meticulously plan your first few rooms, defining and numbering specific memory spots in a fixed order along your chosen route. This isn't just a mental exercise; it's the act of building the organized backbone of your entire memory system. By intentionally mapping out this internal architecture, you are training your brain to create robust neural pathways that will serve as the foundation for flawless recall. The more detailed and deliberate you are in this planning phase, the more effortlessly your mind will be able to store and retrieve vast amounts of information in the future.\nAs you complete this challenge, you will experience the profound sense of control and clarity that comes with a well-structured mind. The frustration of disorganized thoughts will begin to fade, replaced by a quiet confidence in your new ability to systematically manage and access knowledge. You'll be taking a monumental step from being a passive recipient of information to becoming the master architect of your own cognitive landscape, ready to build a memory system that is not only powerful, but also infinitely expandable and reliable.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 4: The Grand Tour Guide: Mastering Spatial Navigation & Recall\nYou've built your palace and mapped its blueprint. Now, it's time to become the master tour guide of your own mind. This section focuses on a crucial distinction: placing information is one thing; retrieving it is another. In the lecture, Your Mental Compass: Effortless Navigation, you will learn the art of the active recall walkthrough. This isn't just a passive mental stroll; it's a deliberate, systematic practice that builds and strengthens the neural pathways to your stored knowledge. We'll show you how to use your fixed route to guide you from one memory spot to the next, making the retrieval process feel less like a search and more like an effortless, guided tour. You'll discover how the simple act of consistently \"walking\" your mental palace transforms retrieval from a frustrating struggle into an automatic, almost instantaneous process.\nThe concepts of navigation will be immediately solidified in your practical challenge, Your Guided Tour: Navigating & Retrieving With Precision. This is the crucible where your skills are truly forged. You will take a short list of new information and, after placing it with your image-creation techniques, you will perform multiple timed mental walkthroughs. The goal is not just to remember the information, but to do so with increasing speed and without a single fumble. This hands-on exercise will give you a visceral, exhilarating experience of your system's power. It’s the moment you stop believing and start knowing that you can access any piece of knowledge you’ve stored, precisely when you need it.\nAs you complete this challenge, you will feel a profound shift in your cognitive confidence. The fear of forgetting will begin to fade, replaced by the empowering knowledge that you have a reliable, organized system at your command. You will no longer feel like a victim of your memory, but its masterful guide, ready to take on any learning challenge with poise and precision.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 5: Populating Your Palace: Crafting Unforgettable Memory Images\nThis section elevates your memory skills from simply creating images to bringing them to life. You've learned to make information vivid, but what about those challenging abstract concepts—the theories, principles, and dense ideas that have no physical form? This is where true mastery begins. In the lecture, The Character Conjurer, you'll discover a powerful, transformative secret: your brain loves to remember people and their stories. You'll learn to animate these intangible ideas by turning them into living, breathing characters. Imagine transforming a complex economic principle into a mischievous, scheming figure or a philosophical concept into a wise, whimsical sage. This technique, known as personification, is the key to unlocking subjects that previously felt impenetrable, making them not just memorable, but deeply intuitive and engaging.\nThe knowledge from the lecture is immediately put into practice in your challenge, Animating Abstract Concepts into Characters. This is your opportunity to flex your creative muscles on some of the most difficult types of information. You'll take three complex, intangible ideas—perhaps a scientific law, a psychological theory, or a business strategy—and apply the principles of personification to them. You'll design your own cast of mental characters, giving them distinct personalities, actions, and even emotions. As you place these animated entities into your Memory Mansion, you'll feel a profound sense of empowerment. The frustration of grappling with abstract ideas will be replaced by the sheer confidence of knowing you can now make any piece of information come alive in your mind, ready to be recalled with ease and confidence.\nAs you complete this challenge, you will experience the profound sense of control and clarity that comes with a well-structured mind. The frustration of disorganized thoughts will begin to fade, replaced by a quiet confidence in your new ability to systematically manage and access knowledge. You'll be taking a monumental step from being a passive recipient of information to becoming the master architect of your own cognitive landscape, ready to build a memory system that is not only powerful, but also infinitely expandable and reliable.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 6: The Narrative Arc: Weaving Stories Into Your Mental Architecture\nThis section is where memory becomes a cinematic experience. You've learned to create powerful, isolated mental images, but now you'll discover how to link them into an epic, unforgettable saga. In the lecture, The Story Weaver, you'll learn the art of creating \"narrative chains.\" This technique is based on a simple, profound truth: your brain is hardwired for stories. You'll learn how to connect one vivid image to the next in a continuous, often bizarre, story. We'll show you how to create \"bizarre bridges\"—exaggerated, multi-sensory transitions where one image morphs into or interacts with the next. This is the secret behind how memory champions can flawlessly recall long lists, complex sequences, or the order of a shuffled deck of cards. You will no longer see information as a static list, but as a dynamic, unfolding plot waiting to be told.\nThe knowledge from this lecture is immediately solidified in your practical challenge, Your First Saga: Weaving Stories for Sequential Information. This is your chance to become a master storyteller of your own mind. You will take a short sequential list of unrelated items—perhaps a to-do list, a list of random words, or a series of historical events—and apply the narrative chain technique. You will create a continuous mental story, a \"micro-epic\" that moves from one item to the next in a bizarre and unforgettable sequence. As you \"play\" this saga in your mind and place it along a fixed route in your Memory Mansion, you will prove to yourself that you can now remember any ordered information as a fun, effortless, and deeply engaging journey.\nAs you complete this challenge, you will feel a profound shift in your ability to handle complex, sequential data. The frustration of trying to memorize a list will be replaced by the joy of creating a captivating mental adventure. You are not just remembering; you are truly creating, and this newfound power will make every future learning experience a more engaging and effective one.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 7: Digital Dwellings & Analog Adventures: Integrating Modern Tools\nWhile your mind is the ultimate tool, we live in a digital world brimming with powerful aids. This section is about creating a synergistic partnership between your brain's organic power and the efficiency of modern technology. The lecture, Blending Brainpower with Tools, will show you how to strategically use digital notes and apps not as crutches, but as an \"external brain.\" You'll learn to offload routine or transient information—like grocery lists, quick reminders, or web links—to free up your mental energy for deeper learning and creative thought. We'll introduce you to the core principle of a hybrid memory system, which ensures your Memory Mansion remains uncluttered and focused on high-value, long-term knowledge, while your digital tools handle the day-to-day data with effortless precision.\nThe concepts from this lecture will be immediately applied in your practical challenge, Hybrid Memory System Integration. This is a design exercise where you'll create a personalized workflow that seamlessly connects your internal and external worlds. You'll choose a new area of study or a project and determine which information is best stored in your Memory Mansion and which is better suited for an app or a notebook. The core of this challenge is designing a conscious \"bridge\"—a system of tags, cues, or mental prompts—that allows you to effortlessly jump between your digital notes and the relevant mental locations in your mansion. By the end of this challenge, you will have built a resilient, future-proof system that leverages the strengths of both your mind and your technology, ensuring you never feel overwhelmed by information again.\nAs you complete this challenge, you will experience the profound sense of efficiency that comes with a streamlined, interconnected system. You'll no longer feel the mental burden of trying to remember every single detail, because you'll have a smart, reliable way to manage it. This is a monumental step toward becoming a truly modern learner, capable of navigating and mastering information in a world that is constantly generating new data.\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 8: Beyond The Basics: Advanced Rooms for Complex Information\nFor the truly ambitious, this section unlocks the door to next-level memory mastery. You've built your foundation and populated your palace with vivid images, and now you are ready to conquer the most challenging type of information: vast, interconnected, and complex subjects. The lecture, Expanding Your Memory Horizons, will teach you advanced strategies to manage a volume of information that would overwhelm a conventional memory system. You will learn about \"Micro-Mansions\", a groundbreaking technique where you dedicate an entire, new mental palace to a single, intricate topic, allowing for unparalleled depth and organization. You'll also master \"Information Layering\", a method for storing multiple levels of detail within a single memory spot, turning a simple image into a rich, multi-layered repository of knowledge.\nThe practical challenge, Mapping Complex Information, is where you'll put these advanced concepts to the ultimate test. You will take a dense subject—perhaps a scientific principle, a historical event with many contributing factors, or a complex business model—and deconstruct it into its core components. Then, using your new skills, you will visually map and link these interconnected parts, creating a comprehensive cognitive web within a new section of your Memory Mansion. This hands-on exercise is about more than just remembering facts; it's about fundamentally re-engineering how your mind processes complexity, transforming a seemingly impenetrable topic into a clear, understandable, and easily navigable landscape.\nAs you complete this challenge, you will experience the exhilarating feeling of conquering a subject that once seemed impossible to master. The frustration of being overwhelmed by dense information will be replaced by a profound sense of clarity and control. You will have proven to yourself that your Memory Mansion is not just a tool for simple lists, but a powerful, infinitely scalable architecture capable of housing and illuminating the most intricate knowledge.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 9: Vaults of Vitality: Storing Names, Dates, & Numbers with Ease\nThis section is where we conquer the most common frustrations in memory: the elusive, arbitrary pieces of data that seem to defy all logic. This is the memory minefield that trips up even the most diligent students. The lecture, Mastering the Memory Minefield, will equip you with specialized systems designed to translate abstract data into concrete, unforgettable images. You will learn the Name-Face Link, a technique for creating a dynamic, often absurd image that connects a person's name to a specific feature on their face, ensuring you never forget a name again. We'll also dive into number-to-image conversion methods like the Number Shape and Number Rhyme systems, which turn cold, impersonal digits into a cast of memorable characters or objects. These aren't just tricks; they're powerful tools that give you direct, conscious control over the most frustrating parts of memory.\nThe knowledge from this lecture is immediately put into practice in your challenge, Precision Data Encoding. This is a hands-on exercise designed to prove that you can recall any specific detail with effortless confidence. You will apply the skills you've just learned to three distinct tasks: creating a Name-Face Link for an acquaintance, encoding a short number sequence into a vivid story, and turning a historical date and its associated event into a single, cohesive mental image. This challenge is about more than just remembering; it's about building the muscle of precision recall. You will see for yourself how these specialized systems transform difficult data into a source of confidence.\nAs you complete this challenge, you will experience the profound relief of knowing you can handle the most frustrating aspects of memory with ease. The feeling of a name being \"on the tip of your tongue\" will become a thing of the past. You will have built a personal Vault of Vitality within your Memory Mansion, a secure, organized space for all those specific details that once seemed impossible to remember.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 10: The Perceptual Gateway: Enhancing Sensory Input for Super-Recall\nThis section is where you learn to make your memories truly come alive. While you've already mastered creating vivid, visual images, you've only been using a fraction of your brain's power. The lecture, Activating Your Full Sensory Power, will teach you a groundbreaking technique: how to consciously infuse all five senses into your mental images. You'll discover that your brain stores information more deeply when it's attached to a multi-sensory experience. We'll show you how to deliberately add sound, smell, touch, and even taste to your mental creations, transforming them from flat pictures into rich, immersive, and unshakeable memories. This is the secret to creating a cognitive landscape so detailed and so real that forgetting becomes nearly impossible.\nThe concepts from this lecture will be immediately put into practice in your challenge, Sensory Immersion. This is a powerful, hands-on exercise designed to prove the strength of this technique. You will revisit a few of the memories you've already encoded in your Memory Mansion from previous sections. Your task is to \"re-encode\" these memories, not by changing the image, but by adding a symphony of sensory details. For example, you might add the crunching sound of a specific image, the smell of its environment, or the texture of its surface. This process of intentional, multi-sensory enhancement will transform your existing memories, giving them a new level of richness and durability.\nAs you complete this challenge, you will experience a profound shift in how you relate to your memories. They will no longer feel like distant, blurry photos, but like vivid, living experiences that you can step back into at will. This skill not only makes your memories more robust, but it also makes the act of learning more engaging and enjoyable. You will have unlocked a new dimension of your cognitive potential, ensuring that your Memory Mansion becomes a truly vibrant and unforgettable world.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 11: Maintenance & Mastery: Future-Proofing Your Memory Fortress\nThis section is where you graduate from builder to master architect. You've created a magnificent mental palace, but true mastery is not a one-time achievement; it's a continuous journey. The lecture, Lasting Retention, will show you how to move your memories from short-term to permanent storage using proven, scientific methods. You'll learn about spaced repetition, a highly effective technique that teaches you to review information at the optimal moments to prevent forgetting. We'll also emphasize the power of active retrieval, proving that the act of pulling information from your mind strengthens its pathways more than any passive review. These strategies ensure your Memory Mansion becomes not just a storage space, but an indestructible fortress of knowledge.\nThe knowledge from this lecture will be immediately applied in your practical challenge, Lifetime Memory Fortification. This is a design exercise where you'll create a personalized maintenance plan and a strategy for future expansion. You'll outline a simple, consistent schedule for reviewing your most important memories, ensuring they remain vibrant and accessible for decades to come. You will also begin to plan how you'll expand your mental empire, identifying new topics you want to learn and the new rooms or sections you will build to house them. This is the moment you commit to becoming a lifelong learner, with a system that is infinitely scalable.\nAs you complete this challenge, you will experience the profound confidence that comes from knowing your knowledge is secure. The fear of forgetting will be replaced by the empowerment of having a clear, actionable plan for continuous growth. You'll realize that your Memory Mansion is not a static building, but a living, breathing, and ever-expanding legacy that will serve you for the rest of your life.\n\n\nMemory Mansion Masterclass Section 12: The Infinite Architect: Expanding Your Mental Empire Endlessly\nThis final section is not an end, but a beginning. You have built an incredible mental palace, and now you are ready to become a master of an infinite cognitive universe.

The Memory Mansion technique, also known as the Method of Loci or Mind Palace, is an ancient memory system that leverages your brain's natural ability to remember places. You mentally create a familiar location (like your home or a favorite park) and then place vivid, memorable images representing information you want to recall in specific spots within that space. By mentally \"walking\" through the location, you can retrieve the information in the correct order.\nIs this technique scientifically proven? Yes. The Method of Loci is one of the most well-documented and scientifically validated memory techniques. Research in cognitive neuroscience has shown that it effectively activates and strengthens the brain's hippocampus, a region critical for both spatial navigation and memory. It is a powerful way to move information from short-term to long-term memory.\nDo I need a \"good imagination\" to do this? Absolutely not. The ability to create vivid images is a skill, not a talent. We will guide you step-by-step on how to use principles like CRAVE (Colorful, Ridiculous, Action-packed, Vivid, Emotional) to make any image unforgettable. The more you practice, the more your imagination will flourish, and the easier the process will become.\nHow is this different from other memory courses? This course provides a complete, cohesive system, not just a collection of disconnected tricks. We start with the foundational principles and build a full, infinitely expandable architecture in your mind. We don't just teach you how to remember; we teach you how to think about information in a way that makes it naturally stick, and how to maintain that knowledge for a lifetime.\nCan this technique help me remember abstract or boring information? Yes, that's one of its biggest strengths. This course includes dedicated sections on how to transform abstract concepts, numbers, names, and dates into concrete, personified, and highly memorable images. We will show you how to conquer even the most difficult subjects by translating them into the language your brain loves.\nHow long does it take to see results? You will see immediate results within the very first section of the course. The practical challenges are designed to show you what's possible from day one. With consistent practice, you'll feel a profound and lasting change in your memory and learning abilities within just a few weeks.\nIs this course suitable for me if I'm a professional or a student? Yes, this course is designed for both. Whether you're a professional needing to master data for a presentation or a student overwhelmed by lecture notes, the Memory Mansion system provides a universal framework. The skills you learn are applicable to any field or subject, from mastering legal precedents to recalling key sales figures.\nCan I use this for creative work, like writing or art? Absolutely. This technique is a powerful tool for creative professionals. It allows you to build a vast mental library of ideas, character traits, story arcs, and sensory details. You can create a \"palace\" for every project, ensuring your creative work is always fueled by a rich and accessible store of inspiration.\nDo I need to be a \"visual learner\" to benefit from this? No, you do not. This course teaches you to leverage all five senses, not just sight. You will learn how to incorporate sound, smell, touch, and even taste into your memories. This multi-sensory approach is far more powerful than relying on visuals alone and works with the way your brain is truly wired.\nIs this just for memorizing lists? No, it's for much more than that. While you'll master lists and sequences, this course is designed to help you understand and retain complex information. You'll learn to map intricate subjects, link disparate concepts, and build a cohesive web of knowledge that supports true, deep understanding.\nWill this course help me with my confidence? Yes, profoundly. A major side effect of this course is a dramatic increase in self-confidence. The ability to recall information with precision and ease reduces anxiety in social and professional settings. You'll no longer fear a mental blank and will feel empowered by your newfound cognitive control.",

      "description": "Increase your mind's activity with 28 simple exercises and get it working the way it should. Brain exercises help you to work better and faster on memory, concentration and problem-solving.\nWhat is brain biohacking?\nThe word BIO is short for biology, and BIOHACKING is a combination of words that means hacking, i.e. improving and enhancing biological functions. It's not hacking in the bad sense, it's repairing. It is an improvement of the way our brain works. Some of the exercises were developed by Japanese professor Yoshiro Tsutsumi. In kinesiology, we use exercises to develop skills in children, to improve motor coordination in athletes and students, to facilitate language learning, and to improve memory in older age.\nAre you ready to keep your mind sharp and young?\nIf so, Brain Biohacking is the course for you. This course is for those who...\nwant to have a perfect memory.\nwant to keep their minds sharp and young.\nwant to learn languages more easily and memorise large amounts of information.\nwant to memorise dates, phone numbers and important events more easily.\nwant to avoid age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.\nwant to learn poems and plays more easily.\nwant to be cheerful and energetic.\nOur brains also need energy to work. Did you know that the organ that uses the most energy is the brain? After the age of 35, the quality of nerve cells and the number of mitochondria starts to decline significantly. As a result, the brain doesn't get enough energy - so we wake up in the morning tired and exhausted. We turn to sweets and coffee instead of breakfast because we need more energy - and these foods only temporarily give us more energy. We find it harder to remember things, we can't concentrate properly; our memory deteriorates; and when we are tired, we forget more often than usual. This makes us more nervous, more tense with colleagues and family members. We feel drained because we don't have enough energy stored in our cells (mitochondria) to help us carry out our daily activities.\nBut there is a solution: brain biohacking!\nLike most of our organs and muscles, the brain can also be trained. Memory and cognitive skills can be improved. You don't need to learn special techniques or go on a course lasting several weeks. You may have to buy tools, medicines or preparations. You just need to learn some very simple techniques to keep your brain in constant training.\nThat's why this course was created, with its unique exercises to develop the brain's nerve cells.\nThe method is all about flexibility of the joints and asynchronous cross movements that improve the brain's cognitive abilities. These movements are more difficult at the beginning because our brain has to cope with them, creating new synaptic connections. After a few days of practice, the tasks become easier and our brains are surprisingly clearer and more focused. Our memory improves, our mental abilities develop.\nAbout the course\nIn this online course, 28 videos help you learn the exercises. These movements are very easy to memorise, can be done in under a minute. There is a bonus video, beneficial for tunnel syndrome and joint stiffness and another video to help you establish a daily routine.\nAccess to the course is unlimited. You can learn about brain integrity, the background to memory impairment, and the method.",

      "description": "Padroneggia un metodo inedito, efficace ed universale, per risolvere problemi matematici da liceo in modo rapido e senza errori di calcolo, rendendo finalmente CONCRETA la materia più astratta di tutte! Adatto anche a studenti DSA o BES, poichè quasi esclusivamente grafico... e i calcoli necessari sono sempre il minimo possibile. Anche se parti da zero, anche se ti hanno fatto odiare la matematica, anche se hai poco tempo, anche se credi che per te sia quasi impossibile!\nEcco una testimonianza sul metodo che mi ha fornito un ex-studente della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa cioè la \"elite\" delle università italiane:\n\"Tutti abbiamo imparato a scuola a fare le operazioni a più cifre (somme, moltiplicazioni, etc.) con carta e penna seguendo rigidi schemi grafici, in cui la giusta posizione dei numeri è la chiave per evitare gli errori.\nCosì operazioni che a mente sono impossibili, diventano facili perché basta seguire lo schema giusto. Se invece non potessimo mettere in colonna i resti, riusciremmo davvero a fare le divisioni con numeri a tre cifre?\nQuesta è la potenza dei metodi grafici.\n\nBene, la rivoluzione di questo corso è stata portare lo stesso principio ai problemi di algebra, inventando uno schema grafico che ti guida a risolvere il problema. La cosa incredibile è la sua semplicità, tanto che viene naturale chiedersi come mai nessuno ci abbia pensato prima.\nPerò devo avvertire che rovina un po' la magia ed il brivido che si prova nel trovare la giusta soluzione in modo 'intuitivo e geniale'! Come col fare le operazioni in colonna, tutto diventa semplice e meccanico! - Livio Cocconcelli\"\n\nEcco cosa troverai in questo corso:\nVideo-lezioni scaricabili\nAudio-lezioni scaricabili\nMappa mentale del metodo stampabile\nTesto completo del metodo stampabile\nRiassunti per ognuno dei 7 passi del metodo\nEsercizi interattivi multimediali\nEsercizi proposti dai partecipanti risolti & commentati\nUna guida \"Quick Start\" per iniziare a risolvere con successo problemi matematici già nel giro di pochi minuti.\n...e tanto altro, perchè il corso crescerà e diventerà sempre più ricco nel tempo grazie anche al TUO contributo!...\nIn meno di 40 minuti avrai già visto più volte in azione il metodo \"dal vivo\" e sul tuo schermo, capito in cosa consiste e scoperto quali sono le domande-guida sempre valide che ti aiuteranno a risolvere tutti i problemi.\nIn meno di 4 ore sarai già in piena operatività e potenzialmente in grado di risolvere almeno il 90% dei problemi da prima liceo (e molti anche di seconda!) con una facilità che ti lascerà a bocca aperta.\n\nIl corso procede per approfondimenti successivi, in modo che chi ha intuito e/o conoscenze possa apprendere il metodo nel minor tempo possibile ed iniziare ad usarlo anche senza conoscere tutti i dettagli.\nMa dando modo a chi vuole maggiori approfondimenti di trovarne a volontà, fin al più piccolo dettaglio, spiegato in modo semplice, chiaro, conciso e.... divertente!\n\nNon troverai da nessuna parte un'opportunità simile per:\nimparare a risolvere problemi matematici da liceo, in un modo innovativo ma di provata efficacia e validità, anche per studenti DSA o BES, perchè principalmente grafico.\npadroneggiare (quasi senza volerlo) tutta l'aritmetica e l'algebra che usa il 90% delle persone nel corso della sua intera vita!\ndivertirti nel frattempo ...e capendo finalmente tutto e solo quello che serve sapere per risolvere problemi matematici da liceo, nel giro di pochi minuti.\n\nNiente fronzoli, SOLO SOSTANZA.

      "description": "Course goal:\nThis course will help you to complete your degree, become an expert in your field and a lifelong learner.\nWhat will students learn in the course?\n· Apply efficient learning methods to their learning style\n· Manage, control and navigate mind-set\n· Plan and strategize time and activities\n· Approach exams with confidence\n· Appreciate the importance of rest, reflection and rewards\n· Manage personal finance\nRequirements\n· Have a good understanding of English\n· Have the willingness to become an expert in a chosen field and a lifelong learner\n· Not look for the easy way out - efficient learning requires focus and effort\nDescription\nThe course is prepared for YOU and is aimed to help YOU build upon and improve your learning methods.\nThe course is difficult, and is demanding.\nThe reason is that for you to achieve these best practices and to be able to apply them consistently, you need to have motivation, you need to put in effort, you need to build up discipline and create habits based on these practices.\nLearning means introducing a change to our brain chemistry.\nYour neurons send signals in a certain way -> you learn something new -> your neurons send signals in a slightly different way.\nThis is not an easy or simple process, as our brain, left on its own, choses the path of least resistance and reverts to our basic survival instincts. And these are great for surviving life or death situations and preventing us from harm… BUT are not efficient for learning, improving and performing at a top level.\nYou cannot get away anymore with not being a focused and efficient lifelong learner.\nIn learning there are proven best practices and methods which you can use to be a top performer.\nThe thing is that there are many of them, while learning is personal.\nDue to this reason you need to be able to filter and pick up the ones that work best for you.\nWhat this course does is:\nIt provides a variety of working best practices and methods\nIt helps you to understand them and test them out\nIt helps you to select which of them you can do consistently and to your best effect\nIt guides you to implement them to your situation\n\n\nThe format of the course is as follows:\nThe course is separated into 6 sessions, or ‘weeks’. You can go about your own pace, but the recommended pace is a ‘week’ for each. The reason is that this gives you some time to think about the information and how can you apply it to your situation.\nPrior to each topic (or ‘week’) you set up your expectations by filling in your personal objectives, or what you are looking forward to learning in the specific section.\nAction list\nUpon completion of each section or ‘week’, you will have an action list with tasks that you need to perform in order to test the topics discussed, as well as the best practices.\nKeep in mind, learning is personal, and best learning practices apply differently to individuals.\nThe action lists will guide you to try these out, see which of them work best for you, which of them you can do consistently, and which of them you should include in your schedule!\n\n\nThe course contents are split into six weeks, or sections, as follows:\nWeek 1: Efficient and Accelerated Learning\n· Learn how the brain works and how thoughts are formed\n· Learn different methods of inputting information\n· Practice accelerated learning techniques\n· Appreciate the value of self-testing\n· Learn to train your imagination\n· Learn to apply neuroconnections theory on a daily basis\n\nWeek 2: Managing and Controlling Mindset\n· Specify your goal and how you will measure progress\n· Pin down your conditional and intrinsic motivation factors\n· Learn how to approach action\n· Learn how to not break your schedule\n· Learn top-down vs bottom up attention practices\n· Deny multitasking and understand your focus tolerance\n· Success and Failure in terms of learning\n\nWeek 3: Planning and Strategizing\n· Learn the importance of morning routines\n· Learn how to plan for more efficient studying\n· Learn how to set up your schedule and your environment\n· Learn approaches for designing notes\n· Learn how to prepare an assignment/project/written coursework\n\nWeek 4: Exam Preparation Techniques\n· How do you perceive exams?\n· Learn how to visualize your journey\n· Learn how to prepare for an exam\n· Learn how to feel comfortable on exams\n· Learn exam-taking techniques\n· What do you do after an exam?\n\nWeek 5: Rest, Rewards and Reflection\n· Appreciate the importance of rest\n· Appreciate the need for other engaging activities\n· Appreciate the need for reflection and rewards\n· Appreciate the relationship between your efforts and results\n· Learn to build objective views of events and situations\n· Set up your rewards\n\nBonus: Week 6: Managing Personal Finance\n· Have an overview of your spending habits\n· Learn to stop the spending leaks and to generate savings\n· Learn how to organize and optimize your personal finance\n· Learn options for handling student debt\n· Short-term spending vs long-term saving and what it means\nAdditional bonus materials:\nStudent’s Financial Planner\nStudent’s Personal Schedule\nGuarantees\nThe course (and his creator) do not guarantee that if you purchase the course, you will achieve your goals and your learning objectives.\nLearning is personal and difficult and the amount by which you improve your learning speed will depend on your ability to apply the best practices and techniques discussed here to your learning style with consistency.\nWhat this course guarantees is that the practices discussed here do work!\nAnd what this course guarantees is that once you go through all the materials, you will have a better understanding and knowledge of the options and tools that you have at your disposal to achieve efficient learning.\nIt is up to you to use them and apply them consistently in order to get the most value and benefits out of the course and out of your overall learning experience!\nWhat the course also guarantees is that upon completion and successful implementation of the methods to your lifestyle you will have a much higher satisfaction due to the efforts and focus you have put in learning and developing these habits.\nWho this course is for:\n\n\n· University or college students who want to complete their degree\n· Students doing a course, certification, assignment or dissertation\n· People who want to become experts in an area and lifelong learners\n\n\nConcluding remarks and setting expectations\nPlease do not limit yourself to what has been taught here!\nThis is not an exhaustive course, as learning is never exhaustive, nor limited. It is aimed to help you gain an understanding of the tools and techniques that you can use, but do not rule out any possibility or option that you think of, or come across – try it out and if it works for you, apply it and do it consistently!\nAnd one more thing that you should remember well – learning is difficult! If you feel it is easy, it means you are not learning much. All options for ‘quick and easy’ learning are misleading.\nAs discussed in the course, learning new information means you are introducing a change to your brain’s chemistry and into how your neurons communicate, which does require focus and effort.\nAnd if you are not putting focus and effort, you are introducing no change.\nHope this helps to set your expectations right…\nAnd with that, I wish you happy, interesting and engaging learning going forward!\nShare to me personally your honest opinion, and any other questions! I am looking forward to having a chat with you : )",

      "description": "The course gives SIMPLE strategies and a better understanding of how to help yourself to become a great learner.\nThis course will teach you how to hack your learning, reading, and memory skills, empowering you to learn anything and everything faster and more effectively.\nMy name is Ina Ilie and my purpose is to find the most efficient ways to learn for the exams and put our mind to work.\nWhy?\nBecause smart strategies bring better results. You could work as much, if not less, as you do now, but with more impressive results.\nI am a psychopedagogist, with a master's degree in cognitive sciences, and I teach thinking skill classes to kids, teenagers, young people, and adults.\nWhy do I focus on exams, specifically?\nBecause most of the students are learning pretty much the same and I know how it feels because, a long time ago, I did exactly that. So, they procrastinate, start learning very late, cram all the info in 3 days of studying, stay up all night before the exam, get there tired and stressed out, trying to use as much of the famous photographic memory to remember where was that info on the page. Trying to survive another exam. Some do, some don't, some remember how the page with the most wanted information looked like, some get blocked, trying the whole exam to remember one tiny thing, stressed out and tired. But you are not them, you are not like that. You are looking for smart ways to learn and good results, and I am here precisely for that.\nI have strategies for how to approach the exam itself, how to cope with the emotions, how to tackle subjects of various complexity. I am interested even in what is good to eat and to do the day of the exam to have an optimum experience.\nBut this course does much more than just help you get well through an important test. It feeds you with the best learning strategies for day to day learning, provided by years of extended research on how the human brain learns best, with not so much effort, but great efficiency. And, here and there, quite a bit of fun.\nHere are some examples of what this course can inspire you with\nThe perfect timing for your reviews, so that they are not too much, not too little, memorization techniques, how to take efficient notes, how to train your working memory to think faster and keep ideas in mind, what are mind maps and how we can use them, how to control stress, what is Zeigarnik effect and how you can put ALL of YOUR BRAIN to work for you, not just the famous 10 percent.\nSo, to sum up, 3 reasons to be next to me on this one:\n1. It feeds you the top and fresh information on the best learning skills\n2. It gives you tips and tricks for how to deal with the exam itself, tactics and emotions, and\n3. It gives you a general view on optimal sleeping, eating, exercising and thinking habits.\nAt the end of this class, you will have tools to memorize and learn more things in less time, you will know when is good to study and when you should take a break, when is the best time to review and what to do when there is too much to learn and you are overwhelmed.\nThank you again for taking interest in my course, I hope it can serve your purposes beautifully, and I am looking forward to knowing how it worked for you! This course gives you access to our online community. Once inside, you can ask me questions, get in touch with the others, share concerns and progress. I am here to help you enjoy the best learning experience possible, with 30 days money-back guarantee. Ready? I wait for you inside, all well!\nLearning strategies, Mind mapping, Memory, Neuroscience, Neuroplasticity, Pass Exam",

Em especial porque acabam vendo algumas pessoas que despontam na capacidade de aprendizagem e memorização, essas tendo enorme vantagem sobre as demais.\n\nSerá que essas pessoas possuem algo de especial, ou essa incrível habilidade pode ser desenvolvida.\nO curso Hiper-Memória & Hiper-Aprendizagem garante que é uma habilidade que pode ser desenvolvida. E ensina exatamente como.\nOs problemas e perguntas sobre aprendizagem e memorização são diversos:\nQuando devo revisar um conteúdo?\nComo transformar uma memória de curto-prazo em uma de longo-prazo?\nComo fazer minhas anotações e resumos?\nO que é a tal da mnemotécnica, utilizada pelos gregos Sócrates, Platão e Aristóteles.\nComo funciona o nosso esquecimento e como evitá-lo?\nEntender é mais importante que memorizar? Como entender um conteúdo?\nO que é a tal da técnica Zip de compressão de informações?\nE incorporação, tem relação com resumos e Mapas Mentais?\nComo armazenar minhas anotações?\n\nO conteúdo de meta-aprendizagem (aprender a aprender) é extremamente abrangente e muitas vezes até complexo. Por esses motivos, pouquíssimos indivíduos possuem acesso a esse conhecimento que é extremamente valioso.\nA Hackers do Estudo é uma escola empenhada em trazer de modo simples, objetivo e prático conceitos que muitas vezes são de difícil entendimento. Com o curso Hiper-Memória & Hiper-Aprendizagem não é diferente.  Baseando-se nos principais autores mundiais da meta-aprendizagem e memorização, o curso apresenta uma quantidade gigante de informações em uma dose ultra-concentrada. E mais, todas informações estão agrupadas didaticamente e passo a passo.\nHiper-Memória & Hiper-Aprendizagem é um curso único e raro.

Bilinçaltı kavramı, özellikle psikanaliz kuramında önemli bir yere sahiptir. Bilinçaltı, insanın bilincine giremeyen, ama davranışlarına ve duygularına etki eden düşünceler, arzular, travmatik anılar ve diğer içsel süreçleri ifade eder.\nÖrneğin, bilinçaltı düzeyde bir kişi, bilinçli olarak düşünmeden suçluluk hissi ya da fobiler gibi duygusal tepkiler verebilir. Bu tür duygusal tepkiler, bilinçaltındaki anılar, deneyimler ve kişinin öğrenmiş olduğu davranışlar tarafından şekillendirilir.\nBilinçaltı, insan davranışları, düşünceleri ve duyguları üzerinde büyük bir etkiye sahiptir. Bu nedenle, birçok psikoterapi yaklaşımı, insanların bilinçaltındaki içsel süreçleri keşfetmelerine yardımcı olmayı hedefler.\nBilinçaltı eğitimi, insanların kendilerine ve diğer insanlara daha anlayışlı bakmalarını, kaygı ve stresle başa çıkmalarını ve daha iyi bir iletişim kurmalarını sağlayabilir. Ayrıca, bu eğitim insanların kendi potansiyellerini keşfetmelerine ve hedeflerine daha kolay ulaşmalarına yardımcı olabilir.\nBilinçaltı eğitimi, birçok alanda faydalı olabilir. Örneğin, iş hayatında daha başarılı olmak, ilişkilerde daha mutlu ve sağlıklı olmak, sağlıklı yaşam tarzı seçimleri yapmak gibi birçok konuda insanların kendilerine daha iyi bakmalarına yardımcı olabilir.

      "description": "***Updated December 2021\nOverview\nMath in the 6th grade is very challenging for many parents and students. This course is designed to make math easier for sixth grade students and parents. Even the best 6th grade math teacher isn't able to connect 100% of the time with every student. Most math students need extra help every now and then to excel in class. That’s why so many families find this math course helpful.\n\n\nWho should take this class?\nParents. Do you want to help your child with math? Take this course to remember and relearn the most important topics in 6th grade math. You can even take this course with your child.\nTeachers. Are you looking for a supplement to your regular 6th grade math lessons? Do you need an activity for your advanced 5th graders? Are you looking for a way to help some of your 7th grade students catch up in math class. This course might be the solution you need. Help your students learn even when you aren't teaching, by having them complete this course.\nStudents. This course was designed to be completed by a 5th, 6th, or 7th grade math student working with minimal help from an adult. Parents can simply give this course to their children, and 99% of kids can handle it on their own. Plus, when they need extra help with the math, there is a Q&A section.\n\n\nWhy take this course?\nSchool doesn’t always provide everything you need to succeed in math class. Most children require extra math help at some point. Teachers often don't have the time to give one-on-one instruction, tutors can be extremely expensive, and parents don't have the time to teach their kids. An online course is often the perfect solution for math students. The students can work at their own pace, rewatching videos to gain a better understanding. The math homework, quizzes, and reviews help ensure understanding. A 5th grader will find an interesting math challenge, a 6th grader can stay on target, and a 7th grader, struggling with math, can catch up by learning the fundamentals.\n\n\nWhat does this course include?\nThis course is separated into 6 sections:\nRatios\nDivision\nRational numbers\nExpressions and equations\nArea, surface area, and volume\nStatistics\nEach section includes four video lessons, math vocabulary words, homework problems, 10 video review questions, and a quiz. In addition, there are two vocabulary practice tests and a final exam.\nTeachers will notice that each section corresponds to the 6th grade math common core modules.",

      "description": "Hiper-Leitura | A Máxima Performance na Habilidade Leitura\nEm certo sentido, todos percebemos que a leitura permeia praticamente todas áreas de nossas vidas. Seja nos negócios, desenvolvimento pessoal, estudos acadêmicos, concursos e vestibulares. Quem possui uma habilidade de leitura afiada encontra atalhos onde quer que esteja.\nA palavra escrita é o o pilar do conhecimento humano. A leitura é a forma de extrair esse conhecimento dos livros. Sem a leitura, ou com uma capacidade fraca dela, somos privados de todo poder e sabedoria que os livros nos oferecem.\nA pergunta que fica: O que nos é ensinado sobre essa habilidade tão valiosa?\nVia de regra, depois da alfabetização, mais nada. É uma habilidade que fica no obscurantismo, esquecida. Deixada a se desenvolver sozinha. Por fim, grande parte das pessoas acaba acreditando que saber ler é somente reconhecer alguns símbolos. E que aqueles que conseguem ler muito (e com elevada retenção) são privilegiados por um dom natural e ou pela genética.\nNesse curso, trazemos uma visão pouco explorada sobre a habilidade leitura.\n1) Existem princípios de como atingir alto rendimento na leitura (rapidez, fluidez, escolha de leituras, entendimento, reflexão e retenção).\n2) Esses princípios são pouquíssimo divulgados. Logo, são desconhecidos do público geral.\nAssim, a habilidade de leitura das pessoas fica na inércia. E todo o poder que os livros poderiam proporcionar também. É um prejuízo em cascata.\nVoltando ao nosso primeiro ponto do texto,\nSe a leitura permeia praticamente todas áreas de nossas vidas, a habilidade leitura estagnada (ou ruim) causa demora na evolução em quase todas áreas de nossas vidas.\nO curso Hiper-Leitura é a armadura completa que lhe deixará equipado com os princípios da leitura de alta performance. É uma jornada única que explora mitos sobre velocidade no ato de ler, ao mesmo tempo que oferece soluções e estratégias  de potentes resultados.\nPerguntas Respondidas no Curso Hiper-Leitura:\n- Qual é a taxa de leitura considerada alta?\n- Como priorizar e selecionar quais leituras fazer?\n- Quais velocidades de leitura são fantasiosas?\n- Como fazer o equivalente a \"prestar atenção\" na aula, só que na leitura?\n- Como aplicar a estratégia de leitura PQLP e PQRST?\n- Como fazer grifos e anotações durante a leitura (sem perder velocidade)?\n- O que é leitura fluídica e quais os benefícios de aplicá-la?\n- O que é verdade e o que é mito sobre leitura dinâmica?\n- Por qual motivo a RSVP não é uma boa ideia?\n- Como aplicar Skimming e Scanning?\n- Quais os benefícios e como adquirir o hábito da leitura?\n- Como atingir a Máxima Performance na Leitura?",

Não sabe como organizar seu projeto de estudo? Aliás, você nem fazia ideia de que para ter sucesso na sua preparação era necessário ter e seguir um planejamento?\n- Não se preocupe, nós vamos te ajudar a criar um plano claro e objetivo de estudos.\nDesmotivação - Você se assustou com a quantidade de conteúdos que precisa estudar para a prova? Acha que não vai dar conta? Pensou em desistir, antes mesmo de começar?\n- Nós sabemos como é se sentir assim, por isso preparamos algumas aulas para te ajudar com a questão da motivação para enfrentar um projeto de estudo.\nFalta de concentração - Você se distrai facilmente durante os estudos? Qualquer coisa tira a sua atenção e foco? Você até começa bem no estudo, mas em poucos minutos já nem sabe mais o que estava estudando ou lendo?\n- Esse é um dos problemas mais comuns, e por isso preparamos dezenas de dicas que você vai poder aplicar rapidamente para aumentar sua atenção e concentração nos estudos.\nBaixo rendimento - Você já começou a estudar, mas tem a sensação de que aprende pouco? Tem a impressão de que todas as outras pessoas aprendem mais e mais rápido do que você?\n- Pode ficar tranquilo, pois você vai descobrir algumas das melhores técnicas de estudo desenvolvidas e aprimoradas por psicólogos e cientistas da educação.\nO nosso objetivo é mostrar a você que é possível estudar para Concursos Públicos, Vestibulares ou outras provas,\ncom qualquer quantidade de tempo disponível;\nusando as suas capacidades mentais ao máximo;\nfazendo as escolhas certas de conteúdo;\ncom foco e atenção;\nusando as técnicas certas de estudo e de memorização;\ne aprendendo mais rápido e preparando-se de forma competitiva.\nMas aqui vai um aviso: Não espere ver truques mágicos e mirabolantes por aqui. Isso não existe. O objetivo desse curso é ajudar você a mudar sua forma de pensar sobre os estudos para preparar sua mente da maneira certa.\nAcredite, preparar sua mente para estudar é de longe muito mais importante do que aprender um monte de técnicas engraçadinhas para decorar fórmulas e regras. É claro que as técnicas têm o seu valor, mas se você não estiver preparado para tirar o maior proveito delas, vai acabar perdendo muito em seus resultados.\nNós vamos mostrar a você como usar a sua inteligência do jeito certo. O seu cérebro, assim como o seu corpo, tem configurações e funcionamento próprios. É importante que você conheça e desenvolva a sua inteligência da forma correta, para só a partir daí, conseguir extrair o máximo proveito dela.\nEntão, não perca mais tempo. Para descobrir tudo isso e muito mais, se matricule agora mesmo para aprender Como se Preparar para Provas, Concursos e Vestibulares.\nEsperamos você no curso!",

Vamos estudar alguns tipos de sonhos, mostrando uma visão criativa e fascinante dos sonhos lúcidos, proféticos, compartilhados, criativos e outros. Descobrir o conteúdo e o sentido de seu próprio sonho. Teremos roteiros para que cada pessoa identifique os elementos de sua mitologia pessoal que se manifestem oniricamente, e como tais elementos pode ser utilizados com criatividade. Os sonhos determinam o destino de vidas individuais e de culturas como um todo. Foram fundamentais para o desenvolvimento da civilização ocidental. Os símbolos são a linguagem dos sonhos. Nos sonhos, o inconsciente é revelado através de símbolos. A chave para a compreensão de um sonho é o conhecimento do símbolo.\n\"Os sonhos nos indicam onde se encontra nossa energia e para onde ela quer ir. Todo sonho é uma mensagem útil que propicia um insight sobre o sentido específico de uma situação também específica da nossa vida. Noite após noite essas mensagens se repetem, chegando a mais de cem mil no decorrer de uma vida. Se estudarmos nossos sonhos por um certo tempo, começaremos aperceber conexões significativas entre eles. Parece haver uma força diretriz que nos guia até o nosso próprio destino individual.\"( Marie-Louise von Franz)",

It's time to plan and conquer those skills that are dormant and grow them to unlock the opportunities that you deserve!\n\n\nThis is the first course of the Human 3.0 initiative, and the most comprehensive course about memory in Udemy. But this is not just a course about memory, follow along to know more.\nOther courses normally repeat common sense notions or techniques that abound in the Internet. Human 3.0 - Super Memory Course has a coherent and strutuctural approach to our phenomenal memorization capacity in a very visual and iterative way.\n\n\nWhy Human 3.0 ?\n\n\nHuman's first version was born out of a biological revolution, sharing with animals some basic traits, but having developed some exclusive capacities.\n\n\nHuman's second version awakened to a cultural revolution, where we developed language, writing, the arts, and the consciousness of thought, uncovered by the history of human genius throughout the centuries.\n\n\nWe believe Human's third version is awakening to a creative revolution, where research around grit, flow, deep work and deliberate practice prove that human full creative potential is not some trait left to chance or in possession of only a few, but it is identified and worked on as a clear and optimized path of excellence, backed by science, with very definite goals and a set of techniques where human beings are creators of inner and outer worlds, in a never ending path of growing depth, complexity and beauty.\n\n\nThe Human 3.0 initiative aims to:\n\n\n\"Shift the world consciousness by realizing human creative potential\".\n\n\nWe believe it's the creative act that drives personal growth, opening the hearts and minds to new realities of higher richness and complexity, a fulfilling plane of existence, consciousness and sensitivity that in the past was reserved to only a few.\n\n\nWe believe memory and visualization to be the fundamental basis of the human creative lab, where ideas are sculpted from raw material into new gifts of the creator to the world.\n\n\nThis course aims to provide strategies, tools and a new method that will take whatever memorization skills you think you have to a whole other level, being the perfect start into this growing path of self-discovery and realization of your true potential.\n\n\nIn this course, you'll have the chance to learn:\n\n\nWhat is Memory - a start with a brief introduction to the main memorization processes, then we do a deep dive on each one.\nMemory Types - we do a walkthrough of the known Memory Types, starting from Sensory Memory all the way until Long-term memory.\nWhy Do We Forget? - A brief incursion on the main reasons we tend to forget what we once knew.\nBasic Principles - A section where we analyze the main principles that directly impact the memorization process.\nStudy Skills - A whole chapter dedicated to optimizing study skills in order to maximize learning and retention.\nMnemonics - A fundamental section that underlines the importance of mnemonic systems, that form the basis of Fonseca Method.\nFonseca Method - A very efficient memorization method that allows you to easily memorize large lists of items in a vivid and unforgettable process.\nMemorizing a Book - In this chapter we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Fonseca Method by memorizing a whole book, divided into 265 sub-items.\nConclusion and next steps.\n\n\nAfter following this course you'll have under your belt everything you need to build a super memory, a polished mental lab where you'll be able to sculpt your dreams into reality.\n\n\nOther courses will follow under the Human 3.0 initiative, addressing key capacities like Learning and Creativity in detail.\n\n\nI invite you to take this course, because I know you want to understand how your mind works, how memory can be vastly improved, and how you can create a mental lab where you will acknowledge your inner creative potential and put it to work in your ideas and projects.\n\n\nSo you see, this course is not just about memory. It's the first to introduce the Human 3.0 horizon, come join us and make part of this journey!\n\n\nEnroll now and come aboard in this mind exploration adventure!",

These are structured ways to help you better organize and recall information by using simple tools like visualization, association, and patterns.\nRather than relying on repetition or re-reading alone, mnemonic methods provide alternative techniques that can help improve how you store and retrieve information.\nWhat Are Mnemonic Devices?\nMnemonic devices are memory aids that help you remember information by linking it to familiar ideas, images, or sounds. These techniques are used in education and training to help learners improve recall and make studying more effective.\nThey include tools such as acronyms, rhymes, visual associations, and mental maps. While they do not guarantee perfect memory, they offer useful ways to work with the brain’s natural preferences for structure and imagery.\nWhat You’ll Learn\nThis course is a basic overview of how mnemonic devices work and how to use them. Topics include:\nAn introduction to how memory works\nCommon reasons why we forget\nOverview of major mnemonic techniques\nUsing imagery and association to remember facts and concepts\nThe Method of Loci (Memory Palace) and how to apply it\nTools like acronyms, rhymes, and peg systems\nUsing mnemonics for studying vocabulary, lists, names, and more\nPractical applications for school, work, and general memory improvement\nThis course is suitable for students, professionals, and anyone interested in learning memory techniques in a structured and accessible way.",

I will keep adding videos as I unearth new ideas and get the data needed to back them.\nLearning from Online Courses is harder than you think.\nI am not saying this because I found it difficult for myself, or I saw my friends struggle. I have researched thousands of online learners' video-watching behavior across a breadth of online courses before arriving at this conclusion.\nLet's face it. We all sign up for courses even when we know there are courses that we are sitting on without completing, only reassuring ourselves that someday we will complete them.\nIf a mere completion of an online course can be difficult, how hard would it be to learn from it? And what about retaining that Learning and applying it to our lives?\nThis course explores the fundamental problems with learning online, primarily from video courses. You will see and relate to the issues we face as we try to complete online courses. Instead of just knowing the problems, we will discuss the solutions for them as well.\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to pick the right courses for yourself; you will also be able to see that you are completing them faster than ever; importantly, learn from them and retain that Learning for the rest of your life.\nUsing checklists and guidelines included in the course, you will develop your learning process. This course will surely make you a smarter learner when it comes to learning from online video courses!\nJoin me on a journey towards lifelong learning.",
