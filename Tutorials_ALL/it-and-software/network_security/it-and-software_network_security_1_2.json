      "description": "MPLS is a protocol that runs inside the ISP networks. Deploying MPLS is always a challenge because of its complexity. However, MPLS has a much better performance than any other routing protocol because it works on Labels for the routing decision and it works on layer 2.5 instead of layer 3 as other routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF and BGP.\nUsing MPLS, the ISP will be able to have a lot of benefits from feature that it provides such as Layer 3 VPN using VRF, Layer 2 VPN using VPLS, Traffic Engineering Tunnels and much more.\nIn this course, I will go through MPLS from scratch, so I am going to explain to you what MPLS is exactly and how it works, then i am going to start doing labs to cover all topics possibles in MPLS.\nTopics that I am going to cover in this course are:\nIntroduction to MPLS\nMPLS Basics, MPLS Labels and MPLS Filtering\nMPLS Layer3 VPN - VRF\nMPLS Layer 2 VPN - VPLS\nMPLS Traffic Engineering\nAll the course will be based on hands-on LABS, so by end of the course you will have a big understanding of how to deploy MPLS in your ISP using MikroTik Routers.\n\n\nTo be able to follow this course, you can use GNS3 because in some LABS we require to have up to 7 MikroTik Routers. Of course if you have those routers than you can deploy them and work on physical routers to to the LABS.\n\n\nFinally, If you have to master MPLS on MikroTik and understand how it works, I highly advise you to register in my course and get all the information that i am going to share with you.",

Why not pass the HCIA certificate? Why not expand your network knowledge with Huawei devices?\nHuawei has been developing its products for a long time and these devices can be found in practically every network in the world, starting from home networks and ending with networks of mobile operators and ISPs.\nIt is good if you know the technology of one vendor, but it will be even better if you get to know the devices of different vendors. From my professional experience, I know that if you are able to build a network, based on devices from different vendors, your price and interest in you on the job market increases dramatically.\nSo do not hesitate, invest in yourself, this course will be a good choice and perhaps the beginning of your path towards HCIE?\nMy name's Marius and I'm Huawei Certified ICT Expert in Datacom area. My professional life includes over 20 years of experience in telecomunications networks. I started my adventure with networks at Orange, and then I spent 12 years working at Huawei and building ISP networks as a Datacom Engineer. I'm currently working as a Network Architect at a Research Institute and I'm designing and implementing networks and network services based on devices of various vendors, such as Huawei, Juniper, Cisco, Fortinet, Mikrotik. I am proud to be one of the architects of the National Educational Network, a network that gives schools from all over Poland access to fast, free and safe Internet. Some of you may know me from my LABNARIO blog, where I've been trying to discuss Huawei technologies for many years.\nI am going to develop this course, adding new sections (soon), so that at the end of the day it will be a complete course to prepare for the HCIA Datacom exam.\nI look forward to seeing you on the inside!",

      "description": "A botnet is a collection of internet-connected  devices  installed with remote access tools (the RAT bots). Together they are all controlled by a server on the hacker's machine.    Remote Access Tools also known as RATs are used to remotely control another PC over the Internet or the Local Area Network.  RATs are used in network management, remote surveillance, system administration, classroom teaching systems, and so on. It is also commonly misused as a malware known as Remote Access Trojans where hackers can spy on the victims' machines, steal information and run commands remotely. In order to be able to understand how they work, we will build tools that simulate a botnet. That way you will be able to better defend and analyze such systems.\nIn this course, you will:\ncreate a client RAT bot that can be installed in multiple machines and controlled by a central command server\nbuild a command and control server that can manage multiple client RATs\nunderstand the building blocks of a botnet network architecture\n\n\nFeatures of this course:\nDesigned with beginners in mind.\nWe will study in detail, how a client RAT  bot is created\nWe start with very simple, bare-bones client RAT and command-control server\nThen, gradually add more functionality to them as the lessons progress.\nIn that way, you will be able to easily follow along in bite-sized chunks\nUse .NET framework to build the client bot RAT and\nMySQL, PHP and xampp to simulate the Command-and-Control Server\n\n\nEverything in this course is highly practical.  No boring theory or lectures. More like walk-throughs which you can replicate and follow along. By the end of this course, you will have the basic knowledge to design and build any bot client RAT and also implement a Command-and-Control server that can manage multiple client bot RATs.

Emulator software such as the routers in Cisco Packet Tracer lack many of the functions and commands needed for CCNA certification, and they lack a Lot of functions and technologies for CCNP or CCIE.\nAnd GNS3 is a cheap-quality product with a difficult user interface, and it requires a Cisco contract for access to router images. Our solution is built on a top-rated, commercial-grade hypervisor (ESXi) and free demo versions of the Cisco routing software.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn how to create a lab network using (demo) versions of the real Cisco IOS and IOS XR routing software, which contain support for all advanced routing technologies, including BGP and MPLS.\n\n\nAll you need is this course and free (or very low cost) software and equipment, like an old left-over computer and some applications.\n\n\nENROLL TODAY or try out our free sample lectures.\n\n\nIntroduction\nFREE PREVIEW: Introduction\nFREE PREVIEW: Welcome care-package\n\n\n0.

      "description": "Remote Access Tools also known as RATs are used to remotely control another PC over the Internet or the Local Area Network.  RATs are used in network management, remote surveillance, system administration, classroom teaching systems, and so on. It is also commonly misused as a malware known as Remote Access Trojans where hackers can spy on the victim's desktop, capture keystrokes and run commands remotely.\nThis course is a follow-up to the first course entitled Fundamentals of Building a Remote Access Tool (RAT1) in C# where we covered C# programming, Networking and Basic RAT development. In this course, you will learn how to:\n\n\nadd keylogging and remote desktop capture functionalities to your RAT projects\ncreate any remote command execution functions that you like\ndesign a scalable multi-tab user interface for the command and control server that allows for unlimited functionalities.\n\n\nDesktop capture, keylogging and  remote command execution are three of the most basic functionalities found in almost all RATs and that is why we need to understand how they work. What better way to learn, than to code them yourself. Learning from existing open-source RATs is frustrating because they are too complex and the authors do not have courses or tutorials to explain them to beginners.\n\n\nFeatures of this course:\nDesigned with beginners in mind.\nWe will study in detail, how desktop capture, keylogging and remote command execution works.\nWe start with very simple, bare-bones desktop and keystroke capture\nThen, gradually add more functionality to them as the lessons progress.\nIn that way, you will be able to easily follow along in bite-sized chunks\nUse .NET remoting framework for rapid application development*\n*Traditionally, RATs are written using socket programming, that makes the code very complex and error-prone. In this course, I will show you an alternative way where you do not have to write low-level code. Instead you can focus on the logic and functionality of your app.  We can achieve this using a powerful Microsoft technology called .NET remoting framework.\n\n\nEverything in this course is highly practical.  No boring theory or lectures. More like walk-throughs which you can replicate and follow along. By the end of this course, you will have the basic knowledge to design and build any RAT containing remote desktop and keystroke capture and run any remote commands that you like.  This knowledge and skills are suitable for those aspiring to be Red Teamers. Even if you have no intention of creating malware, the insider knowledge and skills you gain from this course will make you a better security professional. Also, having practical knowledge of RAT development will give you a better understanding of how to perform malware analysis on RATs.\n\n\nSuitable for:\nReverse Engineering and Malware Analysis Students\nProgrammers who want to know how Malware is created\nStudents planning on entering Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering, or Penetration Testers as a Career Path\nPenetration Testers and Ethical Hackers\n\n\nPrerequisite:\nWindows PC\nBasic programming knowledge is helpful but not mandatory\nCompleted Fundamentals of Building a Remote Access Tool (RAT) in C#",

We are going to do all these steps both via xml configurations and java configurations\nSecurity - Basics\nIn Security-Basics section of this course, we are going to explore how to implement the basic security with a default login form. Later in the section, we are going to explore authentication provider, authentication managers, and we are going to use them inside our project. We are also going to create our own customize login form then we are going to use authenticate and authorize tag inside our application to implement how to display contents based on the assigned authorities\nJava Configurations\nIn Java configurations section of this course, we are going to explore, how to configure the ServletContext programmatically instead of configuring it via web.xml. Later in the section, We are going to integrate our application with DaoAuthenticationProvider to use user names, and roles configured in database tables\nSpring boot\nIn Spring boot section of this course, we are going to migrate our application to spring boot\nSpring OAuth2\nIn Spring OAuth2 section of this course,  we are going to explore OAuth2 plus we are also going to explore how to customize application to use OAuth2 for authorization mechanism, and we are going to use Google and GitHub as the authentication provider. We are going to start off by configuring our application to use google and github as the authentication Provider’s with the default oAuth2Login form. Later we are going to customize login page for the authentication providers then we are going to explore how to use UserInfo endpoint to access the claims of the authenticated end-user plus we are also going to explore explore standard OAuth 2.0 Provider’s implementation of OAuth2UserService plus the implementation of OAuth2UserService with OpenIDConnect ,and lastly, we are going to explore how to map the authorities of the user for the provider having standard OAuth2 implementation, and Open id connect implementation",

      "description": "Hi there,\nWelcome to my \" Fortigate | FORTINET Fortigate Firewall with Lab Exercises \" course.\nFirewall is essential to Network Security. Learn Fortigate Firewall in practice, protect your network from cyber threats\n\n\nA firewall is a security system designed to prevent unauthorized access into or out of a computer network. Firewalls are often used to make sure internet users without access are not able to interface with private networks, or intranets, connected to the internet.\nA firewall is positioned between a network or a computer and a different network, like the internet. It controls the network traffic coming in and going out of the computer or network. If you do not have a firewall, virtually any data can exit your computer or network, and virtually any individual or program can come in.\n\n\nBasically, a firewall is a cybersecurity solution that protects your computer or network from unwanted traffic coming in or going out. It inspects and authenticates all data packets in network traffic before they are allowed to move to a more secure environment.\nWhether a hardware appliance or a software program that is protecting a corporate network or a personal computer, a firewall is essential to network security. For example, depending on where a firewall is installed, it may guard against insider threats in a network segment or act as a barrier against external threats at the network perimeter.\nAs your organization’s first line of defense, a firewall monitors and filters all network traffic including outgoing traffic, application-layer traffic, online transactions, communications, and connectivity. It blocks incoming threats based on a set of pre-programmed rules that also may dictate which users can access specific network areas.\nIt protects your network from unauthorized access to mitigate the risk from cyber attacks.\n\n\nIf you really want to learn Firewall Administration and have fun while learning without getting bored, you are at the right place.\nWith this course, you will learn many things about Firewalls and Firewall Administration and itself. This course offers information from the simplest level to almost advanced. When you finish this course, there will be almost nothing you haven't heard or learned about firewalls.\n\n\nDuring the course you will learn the following topics:\n\n\nWhat is Firewall?\nHow Does Firewall Work?\nFirewall Working Principle\nWhat is Blacklist / White List / Gray List?\nWhat Firewall Does Not Block?\nNetwork Segmentation Concept\nFirewall Types\nFirewall Types According to Their Structures\nHardware Firewall\nSoftware Firewall\nFirewall Types According to Their Functions\nPacket Filtering Firewall\nNAT Firewall\nProxy Firewall\nWAF Web Application Firewall\nUTM (Unified Threat Management)\nFirewall Selection\nFirewall User Guide and Documents\nNetwork Topology Creation\nInstallation Files and Setup\nBasic Firewall Settings\nFirewall Interface\nDashboard\nSecurity Fabric\nFortiview\nNetwork\nSystem\nPolicy & Objects\nSecurity Profiles\nVPN\nFirewall Sample Applications\nTraffic Shaping\nPort Forwarding\nWeb Filter\nApplication Control\nIntrusion Prevention System (IPS)\n\n\n\n\nWith my up-to-date course, you will also have the chance to keep yourself updated and have fun while learning the firewall. I am also happy to say that I will always be available to support your learning and answer your questions.\n\n\nWhat Is a Firewall?\nA firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network. It allows or blocks traffic based on a defined set of security rules.\n\n\nWhat does a firewall do?\nBasically, a firewall is a cybersecurity solution that protects your computer or network from unwanted traffic coming in or going out. It inspects and authenticates all data packets in network traffic before they are allowed to move to a more secure environment.\n\n\nWhy Do You Need a Firewall?\nThere are many reasons why you need a firewall but in general, without firewalls, computers and devices in your network are easy targets for cyber attacks.\nFirewalls protect your network from unauthorized access by hackers who use a variety of tools to gain entry such as viruses, backdoors, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, macros, remote logins, phishing emails, social engineering, and spam. You not only need a firewall to block unauthorized access to your network, but also to block your users from visiting inappropriate websites and downloading malware.\nYou also need a firewall to identify the signatures of dangerous users, known bad actors, and risky applications especially when securing a vulnerable, private network. A firewall can block outflowing data when it notices a social engineering attack to mitigate the damage. When you need to block specific content in application-layer attacks, such as malware, use your firewall. You need a firewall to help you detect and deter rogue activity throughout your network.\nFirewalls can also manage network resources so you can control how much network bandwidth is available for specific data types. In addition, you might need a firewall to provide virtual private network (VPN) services that use data encryption to secure communications across the public internet.\nBy securing the border between your network and the internet, or between segments of your network and the rest of your environment, firewalls provide essential protection from internal and external threats.\n\n\nWhat are the Uses of a Firewall in Networking?\nThe primary use of a firewall in networking is to secure the network from cyberattacks. For example, a firewall prevents malicious and unwanted content from entering your environment. As well, a firewall protects vulnerable systems and private data in the network from unauthorized access–such as hackers or insiders. Protecting your business transitions, operational, and confidential data from ransomware attacks and leaks is a critical use of a firewall.\nIn educational institutions, for example, network firewalls can be used to limit access to specific websites and content deemed inappropriate or unsafe for a particular organization’s users–such as K - 12 and higher. And in business, a firewall can keep users from being distracted by online advertising, gaming, fraudulent websites that host malware, or certain social media platforms when using the company’s network.\nProtecting the seamless operations of a distributed enterprise is a critical use of firewalls in networking. With a remote and often global workforce accessing corporate networks, applications, and data–in multiple data centers around the world–firewalls are imperative to ensure security across all systems.\nFirewalls also safeguard supply chain networks to ensure confidentiality and coordination of goods, services, pricing, and production to secure the value for manufacturer, distributor, seller, and consumer. Whether a firewall takes the form of hardware, software, or web application in the cloud–the use of a firewall is essential to secure networking.\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of a firewall in a computer network?\nBy securing the border between your network and the internet, or between segments of your network and the rest of your environment, firewalls provide essential protection from internal and external threats. Firewalls do this by filtering data in network traffic to protect the network from a wide variety of malicious attacks and malware. Without firewalls to block cyber threats and prevent unauthorized access, computers and devices in your network are susceptible to attack.\n\n\nHow does a firewall protect a network?\nFirewalls block incoming threats based on a set of pre-programmed rules that also can dictate which users can access specific network areas. As part of your first line of defense against cyberattacks, firewalls offer essential monitoring and filtering of all network traffic to ensure only safe content passes to your secure environment. This includes outgoing traffic, application-layer traffic, online transactions, communications and connectivity, and dynamic workflows.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching.\nWhen you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise.\n\n\nVideo and Audio Production Quality\nAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you the best learning experience.\n\n\nYou will be,\nSeeing clearly\nHearing clearly\nMoving through the course without distractions\n\n\nYou'll also get:\nLifetime Access to The Course\nFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A section\nUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download\nDive in now!\nWe offer full support, answering any questions.\n\n\nNow dive into the \" Fortigate | FORTINET Fortigate Firewall with Lab Exercises \" course.\nFirewall is essential to Network Security.

Using Kali Linux, VirtualBox, and industry-standard hacking tools, you'll gain hands-on experience with network attacks, Wi-Fi hacking, web penetration testing, SQL injection, and post-exploitation techniques.\nWe begin by setting up a hacking lab, installing Kali Linux, Metasploitable, and Windows, and learning essential Linux commands. You'll then explore network penetration testing, including MAC address spoofing, deauthentication attacks, and packet sniffing. In the wireless hacking section, you'll discover how hackers crack WPA/WPA2 encryption, capture handshakes, and use wordlist attacks to gain access. You’ll also master MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks, ARP spoofing, and advanced techniques using Bettercap and Wireshark.\nAs you progress, you’ll move into website penetration testing, where you’ll exploit file inclusion vulnerabilities, SQL injection flaws, and command execution weaknesses. The course also covers MySQL database manipulation, SQLMap automation, and hacking user credentials. In the final sections, you'll explore post-exploitation tactics, creating backdoors, keyloggers, and remote access Trojans (RATs), along with social engineering techniques used by attackers.\nBy the end of this course, you'll have a strong foundation in ethical hacking and the confidence to conduct penetration tests or secure systems professionally. Whether you're an aspiring cybersecurity expert, IT professional, or developer, this course will equip you with real-world hacking techniques while ensuring you understand how to defend against cyber threats.\nDisclaimer: This course is for educational purposes only. All hacking techniques are taught with the intent of strengthening security and must be used ethically and legally.",

      "description": "Assembly language programming for hackers is a specialized skill set that combines the knowledge of computer architecture and low-level programming with the creativity and resourcefulness of a hacker. Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is used to write software that interacts directly with a computer's hardware. It is a powerful tool for hackers who need to perform intricate and precise operations on a system, especially when higher-level languages are not sufficient or efficient enough.\nHackers who specialize in assembly language programming are often able to perform tasks that are impossible or extremely difficult with other programming languages. For example, they can write code that directly manipulates a system's memory or registers, which can be critical for certain types of hacks such as exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Assembly language programming can also be used for reverse engineering, where hackers analyze and understand the inner workings of a system by examining its assembly code.\nHowever, assembly language programming requires a deep understanding of computer architecture and low-level programming concepts. Hackers who specialize in this area must be familiar with the instruction set of the specific computer or processor they are targeting, as well as be able to write code that is optimized for performance and efficiency. Despite its complexity, assembly language programming remains an essential skill for hackers who want to push the boundaries of what is possible with computers and systems.",

      "description": "Vulnerability assessments define, identify, classify, and prioritize flaws and vulnerabilities in applications, devices, and networks that can expose organizations, their products, services, code, and applications, to attack.\nSecurity vulnerabilities allow malicious actors to exploit an organization’s applications and systems, so it is essential to identify and respond to them before attackers can exploit them. Comprehensive vulnerability assessments, combined with a risk management strategy, are a critical part of an organization’s security management.\nA vulnerability assessment provides vital insight to understand the risks to an organization’s computing environment. The organization can then respond to vulnerabilities based on their priority level.\nAn effective assessment process involves determining the risk that different vulnerabilities pose to an organization. Typically, this process involves using automated tools such as security scanners. Vulnerability assessment reports should record the results produced by these testing and scanning tools.\nIn this Vulnerability Assessment course, the following tools were used:\nRapid7 InsightAppSec\nRapid7 InsightVM\nAcunetix Scanner\nVulnerability assessment processes typically include the following phases:\nTesting. Vulnerability testing requires a comprehensive list of known vulnerabilities. The security team examines server, application, and system security to identify whether any vulnerabilities are present and checks that they don’t expose your codebase, your system, and your organization to new risks.\nAnalysis. Security analysts identify the source of each vulnerability by scanning the organization’s system components to detect the creation of anomalies or flaws within the codebase.\nRisk assessment. This involves prioritizing vulnerabilities. You determine the risk level of each vulnerability according to how it could or does impact your system, your data, and business functions. There are many vulnerabilities that have little or no impact, while others are potentially very damaging. It’s important to assess which represent the largest and most serious threats so that you can prioritize their remediation rather than wasting time on low- or no-threat flaws.\nRemediation. Remediating high-priority vulnerabilities involves fixing the most important potential security faults. Development, operations, and security teams collaborate to determine how they can mitigate threats and remediate vulnerabilities. This phase involves updating configurations and operations to implement vulnerability patches.",

For example, when taking work devices like PCs out of the office and working in a public place, it’s important to be mindful of the risk that someone might be peeking or eavesdropping. In addition, there are new techniques used for cyberattacks targeting our mental blind spots.\nThe Information Security Course is a teaching aid which uses familiar examples likely to occur during work to explain concepts so that they are easy to understand even for beginners.\nFurthermore, we will provide examples and clear explanations of the latest approaches for cyberattacks, which have been growing rapidly in recent years, including APT attacks, ransomware, and zero-day attacks, supply chain attacks, BEC (business email compromise), back door attacks, smishing (SMS phishing) and password list attacks.\nThis course also covers work from home security. Compared to an office where security is guaranteed, the risks are much higher when working from home. Each employee should understand the risks, and take countermeasures.\nTry to remember these approaches, and improve your security literacy.\nThe revised version has been updated to reflect up-to-date security information and workplace conditions!",

If so, you would know that many web development projects these days require the ability to establish a persistent connection between a client and a server without having to keep sending repeated requests from the client. As you may also know, such functionality may be hard to implement.\nHowever, if you can build your web application in ASP.NET Core, there is a way to make this whole process easy. There is a library called SignalR. This is what I'm going to talk about in this course. As well as doing all the heavy lifting for you, the library abstracts away all complex implementation details, so your code can be made extremely simple.\nHowever, as you would already know, nothing in programming is simple in absolute terms. Programming is a complex activity, so even those concepts that are relatively simple require some practice and studying.\nThis is why I've created this course. By the end of it, you should be able to build a web application that clients will be able to establish a persistent connection with and exchange the data with in real time.",

      "description": "Welcome to this most exciting course on Ethical Hacking: Learn The Art of Hacking Using Python3. Hacking is not always a rewarding activity but it is one of the most fun profession where you can use your knowledge to make yours and others system secured.\n\n\nThis course will try to turn you into a person who can check for the vulnerability in the system and make your own payload to pen-test that system and evaluate proper security measures that needs to be adopted. We'll try to make payloads and test systems from section one, Thus this course is highly practical. We (Bit4Stack Tech Inc.) assumes that you have no prior knowledge in these topics, So we will provide some theory related to networking at the beginning and hands on examples with it.\nWe will cover three modules in this course. Every module will have rich contents related to Hacking. Firstly, we start by creating Backdoor which will provide access to entire file system of victim computer. Then, we use same backdoor to upload the Ransomware that we create from scratch. We will also learn how to bind our payload with other files along with spoofing the file extension.\nThings you will learn at this Course:\n1. Python subprocess module: How to execute commands in the shell (like upload, download files, Lock Computer)\n2. Socket programming: How to make two computer system communicate with each other.\n3. Cryptography: Use concept of encryption and decryption to create CryptoLocker ransomware\n4. Payload Delivery: How to make virus/malware that we create less suspicious and deliver to Victim's computer\nDISCLAIMER:\nAll tutorials and videos have been made using our own routers, servers, websites and other resources, they do not contain any illegal activity. We do not promote, encourage, support or excite any illegal activity or hacking without written permission in general. We want to raise security awareness and inform our readers on how to prevent themselves from being a victim of hackers. If you plan to use the information for illegal purposes, we highly condemn it. We cannot be held responsible for any misuse of the given information.",

      "description": "Windows shortcut (LNK) files are a type of file that contain a reference to another file or program on a computer. They are commonly used to create shortcuts to frequently used programs or files on the desktop or in the Start menu.\nCyber attackers and advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have been known to abuse LNK files as a means of gaining initial access to a system and spreading ransomware. One common technique is to send a malicious LNK file as an attachment in a phishing email. When the recipient clicks on the LNK file, it can execute a malicious script or program that installs the ransomware on the victim's computer.\nAnother technique that cyber attackers have been known to use is to place a malicious LNK file on a network share or removable drive and trick the victim into clicking on it. This can allow the ransomware to spread to other computers on the network or to any computer that the removable drive is connected to.\nIn addition to using LNK files to spread ransomware, cyber attackers may also use them to gain initial access to a system by exploiting vulnerabilities in the way that Windows processes LNK files. For example, they may create a LNK file that contains a malicious payload that is executed when the LNK file is opened, allowing the attacker to gain access to the victim's system.\nIn this course you will learn how to exploit a Windows 10 64-bit system using the modern techniques of creating windows shortcut (lnk file). You will also learn how to use the meterpreter shell, how to abuse windows shortcut to gain reverse shell and bypassing all the antivirus listed on virus total and much more.",

Sure a iphone cost you $1000 behind but what about the data inside, well you have backup that is great, but are you concern on your secret that the person that take hold of your iphone. if they just do a reset and sold it off for a profit, you are consider lucky\nBut if it fall into a hacker hand, he decided to do a forensic before selling off, all your sensitive information has no protection\nLearn how to stay anonymous, learn how the digital forensic work, learn how to encrypt your data. Sure it might have a addition step when you use a device, but for a piece of mind, it might be worth many times if you just lost your device or your house get broken into with all the harddisk unencrypted, this is the worse. A forensic is not even needed if you have a unencrypted harddisk. And the windows logon is not a security at all, if you think that is, you better start thinking again.\nThink again and Enroll in this course to protect your activities and stay Annoymous",

The name comes from the idea that a shell is an interface to a system. Hackers use web shells to gain access to systems remotely, perform tasks on their targets, and escape detection.\nAfter uploading the web shell, ethical hackers must launch their payload and wait for the system’s user to interact with their website. The user will perform remote commands that are run through their infected system’s web browser. That means that the hacker can then run commands on the target server, just by using the upload form.\nIn this course, you will learn how to hack servers through upload forms. You will be able to run commands on the target server, without even knowing the password of the server. From there, you can further compromise the system like get root access on the server. So this course is all about the initial access.\nThis is a beginners course, you need only basic prior knowledge like how to use Linux and have Kali Linux at hands.

      "description": "|| UNOFFICIAL COURSE ||\nThis comprehensive course offers a complete walkthrough of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), designed to help learners understand and apply every stage of the RMF lifecycle—from preparation to continuous monitoring. Whether you're a cybersecurity professional, compliance analyst, system owner, or someone seeking to work with federal information systems, this course will equip you with the knowledge to navigate complex federal security requirements confidently.\nNIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a structured process developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations manage cybersecurity and privacy risks for information systems. It provides a repeatable, flexible, and comprehensive approach for integrating security and risk management into the system development lifecycle.\nYou’ll start by learning the foundational concepts behind RMF, its importance in supporting information security and FISMA compliance, and how it integrates with related standards such as NIST SP 800-53, 800-30, and 800-60. The course then guides you through each of the seven steps in the RMF process, including categorization of information systems, selecting and tailoring security controls, implementing those controls, assessing them for effectiveness, authorizing systems to operate, and continuously monitoring them to maintain a strong security posture.\nWe also explore the organizational and system-level responsibilities introduced in RMF 2.0, discuss key roles like the Authorizing Official, Information System Owner, and Security Control Assessor, and explain how all stakeholders interact across the RMF lifecycle. Beyond traditional systems, the course covers RMF's application in modern environments such as cloud services and DevSecOps pipelines, including how RMF supports FedRAMP and continuous authorization practices.\nThrough clear explanations and real-world context, this course is designed to demystify the RMF and help you build a solid foundation for implementing it within your organization. You’ll gain a deep understanding of how to manage risk, protect systems, and maintain compliance in alignment with federal cybersecurity mandates.\nBy the end of this course, you will not only understand the theory behind each RMF step but also how to apply the framework effectively in practical, organizational, and cloud-based settings.\nNIST RMF is a foundational framework that ensures systems are secure by design, operated within acceptable risk levels, and continuously maintained to meet evolving threats and compliance needs.\nWhether you are preparing for a role in federal cybersecurity or aiming to enhance your organization’s risk management maturity, this course will provide the tools and insights you need to succeed.\nThank you",

      "description": "Cyber security is the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, computers, and data from attack, damage, and unauthorized access. Cyber security training teaches professionals to spot vulnerabilities, fend off attacks, and immediately respond to emergencies.\n\nWe depend on technology heavily, which also translates to a rise in online hackers. The bigger the corporation is, the higher the risk of cyber attacks. This is when cyber security comes into the picture.\nWhat is cyber security: Cyber security is the condition of being guarded against criminal and illegal activities that comprise of activities related to computer, information technology, and virtual reality. It also means the measures taken to acquire this condition. One must know the risks, threats, and consequences of cyber attacks.\n- Who are the attackers: The attacker could be an external source like a hacker who gets into the system and steals files. The imposter could even be someone from the company itself, like an employee who has an access to confidential information.\n- How are the attacks carried out: The attackers through viruses or botnets invade systems. It is even done by using a USB drive or clicking on an unknown link.\n- When is the attack carried out: Cyber attacks mostly occur when your systems or the internal staff are vulnerable. There is no specific vulnerability and the attack can occur at any time.\n- Which area is hit: Cyberspace is a limitless stretch so the attack can occur in any area.\n- Why do these attacks occur: The external agents strike to leak or held captive crucial company data for earning ransom. And the internal sources like the employees do it for competitors in exchange for money. Some even do it as a revenge due to past unpleasant experiences.\n- How to tackle cyber attacks: There are three ways of securing your website:\n1) SSL Certificate: This certificate validates your website's identity and encrypts the information visitors send or receive from your site.\n2) CodeGuard: It is a service that does an automatic backup of your website.\n3) SiteLock: It scans your website for any threat and when it is detected, it works effectively to repair it. Also, you would be instantly notified about any attack.\nIt is protecting CIA:\nConfidentiality\nIntegrity\nAvailability\nThis is typically done using a risk based approach where the risk is the expected impact of a breach combined with the likelihood that a breach will occur. The likelihood is given by the combination of a vulnerability and an attacker (or threat).\nCybersecurity protects individuals and organizations from cyberattacks. Here are some solutions, including both technical and human components:\nReal-time Intelligence: Real-time intelligence is a powerful tool for preventing and containing cyber attacks. The longer it takes to identify a hack, the more costly its consequences. With just 60 seconds’ notification of a compromise, resulting costs could be reduced by 40%.\nComplementary Actions:\nEnacting a multi-layered defense strategy. Ensure that it covers your entire enterprise, all endpoints, mobile devices, applications, and data.\nThird-party assessments. Implement a “least privilege” policy regarding who and what others can access. Make it a habit to review the use of credentials with third parties. You could even take it a step further with a service level agreement (SLA).\nContinuously backing-up data. This can help to safeguard against ransomware, which freezes computer files until the victim meets the monetary demands.\nPatching frequently. A software patch is a code update in existing software. It can fix a bug, address new security vulnerability, address software stability issues, or install new drivers.\nWhitelisting software applications. Application whitelisting would prevent computers from installing non-approved software. This allows administrators to have much more control.\nCyber-insurance scope varies across providers, but typically protects against security breaches and losses. Insurers typically limit their capacity to between $5 million and $100 million per client. The overall cyber-insurance market is estimated to be $20 billion by 2025, up from $3.25 billion today.\nHuman/Cultural Components:\nFor many CEOs and CFOs, hacking can be frustrating because they don’t understand the enemy. A Deloitte white paper suggests creating a dedicated cyber threat management team. It is also recommended that organizations designate a chief information security officer (CISO). For example, neither JPMorgan nor Target had CISOs when they were breached in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nBack to basics: Employee training. Data breaches are often the result of humans’ psychological weaknesses. It’s critical to educate your employees about the warning signs of security breaches, safe practices, and how to respond to a suspected takeover.\nWhat will you learn in this course?\n\n1.

This is a vast and overarching term that describes hardware and software solutions as well as processes or rules and configurations relating to network use, accessibility, and overall threat protection.\nNetwork Security involves access control, virus and antivirus software, application security, network analytics, types of network-related security (endpoint, web, wireless), firewalls, VPN encryption and more.\nIf the topic is cybersecurity, it is hard to start where. This is because of its multi-discipline structure. With this course, you can have a fresh start in network security with hands-on labs. This gives you the advantage of learning both technical and theoretical aspects of the field. You will have a chance to implement your knowledge about these topics during hand LABs. Our LABs are designed to learn the basics of technologies and processes. Thus, at the end of the course, you will have learned how to use or implement fundamental network-security technologies and processes. The theoretical topics include modern approaches.\nDo not worry about technical LABs like IDS technologies, Honeypods, and VPNs. They are designed simply. Before starting the LAB needed theoretical information is given in previous lessons. After finishing the LABs you will have gained needed hands-on practices for Blue Teams.\n\n\nOur course's motto was chosen from the enlightenment era.\n\"Sapere Aude\"  (is the Latin phrase meaning \"Dare to know\")\nEmanuel Kant.",

      "description": "Do you have the crucial job of protecting your private and company systems from malicious attacks and undefined application behavior? Are you looking to secure your Linux systems with improved access controls? Look no further, intrepid administrator! This course will show you how to enhance your system's secure state across Linux distributions, helping you keep application vulnerabilities at bay. This video course covers the core SELinux concepts and shows you how to leverage SELinux to improve the protection measures of a Linux system. You will learn the SELinux fundamentals and all of SELinux's configuration handles including conditional policies, constraints, policy types, and audit capabilities. These topics are paired with genuine examples of situations and issues you will probably come across as an administrator.\nAbout The Author\nSven Vermeulen is a long-term contributor to various free software projects and the author of various online guides and resources. He got his first taste of free software in 1997 and never looked back. In 2003, he joined the ranks of the Gentoo Linux project as a\ndocumentation developer and has since worked in several roles, including Gentoo Foundation trustee, council member, project lead for various documentation initiatives, and (his current role) project lead for Gentoo Hardened SELinux integration and the system integrity project.\nDuring this time, Sven gained expertise in several technologies, ranging from OS-level knowledge to application servers. He used his interest in security to guide his projects further in the areas of security guides using SCAP languages, mandatory access controls through SELinux, authentication with PAM, (application) firewalling, and more.\nWithin SELinux, Sven contributed several policies to the Reference Policy project, and he is an active participant in policy development and user space development projects.\nIn his daily job, Sven is an IT architect in a European financial institution as well as a self-employed solution engineer and consultant. The secure implementation of infrastructures (and the surrounding architectural integration) is, of course, an important part of this. Prior to this, he graduated with an MSc in computer engineering from Ghent University and MSc in ICT enterprise architecture, and he worked as a web application infrastructure engineer.\nSven is the main author of the Gentoo Handbook, which covers the installation and configuration of Gentoo Linux on several architectures. He also authored the Linux Sea online publication (a basic introduction to Linux for novice system administrators) and SELinux System Administration and SELinux Cookbook for Packt Publishing.",

Or an attack that already have taken place.\nThis course explains the basics of web servers and how the logging is done on the web servers default logging locations. We also explain about the structure of logs & default logging locations for the widely used web servers - Apache, Nginx & Microsoft IIS. Authentication servers like SSH & FTP as these too often come under bruteforce attack.\n\n\nCourse teaching methodology\nWe focus on both theoretical & practical aspects of log analysis. So we work in both the ways - as an attacker who would try to attack the application / SSH / FTP services & a defender, who will analyse the logs using multiple tools and visualise how the logs of an application under attack can look like.\nWe setup a test environment with a victim machine and an attacker machine and generate both normal and malicious traffic and then use the generated logs to investigate the common attack pattern and learn the typicality of an attack and educate ourselves on how the attacks look in the logs and appreciate how logs store valuable information which is often overlooked.\nThis will ensure that learners will get hands-on experience on the concept of log analysis and utilise this basic skillset in their day-to-day security or administrative tasks & activities.\nWe also discuss about the best practices from multiple standard sources that can be implemented to ensure that the logging is done at an optimum level and stay vigilant.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will gain a foundational understanding on:\nGrasp the basics of logging concepts, its importance and standard log formats & log storage location for web servers like Apache, Nginx & Microsoft IIS. Authentication services like SSH & FTP.\nIdentify the Malicious traffic that gets logged and ascertain if the application / service is under active attack or has been attacked and learn about the potential point of attack.\nGain a broad insight on best logging practices as per the OWASP guidelines and develop an understanding on ways in which you can implement a robust logging for your IT assets.\nGain an overall thought process for analysing any of the logs of system and troubleshoot and pinpoint an issue.",

      "description": "Enhance your career with a course in IaaS Cloud Computing With OpenStack MasterClass - Part 1\nOpenStack began in 2010 as a joint project of RackSpace Hosting and NASA. More than 500 companies have joined the project since.\nOpenStack is an open source software for building private and public clouds. This is a cloud operating system that controls a large pool of compute, storage and networking resources throughout a data center.\nOpenStack boosts business agility, availability, and efficiency by providing a platform with on-demand, resource pooling, self-service, highly elastic, and measured services capabilities. OpenStack has certain capabilities, like Self-service life cycle management, for example, the run, reboot, suspend, resize and terminate instances. We don’t need manual introduction to perform all these tasks. It will automatically do it using the different OpenStack services.\nNow, why would you want to do that? Can’t you just subscribe with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Salesforce, Google or some other cloud services provider? You certainly can. However, if you are not comfortable entrusting sensitive data to a third party and you have tons of it, then an on-premise or private cloud infrastructure would be the better choice. By building your own cloud in your own data center, you will have more control of your data. OpenStack enables you to do just that.\nLet me take you through the basics which we will be covering in the course-\nFirstly, you will be introduced to OpenStack Series-I and few of its components or services as we call it here.\nNext, you will deep-dive into each of the components. You will learn their basic architecture.\nYou will learn how to install and configure these components with informative demonstrations. They will be explained in simple, easy language.\nAssessment quizzes at the end of each module will help you test your knowledge of the module.\nPrerequisites for the course.\nBefore you start the course, you need to have a good understanding of the following –\nBasic understanding of what virtualization is and how it helps a cloud owner ,to start with\nBasic knowledge of programming languages, such as Python, YAML, Bash etc.\nWorking knowledge of Microsoft Visual Studio Code.\nBasic networking experience and full understanding of the OSI model.\nWho will benefit from this course?\nThe New Stack and the Linux Foundation ranked OpenStack as the most popular open source project. This course will benefit you if you are a software engineer or system administrator interested in planning, deploying and even operating the company’s production and development clouds. This course will help you gain relevance in the industry of software development and deployment. The good news is that as of October 2017, LinkedIn listed almost 6,000 jobs, Indeed 2,500 jobs and Glassdoor 2,600 jobs with OpenStack as a title or a requirement. Learning OpenStack will definitely scale up your business profitability!\nGrab your copy of the OpenStack Course, today!\nHappy Learning!",

Cyber attackers use numerous software and codes in cyberspace to commit cybercrime. They exploit the weaknesses in the software and hardware design through the use of malware. Hacking is a common way of piercing the defenses of protected computer systems and interfering with their functioning. Identity theft is also common. Cybercrimes may occur directly i.e, targeting the computers directly by spreading computer viruses. Other forms include DoS attack. It is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. It suspends services of a host connected to the internet which may be temporary or permanent.\nMalware is a software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. It usually appears in the form of code, scripts, active content, and other software. ‘Malware’ refers to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, for example, Trojan Horses, rootkits, worms, adware, etc.",

It requires the coordinated oversight of a leadership group, which usually includes representatives from teams such as the executive board, IT, legal, communications and HR.\nThe following are some responsibilities an incident management group typically handles:\nproactively preparing incident management plans before an incident occurs;\noverseeing technical response efforts during an active incident;\ncalling on third-party help as required;\ndeciding when and how to communicate incident details and the organization's response with staff, clients, regulators and the media; and\nfollowing up after the incident's resolution to evaluate how it should inform future incident management strategies.\n\n\nWhat is incident response?\nIn its strictest definition, incident response is the technical part of the overarching incident management process. Imagine an organization is the victim of a ransomware attack. The incident response would include the following activities:\nInitial identification of the incident, perhaps through a SIEM or security orchestration, automation and response tool;\nAn alert from a staff member or a third-party security operations center;\nContainment of the ransomware, if the identification was sufficiently timely;\nAttempts to eradicate the infection from the network; and\nData restoration from backups.\nThe typical incident response team is made up mostly of internal security and IT professionals, perhaps with support from third-party security providers.\n\n\nDifferences between incident management and incident response\nIncident response is tactical and focused, while incident management is strategic and broad.\nBecause incident response is essentially a subset of incident management, one can't succeed without the other. The overarching incident management strategy heavily influences technical incident response processes. And, incident response directly affects how likely the business is to lose sensitive data to theft or encryption, making it a critical part of incident management.\nIncident response has significant immediate effects, as it determines how quickly and effectively an organization can recover from an attack or other security incident.\nIncident management tends to have greater long-term business effects, as it encompasses communication with key stakeholders. If an organization does not have an effective incident management strategy for dealing with an attack, then it is far more likely to gain negative attention from staff, clients, the media, regulators and the general public -- causing long-term reputational damage to the brand. For this reason, having an incident response plan that includes incident management details is key.\nIt is also imperative to rehearse incident management and incident response processes using realistic tabletop exercise scenarios. It's surprising how often organizations believe their response plans to be effective, until testing reveals simple mistakes -- such as storing the response plan on the same network hackers have encrypted, making it inaccessible.\n\nWhat are the top 3 challenges with incident response?\n\n\nThe sheer volume of attacks.\nBudget and knowledge constraints.\nLack of escalation and collaboration tools.\n\n\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of teaching\nOAK Academy, based in London, is an online education company that offers courses in IT, Software, Design, and Development in Turkish, English, and Portuguese.

BGP is classified as a path-vector routing protocol, and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator.\n\n\nBGP used for routing within an autonomous system is called Interior Border Gateway Protocol, Internal BGP (iBGP). In contrast, the Internet application of the protocol is called Exterior Border Gateway Protocol, External BGP (eBGP).\n\n\nMPLS VPN is a family of methods for using multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) to create virtual private networks (VPNs). MPLS VPN is a flexible method to transport and route several types of network traffic using an MPLS backbone.\nMultiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) is required in the cloud to utilize the service, which increases the complexity of design and implementation. L3 VPNs are typically not deployed on utility networks due to their complexity; however, an L3 VPN could be used to route traffic between corporate or datacenter locations.\nL3TPv3 are also used to connect a back to back customer like a serial link connected between Customers.",

It does not contain engaging labs or tasks, but only demonstrations. The content is heavily condensed and it will take significantly more than 3 hours to absorb it. You will need a high level of motivation to be able to complete the course and digest the information so that it can be applied practically. At the end of each section, there is a review with multiple-choice questions and explanations. Download and use the course transcript instead of taking notes and follow the references for digging deeper in topics of interest.\n\n\nThe course will introduce you to Microsoft implementation of Kerberos authentication protocol and its benefits, terminology, concepts, and service infrastructure. It will then explain how Kerberos works through detail and step-by-step examination of the ticketing system and communication messages in various configurations using flow diagrams and network traffic analyzer to get better understanding of the processes. Understanding how Kerberos works will help you with troubleshooting complex problems and reduce stress.\n\n\nWe will walk through the configuration of the most common Microsoft applications such as IIS, SQL, Exchange, and file servers, including multi-hop setups and mid-tier service integration, discuss impersonation, review delegation options, and see why some of these options are not so secure. We will also learn how to Kerberize non-Windows services so they can benefit from Kerberos security and convenience of SSO.\n\n\nThen we will dive into troubleshooting issues, go through a checklist so we don’t miss most common misconfigurations and we will look into specific troubleshooting examples. We will also examine Kerberos vulnerabilities and the most common attacks, such as Kerberoasting and Golden and Silver Tickets and talk about how to prevent and detect compromise. Finally, we will look into relevant monitoring and alerting options and learn how to use these for detecting malicious activity.",

Each day, you’re inundated with alerts about potential security breaches, phishing attempts, and malware. The sheer volume is overwhelming, and traditional methods are proving insufficient. The question looms large: “How can I efficiently protect my organization against these evolving cyber threats?” Enter AI and cybersecurity.\nIn this course, you’ll follow the story of Julia, a CISO who faced this exact challenge. Her organization was a prime target for cybercriminals due to its vast amount of sensitive data. Despite having a robust security team, they struggled to keep up with the sophisticated attacks. Julia knew there had to be a better way, and that’s when she discovered the transformative power of AI.\nThe journey begins with an exploration of AI’s role in cybersecurity. You’ll learn about the fundamental principles of AI and how these can be applied to detect and mitigate threats in real-time. The course covers the limitations of AI, ensuring you have a balanced view of its capabilities and potential pitfalls.\nNext, we dive into the technical aspects, starting with text embeddings and vectors. These powerful tools enable AI systems to understand and process language, a crucial aspect in identifying phishing emails, spam, and other text-based threats. You’ll gain hands-on experience in implementing these techniques, turning theoretical knowledge into practical skills.\nJulia’s story continues as she integrates AI into her security infrastructure. You’ll learn alongside her as she navigates the challenges of setting up and configuring AI tools. This section covers everything from environment setup to data preparation, giving you a comprehensive understanding of the technical requirements and best practices.\nThe real magic happens when we move to advanced AI techniques. You’ll explore how to create featurized representations and 3D models, which allow for more sophisticated analysis and detection of threats. These methods provide a deeper insight into the data, enabling more accurate predictions and faster responses.\nOne of the highlights of the course is the development of interactive dashboards. Just as Julia did, you’ll learn to create visualizations that bring your data to life, making it easier to identify patterns and anomalies. This skill is invaluable in communicating complex information to stakeholders and making informed decisions quickly.\nThroughout the course, you’ll work on real-world projects that mirror the challenges faced by cybersecurity professionals. These projects are designed to reinforce your learning and build confidence in applying AI to your own security challenges.\nBy the end of the course, like Julia, you’ll be equipped with a powerful toolkit to defend against cyber threats.

      "description": "i always wanted a course, a book or something which starts from scratch and brings me to an expert level. i saw and read a lot of courses which teach you the applications and software about security and hacking, learning those in security industry, is like knowing wordpress to design websites without understanding programming languages. so i started this course from scratch, from nothing.  because as einstein put it: \"if you can't explain something simply then you don't understand it well enough\".  in security the difference between experts and amateurs is just in the same statement. those who know the background science are those who DESIGN the metasploit and other softwares, and those who don't are the users of the programs. which one do you want to be?\nif the answer is the first group, this the right place for you. we really start from nothing, introduce you the concept of data, that what do we mean by data, bits and bytes? we then introduce the basic element of all the digital devices: TRANSISTOR.\nthen we use that transistor to create the logic gates, nand and not gates. but we only create them if we need them, so before creating anything, we ask the question of \"why do i need this?\" . then we start to give a general overview of what a computer is, why we need it and how we are going to create it. that brings us to the concepts that as human we can't remember everything, so we needed something which could remember as long as we want it to, and more importantly we want it to do the computation so much faster that we ever could. those are the only two things that computer has over human brain. so based on that we proceed, a memory for remembering and a cpu for processing. so we start my using our nand gates to create both memory and cpu. and we test it, troubleshoot it, add features to it, until we have our computer.  now we save our program as a set of instructions inside the memory, the cpu would fetch those instructions, and execute them and move to the next one, and it does it over and over again. everything in the computer which is not hardware, is a program, a simple FILE.\n\n\nso in the second chapter we start talking about files. if all the computer could know are 1s and 0s, how could it show us text and images, movies and executables. this is were we talk about file extensions and headers. so that it could be an introduction into getting us to the elf file format, the executables and binary files in linux. because if we want to reverse files and crack and hack them, first we need to know them. all its segment and section headers, but not just an overview, going deep , somehow that we comprehend every byte of it.  now its time for us to know how they get executed, or how they get created? using programming languages: ASSEMBLY\n\n\nin the next chapter we enter the assembly world. why we need it , like always would be the main question, if we could anser it then we enter to HOW we do it.  we teach everything you need to know about assembly. and when we write a program we debug it using the gdb, analyze instructions one by one, so that you know the reason for each instruction. and at the same time we compare assembly with other higher level programming languages.\n\n\nwhy we need c programming language would trigger the creation of the next chapter. variables, pointers, format specifers, functions, they are all just names without a concept and their comprehension, thats why for every single abstraction there is a separate lecture depicting the memory and stack(we explain what this is in an intuitive manner) organization and how it changes.\n\n\nwhen we know all these sciences in such a different manner, then when we get to the reverse engineering and exploit development, the last two chapter, you see that these are just a different look of everything we have learned so far. just looking differently and keep track of memory.  and using these we would be able to reverse engineer malwares, hack and crack softwares. which means acquiring the offensive skills without which , you could never be a real hacker.",

      "description": "Hello to everyone!\nWelcome to the \"Kali Linux For Beginners\" course.\nLearn from real Ethical hackers how to use Kali Linux easily and quickly, become confident while using Kali Linux!\n\nToday, many critical systems continue to work on the Linux operating system. Because Linux operating systems are very stable and can work without interruption. With the development of the Internet, Linux operating systems have developed and started to use the Windows concept.\n\nLinux is available in a range of different distributions that are tailored to the needs and skills of its users. Simple distributions, like openSUSE, are great for personal computing, while Linux Ubuntu is ideal for network admins and computer scientists.\nLinux has a somewhat inaccurate reputation as being a much more technical and complex alternative to mainstay operating systems like Windows and MacOS. In reality, Linux is an approachable, open-source, and customizable OS that’s designed to address huge deficiencies in commercial operating systems.\nOur student says that: I loved this course and it taught me so many things, that now I am very competent in a terminal that has a UNIX background. Almost all of what is taught was transferable to the Mac terminal, and thanks to this course, I can even make my own scripting programs to make my life easier.\n\nWhat is Linux and why should I use it?\nLinux is an operating system (OS), which is the primary software that a computer uses to execute tasks and communicate directions to its hardware. The operating system that competes the most with Linux is Windows. Linux is a popular and widely-used OS because it is open-source, meaning that it is free to the public, and anyone can modify and customize Linux software as they wish. The reasons to use Linux can vary from developing an app or building a video game to learning how to hack computer systems. As Linux is one of the most popular operating systems, many developers use it to develop their web applications and software programs. This means knowledge of Linux is important for anyone working with computers and software in general. Learning how to work with Linux is a necessary skill for anyone pursuing a career in ethical hacking or penetration testing\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nBoth ethical (white hat) hackers and malicious (black hat) hackers often prefer to use the Linux operating system (OS) over Windows OS. The biggest reason hackers turn to Linux is because it is far more accessible to a wider range of people than Windows OS offers. Linux is free, open-source, and provides a well-integrated command-line interface for users to customize the OS. This means anyone can modify Linux to create their own programs and software. Malicious hackers often opt for Linux because it gives them more control when using Linux, and ethical hackers need to be well-versed in Linux because it’s so popular among black hat hackers. Ethical hackers also often prefer using Linux as it has better existing security measures than Windows and doesn’t usually require third-party antivirus software.\nHow long will it take to learn Linux and how can I teach it to myself?\nThe time it takes to learn Linux can vary, depending on whether you have existing background knowledge of other operating systems and how deep of an understanding you want to gain. For beginners learning Linux to pursue a career in IT or software administration, you may only need a basic understanding of how to navigate and execute functions using Linux and how applications built on Linux behave. If you plan to become an ethical hacker, or pentester, you may need a more in-depth knowledge of Linux security procedures and a skill in manipulating Linux programs. You can learn Linux on your own time by seeking out video tutorials and online courses. There are plenty of courses available on Udemy that teach the fundamentals of Linux and more advanced Linux skills.\nWhat careers use Linux?\nMany jobs in IT, software development, and cybersecurity rely on Linux skills and expertise. A career in app development generally requires a deep understanding of Linux, as many app developers use Linux as a basis for their applications. Software-focused career paths that frequently use Linux include developer and software engineering roles for Python, Java, and Linux systems. Nearly any role in cybersecurity, such as a penetration tester or ethical hacker, requires a strong knowledge of Linux. With Linux expertise and skills, you could work as a system administrator, IT professional, system architect, or database administrator. You may even work in website development, maintenance, or security, as people in those roles build a majority of their web applications on Linux.\nWhat is the core of the Linux operating system?\nThe core component of any operating system is called the kernel. Linux’s core is simply referred to as the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is a single program that manages crucial tasks such as allocating memory, communicating software functions to the computer’s CPU, and comprehending all of the input and output from the computer’s hardware. The kernel is the most important part of an OS and often runs in a separate area from the rest of a computer’s software. The kernel is just one part of a full operating system, which includes a combination of components such as the bootloader, init system, graphical server, desktop environment, and more. The name “Linux” can refer to both the kernel itself (the Linux kernel) and an operating system built around that kernel. For example, the Android OS and the Ubuntu distribution are both made using the Linux kernel.\nWhat are the best Linux distributions for beginners?\nThere is a wide range of Linux distributions to choose from when learning and working with Linux. When you are first learning Linux, the distribution you choose to learn may depend on how you plan to apply your Linux skills. If you are pursuing a career in cybersecurity, you may select a different Linux distribution to start with than someone pursuing a career in game development, for instance. Online courses are some of the best resources for beginners to Linux, as they will give guidance on which Linux distribution is a good fit for the intended application of Linux. For beginners, a few of the most highly recommended Linux distributions include Elementary OS, Ubuntu Linux, and Ubuntu Budgie. Other distributions that are considered easy to learn and master are Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Nitrux, Kodachi, Rescatux, and Parrot Security.\nAdvanced computer knowledge is no longer required to use a Linux operating system.\n\nAnyone at the beginner level can take this course. And this course will take you even further. This course is a practical course. You'll learn some theory first and then have the chance to apply what you've learned.\n\nIn the \"Kali Linux For Beginners\" course, you will learn;\nHow to install Kali Linux 2020.4?\nWhat are default Kali Linux 2020.4 programs and how to use them?\nHow to set up a new program?\nHow are updates of existing programs done?\nYou will learn how to change the Kali Linux 2020.4 installation settings.\nHow to use the terminal?\nkali linux kali ethical hacking kali linux tutorial linux hacking tcpump career hacking learn kali linux muharrem aydin linux hacking kali linux course ddos kali linux hacking ethical hacking kali linux linux expert john the ripper ethical hacker kali linux start your maltego start kali linux kali linux hack kali linux ethical hacking kali linux for hacking linux for hackers kalilinux kali linux full course csi linux kali linux certified professional hashcat kali linux beginner ethical hacking with kali free ethical hacking kali linux tutorial for beginners social engineering kali hacking kali linux for ethical hacking hacking with linux\n\nAt the end of this course;\nYou will be able to change the Kali Linux 2020.4 operating system settings,\nYou will learn how to use the necessary programs for your daily work.\nYou will learn how to run the most used hacker programs.\nUsing linux, kali linux, linux administration, linux command line, kali\nkali linux, oscp, kali, linux, ceh, everything about kali linux os, kali linux tutorial, penetration testing, ethical hacking.\nKali Linux, kali, ethical hacking, kali Linux for beginners, Linux, kali Linux tutorial, learn kali Linux, hacking, kali Linux beginner, kali Linux hacking, oak Academy, kismet, ethical hacking using kali Linux, Linux kali, kali Linux full course, kali linux tutorial for beginners, hacking with kali Linux, how to become a hacker, kali Linux 2021, kali Linux 2020, kali Linux hack, Linux for beginners, kali Linux free\nWhy would you want to take this course?\nOur answer is simple: The quality of the teacher.

      "description": "A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication to form a local area network (LAN) within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, campus, or office building. This gives users the ability to move around within the area and remain connected to the network. Through a gateway, a WLAN can also provide a connection to the wider Internet.\n\n\nWireless LANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standards are the most widely used computer networks in the world. These are commonly called Wi-Fi, which is a trademark belonging to the Wi-Fi Alliance. They are used for home and small office networks that link together laptop computers, printers, smartphones, Web TVs and gaming devices with a wireless router, which links them to the internet. Hotspots provided by routers at restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, libraries, and airports allow consumers to access the internet with portable wireless devices.\n\n\nThe IEEE 802.11 has two basic modes of operation: infrastructure and ad hoc mode. In ad hoc mode, mobile units communicate directly peer-to-peer. In infrastructure mode, mobile units communicate through a wireless access point (WAP) that also serves as a bridge to other networks such as a local area network or the Internet.\n\n\nSince wireless communication uses a more open medium for communication in comparison to wired LANs, the 802.11 designers also included encryption mechanisms: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), no longer considered secure, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, WPA3), to secure wireless computer networks.

      "description": "What is ethical hacking?\nEthical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.\nAlso known as “white hats,” ethical hackers are security experts that perform these assessments. The proactive work they do helps to improve an organization’s security posture. With prior approval from the organization or owner of the IT asset, the mission of ethical hacking is opposite from malicious hacking.\n\nWhat Is A Red Team?\nA red team consists of security professionals who act as adversaries to overcome cyber security controls. Red teams often consist of independent ethical hackers who evaluate system security in an objective manner.\nThey utilize all the available techniques to find weaknesses in people, processes, and technology to gain unauthorized access to assets. As a result of these simulated attacks, red teams make recommendations and plans on how to strengthen an organization’s security posture.\n\n\nHow Does A Red Team Work?\nYou might be surprised to learn that red teams spend more time planning an attack then they do performing attacks. In fact, red teams deploy a number of methods to gain access to a network.\nSocial engineering attacks, for example, rely on reconnaissance and research to deliver targeted spear phishing campaigns. Likewise, prior to performing a penetration test, packet sniffers and protocol analyzers are used to scan the network and gather as much information about the system as possible.\n\n\nWhat Is A Blue Team?\nA blue team consists of security professionals who have an inside out view of the organization. Their task is to protect the organization’s critical assets against any kind of threat.\nThey are well aware of the business objectives and the organization’s security strategy. Therefore, their task is to strengthen the castle walls so no intruder can compromise the defenses.\n\n\nHow Does A Blue Team Work?\nThe blue team first gathers data, documents exactly what needs to be protected and carries out a risk assessment. They then tighten up access to the system in many ways, including introducing stronger password policies and educating staff to ensure they understand and conform to security procedures.\nMonitoring tools are often put in place, allowing information regarding access to the systems to be logged and checked for unusual activity. Blue teams will perform regular checks on the system, for example, DNS audits, internal or external network vulnerability scans and capturing sample network traffic for analysis.",

      "description": "Installing backdoors, exfiltrating documents, or capturing credentials is incredibly easy with a seemingly innocent USB drive called the USB Rubber Ducky. An Expert hacker with a few minutes, photographic memory and perfect typing accuracy can use a few well-crafted keystrokes to hack virtually anything they have physical access to. However, the right hardware can do the same thing every time on demand without fail. That’s where the Rubber Ducky and other Human Interface Devices (HID) come into play. They inject keystrokes at superhuman speeds, violating the inherent trust computers have in humans by posing as a keyboard.\nIn this class, we’ll learn more about what HID attacks are, how they work, the social engineering that can be involved in their deployment, and how to use them in your Pen-testing engagements. Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted. We'll program a microcontroller in Arduino to take advantage of this by acting as an HID device. We can then create our scripts that run when the device is plugged into a target computer. All at only a fraction of the cost of the more well-branded USB Rubber Ducky!\nStudents will learn to use a low-cost Digispark to program their payloads for use in Ethical Hacking and Penetration testing. We'll go over creating more advanced payloads, including tracking payloads which run in the background, as well as Rickroll payloads which can be used with permission on friends and family to demonstrate how HID attacks work. Additionally, students learn to automate nearly anything on an unattended device which can be extremely useful when you need to run the same commands on a series of computers. That’s how the Original USB Ruber Ducky was invented. Hak5 founder Darren Kitchen, while working as a sysadmin, got tired of typing the same commands to fix printers and network shares, again and again, the device evolved out of laziness. He programmed a development board to emulate the typing for him - and thus the keystroke injection attack was born.",

Egg hunters, ASLR bypass, Stack Pivoting, Function Reuse, Manual encoding are some of the techniques covered in this course.\nIt follows the six stages of exploit development and  gives a detailed walk-through of each. Each module starts by identifying  the vulnerability via fuzzing. You'll learn, server fuzzing  (using Spike) and file format fuzzing (using Peach Fuzzer). It then shows  you how to create a PoC to trigger the vulnerability and convert that  PoC into a working exploit.\nThrough this course you will get  introduced to various tools such as Immunity Debugger, Mona library for  Immunity Debugger, Metasploit, msfvenom, Spike, Peach Fuzzer, BooFuzz and much  more.  This course is designed to be short and concise yet packed with practical knowledge.\nEach video includes learning resources (in  video) and associated files (pdf slides, fuzzing scripts, peach pit python script  etc.). You can just follow along and create a working exploit. It's that  simple.  Happy hacking!\nWhat our fellow students say about this course\n\"I have been looking for resources to learn different techniques of exploit development. This course was a great find. It is very easy to follow along and understand the concepts.\" - Surbhi Goel\n\"Great! More fuzzing tools are introduced.\" -  Ying-Chen Chiou\n\"pretty good basics,easy to follow buffer overflow\" - Arun Mathew",

Then we will start diving into what hacking is and what are different types of hacking. We will learn how to keep ourselves secure over LAN by developing a program for changing MAC address. Then we will create a Network Scanner that will help us in scanning devices over our local network and finding out their IP and MAC addresses. During our course, we will explore a lot of aspects of hacking using go language in detail and use important packages for Hacking purposes.\n\n\nIn the later part of our course, we will start developing programs that will help us in hacking. Firstly we will perform a man in the middle attack using ARP spoofing and then we will intercept traffic between users. Then we will create our own backdoor malware that will give us complete control over the victim machine using a power-shell , i.e you will be able to run commands on the remote PC.

      "description": "Welcome to Web Application Penetration Testing or Bug Bounty Hunting course. This course will take you from basics to an intermediate level where you will be able to make some money by hacking, yeah it's very interesting. Imagine making money by doing a thing we love to do.\nHow I get Started\nFirst like all others I went to google and searched for what is bug bounty and how to get started in bug bounty I couldn't find what I wanted then I searched for web application pentesting and found many courses and resources out there and learned about all of them.\nAfter learning about many vulnerabilities I went to a real world application and I was stuck with doing nothing, I didn't know what to test where to test or anything. I didn't know what should I do after selecting a domain to hack, that's the main problem I came across during my journey. Literally none of the resources or courses showed me the answer. It took me a while to understand.\nSo I decided to include that also at the end of the course i.e what should we do after picking up the target. I can assure you that, you won't be stuck like me while start hacking if you purchased this course.\nOne more thing that I coudn't realize was that how to report or where to report and I didn't heard of the platforms out there at that time, might be because of no previous knowledge in this area. So I mentioned in this course that how can we find websites that have bug bounty programs and platforms and external programs too.\nI was able to find my first ever paid bug within 2 months without any previous knowledge. When I post that on twitter thanking all the hackers out there I started getting messages asking how I learned so fast and how am I hunting. This made me starting a medium blog and then got messages from people telling \"Thank you I was able to find my first bug as in the blog\" The blog isn't a big one but it contains vulnerabilities that you can easily find without any previous knowledge. So I thought it will be great if I could make a video course for absolute beginners to become good hackers and earn money by hacking websites.\nNow my name is listed in Hall of Fames of various programs and was able to find critical vulnerabilities so that I can earn more in that way.\nEach Section and lectures have a description of what we are going to learn on that particular section or lecture so that if you are already familiar with that area you can skip that portion.",

We will learn how to not be seen by Intrusion Detection Systems and Evade Anti-Virus Software used by professional Penetration Testers around the globe. The course will then look at Empire, again we will start with the basics of moving around, how to gain our sessions known as 'agents', escalate our privileges if required and migrate over to the Metasploit framework.

      "description": "In computer networking, multicast is group communication where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously. Multicast can be one-to-many or many-to-many distribution.[Multicast should not be confused with physical layer point-to-multipoint communication.\nGroup communication may either be application layer multicast or network-assisted multicast, where the latter makes it possible for the source to efficiently send to the group in a single transmission. Copies are automatically created in other network elements, such as routers, switches and cellular network base stations, but only to network segments that currently contain members of the group.\nNetwork-assisted multicast may also be implemented at the Internet layer using IP multicast. In IP multicast the implementation of the multicast concept occurs at the IP routing level, where routers create optimal distribution paths for datagrams sent to a multicast destination address.\nMulticast is often employed in Internet Protocol (IP) applications of streaming media, such as IPTV and multipoint videoconferencing.\nWhen multiple routers are used in interconnected networks, the routers can exchange information about destination addresses using a routing protocol. Each router builds up a routing table, a list of routes, between two computer systems on the interconnected networks.\nIP multicast is a technique for one-to-many communication over an IP network. The destination nodes send Internet Group Management Protocol join and leave messages, for example in the case of IPTV when the user changes from one TV channel to another. IP multicast scales to a larger receiver population by not requiring prior knowledge of who or how many receivers there are. Multicast uses network infrastructure efficiently by requiring the source to send a packet only once, even if it needs to be delivered to a large number of receivers. The nodes in the network take care of replicating the packet to reach multiple receivers only when necessary.",

Through this tool, you can make viruses and worms that can infect victim's drives, files, shows message, disable Anti-Virus Software and much more. It comes along with a compiler by which you can easily convert your batch virus into executable to evade Anti-Virus or any other purpose.\n\n\nGhost Eye - Ghost Eye is a nasty trojan infection which enters to the target system with peer to peer file sharing process, removable storage device, downloading audio and video files from unsecured sites and many others. It slow down the system running process and also leads to issue like system crash, data loss or hamper of important hardware components. The main aim of this virus is to steal privacy details like credit card number, online banking login details and others. It access user PC information with the use of key loggers which record the online and activities and send to the remote hackers.\n\n\nJPS Virus Maker - JPS Virus Maker has less features than Internet Worm Maker Thing and DelMe Virus Maker. However it has some features that are not available in Internet Worm Maker Thing and DelMe Virus Maker.\n\n\nCustom Trojans - While the original Trojan Horse was used to sneak Greeks into Troy, the common meaning today actually refers to the payload that gets deposited on your computer. Trojans typically grant a hacker remote access to your computer.\n\n\nStatic Malware Analysis - Basic static analysis examines malware without viewing the actual code or instructions. It employs different tools and techniques to quickly determine whether a file is malicious or not, provide information about its functionality and collect technical indicators to produce simple signatures. Technical indicators gathered with basic static analysis can include file name, MD5 checksums or hashes, file type, file size and recognition by antivirus detection tools.\n\n\nDynamic Malware Analysis - Basic dynamic analysis actually runs malware to observe its behavior, understand its functionality and identify technical indicators which can be used in detection signatures. Technical indicators revealed with basic dynamic analysis can include domain names, IP addresses, file path locations, registry keys, additional files located on the system or network.\n\n\nSandboxing  - Automation of malware analysis.",

The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn about all the tactics for ICS/OT as per the framework. This is not a practical course, this is solely for learning the concepts. Also, we will learn about all the techniques in detail for each tactic. And for mitigation, there could be the same mitigation to be applied for multiple techniques so we will cover mitigations as a whole. We will cover all the below-mentioned tactics:\n\n\nICS Attack tactics:\nInitial Access\nExecution\nPersistence\nPrivilege Escalation\nEvasion\nDiscovery\nLateral Movement\nCollection\nCommand and Control\nInhibit Response Function\nImpair Process Control\nImpact\nAfter completing this course you will have a good understanding of the techniques to be implemented and executed by adversaries. That will help you to answer clients, customers, and in meetings and discussions. Also whenever you are designing some solution you will keep these in mind and set proper mitigation to make the environment more secure and comprehensive.\n* Connect to me on Linkedin/ or visit cyberotsecure{dot}com website to get discounts.\nFor understanding this course you should have a basic understanding of the Industrial control system and technical terms which are commonly used in cybersecurity so that you can understand the concepts.

Now there is a legal way by which you can report bugs and vulnerability to websites and in return you can get reward money.\nWhat is this course about?\nThis is an ideal course to learn penetration testing from scratch. This course requires no coding skills yet you will be able to perform and create great reports on pentesting for clients. Pentesting is second highest paid job with lots of empty space according to Forbes.\nEveryone is learning to create, someone has to take the responsibility to secure that creation.\nPenetration testing is a step by step procedure to test an application for various security flaws. These flaws can compromise a website at various levels like database leak, client information leak or may involve monetary leak too.\nA lot of new pentester learn a few slings to hack the application but approaching client in a formal way, doing a procedural pentest and documenting a report is a different game. In this course you will learn about all types of vulnerabilities, exploitation of web application, impact of flaws and finally we will cover the steps to write a report.\nTraditional companies rely on Firewalls and network security. Attack vectors based on web application will not trigger alarm for it. Specially the new application that are based on CMS like wordpress are getting hacked often. A whole lot ground is covered in this course.\nUpdates in this course.\nYou might notice a few small topics being missed out. Web security is a big monster, that is why we have decided to roll out the course and in the mean while we will be updating the course on monthly basis. There will be no charge for extra lecture added but course prize may increase at latter stage.\nNo coding experience, No Prior Knowledge; Just start your journey as WEB APPLICATION PENTESTER.",

      "description": "Welcome to Ethical Hacking Course ! In this course, you will start as a beginner and leave the course with an expert . The course purely focused on Practicals .\nCourse is divided in 3 parts -\n1. Network Pentesting\n2. Web Pentesting\n3. App Pentesting\nThe course is structured in a way that will take you through the basics  of  computer systems, networks and how devices communicate with  each other. We will start by talking about how we can exploit these  systems to carry out a number of powerful attacks. This course will take  you from a beginner to a more advanced level -- by the time you finish, you will have knowledge about most penetration testing fields.\nNetwork Penetration Testing - In this section you will learn major and minor attacks on networks .it can be divided in 3 sections . -\n\n\nPre-connection: in this  section, we still don't know much about penetration testing -- all we  have is a computer with a wireless card. You will learn how gather information about  the networks and computers around you and launch a number of attacks  without a password, such as controlling the connections around you (ie: deny/allow any device from connecting to any network). You will also learn how to create a fake access point, attract users to connect to it and capture any important information they enter.\nGaining Access:  Now that you have gathered information about the networks around you  and found your target, you will learn how to crack the key and gain  access to your target network. In this section you will learn a number of methods to crack WEP/WPA/WPA2 encryption.\nPost Connection: Now you have the key to your target network and you can connect to it. In this section you will learn a number of powerful attacks that can be launched against the network and connected clients. These attacks will allow you to gain access to any account accessed by any device connected to your network and read all the traffic used by these devices (images, videos, audio, passwords ...etc).\nGaining Access - In this section you will learn how to gain full control over any computer system\nServer Side Attacks:  In this approach you will learn how to gain full access to systems without the need for user interaction.  You will learn how to gather information about a target computer system  such as its operating system, open ports, installed services and discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities. You will also learn how to exploit these weaknesses to gain full control over the target. Finally you will learn how to generate different types of reports for your discoveries.\nClient Side Attacks - If  the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to  gain access to it is by interacting with the user. In this approach you  will learn how to launch a number of powerful attacks to fool the target  user and get them to install a backdoor on their device. This is done  by creating fake updates and serving them to the user or by backdooring  downloaded files on the fly. You will also learn how to gather information about the target person and use social engineering to deliver a backdoor to them as an image or any other file type.Post Exploitation - In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’ll learn how to access the file system (read/write/upload/execute), maintain your access, spy on the target and even use the target computer as a pivot to hack other computer systems.\n\n2. Web Application Penetration Testing - In this section you will learn how webistes actually works . you will learn various web application attacks like sql injection attack , xss attack , csrf attack  , shell upload attack , buffer overflow attack , local file inclusion attack etc . we have covered all major attacks on web applications .\n\n\n3. Android App Penetration Testing - In this section , you will learn how android app works . you will learn about various information gathering techniques regarding vulnerabilities like log analysis , reverse engineering etc . A complete process to pentest android apps .\n\n\nSummary\nIn this course, you will perform test to carry out and exploit hidden vulnerability within your network and systems, not only you will be exposing those but you will also provide ways and methods to fix and secure and hardening your system security preventing it from any other attacks. You will learn how to test your network against various types of attacks & develop a network-testing environment that can be used to test scanning tools and techniques. Employ the methods used by real hackers effectively, to ensure the most effective penetration testing of your network, select and configure the most effective tools from Kali Linux to test network security, employ stealth to avoid detection in the network being tested, recognize when stealthy attacks are being used against your network.Exploit networks and data systems using wired and wireless networks as well as web services. Identify and download valuable data from target systems & learn to maintain access on compromised systems. Use social engineering to compromise the weakest part of the network—the end users. Port scanning for UDP scanning, stealth scanning, connect & zombie scanning using pentesting tools. You will learn how to utilize the arsenal of tools available in Kali Linux to conquer any network environment.By the end of this course you will become a pro with the tools that Kali Linux offers to perform some advanced penetration testing, how to exploit the vulnerable systems and how to patch them.\n\n\nNOTE: This course is created for educational purposes only .\nNOTE: This course is a product of Sunil Gupta and no  other organisation is associated with it or a certification exam.  Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy.",

You can start with this course and just dive in. However, if you feel like starting from the basics, we encourage you to check it out!\nThe aim of this course is to provide a practical approach to analysing ransomware. More specifically, we will attack the following topics:\nIdentify and work around anti-virtualisation techniques deployed inside malware samples\nDynamic analysis of sample’s activity on a Windows box\nAdvanced debugging techniques\nUse static analysis to discover and understand encryption algorithms\nDiscover, and work-around, obfuscation tricks and anti-static analysis tricks\nDiscover flaws that allow us to recover encrypted files\nWrite decryptors in Python and C\n\n\nThe course begins by going through the necessary precaution measures when working with malware, then quickly dives in analysing actual samples. Since Windows is by far the most popular target platform, we will focus on this operating system.\nNeither professional programming experience nor assembly language knowledge are required to benefit from the course, although they would be very helpful when we’ll look at identifying encryption algorithms and bypass anti-virtualisation checks. The concepts will be explained in a clear and concise manner and additional resources will be recommended.\nSome programming experience will be very beneficial when we’ll start writing decryptors. However, the focus will be mostly on understanding the algorithms and specifically what information we need to do successful decryptions. For this reason, full Python and C source code will be provided.\nTo get the most out of this course, we recommended to exercise all the steps described within the lectures and whenever a concept or idea is not fully explained or clearly understood, either reached out with questions on the Q&A section or consult online resources.\n\n\nWhy take this course?\nMostly because you like a practical malware analysis course focused on a real threat - ransomware. Also because you’re curious how ransomware are reversed by people or companies that routinely write public decryptors.\nThis course intention is to be useful and interesting to everybody involved in information security and malware analysis, from students to security testers and forensic investigators.\nIf you decide you love reverse engineering and wish to further develop your skills, other resources will be suggested along the way.\nThe course will explain how to use process monitoring tools, hex editors, debuggers and disassemblers.\nA lot of the concepts and analysis strategies presented here apply to analysing malware in general.\nOnce you have completed this training course, you will be more confident and capable to identify anti-virtualisation and anti-static analysis tricks.\nYou will also be able to debug your samples in any debugger and disassembler.\nYou will be able to identify encryption algorithms and write decryptors for your own samples.\nSamples and scripts are included, so you can follow along with us throughout the lessons. IDA scripts, Python and C source code is provided for various tasks needed throughout the class.\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nThis course is for anyone interested in information security in general and malware analysis in particular, including but not only:\nSecurity testers\nMalware analysts\nForensics investigators\nSystem administrators\nInformation security students\n\n\nWho this is not?\nThis course is not an introduction to malware. It only focuses on the sub-topic of ransomware.\nBasic experience with assembly and programming languages will be very helpful, because this is not an introduction to assembly.\nAlthough safety issues are presented, this is not a tutorial on how to configure a malware analysis virtual environment.\nAlthough general information is presented, this is not an elaborate high-level description of ransomware.\nSolutions for attempting to reverse the encryption process and recover files are presented, but this is not a course about how to prevent ransomware in the first place.\nBasic familiarity with reverse engineering concepts would be very useful, because this is not an introduction to reverse engineering.\nAlthough it should be obvious, this is not a tutorial on how to write better ransomware.\n\n\nWhat am I going to get?\nThe lectures, videos and other resources will provide you with relevant information about current malware analysis tricks\nYou will learn how to confidently use any debugger and disassembler\nYou will learn to identify flaws in the ransomware code or encryption logic\nYou will learn how to write scripts for IDA Pro\nYou will get a relevant quiz at the end to test your understanding\nPython and C source code for the decryptors and IDA scripts\n\n\nMinimum requirements :\nAt minimum, you will have:\nA computer that can run a Windows virtual machine.\nAn interest in disassembling things and understanding how they work!\nBasic assembly knowledge about common instructions, registers, conditional branches\nBasic programming knowledge and ability to understand simple Python and C source code\nPatience and a lot of perseverance to “try harder” ®",

Designed for cybersecurity professionals, IT managers, compliance officers, and organizational leaders, this course walks learners through every essential aspect of the CSF, from its origins and structure to its practical implementation across industries.\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary, risk-based framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations of all sizes manage and improve their cybersecurity posture.\nBeginning with a high-level overview, the course explores the origins of the framework, tracing its evolution from Executive Order 13636 to the release of NIST CSF 2.0. Learners will gain insight into the framework’s purpose, intended users, and the broad value it brings in terms of risk management, regulatory alignment, and cybersecurity maturity. We examine how the framework is structured into core components—including the Framework Core, Implementation Tiers, and Profiles—and how each of these helps organizations organize, assess, and improve their cybersecurity capabilities.\nThe course then delves into the Framework Core's five critical Functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—offering clear, actionable explanations of how each function contributes to building resilient and proactive cybersecurity strategies. You’ll learn how these functions are broken down into Categories and Subcategories and how these can be mapped to standards like ISO 27001, COBIT, and NIST SP 800-53 for a comprehensive, standards-based security posture.\nImplementation guidance is provided with detailed coverage of the CSF’s Implementation Tiers and how they reflect an organization’s cybersecurity risk management maturity. The course also explains how to develop Current and Target Profiles and use them for gap analysis, planning, and performance improvement. Real-world guidance is offered on integrating CSF into broader enterprise risk management practices and aligning it with governance, policy, and leadership structures.\nRecognizing the diverse needs of different industries and organizations, the course presents practical use cases for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), critical infrastructure sectors like healthcare and energy, and how the framework can help manage third-party and supply chain risk.\nYou’ll also receive an in-depth look at the major updates in NIST CSF 2.0, including expanded guidance and international applicability. The course concludes with a forward-looking perspective on the future of cybersecurity frameworks, addressing emerging threats, technologies, and global adoption trends.\nIt is especially valued for making complex cybersecurity principles more accessible and actionable, serving as a roadmap for organizations to assess their current security posture, identify gaps, and implement improvements.\nWhether you're new to the NIST CSF or looking to refine your implementation strategy, this course equips you with the knowledge, tools, and confidence to apply the framework effectively and build a stronger, more resilient cybersecurity program in your organization.\nThank you",

      "description": "|| Unofficial Course ||\nThis comprehensive course is designed to prepare learners for the Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) certification while building a strong foundation in secure software development practices. Whether you're a developer, software architect, security professional, or project manager, this course will equip you with the knowledge and skills required to integrate security at every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).\nThe course begins by introducing the core objectives of CSSLP and the growing importance of security in software engineering. You'll explore the fundamentals of software security, including common threats, vulnerabilities, and the critical role of security across the SDLC. Key security concepts such as the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accountability), and defense-in-depth strategies will be discussed in depth to lay a solid conceptual foundation.\nYou’ll gain insights into how to align software projects with organizational security policies, standards, and compliance requirements, including widely adopted frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST, OWASP, GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. The course emphasizes the importance of governance, risk management, and threat modeling, enabling learners to assess risks effectively and apply best practices in real-world projects.\nMoving into secure requirements engineering, the course explores how to define, validate, and manage functional and non-functional security requirements. You’ll learn how to apply threat modeling techniques such as STRIDE, DREAD, and PASTA to anticipate and mitigate potential attacks early in the development cycle.\nSecure software design is a major focus area, covering essential design principles such as least privilege, secure defaults, and fail-safe mechanisms. You’ll examine common design vulnerabilities and learn how to architect systems that are resilient to attacks while maintaining usability and performance.\nDuring the secure implementation phase, the course provides practical guidance on secure coding practices, secure development frameworks, and tools. You'll analyze common coding vulnerabilities—including SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflows—and discover how to prevent them using industry-proven techniques and standards such as the OWASP Top 10 and SANS Top 25.\nThe testing section introduces security testing methodologies including Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST). You’ll learn how to assess software for vulnerabilities, document issues, and incorporate security testing seamlessly into the development workflow.\nAs the course progresses into deployment and operations, you'll explore secure deployment strategies, system hardening, and post-deployment security measures. Topics such as continuous monitoring, incident detection, and response planning are covered to ensure the software remains secure after release.\nFinally, the course addresses ongoing software maintenance and the growing importance of supply chain security. You'll learn best practices for patch management, version control, and managing third-party components to reduce risks in today’s interconnected software environments.\nBy the end of the course, learners will be well-prepared not only to pass the CSSLP certification exam but also to apply secure development principles confidently in their professional roles.\nThis course offers practical knowledge, real-world insights, and a structured learning path for anyone committed to building and maintaining secure software systems.\nThank you",

With the advancement in social, mobile, analytics, cloud and IOT technologies and its adoption by enterprise, cybersecurity posture has become one of the cornerstone of an enterprise resilience to cybersecurity threats.\nThe preparedness for cybersecurity threats and hence organisation risk management capacity is proportionate to the threat, vulnerability, likelihood and impact. Organisation risk management strategy with respect to cybersecurity threats not only depend on tools and technology deployment but policy, process and controls framework as well.\nAs part of organisation cyber security threat management, every medium and large organisation, often, implements information security management system in line with ISO 27001 standard. These systems are a combination of cyber security policy, process, controls and guidelines. Once the cyber security management system, also called as, Information security management system(ISMS) is implemented, it needs to be regularly audited to validate the compliance and improvement based on new cyber threats. The audit ensures that organisation cyber security strategy is in tune with the laid down process and is it at par with current threat vectors.\nHence, Cyber security Audit is always a difficult task. The stakeholder management becomes critical. There should be constructive discussion with auditee and auditor. The discussions and follow through requires a typical characteristic to be depicted during a fruitful audit exercise.\nThis course explains the need for internal cybersecurity audit i.e. why, how and what is being done during audits. It explains the preparation phase, audit conducting phase and post audit phase of audit. The soft aspect of audit are as much important as the audit itself. The Do and Don't are very crisply highlighted that can be applied as a practice by the auditors.\nAt the end of the course, you will be the most sought after auditor by the  different unit of organisation.",

However, understanding the technical aspects of these systems can be complex. That's where this course comes in!\nThis course has been prepared by a certified CCTV security professional for those who wants to join security industry as their profession and who wants to refresh their knowledge in CCTV domain.\nThis course contains basic of CCTV system, how it works and types of CCTV system.\nIn this course, you will also learn about the CCTV camera features which plays a very crucial role in recording a good quality videos and how to  optimum use of the available resources. For example, how to use WDR / BLC technology to avoid image darkness or over brightness.\nI have also shared my field experience where I had provided solutions to the challenging issues. For example, A reputed client had different factories at remote locations and customer wants to view and playback the recorded video at his headquarter security control room.\nHere, challenge was the distance (in kilometers) and the lack of network infrastructure between the factories and headquarter control room.\nThis challenge was solved by introducing wireless access points and now the client is able to view and playback the high quality recorded footage.\nEnroll now and take the first step towards becoming a master in CCTV system installation and maintenance!",

I will actually teach you, what is behind the attacks, and not just show you a “tool”. It is focused around the use of the hacking distribution Kali Linux and will cover both the theory, practical skills, tools and techniques used to hack WiFi network and clients.\nSince, it is based on Kali Linux it will help you prepare for the Offensive Security Wifi Professional exam (which the instructor holds himself) – but is not associated with Offensive Security. We will start with the basics of WiFi technology like frequencies, channels, antennas and move into different operation modes etc. Then I will teach you how to hack WiFi network in all types of setups.\nThere is a very comprehensive 2 hours module on password cracking not only related to WiFi but how to use different techniques and tools to be successful in cracking even complex passwords. I will then move into to more advanced hacks like bypassing AP restrictions, captive portals and setting up rogue AP and talk about “thinking out of the box” as a pentester. There are other ways to hack WiFi networks than just cracking a WEP/WPA key.",

      "description": "It is critical to know Network IP addressing and Subnetting for the IT and Non-IT professionals like Researchers, Scientific Developers to succeed in the real work and passing most IT certifications. Network IP Subnetting is basically dividing your network in different sub networks. By doing this, you can produce different broadcast networks with you one nework. There are types of Subnetting. Each subnet allows its connected devices to communicate with each other, while routers are used to communicate between subnets. The size of a subnet depends on the connectivity requirements and the network technology employed.\nA point-to-point subnet allows two devices to connect, while a data center subnet might be designed to connect many more devices. This course will help you learning the basic foundation of IP address, it's format, ways to assign them, subnetting, and how to subnet.\nThe benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, you can think it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. If you learn how to do a good Subnetting it may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization. Your Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure, or other structures such as meshes.\nWHAT YOU'LL LEARN IN THIS COURSE:\nIP Networks (Animated)\nSubnetting - why do we subnet?\nSubnet Masks and CIDR\nDNS\nDHCP\nFirewall\nLinux and Windows IPv4 Networking\nVirtual Networks Testing with GNS3\nIn this course you will be learning all the important information you need to fully understand IPv4 addressing which is directly related to your Cisco CCNA, RHCSA, RHCE, MCSA and MCSE Exams, or any other IT exams you may be taking. Once you learn the details and key topics, you will learn the tricks and tools which will allow you to subnet any question quickly and accurately!\n\n\nMONEY BACK GUARANTEE IF NOT 100% SATISFIED!\nWhen you enroll you will get lifetime access to all of the course contents and any updates and when you complete the course 100% you will also get a Certificate of completion that you can add to your resumé/CV to show off to the world your new-found Python & Scientific Computing Mastery!

      "description": "On this training you will learn the basics of a Structured cabling system, is building or campus cabling infrastructure that consists of a number of standardized smaller elements (hence structured) called subsystems. Structured cabling components include twisted pair and optical cabling, patch panels and patch cables.\nStructured cabling is the design and installation of a cabling system that will support multiple hardware uses and be suitable for today's needs and those of the future. With a correctly installed system, current and future requirements can be met, and hardware that is added in the future will be supported.\nStructured cabling design and installation is governed by a set of standards that specify wiring data centers, offices, and apartment buildings for data or voice communications using various kinds of cable, most commonly category 5e (Cat 5e), category 6 (Cat 6), and fiber optic cabling and modular connectors. These standards define how to lay the cabling in various topologies in order to meet the needs of the customer, typically using a central patch panel (which is normally 19-inch rack-mounted), from where each modular connection can be used as needed. Each outlet is then patched into a network switch (normally also rack-mounted) for network use or into an IP or PBX (private branch exchange) telephone system patch panel.\nCabling standards require that all eight conductors in Cat 5e/6/6A cable be connected.\nIP phone systems can run the telephone and the computer on the same wires, eliminating the need for separate phone wiring.\nRegardless of copper cable type (Cat 5e/6/6A), the maximum distance is 90 m for the permanent link installation, plus an allowance for a combined 10 m of patch cords at the ends.\nCat 5e and Cat 6 can both effectively run power over Ethernet (PoE) applications up to 90 m. However, due to greater power dissipation in Cat 5e cable, performance and power efficiency are higher when Cat 6A cabling is used to power and connect to PoE devices",

You'll learn about each of these in a way that is completely vendor agnostic -- the concepts you learn here will apply to any vendor and any platform. You'll then learn how these four types of translations are used in Policy NAT and Twice NAT.\nThe second module will teach you how to Configure and Verify each type of address translation discussed in Module 1. If you configure or troubleshoot NAT on a Cisco Router, this is the module for you! We'll methodically take you through the the syntax for each type of NAT and show you various show commands that let you validate NAT's operation.\nThe lab topology will show and prove every NAT concept from Module 1, as we show you a packet capture before it arrives on the NAT router, and after it leaves the NAT router -- showing you exactly what is changed and in what situations.\nThis course is the last resource you will ever have to study to become a subject matter expert (SME) on NAT on a Cisco Router.",

Whether you are a beginner or want to sharpen your skills, this course offers practical, hands-on training in Ethical Hacking.\n\n\nWhat Are the 5 Phases of Ethical Hacking?\n\n\nEthical hacking is a structured process that follows five key stages to simulate real-world cyberattacks and assess security defenses. These phases include:\n\n\nPhase 1: Reconnaissance (Footprinting & Information Gathering)\nIn this initial phase, ethical hackers gather critical information about the target system, including IP addresses, domain details, and network topology. Tools like Google Dorking , WHOIS lookup help in passive and active information gathering.\n\n\nPhase 2: Scanning & Enumeration\nThis phase involves identifying open ports, live hosts, and system vulnerabilities using tools like Nmap and OpenVAS. Ethical hackers map out the target’s weaknesses to prepare for potential exploits.\n\n\nPhase 3: Gaining Access (Exploitation Techniques)\nHackers use various attack methods such as SQL injection, brute force attacks, phishing, and password cracking to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access. Tools like Metasploit and John the Ripper play a key role in this stage.\n\n\nPhase 4: Maintaining Access\nOnce access is gained, the hacker ensures persistent access by installing backdoors, Trojans, and rootkits. This step helps attackers maintain long-term control over the compromised system. Ethical hackers use penetration testing tools like Meterpreter to simulate such attacks.\n\n\nPhase 5: Covering Tracks & Reporting\nTo avoid detection, attackers erase evidence by clearing logs, modifying timestamps, and using anti-forensic techniques. Ethical hackers, however, document their findings in detailed reports to help organizations improve security measures.\n\n\nBoost Your Cybersecurity Career – Enroll Now & Start Learning Today!",

      "description": "Why this course?\nThere are other courses and information available on internet which teach concepts in isolation. They basically do small POCs (Proof Of Concepts) to showcase various things. But they do not give you a project scenario and show how different things tie up together.\nThis course is not a POC course. In this course we learn concepts by doing hands-on real time project, and code it ourselves. This will give a enhanced learning platform on top of the theoretical concepts which I have covered in great detail. I have taken a very easy to understand approach, and I will take you through a flow which will make learning each and every concept very interesting.\nI have taken a real world example and I keep on build on top of it in a continuous manner so that you do not loose the connectivity.\nYou will learn about Spring Boot and Spring Security framework in lot of detail. We will dive deep into Spring Security Filters.\nWhat you will learn?\nIn this course you will learn the following:\nBasic concepts about REST API Security\nLearn about TLS/SSL and know it works\nHow we can secure out API using HTTPS\nLearn in detail about Basic Authentication\nSecure our API using Basic Authentication with user detail in memory, file and database\nLearn in detail about Authorization\nPerform Authorization based on Roles and Authorities\nGet a very good understanding of JWT\nSecure our APIs using JWT. Perform Authentication and Authorization using JWT.\nSee how we can use JWT to secure our Micro Services\nLearn about OAuth 2.0\nSee live example of OAuth 2.0, which we use in our daily lives\nGet intorduced to Okta and use its various features\nUse Okta to secure of APIs using OAuth 2.0\nLearn about OIDC (Open ID Connect)\nExamine the differences between OIDC and OAuth 2.0\nImplement MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) for our APIs using Okta\nUnderstand what is HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code)\nHow to implement HMAC and secure our APIs using HMAC\nLearn Spring Security in depth, exploring up to the filter level\n\n\nWe are going to cover lot of details in this course. So we have lot of theory to learn and lot hands-on exercises to do. I have done live coding in the course you can learn even if you do not have any programming experience with Spring Boot. I have covered Spring Security in lot of detail going to the filter level. I also show you how to debug the problems so that you get a complete experience.\n\n\nSo lets get going!!",

But even if you are a penetration tester, security consultant, a linux administrator or a developer, you should also have to know how to fix your security. How to protect actively (so in real time) and reactively your linux servers. And this is not an easy task, believe me, I hack websites and servers for living. And at the end of the audit, I have to give a report about how I did it and how to protect against attacks like mine.\n\n\nSo wouldn't be easy if you would really on an actively working Web Application Firewall, Firewall and Intrusion Prevention System. To have an all in one product easily manageable, that would know the attacks and prevent them from being successful?\n\n\nThis course is all about this. It is about protecting your server. You will witness different attacks and you will see a product like this in action. This product is called BitNinja and it is an All in one security for Linux Servers. So you can see the attacks but also you will see how to protect against them.\n\n\nIt's very important to know that BitNinja is a commercial, subscription-based product. Hovewer, for this training, you will have an extended free trial so you can test it in your lab environment or even in production.\n\n\nThis is a hands-on training based on demos. So a basic knowledge of Linux would be very useful.\n\n\nHow BitNinja Works\nEasy setup - Enjoy immediate protection on your server. BitNinja is designed to install and work with as little human interaction as possible. Run one line of code and your server is protected from 99% of attacks.\nAll-in-one protection - BitNinja combines the most powerful server security software in one easy-to-use protection suite. You get full-stack protection against XSS, DDoS, malware, scans, script injection, enumeration, brute force and other automated attacks — on all major protocols, not only HTTP(S).\nMachine learning - Servers protected by BitNinja learn from each attack and inform each other about malicious IPs. This result is a global defense network that counteracts botnet attacks with a shield of protection for all servers running BitNinja, while also reducing the number of false positives each server encounters.",

No longer are attackers continuing to throw sophisticated attacks that can cripple a business (ex. Ransomware) at the largest companies. Small and medium-sized businesses are no longer safe, and in many cases after a cyber-attack, companies are rarely prepared for future incidents.\nIn this course, we’ll cover threat and vulnerability management. We introduce you to the core components of comprehensive vulnerability assessment, and provide the hands-on instruction necessary to produce a vigorous defensive strategy from day one.\nThe course is focused on equipping information security personnel from midsize to large organizations charged with effectively and efficiently securing a few hundred or more systems. By the end of the course, you’ll build a solid base around the entire vulnerability management process including the understanding of vulnerabilities, identifying and ranking the security issues, and recommending solutions to remediate the security issues. This process will also help to prevent security breaches.\nAbout The Author\nA computer and cybersecurity expert, Sunil Gupta consults in information technology with a focus on cybersecurity. He is an invited speaker for and a member of many key organizations. Sunil is a technology visionary and cyber security professional who thrives on solving complex problems.

However, configuring this routing protocol is a challenge because it is very complex and there are a lot of topics inside BGP to know them.\nFor this reason, I have designed this course which is the 2nd course for BGP on MikroTik, but this one goes to the advanced level after I have explained the entry to intermediate level in my other course which is \"BGP on MikroTik with LABS - From Entry to Intermediate level\"\nSo this course will go into advanced level in BGP and will contain a lot of LABS.\nTopics that this course will cover are:\nSinglehomed BGP for stub networks\nMultihomed BGP for stub networks\nMultihomed BGP for non-stub networks (including Load balancing and Failover)\nBGP Remove AP private\nBGP Communities\nBGP route reflector\nBGP aggregate\nBGP Confederation\nand much more...\nIf you want to master the topics of BGP in MikroTik on the advanced level, this I advise you to enroll in my course and I am sure that by end of the course you will have a good understanding of how to configure Advanced BGP on MikroTik RouterOS.",

If yes, then go for this Learning Path.\nPackt’s Video Learning Paths are a series of individual video products put together in a logical and stepwise manner such that each video builds on the skills learned in the video before it.\nDevOps is the most widely used software engineering culture and practice that aims at software development and operation. Ansible is one of the most popular tools in the open source orchestration and automation space. Docker is a tool that is designed to benefit both developers and system administrators. Ansible is the way to automate Docker in your environment. Ansible enables you to operationalize your Docker container build and deployment process in ways that you’re likely doing manually today, or not doing at all.\nThe highlights of this Learning Path are:\nGet acquainted with using Ansible 2 features such playbooks, modules and various testing strategies\nLearn to build and manage clusters using Swarm, Mesos, and Kubernetes\nCustomize and secure your Docker according to your business requirements\nLet’s take a look at your journey. You will begin with Ansible 2.0, including its installation, the problems it solves, and more. You will also walk through creating your very first playbook. You will understand the power of variables and quickly be able to manage environments and implement strategies. You will find out how to integrate with different cloud platforms and be introduced to Ansible Galaxy and Tower, which are Ansible's enterprise tooling for supporting large-scale infrastructure.\nNext, you will learn what Docker is and explore Compose by writing a docker-compose. yml file for a social network app, and look at top-down approaches to building network topologies for your social network’s containers. You will then be familiarized with the Swarm workflow, Kubernetes, and Google’s tool for setting up a managed cluster. Finally, you will learn how to set up Docker’s plugin infrastructure and use the customization options.\nBy the end of this Learning Path, you will have strong knowledge on the powerful techniques of Ansible and Docker.\nMeet your authors:\nDavid Cohen has been a system administrator, platform engineer, DevOps engineer, and software developer in everything from small businesses to growing companies (100+ employees) and large tech/engineering firms (10,000+ employees). Most of his work has centered around Linux and Unix system administration, web security, and software development in Python, Ruby, Javascript, and Go. He has also done stranger things such as helping to design two Tier-4 datacenters and being an Infantryman (not at the same time). On his tutorialinux YouTube channel, he has helped tens of thousands of people learn the basics (and not-so-basics) of system administration, DevOps, and software engineering\nShrikrishna Holla is a full-stack developer and entrepreneur based in Bengaluru.

      "description": "New Spring\\Summer 2021 Launch!\nThis is a 100% hands on course as you will be using the same tradecraft and techniques Red Teamer's and advanced adversaries use to escalate privileges on Linux servers after they have gained initial access and established a foothold. This course is not \"death by PowerPoint\", in fact there is not a single Powerpoint slide in the course. This course is aimed for intermediate to advanced users who are hungry to know how to discover and exploit novel escalation paths on popular Linux servers (including some that are patched). Everything is carefully, explained - step-by-step and mapped to MITRE ATT&CK\nAdditionally, although Metasploit is used in some attacks, we will be using less Metasploit and more manual walk-throughs because I wanted to take the time to carefully explain WHY each method works and detail how common misconfigurations happen in enterprise environments.\nWhere Metasploit is used, everything is carefully explained and deconstructed so you can understand why and how it works. Exploits start easy and escalate in difficulty as you progress through the course.\nThe Techniques\nYou will quickly learn and execute the following escalation of privilege techniques across 5 vulnerable machines.  New videos are being released weekly.\nMalicious Python Package\nCVE\nModify Launch Daemon (NEW! Just added 02/12/2021 6 New Lectures!)\nThe Tools\nYou will use ffuf, gobuster, dirsearch, nmap, Bash Scripting, Python Scripting,  netcat, pwncat, Burp Suite (advanced features) and more. You will learn how to threat hunt for SQLi attacks and how to exploit Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) attacks and much much more.\nMy dream for you\nBy the end of this course you should be able to use these techniques in:\nYour day to day work\nOSCP preparation\nCTF hacking\nAbout the lab\nThere are 5 vulnerable machines.\nNo lab setup is required as the entire environment is already established in HackTheBox VIP labs\nI wanted to make this course as realistic as possible while removing as many barriers to entry as possible so I've partnered with HackTheBox VIP labs to make it as easy as possible to get started.\nYes, HackTheBox is an additional charge but it offers hundreds of pre-configured vulnerable machines in a lab which is accessible via a VPN connection. This means you can get started right away and don't have to waste time fumbling with VirtualBox and VMWare settings on your local system. Most of the systems are also licensed which provides the best environment for realistic exploitation.\nTip:\nI made these videos so all commands are zoomed in close so you can watch on a mobile phone if desired. I hate watching videos on my smartphone and squinting at the command prompt or terminal. Never again will that happen.",

      "description": "This course will cover all of the fundamental aspects of the Metasploit framework, tying a subset of the phases of the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) methodology to the course structure.\n\nThese will be specifically information gathering, vulnerability assessment, exploitation and post-exploitation.\nThe course also goes beyond the basics by dealing  with social engineering, privilege escalation, antivirus evasion, persistent backdoors, trojanizing executable files, remote desktop, web penetration testing, port forwarded reverse shells, the Beef-XSS Framework, event log management.\n\nTo follow this course you will need to be confident using generic software programs, know the basics of the Linux command line and a little of system administration.\nIf something isn't clear or doesn't work on your system you can always hit me up and we'll solve the problem.\nConcerning hardware requirements: a host machine with at least 8 GB of RAM with a moderately fast processor, 70 GB of hard-drive space for the vulnerable virtual machine and other 30GB for the Kali VM is a good setup to have, but not mandatory: you can also alternatively install the vulnerable machine on another PC in your home network and work with Kali on your main machine.\nThe course is laid out in 7 main sections:\nSection 1: setup of our environment and introduction to the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES), which is a state of art methodology to carry out a penetration test. Other Metasploit variants like the Metasploit framework on Windows, the Metasploit community edition and Armitage will be covered.\nSection 2: fundamental commands of Metasploit and how it works, how to automate repetitive tasks, how to run exploits and Metasploit modules.\nSection 3: information gathering on the target machine with nmap and the other tools available in Metasploit to check which services are installed and effectively map the the attack surface.\nSection 4: vulnerability assessment. We'll check which of the services fingerprinted are likely to be vulnerable. We'll learn how to install the Nessus vulnerability scanner and integrate it with Metasploit to populate its workspace.\nSection 5: finally exploit of seven Metasploitable3 services using Metasploit exclusively, web penetration testing will also be covered.\nSection 6:  exploiting services via Social Engineering. We'll mainly create vectors for Social Engineering engagements, unsuspecting  payloads for the victim to execute on their machine to obtain remote command execution. We'll create trojanized files, we'll greatly lower the antivirus detection rate and we'll use the Beef-XSS Framework together with Metasploit to deliver more complex attacks.\nSection 7: monitoring the user on his machine, logging his keyboard activity, performing privilege escalation, generating persistent backdoors and log management.\nSection 8: the course outro and credits.",

The Instructor go though step by step and he explained some other options in case there are errors in the given command.\n--Montaner M. U.\n+ more 5-star reviews.\n\nBuild practical skills in CentOS Linux installation and web server setup with this tutorial for beginners.\nAlthough we make all the tutorials and demonstrations on CentOS operating system, note that CentOS explicitly aims for complete binary compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). The only real difference is that CentOS has the branding-related packages from RHEL replaced with recompiled versions from the sources provided by Red Hat.\nSo learning CentOS is 99% the same as learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).\nIn this course you will learn about:\nPhysical dedicated server set up\nDigitalOcean and Amazon Web Services virtual private server set up\nCentOS 7 Linux operating system installation\nApache / Nginx web server, MariaDB database and PHP installation\nOracle VirtualBox installation to create your own VDS host server\nConfigure FTP sever, firewall (with firewalld) and backups with Rsync\nAnd much more tweaks in the upcoming monthly updates, including but no limited to tuning the web server for low RAM systems, applying security tweaks to your server to make it less vulnerable to external attacks etc.\nPowerful Tools at Your Fingertips\nLearning Linux server setup essentials puts a very powerful and useful tools at your disposal. After finishing this course, you will be able to organize your personal web hosting and any other web-based service out there, from e-mail to file sharing service.\nSave money, take total control over your data and have fun!\nContent and Overview\nSuitable for beginning system administrators with zero experience in Linux administration. Through this course, you'll learn all of the fundamentals of web server administration, and gain experience in setting up Linux server OS and LAMP stack. Each chapter is packed with step-by-step guides and the exact Linux commands which will put your new learned skills into practical use immediately.\nYou will start with choosing the right platform for your server. Then you will install CentOS Linux to the server and set up the LAMP stack. After that, you will configure multiple Apache virtual hosts or Nginx server blocks, create your first MariaDB user and database, and finally, you will install WordPress to your new server. We will also go through basic security tweaks for your server.\nStudents completing the course will have the knowledge and skills to set up and administrate their personal server.\nNote, that this course shares some basic theoretical content from my other course \"Debian Linux Server Setup Essentials for Webhosting and More\", but all the practical lessons were designed for CentOS Linux.\nWorking through all the lections and command-line commands, you'll be able to instantly put the knowledge into practice, and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.\n100% Satisfaction Guarantee. No Questions Asked!\nI hope you will be absolutely satisfied once you got through my course. I do my best to make sure this course meets your need and expectations.

What If I told you that in 2016, based on surveys done regarding cyber security, 8 out of 10 CIOs feel that cyber threats are rapidly becoming their number 1 priority. I myself have seen the number of attacks quickly rising, to the point that it's now almost a normal occurrence, unfortunately.\nAnother key point I want you to know is that in the period between April 2015 and March 2016, there was a 550% increase in the number of ransomware attacks. This is worrisome, of course, as the main thing attackers using these methods want is one and only, money. Businesses all around the globe are finding out the hard way that if you are not paying attention to how you secure your IT infrastructure, you stand to lose not only huge amounts of money, but also your reputation.\nWith this in mind, it's quickly becoming apparent that new and innovative cyber security methods need to be taken, if we are to ensure that our network users are protected, sometimes even from themselves. This is where the product that we are discussing in this course, named FortiSandbox, comes in to help you do just that.\nIn this course you will learn just what FortiSandbox is, what is does and how it does it and how it can help you protect your network from disaster. As it is very flexible, you can deploy it in a number of ways, helping to prevent incidents and it can give you information just when you need it to help you contain and mitigate threats.\nI highly suggest that you request a trial of FortiSandbox from Fortinet so that you can follow along and practice at the same time.\n\nBy the end of the course you will have a solid understanding of the FortiSandbox concepts and when time calls it, you will have the skills to work with it in order to transform your network environment and you will have a solid step on which to further build your cyber security know-how.",

XML is a widely-used language for data exchange and storage, and it is often used in web applications to transmit and store data. However, XML is vulnerable to a type of attack known as XXE injection, which can lead to sensitive data exposure, denial of service attacks, and other security risks.\nIn this course, you will learn about the basics of XML, how XXE injection works, and the different types of XXE attacks. You will also learn how to detect and mitigate XXE vulnerabilities using best practices and industry-standard techniques. This course is designed for web developers, security professionals, IT managers, and anyone interested in learning about XXE vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\nThe OWASP Top 10 provides rankings of—and remediation guidance for—the top 10 most critical web application security risks. Leveraging the extensive knowledge and experience of the OWASP's open community contributors, the report is based on a consensus among security experts from around the world.\nYour instructor for this course is a seasoned security professional with years of experience identifying and mitigating XXE vulnerabilities. They'll provide you with step-by-step guidance and practical advice to help you become an expert in XXE.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is XML External Entity (XXE) Injection?\nXML External Entity (XXE) Injection is a type of attack that targets web applications that use XML to transmit and store data. XXE Injection occurs when an attacker can control the content of an XML document, and injects malicious code into the XML file. The malicious code can then be used to perform a range of attacks, including sensitive data exposure, denial of service attacks, and other security risks.\nThe attacker typically injects a malicious XML entity into an XML document, which is then processed by the web application. When the web application processes the malicious XML entity, it may disclose sensitive information or execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Learn XML External Entity (XXE) Injection?\nLearning about XXE vulnerabilities is essential for anyone involved in web application development, security, or IT management. XXE vulnerabilities are a serious threat to web applications and can lead to data breaches, denial of service attacks, and other security risks. By understanding XXE vulnerabilities, you can help protect your web applications from these types of attacks.\nIn addition, knowledge of XXE vulnerabilities is becoming increasingly important for security professionals and IT managers, as more and more web applications are using XML to transmit and store data. Understanding how XXE injection works and how to detect and mitigate these vulnerabilities can help you secure your web applications and protect your organization from potential security risks.\n\n\n\n\nIs XML External Entity (XXE) Injection for Me?\nThis course is designed for web developers, security professionals, IT managers, and anyone interested in learning about XXE vulnerabilities. If you're involved in web application development, security, or IT management, then this course is for you.\nWeb developers will learn how to identify and mitigate XXE vulnerabilities in their web applications. Security professionals and IT managers will learn about the risks associated with XXE vulnerabilities and how to implement best practices to protect against XXE attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of XML External Entity (XXE) Injection\nThere are several types of XML External Entity (XXE) Injection attacks. In this section, we'll discuss the different types of XXE attacks and how they work.\nClassic XXE: The attacker sends a malicious XML document to the server, which contains a reference to an external entity. The web application parses the XML document and retrieves the external entity, which may contain malicious code.\nParameter Entity Injection: This type of attack targets the parameter entities in an XML document. The attacker sends a malicious XML document to the server, which contains a reference to a parameter entity. The web application retrieves the parameter entity, which may contain malicious code.\nOut-of-Band (OOB) XXE: This type of attack sends data from the web application to a remote server controlled by the attacker. The attacker uses the data to create an XXE attack on the remote server,\nBlind XXE: This type of attack does not provide the attacker with any direct response from the server. Instead, the attacker sends a request to the server containing a malicious XML document. If the server is vulnerable to a Blind XXE attack, the attacker can determine the presence of the external entity by monitoring the time it takes for the server to respond.\nBillion Laughs: This type of attack uses a recursive XML document to consume a large amount of resources on the server, potentially leading to a denial of service attack.\n\n\n\n\nWho Needs to Learn XML External Entity (XXE) Injection?\nAnyone involved in web application development, security, or IT management should learn about XXE vulnerabilities. This includes:\nWeb Developers: If you're a web developer, learning about XXE vulnerabilities can help you identify and mitigate XXE attacks in your web applications. This can help you ensure the security of your web applications and protect your users' data.\nSecurity Professionals: If you're a security professional, understanding XXE vulnerabilities can help you assess the security of web applications and identify potential vulnerabilities. This knowledge can also help you develop effective strategies for protecting against XXE attacks.\nIT Managers: If you're an IT manager, learning about XXE vulnerabilities can help you understand the risks associated with XXE attacks and develop effective strategies for protecting your organization's web applications.\nAnyone Interested in Web Security: If you're interested in web security, learning about XXE vulnerabilities can help you develop a deeper understanding of the risks associated with web applications and how to protect against them.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you enroll in this course, you'll receive access to the following materials:\nVideo lectures: You'll have access to over 10 hours of video lectures covering all aspects of SSRF vulnerabilities.\nCourse notes: You'll receive a comprehensive set of course notes that cover all the material covered in the lectures.\nPractical exercises: You'll have the opportunity to practice identifying and exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities in a safe testing environment.\nQuizzes: You'll have access to quizzes to test your knowledge and reinforce what you've learned.\nCertificate of completion: Once you complete the course, you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can add to your resume or LinkedIn profile.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Goals:\nThe goals of this course are to:\nTeach you about the basics of XML and how it is used in web applications.\nExplain how XXE vulnerabilities work and the different types of XXE attacks.\nTeach you how to detect and mitigate XXE vulnerabilities using best practices and industry-standard techniques.\nProvide hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting XXE vulnerabilities in web applications.\nEquip you with the knowledge and skills to protect your web applications from XXE attacks.\n\n\n\n\nBy completing this course, you have gained valuable knowledge and skills in identifying and mitigating XXE vulnerabilities in web applications.

This approach will allow you to quickly reach the experience level of a junior penetration tester.\n\n\nConsider these questions:\nAre you interested in working in the security industry?\nDo you want to learn how to test the security of a Web Application?\nDo you like hands-on, practice-based learning?\n\n\nIf you answered yes to these questions, then this course is for you.\n\n\nIn this course, we will show how to test the security of Secure Bank, a home banking application designed as a training ground for penetration testers and web developers. During the test we will find 40+ security issues belonging to the following  categories:\n\n\n- Information Disclosure\n- Injection Vulnerabilities\n- Authentication\n- Authorization\n- Session Management\n- Business Logic Vulnerabilities\n- Data Validation Vulnerabilities\n- Cryptography\n- Insecure Configuration\n\n\nFor each security issue we will show how to find the vulnerable behavior, how to exploit it and finally how to explain it using written Proof of Concepts (PoCs) to the final client. At the end of the course you will see 40 different PoCs for 40 different vulnerabilities. This should give you a very good intuition on WAPT testing, something that will help you to get started in the industry or to simply refine your skills in case you need to.",

Since RouterOS v7, MikroTik has added Dot1x on the User Manager software to act as the Authentication server for the Dot1x supplicants, this has made me to decide making a course speaking in details about Dot1x and show how you can configure on MikroTik.\nIn this course, you need to have 3 MikroTik routers. I am going to use 2 Hap lite and 1 CRS3xx series switch. If you do not have a CRS3xx series, that's ok to replace it by another MikroTik router/switch.\nI will explain to you what is dot1x and how it works, then I am going to show you how you can do dot1x authentication using MAC authentication and user accounts, and in the last part of the course I will show you how you can assign VLANs for authenticated machines.\nFinally, if you want to understand everything about Dot1x and you want to know how to configure this protocol on MikroTik, all you need to do is to enroll in my course and by end of the course you will have a full understanding on this protocol and able to configure it easily on MikroTik products",

      "description": "Master course in Zero Trust Architecture 2.0\nWhat is Zero Trust Architecture?\nZero trust is when security policy is applied based on context established through least-privileged access controls and strict authentication, not assumed trust. Zero trust architectures simplify network infrastructure, make users happier, and keep cyberthreats at a distance.\nSince John Kindervag, then at Forrester Research, coined the phrase, zero trust architectures follow the maxim \"never trust, always verify.\" To block inappropriate access and lateral movement throughout an environment, zero trust architecture enforces access policies based on context—including the user's role and location, the device they're using, and the data they're asking for.\nA zero trust architecture means you know who's using what, and you can track it, including encrypted traffic; you need to monitor and verify the traffic between parts of the environment; and you need multifactor authentication (MFA) that goes beyond passwords.\nAn important thing to remember is that in a zero trust architecture, a resource's location isn't as important as before. Rather than rigid network segmentation, software-defined microsegmentation protects your data, workflows, services, and such anywhere, in your data center or distributed hybrid or multicloud.\nBy using a network-centric data security strategy that provides specific access only to those who need it, Zero Trust Architecture focuses on the business needs and functionality of an organization. By enabling parameters to dictate access and restrictions, the Zero Trust model views data security from a whole new perspective. As opposed to legacy networks that have little to no visibility or control over network and data usage, Zero Trust Architectures see all network traffic through segmentation gateways with granular policies governing access to data, apps, and assets. There are certain rules that have to be followed before a resource can be accessed in a Zero Trust network.\nThe five major topics I want to cover in this master's course are\n1. Zero trust architecture 2.0: introduction and importance\n2. A zero trust architecture's objective, concept, maintenance, and pillars\n3. Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM zero trust architecture practices\n4. Zero trust architecture design principles and framework\n5. Building a zero trust architecture and strategy",

and what is it used for ?\nEthical hacking involves a hacker agreeing with an organization or individual who authorizes the hacker to levy cyber attacks on a system or network to expose potential vulnerabilities An ethical hacker is also sometimes referred to as a white hat hacker Many depend on ethical hackers to identify weaknesses in their networks, endpoints, devices, or applications The hacker informs their client as to when they will be attacking the system, as well as the scope of the attack An ethical hacker operates within the confines of their agreement with their client They cannot work to discover vulnerabilities and then demand payment to fix them This is what gray hat hackers do Ethical hackers are also different from black hat hackers, who hack to harm others or benefit themselves without permission\nIs Ethical Hacking a good career?\nYes, ethical hacking is a good career because it is one of the best ways to test a network An ethical hacker tries to locate vulnerabilities in the network by testing different hacking techniques on them In many situations, a network seems impenetrable only because it hasn’t succumbed to an attack in years However, this could be because black hat hackers are using the wrong kinds of methods An ethical hacker can show a company how they may be vulnerable by levying a new type of attack that no one has ever tried before When they successfully penetrate the system, the organization can then set up defenses to protect against this kind of penetration This unique security opportunity makes the skills of an ethical hacker desirable for organizations that want to ensure their systems are well-defended against cybercriminals\nWhat skills do Ethical Hackers need to know?\nIn addition to proficiency in basic computer skills and use of the command line, ethical hackers must also develop technical skills related to programming, database management systems (DBMS), use of the Linux operating system (OS), cryptography, creation and management of web applications and computer networks like DHCP, NAT, and Subnetting Becoming an ethical hacker involves learning at least one programming language and having a working knowledge of other common languages like Python, SQL, C++, and C Ethical hackers must have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically to come up with and test new solutions for securing systems Ethical hackers should also understand how to use reverse engineering to uncover specifications and check a system for vulnerabilities by analyzing its code\nWhy do hackers use Linux?\nMany hackers use the Linux operating system (OS) because Linux is a free and open-source OS, meaning that anyone can modify it It’s easy to access and customize all parts of Linux, which allows a hacker more control over manipulating the OS Linux also features a well-integrated command-line interface, giving users a more precise level of control than many other systems offer While Linux is considered more secure than many other systems, some hackers can modify existing Linux security distributions to use them as hacking software Most ethical hackers prefer Linux because it's considered more secure than other operating systems and does not generally require the use of third-party antivirus software Ethical hackers must be well-versed in Linux to identify loopholes and combat malicious hackers, as it’s one of the most popular systems for web servers\nIs Ethical Hacking Legal?\nYes, ethical hacking is legal because the hacker has full, expressed permission to test the vulnerabilities of a system An ethical hacker operates within constraints stipulated by the person or organization for which they work, and this agreement makes for a legal arrangement An ethical hacker is like someone who handles quality control for a car manufacturer They may have to try to break certain components of the vehicle such as the windshield, suspension system, transmission, or engine to see where they are weak or how they can improve them With ethical hacking, the hacker is trying to “break” the system to ascertain how it can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks However, if an ethical hacker attacks an area of a network or computer without getting expressed permission from the owner, they could be considered a gray hat hacker, violating ethical hacking principles\nWhat is the Certified Ethical Hacker ( CEH ) Certification Exam?\nThe Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification exam supports and tests the knowledge of auditors, security officers, site administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who wants to ensure a network is safe against cybercriminals With the CEH credential, you can design and govern the minimum standards necessary for credentialing information that security professionals need to engage in ethical hacking You can also make it known to the public if someone who has earned their CEH credentials has met or exceeded the minimum standards You are also empowered to reinforce the usefulness and self-regulated nature of ethical hacking The CEH exam doesn’t cater to specific security hardware or software vendors, such as Fortinet, Avira, Kaspersky, Cisco, or others, making it a vendor-neutral program\nWhat is the Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM ) exam?\nPassing the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) exam indicates that the credentialed individual is an expert in the governance of information security, developing security programs and managing them, as well as managing incidents and risk For someone to be considered “certified,” they must have passed the exam within the last five years, as well as work full-time in a related career, such as information security and IT administration The exam tests individuals’ knowledge regarding the risks facing different systems, how to develop programs to assess and mitigate these risks, and how to ensure an organization's information systems conform to internal and regulatory policies The exam also assesses how a person can use tools to help an organization recover from a successful attack\nWhat are the different types of hackers?\nThe different types of hackers include white hat hackers who are ethical hackers and are authorized to hack systems, black hat hackers who are cybercriminals, and grey hat hackers, who fall in-between and may not damage your system but hack for personal gain There are also red hat hackers who attack black hat hackers directly Some call new hackers green hat hackers These people aspire to be full-blown, respected hackers State-sponsored hackers work for countries and hacktivists and use hacking to support or promote a philosophy Sometimes a hacker can act as a whistleblower, hacking their own organization in order to expose hidden practices There are also script kiddies and blue hat hackers A script kiddie tries to impress their friends by launching scripts and download tools to take down websites and networks When a script kiddie gets angry at\nIt’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate New tools are released every day, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest

But have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you fire up your favorite browser to browse your daily news or a shopping site? How does content instantly reach your device?\nNetworking, web servers, routing, switching and content delivery systems are the backbone of the Internet infrastructure. The internet is a network of interconnected servers that are designed to reduce latency, improve site rendering speed and performance.\nUnderlying all this complex infrastructure is something called Domain Name Services or DNS in short. What is a DNS, you may ask? If the sites, the CDNs and other content sources are the phone lines of the Internet, then Domain Name Systems (DNSs) are the phone book of the Internet network. Every time you use the Internet, you are using DNS.\nAmazon Web Services are one of the largest public cloud providers and they power a vast majority of the internet.\nDo you know how you can manage your public-private hosted domains inside the AWS cloud? Do you know how you can use and manipulate the traffic targeted towards your websites hosted within the AWS cloud? How do you protect against DNS failures or attacks by malicious users?

That traffic causes management complexity, application-performance unpredictability, and data vulnerability.\n\n\nCisco SD-WAN addresses the current IT challenges. It is designed to meet the needs of modern enterprise applications and the rapidly growing security requirements.\n\n\nCisco SDWAN is a solution that allows user to quickly and seamlessly establish an overlay fabric to connect an enterprise’s data centers, branch and campus locations, as well as colocation facilities in order to improve the network’s speed, security, and efficiency.\nThere are multiple, controller deployment options available for customers. Controllers can be deployed On-premises in the company's data centers on a private cloud built with ESXi or KVM hypervisors or in a public cloud such as AWS or Microdoft Azure.\nThis course is intended to provide design and deployment guidance to onboard Cisco SD-WAN controllers and covers the process of installing the SD-WAN controller software images on a VMWare ESXI instance and establishing the transport and management networks for the three controllers to communicate.\nwe will also ensure that each controller has a valid certificate installed.",

      "description": "#Computer Forensics is the branch of forensics science which deals with the digital evidences that would be admissible in court. The field of digital forensics started early 90's when digital computer compromised. FBI CART program which was previously known as \"Magnet Media Program\" and the father of Computer Forensics Michael Anderson was the chief head of this program. Through blessings of Computer forensics the cases of Michael Jackson, German wings Flight 9525 etc. solved. IN this course you will learn about general forensics procedures, evidence handling and you will know how to use various tools which will help you to become an expert with more practice. The main objective of this course is that I just brief all lectures clearly which is understandable for everyone. There’s no need for computer/forensics' background to enroll this course if you have interest then you may get this course. This course is also helpful for cyber lawyers or prosecutors because gathering and preserving electronic evidence require a special set of considerations. Without a thorough understanding of digital forensics, your next move could compromise evidence or cause your findings to be inadmissible in court.\nShortly this course provides a general introduction to the concepts, theories, principles, and practice of digital forensics. Topics include data acquisition to reporting with lab sessions. Therefore, it also covers the required basics of Unix/Linux commands.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes:\nStep to CHFI From EC-Council\nProcedural Professional in disaster management\nExploring in the field of threat intelligence\nData recovery using professional tools\nMitigation of admissibility\nWindows/Linux/mobile forensics\nPrepare yourself for GCFA\nPreparing reports#\n--------------------------------------",
